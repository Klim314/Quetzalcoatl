probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (ph, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees c), as well as sensory preference among them. decreases in ph (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. only the yogurt with s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and l. reuteri differed in firmness. no differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. no changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. counts of s. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. counts of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/ml for 3 wk. probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of l. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/ml for 35 d, of l. casei for 7d, and of l. reuteri for 14 d. we found no significant sensory preference among the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. however, the yogurt and fermented milk made with l. casei were better accepted. this study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.
effect of versagel on the growth and metabolic activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
in this study, the influence of a protein-based fat replacer, versagel added at 1% and 2% (w/v) to reconstituted skim milk (rsm), on the growth and metabolic activities of selected strains of yogurt starters (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) as well as probiotic organisms (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium longum) was examined. addition of versagel resulted in significantly improved growth of s. thermophilus and b. longum but inhibited that of l. casei, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. this is also reflected in the extent of reduction of ph in rsm with added versagel by these organisms. among the biochemical activities, proteolytic activity of all the organisms except b. longum was adversely affected by the presence of versagel, although the angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace) inhibitory and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory activities were improved. versagel at 1% level influenced the growth, while ace inhibitory and alpha-glu inhibitory activities of the organisms were better at 2% level.
viability of probiotic (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in argentinian fresco cheese.
we evaluated the suitability of argentinian fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. we used cultures of bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), bifidobacterium longum (two strains), bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms, yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.
antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
the antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab, including lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei and streptococcus thermophilus) on staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was evaluated on mrs agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. all lab were repressive to s aureus and e coli on the agar medium. however, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to ph 7.2. in normal milk, l acidophilus strains a and b, s thermophilus and its combinations with l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to s aureus, while in mastitic milk, only s thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. l acidophilus a and l bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to e coli growth in normal milk. s thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to e coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. these results indicate that the antagonistic activity of lab on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
fermentation of aqueous plant seed extracts by lactic acid bacteria.
the effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (vigna unguiculata), peanut (arachis hypogea), soybean (glycine max), and sorghum (sorghum vulgare) were studied. the bacteria investigated were lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. during fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, ph, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees c. maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, ph, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. the maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in ph. change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. in the extracts inoculated simultaneously with l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, a synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased ph in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. fermented extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.
