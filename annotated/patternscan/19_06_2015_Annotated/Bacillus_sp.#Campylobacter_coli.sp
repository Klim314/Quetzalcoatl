TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == culture-independent techniques applied to food industry water surveillance--a case study.
AB  == culture-independent techniques were used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water at potentially critical control points along the production lines at a german dairy company and a spanish dry cured ham company. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was used to describe bacterial population shifts indicating biological instability in the drinking water samples. autochthonous bacteria were identified by sequencing the excised dgge dna bands.  more specifically, real-time pcr was applied to detect a number of pathogenic bacteria, i.e. listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus spp., salmonella spp, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. due to the detection limits of the  real-time pcr method, a specific protocol was established in order to meet the technical detection requirements and to avoid unwanted polymerase inhibitions. autochthonous bacterial populations were found to be highly stable at most of the sampling points. only one sampling point exhibited population shifts at the german dairy company. enterococci and p.aeruginosa were detected in some water samples from these companies by molecular biology detection methods, but not by conventional culturing methods. some opportunistic bacteria as enterobacter sp.,  acinetobacter, sphingomonas sp. and non-pathogenic bacillus, were also detected after dna sequencing of dgge bands.

TI  == analysis of nsukka metropolitan abattoir solid waste and its bacterial contents in south eastern nigeria: public health implication.
AB  == this study was conducted to determine the quantum of waste generation and management and presence of major bacteria genera of public health importance in nsukka municipal abattoir/slaughter house. the environment and public health implications of unhygienic sanitary condition at the abattoir and environs as a consequence of poor waste disposal and management were studied. a total of 194 kg of solid (rumen/stomach) wastes was generated daily without any clearly defined system of disposal and management. forty-five rumen/stomach waste samples were examined for bacterial isolates using standard procedures. the isolation frequency showed that e. coli, bacillus sp., and staphylococcus sp. were more frequently isolated, followed by streptococcus sp., salmonella sp., and campylobacter sp. appropriate strategies for efficient solid waste disposal and management in our abattoirs were recommended.

TI  == detection and identification of intestinal pathogenic bacteria by hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays.
AB  == aim: to detect the common intestinal pathogenic bacteria quickly and accurately.  methods: a rapid (<3 h) experimental procedure was set up based upon the gene chip technology. target genes were amplified and hybridized by oligonucleotide microarrays. results: one hundred and seventy strains of bacteria in pure culture belonging to 11 genera were successfully discriminated under comparatively same conditions, and a series of specific hybridization maps corresponding to each kind of bacteria were obtained. when this method was applied to 26 divided cultures, 25 (96.2%) were identified. conclusion: salmonella sp., escherichia coli, shigella sp., listeria monocytogenes, vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, proteus sp., bacillus cereus, vibrio cholerae, enterococcus faecalis, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter jejuni can be detected and identified by our microarrays. the accuracy, range, and discrimination power of this assay can be continually improved by adding further  oligonucleotides to the arrays without any significant increase of complexity or  cost.

TI  == bacterial flavohaemoglobins: a consensus sequence and identification of a discrete enterobacterial group and of further bacterial globins.
AB  == the amino acid sequences of haemoglobin-like proteins from the bacteria alcaligenes eutrophus, bacillus subtilis, erwinia chrysanthemi, escherichia coli, vibrio parahaemolyticus, vitreoscilla sp. and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae  were studied. phylogenies based on distance and parsimony analysis showed that the eubacterial group can be easily distinguished from the other haemoglobin-like proteins. the construction of a consensus bacterial flavohaemoglobin based on the alignment of six bacterial and one yeast globins allowed the design of consensus  primers to search for haemoglobin-like genes in other bacteria. pcr products of the expected size were found in campylobacter jejuni, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, rhizobium leguminosarum, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  == the epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. from 1 january 1992 to 31 december 1994, the phls communicable disease surveillance centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in england and wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and s. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, clostridium perfringens in four, bacillus cereus in two, and campylobacter sp and escherichia coli in one each. no pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. the commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight  outbreaks. raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. inappropriate  storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.
