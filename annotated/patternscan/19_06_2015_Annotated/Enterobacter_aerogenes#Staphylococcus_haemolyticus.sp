TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == [prostate histopathology of nih category iv prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  == asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category iv in nih classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). no report concerning this category has been present. we investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (psa) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between january, 1996 and december,  2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as nih category iv prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). we observed all pathological specimens stained with hematoxylin-eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by true et al. (1999). we also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as psa values, psa density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. in the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88)  in stromal. no relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. however, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate  cancers, later. pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). isolated bacteria were 4 strains of enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. gram positive rod, and candida sp. no relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. these results indicated that the incidence of niii category iv prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. however, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
