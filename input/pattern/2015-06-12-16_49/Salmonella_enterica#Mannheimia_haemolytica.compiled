TI  - Reducing assembly complexity of microbial genomes with single-molecule sequencing.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The short reads output by first- and second-generation DNA sequencing instruments cannot completely reconstruct microbial chromosomes. Therefore, most genomes have been left unfinished due to the significant resources required to manually close gaps in draft assemblies. Third-generation, single-molecule sequencing addresses this problem by greatly increasing sequencing read length, which simplifies the assembly problem. RESULTS: To measure the benefit of single-molecule sequencing on microbial genome assembly, we sequenced and assembled the genomes of six bacteria and analyzed the repeat complexity of 2,267 complete bacteria and archaea. Our results indicate that the majority of known bacterial and archaeal genomes can be assembled without gaps, at finished-grade quality, using a single PacBio RS sequencing library. These single-library assemblies are also more accurate than typical short-read assemblies and hybrid assemblies of short and long reads. CONCLUSIONS: Automated assembly of long, single-molecule sequencing data reduces the cost of microbial finishing to $1,000 for most genomes, and future advances in this technology are expected to drive the cost lower. This is expected to increase the number of completed genomes, improve the quality of microbial genome databases, and enable high-fidelity, population-scale studies of pan-genomes and chromosomal organization.
TI  - Bacteremia associated with naturally occuring acute coliform mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of bacteremia in dairy cows with naturally  occurring acute coliform mastitis (ACM) with a wide range of disease severity. DESIGN: Cohort study. ANIMALS: 144 dairy cows with ACM from 6 herds. PROCEDURE: Cows were examined at time of identification of ACM (time 0) and classified as having mild, moderate, or severe mastitis on the basis of rectal temperature, hydration status, rumen contraction rate, and attitude. Cows were reexamined at 24 or 48 hours. Bacteriologic culturing of milk and blood (30 ml), CBC, and serum biochemical analysis were performed at each time point. Appropriate samples were obtained at a single point from herdmates without mastitis (controls) that were closely matched for lactation number and days since parturition. Blood culture results were compared among severity groups and controls by use of chi2 tests, as was outcome of an ACM episode for cows grouped by blood bacterial isolates. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated from 52 blood samples from 46 of 144 (32%) cows with ACM, which was significantly more than control cows (11/156; 7.1%). Group-1 isolates (Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium) were identified in 20 of 144 (14%) cows with ACM and 0 of 156 control cows. Group-1 isolates were identified in 4.3, 9.1, and 42% of cows classified as having mild, moderate, and severe ACM, respectively. Escherichia coli and K pneumoniae milk and blood isolates obtained from the same cow were of the same genotype. Bacillus spp were identified in 21 of 144 (15%) cows with ACM, which was significantly more than control cows (3/156; 1.9%). Thirty-five percent of cows with a group-1 isolate died during the mastitis episode. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that bacteremia develops in a substantial proportion of cows with ACM. Classification of severity of disease is important for establishment of effective treatment protocols; parenteral antimicrobial treatment may be indicated in cows with ACM.
TI  - Induction of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in THP-1 cells by Salmonella typhimurium, Pasteurella haemolytica and Haemophilus influenzae porins.
AB  - The effect of porins purified from Salmonella typhimurium, Pasteurella haemolytica and Haemophilus influenzae on induction of tyrosine phosphorylation in THP-1 cells and C3H/HeJ macrophage was investigated. Incubation of porins at concentration of 1.0-5.0 microg ml(-1) with either THP-1 or macrophage from C3H/HeJ mice resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of specific host cell proteins. After porin stimulation a pattern of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins appeared in the soluble cytoplasmic fraction, in the membrane fraction and in the insoluble protein fraction. The observed effects were dependent on the porin concentrations; they reached a maximal expression at 3 min and declined at 60 min. Porin and lipopolysaccharide treatments induce a similar phosphorylation pattern in all of the three cellular fractions studied. A difference can be observed in the cytoplasmic fraction bands of 50-60 kDa, which are more evident after treatment with lipopolysaccharide, and in the insoluble fraction band of 80 kDa and the cytoplasmic fraction band of 250 kDa, which are more evident after treatment with porins. The events of tyrosine protein phosphorylation were present in macrophage from lipopolysaccaride-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice stimulated with porins, while they were markedly reduced when the cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Staurosporine, genistein and cytochalasin D induced in the three cellular fractions a different inhibition pattern of tyrosine protein phosphorylation in porin stimulated cells. Porins extracted from the three bacterial species investigated behave in a similar way as stimuli more or less potent; Hib porin seems to be the most powerful stimulator and, moreover, it specifically induces phosphorylation of a 55 kDa band.
TI  - Role of Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella haemolytica and Salmonella typhimurium porins on inducible nitric oxide release by murine macrophages.
AB  - The aim of this study was to verify whether Pasteurella haemolytica, P. multocida and Salmonella typhimurium porins could affect the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) release by murine resident peritoneal macrophages in vitro. We also compared their effect with that elicited by P. haemolytica, P. multocida and S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS) whose biological activity is well known. Variations in NO release and iNOS mRNA expression due to variable concentrations of porins were recorded and compared. We also investigated the synergism between bacterial products and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). With this aim cells were incubated with porins together with murine rIFN-gamma prior to assessing the presence of NO in the supernatant and mRNA analysis. Porins in themselves were not able to induce NO release by resident peritoneal macrophages. Incubation of macrophages with IFN-gamma in the presence of porins increased NO release, whereas incubation in the presence of the arginine analog N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMA) inhibited NO release. The greatest NO release was obtained using porins at a concentration of 5 microg/mL. Porins, together with IFN-gamma, were also able to upregulate the mRNA expression of iNOS. Our findings suggest that gram-negative porins are able to modulate inflammatory and immunological responses by affecting the release of NO and the expression of iNOS gene in activated macrophages.
TI  - CRITICA: coding region identification tool invoking comparative analysis.
AB  - Gene recognition is essential to understanding existing and future DNA sequence data. CRITICA (Coding Region Identification Tool Invoking Comparative Analysis) is a suite of programs for identifying likely protein-coding sequences in DNA by combining comparative analysis of DNA sequences with more common noncomparative methods. In the comparative component of the analysis, regions of DNA are aligned with related sequences from the DNA databases; if the translation of the aligned sequences has greater amino acid identity than expected for the observed percentage nucleotide identity, this is interpreted as evidence for coding. CRITICA also incorporates noncomparative information derived from the relative frequencies of hexanucleotides in coding frames versus other contexts (i.e., dicodon bias). The dicodon usage information is derived by iterative analysis of the data, such that CRITICA is not dependent on the existence or accuracy of coding sequence annotations in the databases. This independence makes the method particularly well suited for the analysis of novel genomes. CRITICA was tested by analyzing the available Salmonella typhimurium DNA sequences. Its predictions were compared with the DNA sequence annotations and with the predictions of GenMark. CRITICA proved to be more accurate than GenMark, and moreover, many of its predictions that would seem to be errors instead reflect problems in the sequence databases.
