TI  == brood ball-mediated transmission of microbiome members in the dung beetle, onthophagus taurus (coleoptera: scarabaeidae).
AB  == insects feeding on plant sap, blood, and other nutritionally incomplete diets are typically associated with mutualistic bacteria that supplement missing nutrients. herbivorous mammal dung contains more than 86% cellulose and lacks amino acids essential for insect development and reproduction. yet one of the most ecologically necessary and evolutionarily successful groups of beetles, the dung  beetles (scarabaeinae) feeds primarily, or exclusively, on dung. these associations suggest that dung beetles may benefit from mutualistic bacteria that provide nutrients missing from dung. the nesting behaviors of the female parent and the feeding behaviors of the larvae suggest that a microbiome could be vertically transmitted from the parental female to her offspring through the brood ball. using sterile rearing and a combination of molecular and culture-based techniques, we examine transmission of the microbiome in the bull-headed dung beetle, onthophagus taurus. beetles were reared on autoclaved dung and the microbiome was characterized across development. a ~1425 bp region of the 16s rrna identified pseudomonadaceae, enterobacteriaceae, and comamonadaceae as the most common bacterial families across all life stages and populations, including cultured isolates from the 3(rd) instar digestive system.  finer level phylotyping analyses based on lepa and gyrb amplicons of cultured isolates placed the isolates closest to enterobacter cloacae, providencia stuartii, pusillimonas sp., pedobacter heparinus, and lysinibacillus sphaericus.  scanning electron micrographs of brood balls constructed from sterile dung reveals secretions and microbes only in the chamber the female prepares for the egg. the use of autoclaved dung for rearing, the presence of microbes in the brood ball and offspring, and identical 16s rrna sequences in both parent and offspring suggests that the o. taurus female parent transmits specific microbiome members to her offspring through the brood chamber. the transmission of the dung  beetle microbiome highlights the maintenance and likely importance of this newly-characterized bacterial community.

TI  == resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in barbados.
AB  == resistance to third-generation, or extended-spectrum, cephalosporins caused by induction of class i beta-lactamases has been reported rarely from developing countries. seven isolates of cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative rods were recovered recently from urine, burns and ulcers in the queen elizabeth hospital,  barbados. the isolates were identified as acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), citrobacter freundii (1), enterobacter cloacae (1), morganella morganii (1), providencia stuartii (1) and proteus sp. (1). induction of beta-lactamase by cefoxitin was demonstrated, and minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by agar dilution. beta-lactamases were demonstrated by isoelectric focusing; the presence of chromosomal beta-lactamases was confirmed in at least three of the resistant isolates. the only antibiotics which were uniformly active against these resistant strains were imipenem and ciprofloxacin. these data confirm the existence of resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins in barbados, and emphasise the necessity for continuous surveillance of resistance patterns in the caribbean region.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == semisynthetic cephalosporins. synthesis and structure-activity relationships of 7-(1-pyrryl)- and 7-(1-indolyl)acetamidocephalosporin derivatives.
AB  == a series of 1-pyrrole- and 1-indoleacetamido derivatives of 3-heteroaryl-substituted cephalosporins was prepared. the most active compound in the series was 7-[[2-(1-pyrryl)acetyl]amino]-3-[[(1-methyltetrazol-5-yl)thio]-methyl]-8-oxo-5-th ia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid (6), which showed comparable potency in vitro and in vivo to that of cefazolin, and, in addition, was more potent than cefazolin against enterobacter sp. and providencia stuartii.
