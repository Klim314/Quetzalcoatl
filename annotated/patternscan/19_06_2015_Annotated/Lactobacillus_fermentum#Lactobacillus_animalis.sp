TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == human intestinal mucosa-associated lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains with probiotic properties modulate il-10, il-6 and il-12 gene expression in thp-1 cells.
AB  == lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are considered one of the permanent genera of the physiological human intestinal microbiota and represent an enormous pool of potential probiotic candidates. approximately 450 isolates of presumptive lactobacillus or bifidobacterium strains were obtained from bioptic samples of colonic and ileal mucosa from 15 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. on the basis of randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, 20 strains were selected  for further taxonomic classification and characterisation, as well as assessment  of probiotic properties and safety. importantly, selected strains showed the capability of colonising different parts of the intestine. the most frequently isolated species was lactobacillus paracasei followed by lactobacillus fermentum. the majority of isolates were susceptible to antimicrobials of human and veterinary importance, however, tetracycline and/or erythromycin resistance was observed in lactobacillus plantarum and l. fermentum strains. thirteen strains were able to ferment more than 19 different carbon sources and three out of five  tested strains exerted antagonistic activity against several different indicator  strains. two lactobacillus isolates (l. paracasei l350 and l. fermentum l930 bb)  and one bifidobacterium isolate (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. animalis im386)  fulfilled in vitro selection criteria for probiotic strains and exhibited strong  downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines il-6 and il-12 and upregulation of anti-inflammatory il-10. the selected strains represent suitable candidates for further studies regarding their positive influence on host health and could play  an important role in ameliorating the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  == synergistic antibacterial efficacies of the combination of bovine lactoferrin or  its hydrolysate with probiotic secretion in curbing the growth of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the occurrence of multidrug-resistant or meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) has become an important issue in clinics. this study evaluated a combinatorial treatment approach by using the well-documented antibacterial protein apo-bovine lactoferrin (apo-blf) or its hydrolysate and specific probiotic supernatants for controlling mrsa infection. clinical mrsa strains were isolated from different patient specimens. apo-blf-hydrolysate possessed stronger anti-mrsa activity than complete blf in that it inhibited the growth of most mrsa strains tested in vitro. otherwise, the supernatants produced by lactobacillus fermentum (atcc 11739), bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (atcc 15707) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bcrc 17394) inhibited the growth of various mrsa strains. further, l. fermentum or b. animalis subsp. lactis supernatant plus apo-blf or blf-hydrolysate led to partially synergistic to synergistic growth-inhibitory activity against mrsa strains. however, l. fermentum and not b. animalis subsp. lactis or b. longum subsp. longum was observed to resist the antibacterial activity of both apo-lf and blf-hydrolysate. therefore, it is suggested that l. fermentum could be the best candidate to be used with apo-blf or blf-hydrolysate as a live supplement against mrsa infections.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == intestinal bacteroides species associated with coeliac disease.
AB  == aims: to characterise the predominant species of bacterial populations associated with duodenal biopsies of paediatric patients with active and treated coeliac disease. methods: 20 biopsy specimens from patients with active coeliac disease,  12 from patients with treated coeliac disease, and eight from age-matched controls were evaluated for comparative purposes. bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria (lab) populations were analysed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis using group-specific primers. results: bacteroides diversity was higher in biopsy specimens from controls than in those from patients with active and treated coeliac disease. bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis/bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides ovatus were more abundant in controls than in patients with coeliac disease (p<0.05). bacteroides vulgatus was more frequently detected in controls than in patients with treated coeliac disease (p<0.01). bacteroides dorei was more common in patients with active coeliac disease than in those with treated coeliac disease and control children (p<0.01). bifidobacterium diversity was higher in patients with coeliac disease than in controls. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis were more prevalent in patients with active coeliac disease than in patients with treated coeliac disease and control children. a higher lab diversity was found in patients with treated coeliac disease and controls than in patients with active coeliac disease. weissella spp and lactobacillus fermentum were more frequently detected  in patients with treated coeliac disease than in controls and patients with active coeliac disease. conclusions: bacteroides, bifidobacterium and lab populations in the duodenum of spanish children with typical coeliac disease (active and treated) and controls differ in diversity and species composition; this could contribute to features of the disease.

TI  == identification and evaluation of the probiotic potential of lactobacilli isolated from canine milk.
AB  == canine milk protects puppies against infectious diseases through a variety of mechanisms. in this study, the presence of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria grown on mrs-cys agar plates from milk of nine bitches was investigated. the gram positive catalase negative bacilli identified in this study belonged to  four lactobacillus species (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus murinus, lactobacillus animalis), as well as one isolate that was identified as weissella viridescens. random amplified polymorphic dna profiling revealed 28 different genetic profiles among the lactobacilli isolates. their probiotic potential was evaluated through different assays, including survival in conditions that resemble those existing in the gastrointestinal tract, production of antimicrobial compounds, adherence to intestinal mucin, degradation of mucin and pattern of antibiotic sensitivity. some strains showed potential for future applications as canine probiotics.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for potential probiotic use  in iberian dry fermented sausages.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select lactic acid bacteria and bifibobacteria strains as potential probiotic cultures during the processing of iberian dry fermented sausages. a total of 1000 strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages (363), and human (337) and pig faeces (300) in different culture media. around 30% of these strains, mainly isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages in lamvab agar, were pre-selected for testing as potential probiotics by their ability to grow adequately at the ph values and nacl concentrations of these meat products during the ripening process. of the in vitro investigations used to predict the survival of a strain in conditions present in the gastro intestinal tract, exposure to ph 2.5 showed itself to be a  highly discriminating factor with only 51 out of 312 pre-selected strains resisting adequately after 1.5h of exposure. all acid-resistant isolates identified as lactobacilli originated from human faeces (lactobacillus casei and  lactobacillus fermentum) and pig faeces (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus animalis, lactobacillus murinus, and lactobacillus vaginalis). pediococcus acidilactici strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages and pig faeces, whereas the greatest number of enterococcus strains were identified as enterococcus faecium, with this species being isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages, and human and pig faeces. most of these strains are promising probiotic meat culture candidates suitable for iberian dry fermented sausages.

TI  == relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. methods and results: hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, b. animalis and enterococcus faecalis. we also determined the number of immunoglobulin (ig)a+, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha+, interleukin (il)-6+ and il-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to balb/c mice.  all strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. no correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. when some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation  to liver was observed. the oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1))  and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. the differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. conclusions: indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. however, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. significance and impact of the study: the immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. the ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of il-6 by il-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.

TI  == adhesion of probiotic lactobacilli to chick intestinal mucus.
AB  == in the present work, interactions between three lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus fermentum crl1015, lactobacillus animalis crl1014, and lactobacillus fermentum crl1016) and chicken small intestinal mucus were determined. three lactobacilli isolated from chicken and selected by their potentially probiotic properties were able to grow in mucus preparations. three peaks from gel filtration chromatography of intestinal mucus were obtained. the adhesion to three mucus fractions (i, ii, and iii), especially fraction iii, was  higher (p < 0.01) in l. fermentum crl1015 than l. animalis crl1014. pretreatment  of this fraction with proteases and metaperiodate showed lower (p < 0.01) adhesion values than that of the control, suggesting that a glycoprotein from the mucus acts as a receptor for l. fermentum crl1015. highest adhesion values were obtained at ph 7 and 42 degrees c, and neither the removal of divalent cations with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) nor the addition of calcium produced  significant variation from the adhesion values of the control (p > 0.01). this adhesion was only inhibited by n-acetyl-glucosamine. salmonella pullorum and salmonella gallinarum showed high (p < 0.01) values of adhesion to chick intestinal mucus. the results obtained from assays of the inhibition of adherence of salmonella spp. to mucus, immobilized in polystyrene tissue culture wells, indicated that the pathogen adhesion was not reduced by lactobacilli (p > 0.05) or their spent culture supernatants (p > 0.05), suggesting that these strains did not interfere with the binding sites for salmonella spp. adhesion to the small intestinal mucus.

TI  == examination of adhesive determinants in three species of lactobacillus isolated from chicken.
AB  == the microbial adhesion process includes passive forces; electrostatic interactions; hydrophobic, steric forces; lipoteichoic acids; and specific structures, such as external appendages (lectins) and (or) extracellular polymers. in a previous work, we showed that lactobacillus animalis, l. fermentum, and l. fermentum ssp. cellobiosus had lectinlike proteic structures on their surfaces and high hydrophobicity values on the cell surface of l. fermentum ssp. cellobiosus. here, we examined the presence of the bacterial forces or structures that could be involved in the interaction between bacteria and epithelial cells. lactobacillus animalis and l. fermentum possessed a net negative surface charge, whereas l. fermentum ssp. cellobiosus showed similar affinity to both cationic and anionic exchange resins, aggregated in the presence of ammonium sulfate, and had high affinity (75.4%) to a hydrophobic matrix. only  l. animalis was shown to have ribitol teichoic acids in the cell wall. the amount of polysaccharides from cell walls varied between different strains, with l. fermentum ssp. cellobiosus having the highest concentration. lectin extracts obtained from lactobacilli did not possess sugar residues, thereby demonstrating  the proteic nature of the superficial surface structures of three strains. the lactic acid bacteria studied here showed different surface determinants, which could be involved in the interactions between these lactobacilli and intestinal epithelial cells.

TI  == some probiotic properties of chicken lactobacilli.
AB  == the beneficial effect of lactobacilli has been attributed to their ability to colonize human and animal gastrointestinal tracts. in this work, adhesion assays  with three lactobacillus strains and intestinal fragments obtained from chickens  were assessed. lactobacillus animalis and l. fermentum were able to adhere to three kinds of epithelial cells (crop, small and large intestines) with predominance to small intestine. among the strains considered, l. fermentum subsp. cellobiosus showed the lowest and l. animalis the highest adhesion ability. scanning electron microphotographs showing l. animalis and l. fermentum  adhering to intestinal cells were obtained. the characterization of l. animalis adhesion indicated that lectin-like structure of this strain has glucose/mannose  as specific sugars of binding. however, a calcium requirement was not observed. the adhesion of l. fermentum was reduced by addition of sialic acid or mannose (p < 0.01). these carbohydrates can be involved in the interaction between adhesin and epithelial surface. in this case, the dependence on bivalent cations was demonstrated. lactobacillus fermentum was effective in reducing the attachment of salmonella pullorum by 77%, while l. animalis was able to inhibit (90%, 88%, and  78%) the adhesion of s. pullorum, s. enteritidis, and s. gallinarum to host-specific epithelial fragments respectively. our results from this in vitro model suggest that these lactobacilli are able to block the binding sites for salmonella adhesion.

TI  == lactobacilli isolated from chicken intestines: potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacillus strains were tested for their in vitro probiotic properties. cell surface hydrophobicity was found to be very high for lactobacillus fermentum subsp. cellobiosus and salmonella gallinarum; high values could indicate a greater ability to adhere to epithelial cells. studies on lactobacillus animalis  indicated relative cell surface hydrophobicities smaller than those of l. fermentum subsp. cellobiosus and l. fermentum. l. animalis and enterococcus faecalis were able to coaggregate with l. fermentum subsp. cellobiosus and l. fermentum, respectively, but not with salmonella gallinarum. after mixed-culture  studies for determining suitable growth behavior, the pair of strains l. animalis plus l. fermentum subsp. cellobiosus was selected for an attempted challenge against salmonella gallinarum. double and triple mixed-culture studies indicated  that selected lactobacillus strains were able to retain their beneficial characteristics in the presence of salmonella gallinarum such as presence of lectins, production of antimicrobial compounds, and ability to grow and compete.  the selected microorganisms can be considered as potential ingredients for a chicken probiotic feed formulation intended to control salmonellosis and also improve poultry sanitation.

TI  == lectin-like protein fractions in lactic acid bacteria isolated from chickens.
AB  == agglutination of fifty bacterial strains isolated from gastric-intestinal tract of chickens with yeasts treated with glutaraldehyde and glycine was assayed to study possible adhesion mechanisms to epithelia. it was found that lactobacillus  fermentum, lactobacillus fermentum subsp. cellobiosus and lactobacillus animalis  agglutinated yeasts massively and this agglutination was inhibited in each strain by different representative sugars: agglutination was inhibited in three selected strains with 0.2 m mannose. the three strains agglutinated chicken red blood cells, but did not agglutinate human red blood cells, whereas the agglutinating capacity for other animal erythrocytes was variable. the lectins were partially purified on a sephadex g-75 column and affinity chromatography. the molecular weight of each of the protein subunits was estimated as about 50-67 kda using electrophoretic techniques. after treatment with lipase and metaperiodate modifications bacterial superficies and/or liberation of some structures produced an unspecific interaction with increase in the yeast agglutination and hemagglutination. the optimal conditions of work were: ph 6-7, ca2+ 1 mm, mg2+ 2  mm and 37-42 degrees c.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.
