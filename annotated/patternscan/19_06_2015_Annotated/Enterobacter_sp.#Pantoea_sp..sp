TI  == aerobic microbial community of insectary population of phlebotomus papatasi.
AB  == background: microbes particularly bacteria presenting in the gut of haematophagous insects may have an important role in the epidemiology of human infectious disease. methods: the microbial flora of gut and surrounding environmental of a laboratory strain of phlebotomus papatasi, the main vector of  zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) in the old world, was investigated. biochemical reactions and 16s rdna sequencing of the isolated bacteria against 24 sugars and amino acids were used for bacteria species identification. common mycological media used for fungi identification as well. results: most isolates belonged to the enterobacteriaceae, a large, heterogeneous group of gram-negative rods whose natural habitat is the intestinal tract of humans and animals. enterobacteriaceae groups included edwardsiella, enterobacter, escherichia, klebsiella, kluyvera, leminorella, pantoea, proteus, providencia, rahnella, serratia, shigella, tatumella, and yersinia and non enterobacteriaceae groups included bacillus, staphylococcus and pseudomonas. the most prevalent isolates were proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris. these saprophytic and swarming motile bacteria were isolated from all immature, pupae, and mature fed or unfed male or  female sand flies as well as from larval and adult food sources. five fungi species were also isolated from sand flies, their food sources and colonization materials where candida sp. was common in all mentioned sources. conclusion: midgut microbiota are increasingly seen as an important factor for modulating vector competence in insect vectors so their possible effects of the mirobiota on the biology of p. papatasi and their roles in the sandfly-leishmania interaction  are discussed.

TI  == microbial evaluation of sandboxes located in urban area.
AB  == this paper presents the results of a study on the degree of bacteriological pollution of sandboxes situated in fenced and unfenced housing estates located in an urban area in olsztyn, poland. heterotrophic plate counts (hpc22, hpc37), enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and  clostridium perfringens determined by cultivation and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methods were used as indicators of the sanitary state. their maximum number in the sand samples reached values of up to 5.4x10(7), 2.6x10(6),  3.3x10(4), 2.1x10(3), 1.8x10(4), 1.9x10(1) and 1.2x10(4)cfu/g, respectively. it was found that values of culture-independent method were two-four orders greater  than those obtained by the cultivation method. among identified enterobacteriaceae, pantoea spp. and enterobacter cloacae were the most numerous, whereas escherichia cells were detected only occasionally. pathogenic bacteria of the genus salmonella sp. were isolated from sandboxes also when e. coli were absent. bacteria from staphylococcus genus were isolated irrespective of the site and time of sampling. additionally, the presence of molds and yeasts was studied. maximum counts of these microorganisms amounted to 1.0x10(5) and to 3.5x10(4)cfu/g. aspergillus, penicillium, alternaria and trichoderma genera were  most numerous among molds, whereas trichosporon was detected most frequently among yeasts. sandboxes in the fenced housing estate and those located in the area which is not close to trees were less polluted than the sand collected from  sandboxes in the unfenced housing estate. potentially pathogenic bacteria of the  genus salmonella spp. were identified in analyzed sandboxes, also when toxocara and e. coli were absent. it seems that assessing the contamination of children's  play areas basing only on fecal bacteria counts and by monitoring number of parasites' eggs may be insufficient to evaluate microbial pollution of sandboxes  and may not fully reflect their safety for children.

TI  == isolation and enzyme bioprospection of endophytic bacteria associated with plants of brazilian mangrove ecosystem.
AB  == the mangrove ecosystem is a coastal tropical biome located in the transition zone between land and sea that is characterized by periodic flooding, which confers unique and specific environmental conditions on this biome. in these ecosystems,  the vegetation is dominated by a particular group of plant species that provide a unique environment harboring diverse groups of microorganisms, including the endophytic microorganisms that are the focus of this study. because of their intimate association with plants, endophytic microorganisms could be explored for biotechnologically significant products, such as enzymes, proteins, antibiotics and others. here, we isolated endophytic microorganisms from two mangrove species, rhizophora mangle and avicennia nitida, that are found in streams in two mangrove systems in bertioga and cananeia, brazil. bacillus was the most frequently isolated genus, comprising 42% of the species isolated from cananeia and 28% of the species from bertioga. however, other common endophytic genera such as pantoea, curtobacterium and enterobacter were also found. after identifying the isolates, the bacterial communities were evaluated for enzyme production. protease activity was observed in 75% of the isolates, while endoglucanase activity occurred in 62% of the isolates. bacillus showed the highest activity rates for amylase and esterase and endoglucanase. to our knowledge, this is the first reported diversity analysis performed on endophytic  bacteria obtained from the branches of mangrove trees and the first overview of the specific enzymes produced by different bacterial genera. this work contributes to our knowledge of the microorganisms and enzymes present in mangrove ecosystems.

TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == phosphate solubilization potential and modeling of stress tolerance of rhizobacteria from rice paddy soil in northern iran.
AB  == the purposes of this study were to evaluate the phosphate solubilization activity of bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of rice paddy soil in northern iran, and to study the effect of temperature, nacl and ph on the growth of these isolates by modeling. three of the most effective strains from a total of 300 isolates were identified and a phylogenetic analysis was carried out by 16s rdna  sequencing. the isolates were identified as pantoea ananatis (m36), rahnella aquatilis (m100) and enterobacter sp. (m183). these isolates showed multiple plant growth-promoting attributes such as phosphate solubilization activity and indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) production. the m36, m100 and m183 isolates were able  to solubilize 172, 263 and 254 microg ml(-1) of ca3(po4)2 after 5 days of growth  at 28 degrees c and ph 7.5, and to produce 8.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mug ml(-1) of iaa when supplemented with l-tryptophan (1 mg ml(-1)) for 72 h, at 28 degrees c and ph 7.0, respectively. the solubilization of insoluble phosphate was associated with a drop in the ph of the culture medium and there was an inverse relationship between ph and solubilized p (r = -0.98, p < 0.0952). there were no significant differences among isolates in terms of acidity tolerance based on their confidence limits as assessed by segmented model analysis and all isolates were able to grow at ph 4.3-11 (with optimum at 7.0-7.5). based on a sigmoidal trend of a three-parameter logistic model, the salt concentration required for 50 % inhibition was 8.15, 6.30 and 8.23 % nacl for m36, m100 and m183 isolates, respectively. moreover, the minimum and maximum growth temperatures estimated by  the segmented model were 5.0 and 42.75 degrees c for m36, 12.76 and 40.32 degrees c for m100, and 10.63 and 43.66 degrees c for m183. the three selected isolates could be deployed as inoculants to promote plant growth in an agricultural environment.

TI  == synergistic activity of biocides and antibiotics on resistant bacteria from organically produced foods.
AB  == synergism between biocides and antibiotics was investigated in 20 biocide and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains that were previously isolated from organically produced foods, according to their antimicrobial resistance profiles. most of the antibiotic/biocide combinations yielded synergistic interactions, reducing the inhibitory concentrations of biocides and antibiotics by 4- to 16-fold. among enterococci, synergism with biocides was detected for amoxicillin  (am), cefuroxime (cx), erythromycin (em), ciprofloxacin (cp), and trimethoprim/sulphametoxazol (t/s). among staphylococci, interactions were synergistic (am) and either synergistic or indifferent (cx and em, depending on biocide). among the three methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus clinical strains included in the study, the combinations of methicillin and triclosan or hexachlorophene acted synergistically in all strains, but interactions were either synergistic or indifferent for the other biocides, depending on the strain. all combinations tested were synergistic for lactobacillus (am, cx, em, and cp) and micrococcus (am, em). in salmonella, interactions were indifferent (am, cx, em, and cp) or synergistic (t/s). synergism with biocides was also detected in klebsiella isolates (am, cx, and t/s), enterobacter sp. (am, cx, em,  and t/s), pantoea (am, cx, em, cp, and t/s), and chryseobacterium sp. (em). these results suggest that combinations of biocides and antibiotics may open new possibilities to combat antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [poe]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [pte]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [ee]). several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. however, until now, the polybacterial communities of poe, pte, and ee have not been precisely studied. hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries. of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-pcr-positive samples. the obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra) to identify unique clones. the multiple types of ardra patterns (p=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (p=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in poe, pte, and ee. moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in ee. gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus spp. (n=19), streptococcus spp. (n=18), staphylococcus spp. (n=6), exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), gemella spp. (n=2), enterococcus spp. (n=2), a lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a clostridium sp. (n=1), and a nocardia sp. (n=1), and  gram-negative bacteria, including serratia spp. (n=18), pseudomonas spp. (n=10),  enterobacter spp. (n=8), acinetobacter spp. (n=3), pantoea spp. (n=3), a haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. interestingly,  among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of poe, pte, and ee infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.

TI  == functional characterization of the sucrose isomerase responsible for trehalulose  production in plant-associated pectobacterium species.
AB  == fifty-three plant-associated microorganisms were investigated for their ability to convert sucrose to its isomers. these microorganisms included one dickeya zeae isolate and 7 enterobacter, 3 pantoea, and 43 pectobacterium species. eleven out  of the 53 strains (21%) showed the ability to transform sucrose to isomaltulose and trehalulose. among those, pectobacterium carotovorum kkh 3-1 showed the highest bioconversion yield (97.4%) from sucrose to its isomers. in this strain,  the addition of up to 14% sucrose in the medium enhanced sucrose isomerase (siase) production. the siase activity at 14% sucrose (47.6 u/mg dcw) was about 3.6-fold higher than that of the negative control (13.3 u/mg dcw at 0% sucrose).  the gene encoding siase, which is comprised a 1776 bp open reading frame (orf) encoding 591 amino acids, was cloned from p. carotovorum kkh 3-1 and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant siase (pcsi) was shown to have optimum activity at ph 6.0 and 40 degrees c. the reaction temperature significantly affected the ratio of sucrose isomers produced by pcsi. the amount of trehalulose increased from 47.5% to 79.1% as temperature was lowered from 50 degrees c to 30 degrees c, implying that siase activity can be controlled by reaction temperature.

TI  == physical impaction injury effects on bacterial cells during spread plating influenced by cell characteristics of the organisms.
AB  == aims: to understand the factors that contribute to the variations in colony-forming units (cfu) in different bacteria during spread plating. methods and results: employing a mix culture of vegetative cells of ten organisms varying in cell characteristics (gram reaction, cell shape and cell size), spread plating to the extent of just drying the agar surface (50-60 s) was tested in comparison  with the alternate spotting-and-tilt-spreading (sats) approach where 100 mul inoculum was distributed by mere tilting of plate after spotting as 20-25 microdrops. the former imparted a significant reduction in cfu by 20% over the spreader-independent sats approach. extending the testing to single organisms, gram-negative proteobacteria with relatively larger cells (escherichia, enterobacter, agrobacterium, ralstonia, pantoea, pseudomonas and sphingomonas spp.) showed significant cfu reduction with spread plating except for slow-growing methylobacterium sp., while those with small rods (xenophilus sp.) and cocci (acinetobacter sp.) were less affected. among gram-positive nonspore formers, staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant cfu reduction while staphylococcus haemolyticus and actinobacteria (microbacterium, cellulosimicrobium and brachybacterium spp.) with small rods/cocci were unaffected. vegetative cells of bacillus pumilus and b. subtilis were generally unaffected while others with larger rods (b. thuringiensis, brevibacillus, lysinibacillus and paenibacillus spp.) were significantly affected. a simulated plating study coupled with live-dead bacterial staining endorsed the chances of cell disruption with spreader impaction in afflicted organisms. conclusions: significant reduction in cfu could occur during spread plating due to physical impaction injury to bacterial cells depending on the spreader usage and the variable effects on different organisms are determined by gram reaction, cell size and cell shape. the inoculum spreader could impart physical disruption of vegetative cells against a hard surface. significance and impact of study: possibility of cfu reduction in sensitive organisms and the skewed selection of hardier organisms during spread plating, and the recommendation of sats as an easier and safer alternative for cfu enumerations.

TI  == diversity of sporadic symbionts and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria isolated from nodules of woody, shrub, and food legumes in ethiopia.
AB  == fifty-five bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilized nodules of woody and shrub legumes growing in ethiopia: crotalaria spp., indigofera spp., and erythrina brucei, and the food legumes soybean and common bean. based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, the majority of the isolates were identified as gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genera achromobacter, agrobacterium, burkholderia, cronobacter, enterobacter, mesorhizobium, novosphingobium, pantoea, pseudomonas, rahnella, rhizobium, serratia, and variovorax. seven isolates were gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera bacillus, paenibacillus, planomicrobium, and rhodococcus. amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) fingerprinting showed that each strain was genetically distinct. according to phylogenetic analysis of reca, glnii, rpob, and 16s rrna gene sequences, rhizobium, mesorhizobium, and agrobacterium were further classified into six different genospecies: agrobacterium spp., agrobacterium radiobacter, rhizobium sp., rhizobium phaseoli, mesorhizobium sp., and putative new rhizobium species. the strains from r. phaseoli, rhizobium sp. iar30, and mesorhizobium sp. err6 induced nodules on their host plants. the other strains did not form nodules on their original host. nine endophytic bacterial strains representing seven genera, agrobacterium, burkholderia, paenibacillus, pantoea, pseudomonas, rhizobium, and serratia, were found to colonize nodules of crotalaria incana and common bean on co-inoculation with symbiotic rhizobia. four endophytic rhizobium and two agrobacterium strains had identical nifh gene sequences with symbiotic rhizobium strains, suggesting horizontal gene transfer.  most symbiotic and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria showed plant growth-promoting properties in vitro, which indicate their potential role in the promotion of plant growth when colonizing plant roots and the rhizosphere.

TI  == pseudocitrobacter gen. nov., a novel genus of the enterobacteriaceae with two new species pseudocitrobacter faecalis sp. nov., and pseudocitrobacter anthropi sp. nov, isolated from fecal samples from hospitalized patients in pakistan.
AB  == four isolates of gram-negative facultatively anaerobic bacteria, three of them producing ndm-1 carbapenemase, were isolated from hospitalized patients and outpatients attending two military hospitals in rawalpindi, pakistan, and studied for their taxonomic position. initially the strains were phenotypically identified as citrobacter species. comparative analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences then showed that the four strains shared >97%, but in no case >98.3%, 16s rrna gene sequence similarities to members of the genera citrobacter, kluyvera, pantoea, enterobacter and raoultella, but always formed a separate cluster in respective phylogenetic trees. based on multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) including partial recn, rpoa, thdf and rpob gene sequence and respective amino acid sequence analysis it turned out that the strains also here always formed separate clusters. based on further comparative analyses including dna-dna hybridizations, genomic fingerprint analysis using rep- and rapd-pcrs and physiological tests, it is proposed to classify these four strains into the novel genus pseudocitrobacter gen. nov. with a new species pseudocitrobacter faecalis sp. nov. with strain 25 cit(t) (=ccm 8479(t)=lmg 27751(t)) and pseudocitrobacter  anthropi sp. nov. with strain c138(t) (=ccm 8478(t)=lmg 27750(t)), as the type strains, respectively.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == application of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to microbial diversity analysis in chinese douchi.
AB  == background: douchi is a traditional chinese soybean food which has been consumed  for thousands years as an important protein source and flavouring ingredient. studies have rarely been carried out to investigate its microbial composition and these are urgently required for the commercial labels and safety considerations.  results: microbial counts were statistically significant different among douchi samples. although the maximum diversity indexes of bacterial, bacillus and fungal polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) patterns were only 79%, 70% and 64%, some microorganisms, e.g. bacillus subtilis, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, pseudomonas sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae and pichia  farinose, were found to share dominant positions in most douchi samples. in addition, some pathogens, e.g. staphylococcus saprophyticus, pantoea sp., staphylococcus sciuri, enterobacter sp. and staphylococcus sp., were also identified. conclusion: the pcr-dgge technique was used for the first time as an  effective method to assess the microbial communities in different chinese douchi  samples. this information may be useful in improving the product quality, reformatting production methods, extending shelf life and scaling up the fermentation process.

TI  == characterization of phragmites cummunis rhizosphere bacterial communities and metabolic products during the two stage sequential treatment of post methanated distillery effluent by bacteria and wetland plants.
AB  == this study deals with the characterization of rhizosphere bacterial communities and metabolic products produced during the two stage sequential treatment of post methanated distillery effluent by bacteria and constructed wetland plants. results showed that bacterial treatment followed by wetland plants (phragmites cummunis) resulted 94.5% and 96.0% reduction in bod and cod values, respectively. the pcr-rflp analysis showed the presence of stenotrophomonas, enterobacter, pantoea, acinetobacter and klebsiella sp., as dominant rhizosphere bacterial communities which play an important role in degradation and decolorization of pmde in wetland treatment system. further, the lc-ms-ms and other spectrophotometric analysis have shown that most of the pollutants detected in untreated pmde were diminished from bacteria and wetland plant treated pmde indicating that bacteria and wetland plant rhizosphere microbes utilized them as  carbon, nitrogen and energy source. while, methylbenzene, furfuryl alcohol, and 4-vinyl-2-methoxyphenol were detected as metabolites in bacteria and hexadecanol  in wetland plant rhizosphere treated pmde.

TI  == a multiphasic approach for the identification of endophytic bacterial in strawberry fruit and their potential for plant growth promotion.
AB  == this study used a multiphasic approach, characterized by the simultaneous use of  culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, to investigate endophytic bacterial communities in strawberry (fragaria ananassa) fruit. a total of 92 bacterial endophytes were isolated and initially grouped by their repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep)-pcr banding pattern and biochemical features. phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences of 45 representatives showed that the isolates belonged to the species bacillus subtilis (eight isolates), bacillus sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter sp. (seven isolates), enterobacter ludwigii (six isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (six isolates), pseudomonas sp.  (five isolates), pantoea punctata (three isolates), and curtobacterium citreum (three isolates). nucleic acids were extracted from the strawberry fruit and subjected to 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (16s rrna pcr-dgge). the species b. subtilis, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas sp. were detected both by isolation and dgge. the dgge fingerprints of total bacterial dna did not exhibit bands corresponding to several of the representative species isolated in the extinction dilution (l. plantarum, c. citreum, and p. punctata). in contrast, bands in the dgge profile that were identified as relatives of arthrobacter sp. and one uncultivable erythrobacter sp. were not recovered by cultivation techniques. after isolation,  the nitrogen fixation ability and the in vitro production of indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) equivalents and siderophores were evaluated. a high percentage of isolates  were found to possess the ability to produce siderophores and iaa equivalents; however, only a few isolates belonging to the genera pseudomonas and enterobacter showed the ability to fix nitrogen. plant growth promotion was evaluated under greenhouse conditions and revealed the ability of the bacillus strains to enhance the number of leaves, shoot length, root dry weight, and shoot dry weight. the activity of the bacterial isolate identified as b. subtilis na-108 exerted the greatest influence on strawberry growth and showed a 42.8% increase in number of  leaves, 15.26% for high shoot, 43.5% increase in root dry weight, and a 77% increase in shoot dry weight when compared with untreated controls.

TI  == bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes from a greek vineyard.
AB  == grape bacterial microbiota plays central roles in the quality of grapes and wine, yet its diversity remains poorly described. in the present study, bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes of two cultivars originating from the same vineyard were assessed. isolates were identified by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and sequence analysis of partial 16s rrna gene. comparable counts were recorded between botrytis-infected  and sound grape samples. in all cases, the majority of isolates belonged to different species of enterobacteriaceae. the dominant species in the vineyard was klebsiella oxytoca that was found in different combinations with citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., erwinia sp., pantoea dispersa, tatumella ptyseos or  other species. in fermenting musts, those populations declined while other species evolved, like lactobacillus plantarum and enterobacter ludwigii. populations in botrytised samples persisted longer during spontaneous fermentations. present study suggests that bacterial diversity on grapes may be wider than previously described.

TI  == isolation of phosphate solubilizing bacteria and their potential for lead immobilization in soil.
AB  == lead (pb), a highly toxic heavy metal forms stable compounds with phosphate (p).  the potential of phosphate solubilizing bacteria (psb) to immobilize pb by enhancing solubilization of insoluble p compounds was tested in this research. eighteen different psb strains isolated from p amended and pb contaminated soils  were screened for their efficiency in p solubilization. the psb isolated from p amended soils solubilized 217-479 mg/l of p while the psb from pb contaminated soil solubilized 31-293 mg/l of p. stepwise multiple regression analysis and p solubility kinetics indicated that the major mechanism of p solubilization by psb is the ph reduction through the release of organic acids. from the isolated bacteria, two psb were chosen for pb immobilization and these bacteria were identified as pantoea sp. and enterobacter sp., respectively. the psb significantly increased p solubilization by 25.0% and 49.9% in the case of pantoea sp., and 63.3% and 88.6% in the case of enterobacter sp. for 200 and 800  mg/kg of rock phosphate (rp) addition, respectively, thereby enhancing the immobilization of pb by 8.25-13.7% in the case of pantoea sp. and 14.7-26.4% in the case of enterobacter sp. the ability of psb to solubilize p, promote plant growth, and immobilize pb can be used for phytostabilization of pb contaminated soils.

TI  == culture-dependent and culture-independent characterization of microorganisms associated with aedes aegypti (diptera: culicidae) (l.) and dynamics of bacterial colonization in the midgut.
AB  == in this work we show that the lumen of aedes aegypti midgut is highly colonized by bacteria that were identified by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. rdna sequences obtained were compared with those from genbank and the main bacterial genera identified were: serratia, klebsiella, asaia, bacillus, enterococcus, enterobacter,kluyvera and pantoea. all genera were identified in midgut except enterobacter that was observed only in eggs. asaia and pantoea were also identified in eggs and ovary, respectively. in addition two yeast genera were observed in a. aegypti: pichia isolated from midgut and candida identified in midgut and ovary. the genus serratia was dominant in all isolation assays representing 54.5% of the total of microorganisms. thirty-nine and 24 bacterial clones were successfully obtained from midguts 24 and 48h after blood feeding (abf), respectively. the majority of clones obtained were from serratia sp. (48.7% and 50% for 24 and 48h abf, respectively). light microscopy showed that bacteria were located preferentially in the posterior midgut, around the blood meal and associated with peritrophic matrix. scanning electron microscopy images  showed a high number of bacteria in midgut during blood digestion and the peak of bacterial enumeration was reached 48h abf, stage in which lumen was almost totally occupied by bacteria that were also interacting with epithelial microvilli. our results show the dynamics of microbial colonization and their distribution in midgut during blood digestion.

TI  == [population dynamics and antagonism toward fusarium oxysporium f. sp. vasinfectum. and verticillium dahliae kleb of endophytic bacteria from cotton].
AB  == objective: to explore population dynamics of endophytic bacteria and obtain antagonistic endophytic bacteria toward verticillium dahliae kleb (vd), fusarium  oxysporium f. sp. vasinfectum (fov) from cotton. methods: root, stem and leaf samples were surface-disinfested, and subsequently used to isolate endophytic bacteria by diluting plate counting method. we assayed antagonism of the isolated endophytic bacteria toward three pathogens: vd (v107, which is a highly virulent  defoliating isolate and v396, which is a mildly virulent non-defoliating isolate), fov (f108) using a dual culture method, and analyzed the 16s rdna sequence of doubly antagonistic endophytic bacteria (daeb) isolates toward both vd and fov. results: the population size of endophytic bacteria in root was significantly larger than that in leaf and stem. the populations at seedling stage were generally lower than those at the flowering/maturing stage in root, the populations in stem and leaf were fluctuant at different development stages,  but variation law was not observed obviously. furthermore, although no significant differences of the population densities in root were found among 6 cotton cultivars, the population densities in stem and leaf showed cultivar differences. the proportion of endophytic bacteria antagonizing vd (v107, v396) and fov (f108) in root was higher than that in stem/leaf, moreover, the amount of endophytic bacteria antagonizing toward v107 was less than that toward v396/f108. based on 16s rdna sequence analysis, all 44 daeb isolates consisted of two phyla, i.e., bacteroidetes (1 out of 44) and proteobacteria (43 out of 44), and fell into 8 genera. the genus enterobacter (18 out of 44) and pantoea (15 out of 44) were predominant. notably, ten daeb isolates demonstrated <97% sequence similarity with the most similar sequences of strain deposited in the ribosomal database, these daeb isolates might be potential novel species. conclusion: this  article suggested that plant genotype, development stage, and tissue influenced the population of endophytic bacteria. we discovered that daeb with predominant and various genus existed in cotton. endophytic bacteria in cotton could serve as a pool for discovering biocontrol agent toward cotton pathogens.

AB  == bacterial strains belonging to dna hybridization groups (hg) ii, iv and v, in the erwinia herbicola-enterobacter agglomerans complex, of brenner et al. [int j syst bacteriol 34 (1984), 45-55] were suggested previously to belong to the genus pantoea, but have never been formally described and classified. additionally, it  has been shown in several studies that pectobacterium cypripedii is more closely  related to species of pantoea than to those of pectobacterium. in this study, the phylogenetic positions of brenner's dna hg ii, iv and v and pectobacterium cypripedii were re-examined by both 16s rrna gene sequencing and multilocus sequence analyses (mlsa) based on the gyrb, rpob, atpd and infb genes. the analyses revealed that dna hg ii, iv and v and pectobacterium cypripedii form five separate branches within the genus pantoea (strains from hg v were split into two branches). dna-dna hybridization data further confirmed that dna hg ii,  iv and v constitute four separate species. pectobacterium cypripedii was shown to be a close phylogenetic relative of pantoea dispersa and dna hg iv by both 16s rrna gene sequence and mlsa analyses. biochemical analyses performed on strains from dna hg ii, iv and v and pectobacterium cypripedii confirmed their taxonomic  position within the genus pantoea and revealed phenotypic characteristics that allow the differentiation of these species from each other and from their closest phylogenetic neighbours. it is proposed to emend the description of the genus pantoea and to describe pantoea septica sp. nov. for dna hg ii (type strain lmg 5345(t) =bd 874(t) =cdc 3123-70(t)), pantoea eucrina sp. nov. for dna hg iv (type strain lmg 2781(t) =bd 872(t) =cdc 1741-71(t) =lmg 5346(t)), pantoea brenneri sp. nov. for strains of dna hg v excluding lmg 24534 (type strain lmg 5343(t) =bd 873(t) =cdc 3482-71(t)) and pantoea conspicua sp. nov. for the remaining strain of dna hg v (type strain lmg 24534(t) =bd 805(t) =cdc 3527-71(t)) and to transfer pectobacterium cypripedii to the genus as pantoea cypripedii comb. nov.

TI  == robustness of the bacterial community in the cabbage white butterfly larval midgut.
AB  == microbial communities typically vary in composition and structure over space and  time. little is known about the inherent characteristics of communities that govern various drivers of these changes, such as random variation, changes in response to perturbation, or susceptibility to invasion. in this study, we use 16s ribosomal rna gene sequences to describe variation among bacterial communities in the midguts of cabbage white butterfly (pieris rapae) larvae and examine the influence of community structure on susceptibility to invasion. we compared communities in larvae experiencing the same conditions at different times (temporal variation) or fed different diets (perturbation). the most highly represented phylum was proteobacteria, which was present in all midgut communities. the observed species richness ranged from six to 15, and the most abundant members affiliated with the genera methylobacteria, asaia, acinetobacter, enterobacter, and pantoea. individual larvae subjected to the same conditions at the same time harbored communities that were highly similar in structure and membership, whereas the communities observed within larval populations changed with diet and over time. in addition, structural changes due  to perturbation coincided with enhanced susceptibility to invasion by enterobacter sp. nab3r and pantoea stewartii cwb600, suggesting that resistance to invasion is in part governed by community structure. these findings along with the observed conservation of membership at the phylum level, variation in structure and membership at lower taxonomic levels, and its relative simplicity make the cabbage white butterfly larval community an attractive model for studying community dynamics and robustness.

TI  == uranium(vi) reduction and removal by high performing purified anaerobic cultures  from mine soil.
AB  == biological uranium reduction was investigated using bacteria isolated from a uranium mine in limpopo, south africa. background uranium concentration in soil from the mine was determined to be 168 mgkg(-1) much higher than the typical background uranium concentration in natural soils (0.30-11.7 mgkg(-1)). therefore it was expected that the bacteria isolated from the site were resistant to u(vi)  toxicity. preliminary studies using a non-purified consortium from the mine soil  showed that u(vi) [uranyl(vi) dioxide, uo(2)(2+)] was reduced and re-oxidized intermittently due to the coexistence of u(vi) reducers and u(vi) oxidisers in the soil. results from u(vi) reduction by individual species showed that the purified cultures of pantoea sp., pseudomonas sp. and enterobacter sp. reduced u(vi) to u(iv) [u(oh)(4)(aq)] under ph 5-6. klebsiella sp. had to be eliminated from the cultures since these contributed to the remobilisation of uranium to the hexavelant form. the initial reduction rate determined at 50% point in 30 mgl(-1) batches was highest in pseudomonas sp. at 30 mgl(-1), followed by pantoea sp. rapid reduction was observed in all cultures during the first 6h of incubation with equilibrium conditions obtained only after incubation for 24h. complete u(vi) reduction was observed at concentrations as high as 200mgl(-1) and up to 88% removal after 24h in batches with an initial added u(vi) concentration of 400 mgl(-1).

TI  == comparison of the bacterial community and characterization of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria from different genotypes of chrysopogon zizanioides (l.) roberty (vetiver) rhizospheres.
AB  == molecular approaches [pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge)] were used to determine whether three different vetiver (chrysopogon zizanioides) genotypes, commercially used in brazil and considered economically important over the world, select specific bacterial populations to coexist in their rhizospheres. dgge profiles revealed that the predominant rhizospheric bacterial  community hardly varies regarding the vetiver genotype. moreover, using traditional cultivation methods, bacterial strains were isolated from the different rhizospheres. colonies presenting different morphologies (83) were selected for determining their potential for plant growth promotion. more than half of the strains tested (57.8%) were amplified by pcr using nifh-based primers, specific for the enzyme nitrogenase reductase. the production of siderophores was observed in 88% of the strains, while the production of antimicrobial substances was detected in only 14.5% of the isolates when micrococcus sp. was used as the indicator strain. production of indole-3-acetic acid and the solubilization of phosphate were observed in 55.4% and 59% of the isolates, respectively. in total, 44 strains (53%) presented at least three characteristics of plant growth promotion and were submitted to amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. twenty-four genetic groups were formed at 100% similarity and one representative of each group was selected for their identification by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. they were affiliated with the genera acinetobacter, comamonas, chryseobacterium, klebsiella, enterobacter, pantoea, dyella, burkholderia, or pseudomonas. these strains can be considered of great importance as possible biofertilizers in vetiver.

TI  == population dynamics and identification of endophytic bacteria antagonistic toward plant-pathogenic fungi in cotton root.
AB  == the antagonistic potentials of endophytic bacteria isolated from the roots of six cotton cultivars at different developmental stages were determined in vitro toward three pathogens: verticillium dahliae kleb v107 and v396 and fusarium oxysporum f.sp. vasinfectum (f108). the populations of antagonistic endophytic bacteria (aeb) toward v107, v396, and f108 at the flowering and maturation stages were significantly higher than those at the seedling stage were. more aeb were found to be antagonistic toward pathogens v396 and f108 than v107. results from the multivariate analysis of variance showed that the populations of aeb were significantly different for the main factors of cultivars, stages, and their interactions. based on 16s rdna sequence analysis, the 39 aeb isolates that antagonized v107, v396, and f108 (baeb) consisted of seven genera, in which the genus of enterobacter (17 out of 39) and pantoea (14 out of 39) were predominant  among the baeb isolates. characterized by box-pcr fingerprints, these 39 baeb isolates represented 35 different cluster types. to explore the antagonistic mechanisms, the agar diffusion method was used to detect cell-wall-degrading enzyme activity and siderophore secretion. nearly half of these baeb isolates showed protease and chitinase activity, while all 39 baeb isolates excreted siderophores. however, pectinase, cellulase, and xylanase activity were hardly detected. a germination experiment revealed that nine of the 39 baeb isolates significantly improved the vigor index of the cotton seedlings.

TI  == arsenic detoxification potential of aox genes in arsenite-oxidizing bacteria isolated from natural and constructed wetlands in the republic of korea.
AB  == arsenic is subject to microbial interactions, which support a wide range of biogeochemical transformations of elements in natural environments such as wetlands. the arsenic detoxification potential of the bacterial strains was investigated with the arsenite oxidation gene, aox genotype, which were isolated  from the natural and constructed wetlands. the isolates were able to grow in the  presence of 10 mm of sodium arsenite (as(iii) as naaso(2)) and 1 mm of d: +glucose. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated that  these isolated strains resembled members of the genus that have arsenic-resistant systems (acinetobacter sp., aeromonas sp., agrobacterium sp., comamonas sp., enterobacter sp., pantoea sp., and pseudomonas sp.) with sequence similarities of 81-98%. one bacterial isolate identified as pseudomonas stutzeri strain gist-bdan2 (ef429003) showed the activity of arsenite oxidation and existence of  aoxb and aoxr gene, which could play an important role in arsenite oxidation to arsenate. this reaction may be considered as arsenic detoxification process. the  results of a batch test showed that p. stutzeri gist-bdan2 (ef429003) completely  oxidized in 1 mm of as(iii) to as(v) within 25-30 h. in this study, microbial activity was evaluated to provide a better understanding of arsenic biogeochemical cycle in both natural and constructed wetlands, where ecological niches for microorganisms could be different, with a specific focus on arsenic oxidation/reduction and detoxification.

TI  == genetic diversity of siderophore-producing bacteria of tobacco rhizosphere.
AB  == the genetic diversity of siderophore-producing bacteria of tobacco rhizosphere was studied by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), 16s rrna sequence homology and phylogenetics analysis methods. studies demonstrated that 85% of the total 354 isolates produced siderophores in iron limited liquid medium. a total of 28 ardra patterns were identified among the 299 siderophore-producing bacterial isolates. the 28 ardra patterns represented bacteria of 14 different genera belonging to six bacterial divisions, namely beta-, gamma-, alpha-proteobacteria, sphingobacteria, bacilli, and actinobacteria. especially, gamma-proteobacteria consisting of pseudomonas, enterobacter, serratia, pantoea, erwinia and stenotrophomonas genus encountered 18 different ardra groups. results also showed a greater siderophore-producing bacterial diversity than previous researches. for example, sphingobacterium (isolates g-2-21-1 and g-2-27-2), pseudomonas poae (isolate g-2-1-1), enterobacter endosymbiont (isolates g-2-10-2 and n-5-10), delftia acidovorans (isolate g-1-15), and achromobacter xylosoxidans (isolates n-46-11hh and n-5-20)  were reported to be able to produce siderophores under low-iron conditions for the first time. gram-negative isolates were more frequently encountered, with more than 95% total frequency. for gram-positive bacteria, the bacillus and rhodococcus were the only two genera, with 1.7% total frequency. furthermore, the pseudomonas and enterobacter were dominant in this environment, with 44.5% and 24.7% total frequency, respectively. it was also found that 75 percent of the isolates that had the high percentages of siderophore units (% between 40 and 60) belonged to pseudomonas. pseudomonas sp. g-229-21 screened out in this study may  have potential to apply to low-iron soil to prevent plant soil-borne fungal pathogen diseases.

TI  == diversity of endophytic enterobacteria associated with different host plants.
AB  == fifty-three endophytic enterobacteria isolates from citrus, cocoa, eucalyptus, soybean, and sugar cane were evaluated for susceptibility to the antibiotics ampicillin and kanamycin, and cellulase production. susceptibility was found on both tested antibiotics. however, in the case of ampicillin susceptibility changed according to the host plant, while all isolates were susceptible to kanamycin. cellulase production also changed according to host plants. the diversity of these isolates was estimated by employing box-pcr genomic fingerprints and 16s rdna sequencing. in total, twenty-three distinct operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified by employing a criterion of 60% fingerprint similarity as a surrogate for an otu. the 23 otus belong to the pantoea and enterobacter genera, while their high diversity could be an indication of paraphyletic classification. isolates representing nine different otus belong to pantoea agglomerans, p. ananatis, p. stewartii, enterobacter sp.,  and e. homaechei. the results of this study suggest that plant species may select endophytic bacterial genotypes. it has also become apparent that a review of the  pantoea/enterobacter genera may be necessary.

TI  == taxonomic structure and stability of the bacterial community in belgian sourdough ecosystems as assessed by culture and population fingerprinting.
AB  == a total of 39 traditional sourdoughs were sampled at 11 bakeries located throughout belgium which were visited twice with a 1-year interval. the taxonomic structure and stability of the bacterial communities occurring in these traditional sourdoughs were assessed using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. a total of 1,194 potential lactic acid bacterium (lab) isolates were tentatively grouped and identified by repetitive element sequence-based pcr, followed by sequence-based identification using 16s rrna and  phes genes from a selection of genotypically unique lab isolates. in parallel, all samples were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of v3-16s rrna gene amplicons. in addition, extensive metabolite target analysis of  more than 100 different compounds was performed. both culturing and dgge analysis showed that the species lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus paralimentarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus pontis dominated the  lab population of belgian type i sourdoughs. in addition, dgge band sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of acetobacter sp. and a member of the erwinia/enterobacter/pantoea group in some samples. overall, the culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches each exhibited intrinsic limitations in assessing bacterial lab diversity in belgian sourdoughs. irrespective of the lab biodiversity, a large majority of the sugar and amino acid metabolites were detected in all sourdough samples. principal component-based analysis of biodiversity and metabolic data revealed only little  variation among the two samples of the sourdoughs produced at the same bakery. the rare cases of instability observed could generally be linked with variations  in technological parameters or differences in detection capacity between culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. within a sampling interval  of 1 year, this study reinforces previous observations that the bakery environment rather than the type or batch of flour largely determines the development of a stable lab population in sourdoughs.

(n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == confirmation of e. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  == paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. some are rich in wood  fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their  coliform microflora. therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. for the first series of analyses, the medium used was colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to  isolate bacteria in pure culture on macconkey agar. in a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase  activities, were used to isolate bacteria. first, the presence of thermotolerant  coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 mpn/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. from this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on macconkey medium and identified as citrobacter freundii, enterobacter sp, e. sakazakii, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, k. pneumoniae subsp.  ozaenae, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, pantoea sp, raoultella terrigena, r. planticola. second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 mpn/g (d.w) sludge, whereas e. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 mpn/g (d.w.) sludge. the presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and e. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in  large quantities. also, indigenous e. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated e. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. in this second series of isolations, api20e and biolog identified most isolates as e. coli, but others remained unidentified. the sequences of the 16s rdna confirmed that most isolates were likely e. coli, few burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. this study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.

AB  == the bacteria hosted in the root nodules of the three mediterranean wild legume species hedysarum carnosum, hedysarum spinosissimum subsp. capitatum, and hedysarum pallidum, growing in native stands in different habitats in algeria were isolated. bacteria were recovered on yeast-mannitol-agar or on minimal media from a total of 52 nodules. isolates were analyzed by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) using the enzyme cfoi, and further sorted by rapd fingerprinting. a total of ten different types were found and their amplified 16s rdna was sequenced and compared to databases. the blast alignment indicates that  all the species whose sequences share 98 to 100% identity to the bacteria found in these nodules belong to the class gammaproteobacteria and include pantoea agglomerans, enterobacter kobei, enterobacter cloacae, leclercia adecarboxylata,  escherichia vulneris, and pseudomonas sp. no evidence of any rhizobial-like sequence was found even upon amplifying from the bulk of microbial cells obtained from the squashed nodules, suggesting that the exclusive occupants of the nodules formed by the three plants tested are members of the orders enterobacteriales or  pseudomonadales. this is the first report of gammaproteobacteria associated with  legume nodules. despite the presence of the related crop plant hedysarum coronarium, specifically nodulated by rhizobium sullae, these three hedysarum species demonstrate to have undergone a separate path in terms of endophytic interactions with bacteria. an hypothesis to account for differences between the  symbiotic relationships engaged by man-managed legumes, and those found in plants whose ecology is independent from human action, is discussed.

TI  == isolation and identification of marine chitinolytic bacteria and their potential  in antifungal biocontrol.
AB  == chitinolytic marine bacterial strains (30) were isolated from the sea dumps at bhavnagar, india. they were screened as chitinase producers on the basis of zone  of clearance on chitin agar plates incorporated with calcofluor white m2r for the better resolution. out of these, three strains namely, pseudomonas sp., pantoea dispersa and enterobacter amnigenus showed high chitinase production. they were also found to produce proteases and therefore have a good potential for use as antifungal biocontrol agents for the control of fungal plant pathogens. these strains could degrade and utilize the mycelia of macrophomina phaseoliena (tassi) goidanich and fusarium sp. in vitro, these strains could inhibit the growth of fusarium sp. and m. phaseolina. the culture filtrate inhibiting hyphal elongation was observed microscopically.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == diversity of endophytic bacterial populations and their interaction with xylella  fastidiosa in citrus plants.
AB  == citrus variegated chlorosis (cvc) is caused by xylella fastidiosa, a phytopathogenic bacterium that can infect all citrus sinensis cultivars. the endophytic bacterial communities of healthy, resistant, and cvc-affected citrus plants were studied by using cultivation as well as cultivation-independent techniques. the endophytic communities were assessed in surface-disinfected citrus branches by plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). dominant isolates were characterized by fatty-acid methyl ester analysis as bacillus pumilus, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium spp. (including methylobacterium extorquens, m. fujisawaense, m. mesophilicum, m. radiotolerans, and m. zatmanii), nocardia sp., pantoea agglomerans, and xanthomonas campestris. we observed a relationship between cvc symptoms and the frequency of isolation of species of methylobacterium, the genus that we most frequently isolated from symptomatic plants. in contrast, we isolated c. flaccumfaciens significantly more frequently from asymptomatic plants than from those with symptoms of cvc while p. agglomerans was frequently isolated from tangerine (citrus reticulata) and sweet-orange (c. sinensis) plants, irrespective of whether the plants were symptomatic or asymptomatic or showed symptoms of cvc. dgge analysis of 16s rrna gene fragments amplified from total plant dna resulted in several bands that matched those from the bacterial isolates, indicating that dgge profiles can be used to detect some endophytic bacteria of citrus plants. however, some bands had no match with any isolate, suggesting the occurrence of other, nonculturable or as yet uncultured, endophytic bacteria. a specific band with a high g+c ratio was observed only in asymptomatic plants. the higher frequency of c. flaccumfaciens in asymptomatic plants suggests a role for this organism in the resistance of plants to cvc.

TI  == samsonia erythrinae gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from bark necrotic lesions of erythrina sp., and discrimination of plant-pathogenic enterobacteriaceae by phenotypic features.
AB  == bacterial strains isolated from diseased erythrina (erythrina sp.) trees in martinique (french west indies) were studied using phenotypic tests, 16s rdna sequence analysis and dna-dna hybridization. numerical analysis of phenotypic characteristics showed that these strains formed an homogeneous phenon among plant-pathogenic enterobacteriaceae, and gave useful and updated information for  the identification of these bacteria. results of dna-dna hybridization indicated  that strains from erythrina belonged to a discrete genomospecies (89-100% hybridization) and had low levels of dna relatedness (2-33% hybridization) with reference strains of phytopathogenic erwinia, brenneria, pectobacterium, pantoea  and enterobacter species. 16s rdna sequence analysis using three different methods revealed that the position of strain cfbp 5236t isolated from erythrina was variable in the different trees, so that strains from erythrina could not be  assigned to any recognized genus. it is proposed that these strains are included  in a new genus, samsonia. the name samsonia erythrinae is proposed for the new species. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain, cfbp 5236t (= icmp 13937t), is 57.0 mol%.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == variability and interactions between endophytic bacteria and fungi isolated from  leaf tissues of citrus rootstocks.
AB  == fungi and bacteria were isolated from surface disinfected leaf tissues of several citrus rootstocks. the principal bacterial species isolated were alcaligenes sp., bacillus spp. (including b. cereus, b. lentus, b. megaterium, b. pumilus, and b.  subtilis), burkholderia cepacia, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium extorquens, and pantoea agglomerans, with p. agglomerans and b. pumilus being the most frequently isolated species. the most abundant fungal species were colletotrichum gloeosporioides, guignardia citricarpa, and cladosporium sp. genetic variability between 36 endophytic bacterial isolates was analysed by the random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) technique, which indicated that b. pumilus isolates were more diverse than p. agglomerans isolates, although genetic diversity was not related to the host plants. in vitro interaction studies between g. citricarpa isolates and the most  frequently isolated endophytic bacteria showed that metabolites secreted by g. citricarpa have an inhibitory growth effect on some bacillus species, and a stimulatory growth effect on p. agglomerans.

TI  == erwinia pyrifoliae sp. nov., a novel pathogen that affects asian pear trees (pyrus pyrifolia nakai)
AB  == a novel pathogen from asian pears (pyrus pyrifolia nakai) was analysed by sequencing the 16s rdna and the adjacent intergenic region, and the data were compared to related enterobacteriaceae. the 16s rdna of the asian pear pathogen was almost identical with the sequence of erwinia amylovora, in contrast to the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region of both species. a dendrogram was deduced from determined sequences of the spacer regions including those of several related species such as erwinia amylovora, enterobacter pyrinus, pantoea  stewartii subsp. stewartii and escherichia coli. dendrograms derived from 121 biochemical characteristics including biotype 100 data placed the asian pear pathogen close to erwinia amylovora and more distantly to other members of the species erwinia and to the species pantoea and enterobacter. another dna relatedness study was performed by dna hybridizations and estimation of delta tm  values. the asian pear strains constituted a tight dna hybridization group (89-100%) and were barely related to strains of erwinia amylovora (40-50%) with a delta tm in the range of 5.2-6.8. the g + c content of dna from the novel pathogen is 52 mol%. therefore, it is proposed that strains isolated from asian pears constitute a new species and the name erwinia pyrifoliae is suggested; the  type strain is strain ep 16/96t (= cfbp 4172t = dsm 12163t).
