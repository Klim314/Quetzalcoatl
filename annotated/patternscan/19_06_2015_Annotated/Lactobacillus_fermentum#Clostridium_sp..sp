TI  == oral administration of lactobacillus fermentum i5007 favors intestinal development and alters the intestinal microbiota in formula-fed piglets.
AB  == the present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of early administration of lactobacillus fermentum i5007 on intestinal development and microbial composition in the gastrointestinal tract using a neonatal piglet model. full-term 4 day old piglets, fed with milk replacer, were divided into a control  group (given placebo of 0.1% peptone water) and a l. fermentum i5007 group (dosed daily with 6 x 10(9) cfu/ml l. fermentum i5007). the experiment lasted 14 days. on day 14, a significant increase in the jejunum villous height (583 +/- 33 vs 526 +/- 18) and increases in the concentrations of butyrate (7.55 +/- 0.55 vs 5.33 +/- 0.39) and branched chain fatty acids in the colonic digesta were observed in piglets in the l. fermentum i5007 treatment (p < 0.05). mrna expression of il-1beta (1.29 +/- 0.29 vs. 0.62 +/- 0.07) in the ileum were lower  after 14 days of treatment with l. fermentum i5007. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) revealed that l. fermentum i5007 affected the colonic microbial communities on day 14 and, in particular, reduced numbers of clostridium sp. l. fermentum i5007 play a positive role in gut development in neonatal piglets by modulating microbial composition, intestinal development, and immune status. l. fermentum i5007 may be useful as a probiotic for application in neonatal piglets.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == characterization of pentocin tv35b, a bacteriocin-like peptide isolated from lactobacillus pentosus with a fungistatic effect on candida albicans.
AB  == lactobacillus pentosus tv35b, isolated from the posterior fornix secretions of the vagina of a prenatal patient, produced a bacteriocin-like peptide (pentocin tv35b), which is inhibitory to clostridium sporogenes, cl. tyrobutyricum, lact. curvatus, lact. fermentum, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp. and candida albicans. the mechanism of activity of pentocin tv35b is bactericidal, as shown by a decrease in the viable  cell numbers of lact. sake from approximately 4 x 108 to less than 10 cfu ml - 1  over a period of 4 h. pentocin tv35b added to the growth medium of c. albicans stimulated the formation of pseudohyphae during the first 36 h, followed by a slight repression in cell growth. production of pentocin tv35b was at its maximum towards the end of the logarithmic growth phase of strain tv35b. the peptide was  purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by sp-sepharose cation exchange chromatography. the molecular size of pentocin tv35b was estimated to be between 2.35 and 3.4 kda, according to tricine-sds page. however, results obtained by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy indicated that the peptide  is 3930.2 da in size. amino acid analysis performed by using the pico-tag(r) method and a nova-pak c18 hplc column indicated that pentocin tv35b consists of 33 amino acids with a total mass of 3929.63 da. pentocin tv35b is inactivated when treated with papain and proteinase k, but remains active after incubation at ph 1-10 for 2 h at 25 degrees c, and when heat-treated for 30 min at 100 degrees  c.

TI  == [studies on the locality and the function of spirosome in bacterial cells: relationship between the production of spirosome and anaerobic glycolysis].
AB  == the locality and the function of spirosome were studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and electron microscopy in  peptostreptococcus productus, clostridium sp. hd-17, lactobacillus fermentum, eubacterium aerofaciens and escherichia cali b. when the bacterial cells in phosphate buffered saline were disrupted by sonication and fractionated by differential centrifugation, the spirosome protein was found in the cytoplasmic fraction and not in the fraction of cell wall and cell membrane (the envelope fraction). the spirosome protein was found, however, in the envelope fraction when the bacterial cells were treated with a proper concentration of sds. the spirosome protein in the envelope fraction disappeared after treatment with 2% triton x-100 for 2 h. these results suggest that the spirosome protein anchored to the cell membrane upon sds treatment. so it is presumed that the locality of spirosome is close to the cell membrane. spirosome production increased in parallel to the concentration of glucose in the medium in obligate and aerotolerant anaerobes as well as in facultative anaerobes. this result indicates that the spirosome production was induced during the process of anaerobic glycolysis. fructose as the sole carbon source in the minimal medium induced the  spirosome production by e. coli as did glucose, but sodium pyruvate did not induce it either under aerobic or anaerobic condition.
