yoghurt fermented by lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus h+ -atpase-defective mutants exhibits enhanced viability of bifidobacterium breve during storage.
persistent acid production by lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during  refrigerated storage is a major cause of reduced viability of probiotic strains such as bifidobacterium breve in yoghurt. it was established that h+ -atpase-defective mutants of lactic acid bacteria have reduced growth and metabolism in low ph environments. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate inhibition of post-acidification and maintenance of b. breve viability in yoghurt fermented by l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus mutants with reduced membrane-bound h+ -atpase activity during refrigerated storage. spontaneous neomycin mutants of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus that had a significantly (p < or = 0.05) reduced h+ -atpase activity were successfully isolated. yoghurt fermented using l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus sbt0164 no. 55-1 (mutant) starter culture had markedly reduced post-acidification and maintained viability (> or = 10(8) cfu/ml) of both bifidobacteruim breve jcm 1192(t) and bifidobacteruim breve jcm 7017 during storage at 10 degrees c for 21 days. these results clearly showed that yoghurt fermented by mutants of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus with reduced membrane-bound h+ -atpase activity has reduced post-acidification that prolongs viability of b. breve in yoghurt during refrigerated storage.
