TI  == anti-viral and anti-bacterial activities of an extract of blackcurrants (ribes nigrum l.).
AB  == the inhibitory effects of an extract of the blackcurrant (ribes nigrum l.) against pathogens associated with oral, nasopharyngeal and upper respiratory infectious diseases; namely respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), influenza virus a  and b (ifv-a and ifv-b), adenovirus (adv), herpes simplex virus type 1, haemophilus influenzae type b, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, were investigated. less than 1% concentration of extract of blackcurrant inhibited replication of rsv, ifv-a and -b and hsv-1 by over 50% and a 10% extract inhibited adsorption of these viruses onto the cell surface by over 95%.  the effects on adv were much less pronounced; the half minimal inhibitory concentration of adv replication was 2.54 +/- 0.26, and a 10% concentration of the extract inhibited adv adsorption on the cell surface by 72.9 +/- 3.4%. the antibacterial activities of the blackcurrant were evaluated based on its efficacy as a disinfectant. a 10% extract disinfected 99.8% of h. influenzae type b and 78.9% of s. pneumoniae in 10 min, but had no demonstrable effect against s. mutans. the blackcurrant extract still showed antiviral and antibacterial activities after the ph had been made neutral with sodium hydroxide, suggesting that these activities are not the result of acidic reactions or of components precipitated at a neutral ph. these findings demonstrate the potential of blackcurrant extract as a functional food for oral care.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be  attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces  suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI  == xylitol in preventing acute otitis media.
AB  == xylitol is a polyol sugar alcohol and is referred to as birch sugar, because it can be produced from birch. natural sources of xylitol include plums, strawberries, raspberries and rowan berries. xylitol inhibits the growth of streptococcus pneumoniae and it inhibits the attachment of both pneumococci and haemophilus influenzae on the nasopharyngeal cells. in two clinical trials xylitol was found efficient to prevent the development of acute otitis media with a daily dose of 8.4-10 g of xylitol given in five divided doses. the efficacy in  these 2-3 months follow-up trials was approximately 40% when chewing gum was used and approximately 30% with xylitol syrup. the need to use antimicrobials reduced  markedly when using xylitol. in a high-risk group of children with tympanostomy tubes xylitol was ineffective in preventing otitis. xylitol appears to be an attractive alternative to prevent acute otitis media. a more practical frequency  of doses should be found before its use can be widely recommended.

TI  == genetic transformation in streptococcus mutans requires a peptide secretion-like  apparatus.
AB  == competence for genetic transformation in streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus gordonii involves the comab secretion apparatus, which is thought to export the competence-stimulating peptide. homologous secretory systems are also used for the export of certain bacteriocins and bacteriocin-like peptides. in this study, a similar secretory apparatus was found in the streptococcus mutans genome, and its role in transformation was investigated. gene inactivation resulted in a mutant deficient in transformability. we suggest that secretion of  a peptide, possibly the competence-stimulating peptide itself, is involved in competence induction also in s. mutans.

TI  == the in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == effect of xylitol on growth of nasopharyngeal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == xylitol is known to reduce caries by inhibiting the growth of streptococcus mutans. we hypothesized that xylitol could also affect the growth of other nasopharyngeal bacterial flora, which could be important when considering respiratory infections caused by these bacteria. we studied this in vitro by adding xylitol to the medium and observed that 1 and 5% xylitol reduced markedly  the growth of alpha-hemolytic streptococci, including s. pneumoniae. it reduced slightly the growth of beta-hemolytic streptococci but not that of haemophilus influenzae or moraxella catarrhalis. the inhibitory growth pattern was similar to that previously seen with s. mutans, which may indicate a similarity in the enzymatic processing of five-carbon sugars such as xylitol. this sugar alcohol is a widely used sweetener, and the concentrations used in our experiments are easily achieved in the oral cavity. if xylitol reduces the growth of s. pneumoniae in the nasopharynx, it could also reduce the carriage of this pathogen and thus have clinical significance in the prevention of pneumococcal diseases.

TI  == iga subclasses of human colostral antibodies specific for microbial and food antigens.
AB  == the distribution of total and antigen-specific iga1 and iga2 antibodies in human  colostrum was determined by elisa using subclass-specific monoclonal reagents. in 18 samples of colostrum the mean ratio of total iga1 to iga2 was found to be 53:47, respectively, but significant individual variations were observed. in two  samples we found unusually low levels of iga1, while iga2 was in the normal range. iga1 and iga2 antibody activities were determined against the following antigens: bovine gamma-globulin and beta-lactoglobulin, tetanus toxoid, protein antigen i/ii of streptococcus mutans, influenza virus vaccine, polysaccharides of pneumococcal, meningococcal and haemophilus influenzae type b origin, and lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli k235. the iga antibody activity directed against the polysaccharides was almost equally distributed between the two subclasses. however, antibody activity specific for protein antigens was found predominantly in the iga1 subclass while anti-lps activity was mostly of the iga2 subclass.
