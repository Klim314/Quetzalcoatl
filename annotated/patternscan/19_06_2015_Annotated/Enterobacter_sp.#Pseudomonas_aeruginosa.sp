TI  == microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a university hospital.
AB  == background: microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in state university of campinas, no data has been published yet. methods: the main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. the blood culture records requested from  4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. the samples were processed using the bact/alert system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. results: a total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). there were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). the prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns) (15.87%), escherichia coli (13.0%), staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), enterobacter sp (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and candida sp (5.1%). examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of  the s. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and 80% of the cns isolates were oxacillin-resistant. for a. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs  were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for p. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. when all gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to  beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. conclusions: eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. for empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.

TI  == acanthamoeba and bacteria produce antimicrobials to target their counterpart.
AB  == background: in the microbial ecosystem, microbes compete for space and nutrients. consequently, some have developed the ability to kill or inhibit the growth of other competing microbes by producing antimicrobial substances. as the 'producer' species are generally immune to these substances, their compounds act on the competing microbial species and give the producer more space and access to nutrients for growth. many currently used antibiotics were developed by exploiting this potential of certain microbes. findings: here, the free-living amoeba, acanthamoeba castellanii, was investigated for its antibacterial activity against representative gram positive and gram negative bacteria, while bacterial  isolates were tested for their anti-amoebic properties. conditioned medium from a. castellanii showed remarkable bactericidal properties against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) exhibiting almost 100% kill rate, but had limited effect against acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). similarly, the conditioned  medium of e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., exhibited potent anti-acanthamoebic effects in a concentration-dependent manner. conditioned media of acanthamoeba, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp. showed no cytotoxicity in vitro when tested against human brain microvascular endothelial cells. active molecule/s in aforementioned amoebic and two bacterial conditioned media were 5 - 10 kda, and <5 kda respectively. conclusions: a. castellanii conditioned medium showed potent bactericidal properties against mrsa. the active molecule(s) are heat- and pronase-resistant, and in the 5 to 10 kda molecular mass range. contrary to this, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., conditioned medium showed anti-amoebic effects that are <5 kda in molecular mass, suggestive of active metabolites.

TI  == isolation and characterization of siderophore producing antagonistic rhizobacteria against rhizoctonia solani.
AB  == plant protection through siderophore producing rhizobacteria (spr) has emerged as a sustainable approach for crop health management. in present study, 220 bacteria isolated from tomato rhizosphere were screened for in vitro antagonistic activity against rhizoctonia solani ag-4. nine potent antagonistic strains viz., alcaligenes sp. (mun1, mb21, and mpf37), enterobacter sp. (mpm1), pseudomonas sp. (m10a and mb65), p. aeruginosa (mpf14 and mb123) and p. fluorescens (mpf47) were  identified on the basis of physiological characters and 16s rdna sequencing. these strains were able to produce hydrolytic enzymes, hydrogen cyanide, indole acetic acid, although, only few strains were able to solubilize phosphate. two strains (mb123 and mpf47) showed significant disease reduction in glasshouse conditions were further evaluated under field conditions using three different application methods. application of p. fluorescens (mpf47) in nursery as soil mix + seedling root treatments prior to transplantation resulted in significant disease reduction compared to control. total chlorophyll and available iron were  significantly higher in the mpf47 treated plants in contrast to infected control. in conclusion, siderophore producing bacteria mpf47 have strong biocontrol abilities and its application as soil mix + seedling root treatments provided strong shield to plant roots against r. solani and could be used for effective bio-management of pathogen.

TI  == amount of usage and involvement in explosions not associated with increased contamination of prehospital vehicles with multi-drug-resistant organisms.
AB  == introduction: the role of explosions and patient transport vehicles as sources and vectors of gram-negative, multidrug-resistant organisms (mdros) that predominate infections following lengthy evacuations after disasters due to natural hazards and in current war-trauma patients is unknown. hypothesis/problem: damaged or heavily-used vehicles could be sources of the mdros subsequently linked to nosocomial infections. methods: from january through may 2008 in iraq, inside surfaces of heavily-used, tactical vehicles (experimental group) were sampled with sterile, pre-moistened swabs. swabs, along with positive and negative controls, were shipped to the reference laboratory in  washington, dc, where they underwent culture, identification and susceptibility testing, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. multidrug-resistant organisms were defined according to the standard centers for disease control and prevention definitions. high risk organisms (hros) were defined as susceptible e. coli, a. baumannii, p. aeruginosa, enterobacter spp, or klebsiella spp. concurrently, new  counterparts (control group) were similarly surveyed in a storage lot in georgia, usa. groups were compared using the chi-squared test. results: one hundred thirty-nine consecutive vehicles including all available ambulances were sampled, yielding 153 swabs. nineteen were lost or damaged during shipping. seventy-nine swabs yielded growth of one or more gram-negative bacteria. the amount and genotype of mdros in heavily-used vehicles, including those involved in roadside  bombings, were compared to control vehicles and to strains isolated from wounds and environmental surfaces at the base hospital. predominant organisms included p. agglomerans (34%), s. flexneri (8%), e. vulneris (6%), pseudomonas sp. (6%), and k. pneumonia (6%). no mdros were isolated. thirteen vehicles (eight of 94 experimental and five of 45 control) yielded hro. there was no difference in contamination rates (p = .63). no hros were isolated from ambulances. no clonal association existed between vehicle and hospital strains. conclusion: given the implications that this knowledge gap has on military and civilian prehospital reservoirs of infection, further study is warranted to confirm these findings and identify targets for preventive intervention throughout civilian disaster and military casualty evacuation chains.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == discrimination of selected species of pathogenic bacteria using near-infrared raman spectroscopy and principal components analysis.
AB  == abstract. a method, based on raman spectroscopy, for identification of different  microorganisms involved in bacterial urinary tract infections has been proposed.  spectra were collected from different bacterial colonies (gram-negative: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, and gram-positive: staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp.), grown on culture medium (agar), using a raman spectrometer with a fiber raman probe (830 nm). colonies were scraped from the agar surface and placed on an aluminum foil for raman measurements. after preprocessing, spectra were submitted to a principal component analysis and mahalanobis distance (pca/md) discrimination algorithm. we found that the mean raman spectra of different bacterial species show similar bands, and s. aureus was well characterized by strong bands related to carotenoids. pca/md could discriminate gram-positive bacteria with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and gram-negative bacteria with sensitivity ranging from 58 to 88% and specificity ranging from 87% to 99%.

TI  == in vivo-validated essential genes identified in acinetobacter baumannii by using  human ascites overlap poorly with essential genes detected on laboratory media.
AB  == a critical feature of a potential antimicrobial target is the characteristic of being essential for growth and survival during host infection. for bacteria, genome-wide essentiality screens are usually performed on rich laboratory media.  this study addressed whether genes detected in that manner were optimal for the identification of antimicrobial targets since the in vivo milieu is fundamentally different. mutant derivatives of a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii were screened for growth on human ascites, an ex vivo medium that reflects the infection environment. a subset of 34 mutants with unique gene disruptions that demonstrated little to no growth on ascites underwent evaluation in a rat subcutaneous abscess model, establishing 18 (53%) of these genes as in vivo essential. the putative gene products all had annotated biological functions, represented unrecognized or underexploited antimicrobial targets, and could be grouped into five functional categories: metabolic, two-component signaling systems, dna/rna synthesis and regulation, protein transport, and structural. these a. baumannii in vivo essential genes overlapped poorly with the sets of essential genes from other gram-negative bacteria catalogued in the database of essential genes (deg), including those of acinetobacter baylyi, a closely related species. however, this finding was not due to the absence of orthologs. none of the 18 in vivo essential genes identified in this study, or their putative gene products, were targets of fda-approved drugs or drugs in the developmental pipeline, indicating that a significant portion of the available target space within pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is currently neglected. importance: the  human pathogen acinetobacter baumannii is of increasing clinical importance, and  a growing proportion of isolates are multiantimicrobial-resistant, pan-antimicrobial-resistant, or extremely resistant strains. this scenario is reflective of the general problem of a critical lack of antimicrobials effective  against antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and escherichia coli. this study identified a set of a. baumannii genes that are essential for growth and survival during infection and demonstrated the importance of using clinically relevant media and in vivo validation while screening for essential genes for the purpose of developing new antimicrobials. furthermore, it established that if a gene is absent from the database of essential genes, it should not be excluded as a potential antimicrobial target. lastly, a new set of high-value potential antimicrobial targets for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria has been identified.

TI  == phyto-synthesis of silver nanoscale particles using morinda citrifolia l. and its inhibitory activity against human pathogens.
AB  == leaf extract of morinda citrifolia l. was assessed for the synthesis of silver nanoscale particles under different temperature and reaction time. synthesized nanoscale (mcagnps) particles were confirmed by analysing the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (spr) using uv-visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm. further sem, hrtem analysis confirmed the range of particle size between 10 and 60 nm and sead pattern authorizes the face centered cubic (fcc) crystalline nature of the mcagnps. fourier transform infrared spectrum (ftir) of synthesized  mcagnps confirms the presence of high amount of phenolic compounds in the plant extract which may possibly influence the reduction process and stabilization of nanoparticles. further, inhibitory activity of mcagnps and plant extract were tested against human pathogens like eschericia coli, pseudomonas aeroginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus and enterococci sp. the results indicated that the mcagnps showed moderate inhibitory actions against human pathogens than crude plant extract, demonstrating its antimicrobial value against pathogenic diseases.

TI  == new role of antibody in bacterial isolation.
AB  == to eliminate the interference caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa in the isolation of salmonella, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against p. aeruginosa was prepared by inoculating four new zealand rabbits with the pathogen. the antiserum was purified using saturated ammonium sulfate and added into rappaport-vassiliadis medium with soya (rvs) broth and muller-kauffmann tetrathionate novobiocin broth  (mkttn broth) to evaluate whether it could inhibit the growth of p. aeruginosa. observations by scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that p. aeruginosa was  attacked and destroyed by the antibody when incubated for 10 min at 37 degrees c. the activity of the antibody was also effective against 11 other strains of p. aeruginosa. twenty-six strains of salmonella were mixed with p. aeruginosa in rvs and mkttn broth at 37 degrees c for 12 h, respectively, and the cultures were plated on salmonella chromogenic medium (scm; oxoid, basingstoke, uk). only salmonella grew on scm; five colonies were randomly selected for identification by vitek 2 (biomerieux, lyon, france). additionally, when mixed with two strains  of enterobacter cloacae (atcc 700323 and yg001), the prepared antibody did not affect the growth of e. cloacae. the results demonstrated that the microbicidal activity of the antibody did not affect the tested salmonella sp. or e. cloacae strains. therefore, the antibody generated could be used to increase the accuracy of salmonella isolation.

TI  == temporal variation of microbiological and chemical quality of noncarbonated bottled drinking water sold in sri lanka.
AB  == use of bottled water in sri lanka has increased over the last decade, while new brands of bottled water are often introduced to the market. however, the manufacturers' adherence to bottled water regulations is questionable, raising concerns regarding the quality of bottled water. the objective of the current study was to investigate the microbiological and chemical quality of bottled water in sri lanka. thirty bottled water brands were sampled and their chemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed. microbiological analysis was carried out within 1 to 3, 3 to 6, 6 to 9, and 9 to 12 mo after the date of manufacture. the results indicated that 63% of brands tested exceeded the levels  permitted by the sri lanka standards institution (slsi) for presumptive total coliforms (tc) (<10 cfu per 100 ml) whereas 97% brands exceeded the world health  organization (who) permitted level. thirty percent of brands exceeded the limit for presumptive fecal coliforms (fc) (0 cfu per 100 ml in accordance with who permitted levels, slsi and the sri lanka health ministry requirement). eighty percent of brands showed higher heterotrophic plate counts (hpc) which exceeded the who guidelines for bottled drinking water. throughout their shelf life, the counts of tc, fc, and hpc bacteria decreased. bacteria identified were klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pasteurella haemolytica, the most frequently being p. aeruginosa. the dominant fungi identified were aspergillus sp. and penicillium sp. inorganic chemical parameters were within permitted levels for all brands except for initial content of ammonia. the results of this study show the need for the bottling industry to  be monitored closely by relevant authorities, in order to provide safe bottled drinking water to consumers in sri lanka.

TI  == gram-negative osteomyelitis: clinical and microbiological profile.
AB  == introduction: despite the growing interest in the study of gram-negative bacilli  (gnb) infections, very little information on osteomyelitis caused by gnb is available in the medical literature. objectives and methods: to assess clinical and microbiological features of 101 cases of osteomyelitis caused by gnb alone, between january 2007 and january 2009, in a reference center for the treatment of high complexity traumas in the city of sao paulo. results: most patients were men (63%), with median age of 42 years, affected by chronic osteomyelitis (43%) or acute osteomyelitis associated to open fractures (32%), the majority on the lower limbs (71%). the patients were treated with antibiotics as inpatients for 40 days (median) and for 99 days (median) in outpatient settings. after 6 months follow-up, the clinical remission rate was around 60%, relapse 19%, amputation 7%, and death 5%. nine percent of cases were lost to follow-up. a total of 121 gnb was isolated from 101 clinical samples. the most frequently isolated pathogens were enterobacter sp. (25%), acinetobacter baumannii (21%) e pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). susceptibility to carbapenems was about 100% for enterobacter sp., 75% for pseudomonas aeruginosa and 60% for acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: osteomyelitis caused by gnb remains a serious therapeutic  challenge, especially when associated to nonfermenting bacteria. we emphasize the need to consider these agents in diagnosed cases of osteomyelitis, so that an ideal antimicrobial treatment can be administered since the very beginning of the therapy.

TI  == the influence of environmental bacteria in freshwater stingray wound-healing.
AB  == invasion by bacteria can influence the course of healing of wounds acquired in aquatic environment. in this study, the bacteria present in potamotrygon motoro stingray mucus and in the alto parana river water were identified, and their ability to induce tissue injury and resist antibiotics was determined. biochemical identification analysis showed that 97% of all bacterial isolates were gram negative, aeromonas spp., enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii being the species most prevalent. gelatinase and caseinase were produced by aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas sobria and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. erythrocyte hemolysis assay showed that a. sobria, a. hydrophila and to a lesser  extent, other gram-negative bacteria produced hemolysin. it was also observed that molecules released in culture by these bacteria were toxic to human epithelial cells. antibiogram results showed that 68% of all bacterial isolates were resistant to at least one type of antibiotic, mainly b-lactams. finally, it  was demonstrated that although p. motoro venom was toxic to epithelial cells it did not influence bacterial proliferation. in summary, the results obtained in this work indicate that during the accident, the mucus of p. motoro and the environmental water may transfer into the wound pathogenic multi-resistant bacteria with the potential to cause severe secondary infections.

TI  == bacteriologic and plasmid analysis of etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in lagos, nigeria.
AB  == background: conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the conjunctiva, is one of the most common eye problems affecting all age groups in nigeria. a better understanding of its epidemiology and the antibiotic susceptibility of etiologic  bacterial agents is crucial for the initiation of preventive and therapeutic measures. this study determined the distribution and patterns of bacterial infections in nigerian patients with conjunctivitis. antibiotic resistance patterns and the plasmid profiles of these pathogens were also investigated. methodology: a total of 83 consecutive and non-duplicate conjunctival specimens were collected from patients attending eye clinics at three different hospitals in lagos, nigeria, between february and september 2010. specimens were cultured on standard bacteriologic media and the recovered isolates speciated using standard techniques. susceptibility of pathogens to antibiotics and plasmid dna extraction were carried out by disk diffusion and alkaline lysis methods. conjugation experiment was done with rifampicin-resistant escherichia coli dh5alpha as the recipient cell. data were analyzed using the chi-square test. results: all the specimens were culture-positive, yielding a total of 155 bacterial isolates. gram-positive cocci comprising staphylococcus aureus (27.7%)  and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. (22.6%) accounted for 50.3% (78 of 155) of conjunctivitis cases, followed by gram-positive bacilli (22.6%), gram-negative bacilli (21.3%), and gram-negative cocci (4.5%). corynebacterium spp. were the most commonly isolated gram-positive bacilli accounting for 16.1% of conjunctivitis cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa topped with 9.7% as the most commonly isolated gram-negative bacilli. other gram-negative bacilli in order of  their isolations were e. coli (6.5%), proteus sp. (3.2%), klebsiella sp. (1.9%),  and enterobacter aerogenes (1.9%). moraxella spp. were the only gram-negative cocci isolated, and they accounted for 4.5% of the total conjunctival infections. further analysis of the complexity of infections showed that 25 specimens elicited mono-infections, while cases of polymicrobial infections caused by two pathogens and three or more pathogens constituted 51.8% and 18.1% of conjunctivitis specimens screened, respectively. the disparity in the percentage  contribution of three infection patterns was significant (p < 0.05). antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed chloramphenicol and ofloxacin as the least and most active antibiotics tested as 99 (63.9%) and 149 (96.1%) of the 155 recovered isolates were sensitive to them. on the whole, the least susceptible pathogen was p. aeruginosa with sensitivities ranging from 20% to 80%, while moraxella sp. represented the most sensitive pathogen with sensitivities ranging from 71.4% to  100%. other bacterial isolates also elicited antibiotic sensitivities in the range of 33.3-100%. a total of 101 isolates were screened for plasmids, of which  45 harbored plasmids, yielding a plasmid frequency of 44.6%. conjugal transfer of resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin was detected in the transconjugants after the mating experiment. the antibiotic resistances were transferred either singly or in combination from six of the seven selected donor  strains. the antibiotic resistance pattern transferred by these donor strains was partial and was associated with the transfer of r plasmids of sizes 21.3, 15.2, and 5.0 kb from three of the six transferable strains. the frequencies of transfer of antibiotype or r plasmids to the transconjugants ranged from 1.8 x 10(-7) to 1.4 x 10(-5) transconjugants per donor strain. conclusion: conjunctivitis as an eye problem in lagos is polymicrobial with infections associated with transferable r plasmids for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and streptomycin. continuous surveillance of conjunctivitis in relation to etiology,  drug susceptibility, and plasmid transferability in the study area is therefore recommended.

TI  == effect of neem extract against the bacteria isolated from marine fish.
AB  == marine ornamental fishes are exceedingly valuable due to their high demand in domestic and international markets. there is a growing global interest to rear the fishes in captivity. but problem due to bacteria and fungi are the major hitch in captive condition. since, the use of antibiotics is banned, an attempt was made to ascertain in vitro assay of the neem leaves extract against the bacterial pathogens isolated from infected fishes. bacterial strains isolated from infected regions of the clown fishes amphiprion sebae and a. ocellaris were  identified as aeromonas hydrophila, enterobacter sp., e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus sp., streptococcus sp., vibrio cholerae, v. alginolyticus, v. parahaemolyticus and yersinia enterocolitica. ethanol and methanol extracts were  highly inhibitory to the bacterial isolates when compared to other solvents. ethanol extracts exhibited low minimum inhibitory concentration (75-250 microg ml(-1)) as compared to other extracts. the present finding revealed that the neem leaf extract significantly reduces the bacterial pathogens and their infection in marine ornamental fishes.

TI  == culture-independent techniques applied to food industry water surveillance--a case study.
AB  == culture-independent techniques were used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water at potentially critical control points along the production lines at a german dairy company and a spanish dry cured ham company. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was used to describe bacterial population shifts indicating biological instability in the drinking water samples. autochthonous bacteria were identified by sequencing the excised dgge dna bands.  more specifically, real-time pcr was applied to detect a number of pathogenic bacteria, i.e. listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus spp., salmonella spp, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. due to the detection limits of the  real-time pcr method, a specific protocol was established in order to meet the technical detection requirements and to avoid unwanted polymerase inhibitions. autochthonous bacterial populations were found to be highly stable at most of the sampling points. only one sampling point exhibited population shifts at the german dairy company. enterococci and p.aeruginosa were detected in some water samples from these companies by molecular biology detection methods, but not by conventional culturing methods. some opportunistic bacteria as enterobacter sp.,  acinetobacter, sphingomonas sp. and non-pathogenic bacillus, were also detected after dna sequencing of dgge bands.

TI  == the use of culture-independent tools to characterize bacteria in endo-tracheal aspirates from pre-term infants at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == although premature infants are increasingly surviving the neonatal period, up to  one-third develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd). despite evidence that bacterial colonization of the neonatal respiratory tract by certain bacteria may  be a risk factor in bpd development, little is known about the role these bacteria play. the aim of this study was to investigate the use of culture-independent molecular profiling methodologies to identify potential etiological agents in neonatal airway secretions. this study used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) and clone sequence analyses to  characterize bacterial species in endo-tracheal (et) aspirates from eight intubated pre-term infants. a wide range of different bacteria was identified in  the samples. forty-seven t-rf band lengths were resolved in the sample set, with  a range of 0-15 separate species in each patient. clone sequence analyses confirmed the identity of individual species detected by t-rflp. we speculate that the identification of known opportunistic pathogens including s. aureus, enterobacter sp., moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus sp., within the airways of pre-term infants, might be causally related to the subsequent development of bpd. further, we suggest that culture-independent techniques, such as t-rflp, hold important potential for the characterization of  neonatal conditions, such as bpd.

AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  == the diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of eudrilus eugeniae, lampito mauritii, eisenia fetida and perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. while actinomycetes (streptomyces albus, s. somaliensis, nocardia asteroides, n. caviae and saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (amoeba proteus, a. terricola, paramecium trichium, euglena viridis, e.  orientalis, vorticella picta and trichomonas hominis) and yeast (candida tropicalis, c. krusei c. albicans and cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. certain species of fungi (saksenae vasiformis, mucor plumbeus, cladosporium carrionii, c. herbacium, alternaria sp., cunninghamella echinulata,  mycetia sterila, syncephalostrum racemosum, curvalaria lunata, c. geniculata and  geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterium antitratum,  mima polymorpha, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. rettgeri, escherichia coli, staphylococus citreus, bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococci and micrococci) were completely digested. certain other species were not digested fungi like aspergillus fumigatus, a. flavus, a. ochraceous, trichoderma koningii (except by eeugeniae), fusarium moniliforme (except by e. eugeniae) and rhizopus sp., and bacteria like klebsiella pneumoniae and morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. the microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in  the casts.

TI  == screening for anti-infective properties of several medicinal plants of the mauritians flora.
AB  == several plants of the mauritian flora alleged to possess anti-infective properties were studied against different strains of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. the grounded dried plant materials were extracted with different extractants and screened for anti-microbial activity using the disk diffusion and the micro-dilution techniques. preliminary screening revealed that the methanol extracts were most active. salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter cloacae and bacillus subtilis were the three test organisms, which were found to be susceptible to all the crude methanolic extracts of the different plants investigated (100% susceptibility), followed by escherichia coli (57.1%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (57.1%), and staphylococcus aureus (28.6%). the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration recorded for the different crude methanol extracts against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis and the mould fungus candida albicans were 500, 1000, 125, 250, 1000 and 125 micro g/ml, respectively. bioautography using cladosporium cucumerinum revealed that dichloromethane (dcm) extracts had the highest activity against the phytopathogenic fungus. it was also noted that the dcm extracts of michelia champaca and antidesma madagascariense yielded the maximum number of growth inhibiting compounds against cladosporium cucumerinum. activity of the different crude extracts was also investigated against several phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, colletotrichum glocosporoides, rhizoctonia solani, sclerotinia sclerotium, guignardia sp. and fusarium oxysporum. it was found that crude hexane extracts as well as crude dcm extracts exhibited marked activity against several strains of fungi, especially colletotrichum glocosporoides, sclerotinia sclerotium and guignardia sp.

TI  == nature of bacteria found on some wards in sultan qaboos university hospital, oman.
AB  == this study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. one hundred swab specimens collected from children's  toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of cinnamon oil and cinnamaldehyde from the chinese medicinal herb cinnamomum cassia blume.
AB  == both cinnamomum verum j.s. presl. and cinnamomum cassia blume are collectively called cortex cinnamonmi for their medicinal cinnamon bark. cinnamomum verum is more popular elsewhere in the world, whereas c. cassia is a well known traditional chinese medicine. an analysis of hydro-distilled chinese cinnamon oil and pure cinnamaldehyde by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that cinnamaldehyde is the major component comprising 85% in the essential oil and the purity of cinnamaldehyde in use is high (> 98%). both oil and pure cinnamaldehyde of c. cassia were equally effective in inhibiting the growth of various isolates  of bacteria including gram-positive (1 isolate, staphylococcus aureus), and gram-negative (7 isolates, e. coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus and samonella typhymurium), and fungi including yeasts (four species of candida, c. albicans, c. tropicalis, c. glabrata, and c. krusei), filamentous molds (4 isolates, three  aspergillus spp. and one fusarium sp.) and dermatophytes (three isolates, microsporum gypseum, trichophyton rubrum and t. mentagraphytes). their minimum inhibition concentrations (mic) as determined by agar dilution method varied only slightly. the mics of both oil and cinnamaldehyde for bacteria ranged from 75 microg/ml to 600 microg/ml, for yeasts from 100 microg/ml to 450 microg/ml, for filamentous fungi from 75 microg/ml to 150 microg/ml, and for dermatophytes from  18.8 microg/ml to 37.5 microg/ml. the antimicrobial effectiveness of c. cassia oil and its major constituent is comparable and almost equivalent, which suggests that the broad-spectrum antibiotic activities of c. cassia oil are due to cinnamaldehyde. the relationship between structure and function of the main components of cinnamon oil is also discussed.

TI  == pharmacodynamic modeling of imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam for empiric therapy of skin and soft tissue infections: a report from the optama program.
AB  == background: the bactericidal exposures necessary for positive clinical outcomes among skin and soft tissue infections are largely dependent on interpatient pharmacokinetic variability and pathogen drug susceptibility. by simulating the probability of achieving target bactericidal exposures, the pharmacodynamics of three beta-lactam agents were compared against a range of pathogens implicated commonly in complicated skin and soft tissue infections. methods: using monte carlo simulation, pharmacodynamic target attainment expressed as the percentage of the time interval during which the antibiotic concentration exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration (%t > mic) in serum and blister fluid was calculated for 5,000 simulated patients receiving imipenem-cilastatin 0.5 g q8h,  meropenem 0.5 g q8h, piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g q6h, and piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g q8h. the pharmacokinetics for each antibiotic were  derived from previously published healthy volunteer studies. the mics for staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter sp., klebsiella sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci, proteus sp., beta-hemolytic streptococci, and serratia sp. were taken from the mystic 2003 surveillance study and weighted by the prevalence of each pathogen among 1,404 isolates collected from skin and soft tissue infections during the 2000 sentry study. the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was added into the model at increasing resistance rates. results: imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g q6h achieved  greater than 90% likelihood of achieving bactericidal exposure in serum and blister fluid until the prevalence of mrsa increased beyond 10%. piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g q8h achieved a lower probability of achieving bactericidal exposure than the other regimens (88.7%, p < 0.001). conclusions: when the incidence of mrsa is low, imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g q6h would be optimal choices for the empiric treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections among the regimens studied. when mrsa is suspected, a drug that retains activity against this pathogen should be considered.

TI  == differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == [development and evaluation of a pcr method for diagnosis of salmonella enteric fever, based on dna sequences of the hila gene].
AB  == typically, diagnosis of enteric fever due to salmonella spp. is by bacterial isolation from blood culture; however, the blood culture method is slow, not always available, and not informative in patients with antibiotic treatment. salmonella spp. uses the hila gene (component of the pathogenicity island i) to invade epithelial cells and produce infection. using the hila gene sequence a pcr test was designed to detect salmonella in blood samples. the sensitivity (s), specificity (sp), positive predictive value (ppv) and negative predictive value (npv) of the pcr method were obtained by testing the blood samples from 34 patients with suspected of enteric fever. presence of s. typhi was confirmed by blood culture. blood samples were also tested from 35 patients with infections due to other non-salmonella pathogens, again corroborated by blood culture (klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; serratia marcescens, 5; escherichia coli, 4; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; providencia alcalifaciens, 4; enterobacter cloacae, 4). control samples were obtained from 150 healthy volunteers. the s, sp, ppv and npv for the pcr method were all 100%. the lowest number of colony forming units/ml detected by pcr in blood samples was 10.

TI  == pcr method based on the ogdh gene for the detection of salmonella spp. from chicken meat samples.
AB  == in a previous paper, the ogdh gene that encodes 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase was  isolated from salmonella typhimurium. the catalytic n-terminal region in the enzyme was found to be very specific for the salmonella species. therefore, the aim of the present study was to detect s. typhimurium in food sources using primers designed for ogdh-1 and ogdh-2 which were based on the salmonella-specific region of the ogdh gene. a simple polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection method was developed to detect low numbers of s. typhimurium in a chicken meat microbial consortium. using the ogdh-specific primers under stringent amplification conditions and for gene probe analysis, fewer than 100 colony-forming units (cfus) were detectable when pure cultures were employed. when the pcr assay was run on s. typhimurium-contaminated meat contents, only the positive meat samples containing as few as 200 cfus reacted to the assay. the method employed for sample processing is simple and it was determined to provide  a sensitive means of detecting trace amounts of s. typhimurium-specific sequences in the presence of mixed meat microbial populations. when compared with six representative intestinal gram-negative bacterial strains in foods, including vibrio parahaemolyticus, v. vulnificus, enterobacter cloacae, e. coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus sp., s. typhimurium had a unique and distinct pcr product (796 bp). in conclusion, the two ogdh primers were found to be rapid  and sensitive detectors of salmonella spp for the pcr method.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == microbial diversity and prevalence of virulent pathogens in biofilms developed in a water reclamation system.
AB  == bacterial biofilm is a common phenomenon in both natural and engineered systems which often becomes a source of contamination and microbially influenced corrosion. it is thought that formation of biofilm in the monoculture of several  bacterial species is regulated by acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) quorum-sensing signals. in this study, we investigated the microbial diversity and existence of  ahl-producing and ahl-degrading bacterial species in the biofilm samples from a water reclamation system located in a tropical environment. 16s ribosomal dna sequencing analysis indicated the presence of at least 11 bacterial species, including the frequently encountered bacterial pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, and several rare pathogens. we showed that only two groups of isolates, belonging to p. aeruginosa and enterobacter agglomerans, produced ahl signals. we also found that three bacterial isolates, i.e., agrobacterium tumefaciens xj01, bacillus cereus xj08, and ralstonia sp. xj12, expressed ahl degradation enzymes. furthermore, we showed that p. aeruginosa isolate hl43 was virulent against animal model caenorhabditis elegans and released 2-6-fold more pyocyanin cytotoxin than p. aeruginosa strains pa01 and pa14, the two commonly used laboratory strains. these data indicate the complexity and importance of biofilm research in water reclamation.

TI  == multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  == multiple organ failure (mof) is the main cause of death in icus, especially affecting septic patients. it is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. the prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. the objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital icu related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of mof, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. the mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. the main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. a retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the icu in a 4 month period during 1999. fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by accs/sccm criteria. there were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency  patients). apache ii score was calculated on admission and mof, measured for the  first five days, was diagnosed using marshall and meakins criteria. the statistical method used was non-parametric mann-whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. the incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). none of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%),  died. there were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. the most frequent bacteria found were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant acinetobacter baumanii (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), enterobacter aerogenes (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (2). the mean  value +/- sd of apache ii (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). we conclude that mof due to sepsis in an icu is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high apache ii.

AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

AB  == a compost mixture amended with soybean oil was enriched in microorganisms that transformed unsaturated fatty acids (ufas). when oleic acid or 10-ketostearic acid was the selective fatty acid, sphingobacterium thalpophilum (nrrl b-23206, nrrl b-23208, nrrl b-23209, nrrl b-23210, nrrl b-23211, nrrl b-23212), acinetobacter spp. (nrrl b-23207, nrrl b-23213), and enterobacter cloacae (nrrl b-23264, nrrl b-23265, nrrl b-23266) represented isolates that produced either hydroxystearic acid, ketostearic acid, or incomplete decarboxylations. when ricinoleic (12-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic) acid was the selective ufa, enterobacter cloacae (nrrl b-23257, nrrl b-23267) and escherichia sp. (nrrl b-23259) produced  12-c and 14-c homologous compounds, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (nrrl b-23256, nrrl b-23260) converted ricinoleate to a trihydroxyoctadecenoate product. also, various enterobacter, pseudomonas, and serratia spp. appeared to decarboxylate linoleate substrate incompletely. these saprophytic, compost bacteria were aerobic or facultative anaerobic gram-negative and decomposed ufas through decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and hydroperoxidation mechanisms.

TI  == teicoplanin in the prevention of infection in total hip replacement.
AB  == perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis has been shown to be effective in reducing postoperative wound infections. the rising incidence of infections secondary to methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus. s. epidermidis and s. enterococcal prompted us to administer teicoplanin to infection in elective total joint arthroplasty. in 111 patients teicoplanin was given in a single intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg prior to surgery. in the postoperative period no deep infection  of the prosthetic device was found in a 14-month follow-up. in two patients the following organisms were isolated from superficial infections of the wound: s. epidermidis (methicillin-sensitive), pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter sp. in no patient was revision surgery necessary. the serum concentration of teicoplanin was within the therapeutic range during surgery, and tissue levels of teicoplanin in cancellous (6.2 mg/kg, range 3.8-10.9 mg/kg) and cortical (7.1 mg/kg, range 2.6-12.1 mg/kg) bone during surgery in 16 patients exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration of 90% (mic90) of methicillin-resistant strains  reported for methicillin-resistant strains. in our experience a single dose regimen of teicoplanin is a safe and effective method of antibiotic prophylaxis in hip joint replacement, particularly when methicillin-resistant bacteria are present.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  == of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by escherichia coli (e coli), followed by proteus mirabilis (p mirabilis), klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. of e coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-r), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (amc). for p mirabilis, ampi-r isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to amc. klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to amc. in these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. in the other enterobacteria (enterobacter  cloacae, morganella morganii, p vulgaris, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and amc) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of p vulgaris to amc. enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and p aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. for staphylococcus aureus,  the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. all the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.

TI  == cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  == topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. the anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have  been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. the present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. the pathogens used were branhamella catarrhalis, enterobacter sp., haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. the bacteria  studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. these topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical  anesthetics when culturing specimens. this is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. this type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. a modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.

TI  == bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (united states and canada, 1997).
AB  == the sentry program was established in january 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the united states (30 sites), canada (8 sites), south america (10 sites), and europe  (24 sites). during the first 6-month study period (january to june 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (bsi) were reported by north american sentry participants (4,119 from the united states and 939 from canada). in both the united states and canada, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common bsi isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10  most frequently reported species in both the united states and canada. although the rank orders of pathogens in the united states and canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several  pathogens. overall, u.s. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from canada. the differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant s. aureus  isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for u.s. and canadian  isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (meca, vana, and vanb) in the canadian microbial population. among u.s. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to  penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost  every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.

TI  == [the role of meropenem in bacterial meningitis].
AB  == meropenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic of with an antibacterian spectrum similar to that of imipenem, but from which it may mainly be differentiated by the possibility of its administration at high doses and it has no demonstrated proconvulsive effect, properties which make it applicable in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. the clinical and experimental experience in the treatment of bacterial meningitis with this antibiotic is herein reviewed. it has been observed that the efficacy and safety of meropenem in meningitis caused by n. meningitidis, h. influenzae and pneumococci sensitive to penicillin may be similar to that of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone in both the pediatric and adult population. there are very few reports on the treatment of meningitis caused by pneumococci resistant to penicillin. however, given that the activity of meropenem on these pneumococci is similar to that of cefotaxime and that the doses administered are much lower, it does not appear to be recommendable in the  treatment of this indication, although it should be tested in all meningeal strain to these characteristics isolated. it may currently be considered that the main indication of meropenem in the infections of the central nervous system is in nosocomial meningitis by multiresistant gram negative bacilli such as those of the klebsiella-serratia-enterobacter and acinetobacter sp. group. therefore a limited, albeit favorable, report on the clinical experience with meropenem is herein presented. meropenem may also be useful in the treatment of meningitis by  pseudomonas aeruginosa in which other treatments have failed.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of cefepime compared to other broad-spectrum  cephalosporins against clinical isolates from eighteen brazilian hospitals by using the etest.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefepime was compared to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime in a multicenter study involving 10 clinical microbiology laboratories and clinical isolates from 18 brazilian hospitals from  7 cities (4 states). a total of 982 isolates consecutively collected between december 1995 and march 1996 were susceptibility tested by using etest and following the nccls procedures for agar diffusion tests. the cefepime spectrum was broader than that of the other broad-spectrum cephalosporins against both gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci. cefepime was particularly more active against enterobacter sp. (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), serratia sp. (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml) and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 3 micrograms/ml). against pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefepime (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) was slightly more active than ceftazidime (mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and 8- to 16-fold more active than ceftriaxone of cefotaxime (mic90, > 256 micrograms/ml). our results show that nosocomial bacteria, especially gram-negative rods, have a high rate of cephalosporin resistance in brazil. however, part of these resistant bacteria remains susceptible to cefepime. the etest was shown to be an excellent method for multicenter studies of the in vitro evaluation of new antimicrobial agents.

TI  == [evaluation of in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against 569 gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == objective: evaluation of the in vitro activity of new fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems against gram-negative bacteria. material and method: a total of 569 clinical isolates were obtained from inpatients at sao paulo hospital--unifesp/epm in june and july of 1992. the species distribution was as follows: enterobacter sp. (62), escherichia coli (308), klebsiella pneumoniae (27), klebsiella sp. (9), proteus mirabilis (23), pseudomonas aeruginosa (88), pseudomonas sp. (4), serratia sp. (30) and other gram-negatives  (7). susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution. the antimicrobials agents tested were: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, du 6859-alpha, ceftazidime, cefepime, fk 037, imipenem, meropenem  and biapenem. results: du 6859-alpha showed the highest anti-microbial activity among the fluoroquinolones. it was two- to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against some species. the potency and antimicrobial spectrum were similar between the fourth-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae,  except for enterobacter sp. strains which were more susceptible to cefepime than  they were to cefetazidime or fk 037. when testing pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftazidime was slightly more active than the other cephalosporins. against enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, meropenem was more active  than imipenem or biapenem. in addition, the percentage of strains, susceptible to meropenem was higher than the percentage susceptible to the other cerbapenems against these species. conclusion: the new antimicrobial agents demonstrated in vitro activity higher than that of agents commercially available. however, more studies are necessary to further evaluate the in vivo activity and the clinical benefit of these compounds.

AB  == background: the new cephalosporins with heterocyclic positively charged substituent at position c3 belong to the 4th generation cephalosporins. it is not evident, whereas these antibiotics are effective against cefotaxime-ceftazidime-resistant bacteria. we investigated the efficiency of the  cefepime (maxipime, bms) against acinetobacter sp., x. maltophilia, pseudomonas sp., flavobacterium sp., sphingobacterium sp. and against strains with production of esbl (extended spectrum beta-lactamases) (enterobacter sp., citrobacter sp., klebsiella sp.). methods and results: we determined the susceptibility of the 54  strains resistant to 50 mg/l and more of ceftazidime. the majority of the strains (35) are susceptible to cefepime and mic is the range 1.65-3.15 mg/l of cefepime. 17 strains have mic = 6.25 mg/l. two strains (one strain p. aeruginosa a one strain k. pneumoniae) were resistant to cefepime and mic = 12.5 mg/l. the activity of beta-lactamases was determined by quantitative macroiodometric method in one strain of p. cepacia and two strains of sphingobacterium multivorum. they  hydrolyse actively imipenem (they produce metallo-beta-lactamase) and ceftazidime (they are highly resistant to this antibiotic), but cefepime is more slowly hydrolysed than ceftazidime. conclusions: at the present time cefepime is effective against ceftazidime-resistant strains in so-called "problematic" species of bacteria. however, it is important to protect its efficiency in the future, this requires its rational use.

TI  == role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the design of dosage schedules for 12-h cefotaxime alone and in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  == pharmacodynamic principles have provided important tools to evaluate and compare  antimicrobial agents, and well as to guide dosing. for beta-lactams, time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) has surfaced as the most important factor. however, the area under the inhibitory serum concentration time-curve (auic) may be superior when appropriate dosing intervals are selected. although the target time over the mic is unclear in humans even when concentrations remain continuously above the mic, a higher auic predicts better clinical outcome up to  a maximum. this article provides a pharmacodynamic assessment of 1- and 2-g doses of cefotaxime every 12 h. auic24 values and published mic values for common pathogens (grouped into four groups based on mic90) were used to predict organisms suitable for treatment with every-12-h regimes. cefotaxime was inadequate for group 4 organisms including: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acienetobacter sp., and enterococcus sp. organisms such as enterobacter cloacae,  serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and b. fragilis may be suboptimally treated with cefotaxime every 12 h. cefotaxime in doses of 1-2 g every 12 h should be useful in patients with normal renal function infected with organisms having mics < 0.5 microgram/ml. this regimen should obtain auic24 values > 125 and ensure adequate time above the mic. in patients with impaired renal function, because of a longer half-life and higher area under the curve, pathogens with mic values in the 0.5-2 micrograms/ml range may be treated with cefotaxime every 12 h while maintaining auics > 125. data are also presented for cefotaxime 2 g every 8 h alone and in combination with ofloxacin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a prospective study of postoperative wound infection was carried out over a 12-month period. intra-operative swabs from the patients' anterior nares, the opened viscus and parietes were cultured using standard bacteriological techniques. of the 1770 wounds studied, 167 (9.4%) became infected. wound infection rates, according to clinical wound types, were clean 5.9%, clean-contaminated 10.7%, contaminated 24.3% and dirty 52.9%. the figures according to microbiological wound types were clean 4.7%, and potentially, lightly and heavily contaminated 15.3%, 22.1% and 30.2% respectively. the commonest causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus 23.7%, escherichia coli  16.9%, staphylococcus epidermidis 13.5% and pseudomonas aeruginosa 13.0%. when isolated intra-operatively, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., klebsiella spp. and  p. aeruginosa appeared to have a high probability of causing postoperative wound  infection, but the intra-operative isolation of bacteroides sp. was a poor predictor of subsequent wound infection.

TI  == aminoglycosides versus beta-lactams in gram-negative pneumonia.
AB  == newer beta-lactam antibiotics with high levels of activity against gram-negative  aerobic bacilli (including pseudomonas aeruginosa) such as cefoperazone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and aztreonam may be suitable for monotherapy of gram-negative pneumonia. aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin are also highly active against these same organisms and have been more extensively used, but are both ototoxic and nephrotoxic. key therapeutic questions are whether beta-lactams can safely replace aminoglycosides for the treatment of gram-negative pneumonia, and whether monotherapy or aminoglycoside and beta-lactam combination antibiotic treatment is superior. there is remarkably little definitive clinical data in the literature to answer these questions, but  available studies suggest that beta-lactam monotherapy may be adequate for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonias, but that combination therapy may be preferred for pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia sp, enterobacter sp, and acinetobacter sp, largely based on rates of bacterial persistence and emergence of resistance. at this time, there are more data available to support aminoglycoside monotherapy than beta-lactam monotherapy in gram-negative pneumonia and remarkably little data to suggest superiority of two antibiotics over single agents when they have been compared prospectively. thus, combination  therapy remains a conservative recommendation until better studies are available.

AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

AB  == cefpodoxime proxetil (ru 51807) is an enterally absorbed ester prodrug which is rapidly cleaved in vivo after oral administration, with release of the active free acid metabolite cefpodoxime. the in vitro antibacterial activity of the sodium salt of cefpodoxime (ru 51746) against approximately 800 clinical isolates was evaluated comparatively with other orally active beta-lactams. ru 51746 was found to be active against enterobacteria normally susceptible to third generation cephalosporins, with mic50 values ranging from 0.02 mg/l (providencia  sp) to 5 mg/l (c. freundii). ru 51746 was also active against h. influenzae, including beta-lactamase producing strains (mic50 0.04 mg/l), oxa-s s. aureus (2,5), beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.05) and s. pneumoniae (0.002). oxa-r staphylococci and p. aeruginosa were resistant to ru 51746 (mic50 greater than 40 mg/l for both organisms). the antibacterial activity of ru 51746 was bactericidal in nature and independent from test conditions. the molecule was stable to all the beta-lactamases studied, with the exception of cefuroximase (type ic). ru 51746 exhibited no strong inhibitory effects on these enzymes, except with enterobacter p99 (type ia). a good correlation was found between in vivo activity of ru 51807 and in vitro activity of ru 51746. cefpodoxime proxetil was found to  be more effective than cefaclor in mice with experimental septicemia caused by various streptococci, with a dp50 ratio in the 10-100 range. this advantage was again evidenced for septicemias due to various enterobacteria. in contrast, cefaclor proved more effective in experimental staphylococcus infections. in mice with experimental pneumonia, cefpodoxime proxetil caused sharp falls in k. pneumoniae lung counts. six days after induction of the infection, 60% of animals under cefpodoxime proxetil had sterile lungs, versus 25% of animals under amoxicillin.

TI  == a randomized prospective study of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with or without teicoplanin as an empiric antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients.
AB  == febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a hickman line-associated infection. at 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol  violation or death due to other causes. a total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. the diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (34), hodgkin's disease  (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), escherichia coli (13), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), klebsiella sp. (3), enterobacter cloacae (2), streptococcus faecalis (2), ent. adenocarboxylata (1), clostridium septicum (1). strept. b (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and p. fluorescens (1), in-vitro testing showed that all  gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. there were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), strep. sangius (1), strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and p. maltophilia (1). both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. there is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. in view of the very high incidence of gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that  teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in  all febrile neutropenic patients.

(10 episodes), salmonella sp. (seven episodes), enterobacter sp. (six episodes), proteus sp. (four episodes), serratia sp. (four episodes), haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), klebsiella sp. (three episodes), staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and morganella morganii (two episodes). overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). five organisms persisted: acinetobacter sp. (two patients), p. aeruginosa (one patient), enterobacter sp. (one patient), and serratia sp. (one patient). side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). superinfecting organisms and sites  were as follows: enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). ciprofloxacin administered either  intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.

AB  == clinical and bacteriological data of 145 inpatients with septicemia, treated at the hospital of chiba university school of medicine from 1972 to 1987, were reviewed by dividing them into three stages. (stages i: 1972-76, stage ii: 1978-82, stage iii: 1983-87) patients with underlying diseases have been increasing: 91.8% of the total patients in stage iii. among the patients with underlying diseases, malignant and hematological diseases occupied about 60%, and in the other diseases, congenital heart diseases have been increasing in number.  as to the organisms isolated, gram positive bacteria have increased, while gram negative bacteria have decreased. in stage iii, the rate of gram positive organisms and gram negative ones accounted for 43.1% and 41.2% of all the isolates from the septic patients with malignant & hematological diseases, respectively. in patients with malignant & hematological diseases, alpha-streptococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and fusobacterium sp. have been increasing, whereas, escherichia coli, enterobacter sp., klebsiella sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa decreasing. in patients with other underlying diseases, s. aureus, cns, and non fermenters have been increasing. among the patients without underlying diseases, gram positive bacteria accounted for the major part. the decrease of gram negative organisms in patients with malignant and hematological diseases may partially depend on the introduction of polymixin  b as the drug of gut decontamination. the outcome of septicemia in the patients with malignant & hematological diseases has been markedly improving through all the three stages. during stage iii, episode mortality and case mortality rate proved to be 23% and 31%, respectively. the introduction of the third generation  cephems has decreased the mortality rate for gram negative organisms and contributed to the improvement of the total prognosis. the prognosis was worst in the case of p. aeruginosa, showing a mortality rate of 50% during stage iii. coincidence rate of blood and other cultures have been largest in the case of p.  aeruginosa, so, the drug sensitivity of the strain cultured from other sites is sometimes useful in the choice of antibiotics.

TI  == product of the lactococcus lactis gene required for malolactic fermentation is homologous to a family of positive regulators.
AB  == malolactic fermentation is a secondary fermentation that many lactic acid bacteria can carry out when l-malate is present in the medium. the activation of  the malolactic system in lactococcus lactis is mediated by a locus we call mler.  induction of the genes necessary to perform malolactic fermentation occurs only in bacteria with a functional copy of mler. the mler gene consists of one open reading frame capable of coding for a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 33,813 daltons. the amino acid sequence of the predicted mler gene product is homologous to that of positive activators in gram-negative bacteria: lysr, ilvy gene products of escherichia coli, metr, cysb of salmonella typhimurium, ampr of  enterobacter cloacae, nodd of rhizobium sp., and trpi of pseudomonas aeruginosa.

(92.31%). of the 9 bacterial species more frequently isolated totaling 1108 (82%) of the 1230 test isolates, disk susceptibility was 99% (e. coli), 93% (pseudomonas aeruginosas), 87% (staphylococcus aureus), 100% (klebsiella pneumoniae), 98% (klebsiella sp), 97% (proteus mirabiles), 94% (enterobacter sp), 100% (streptococcus faecalis) with good mic correlation (up to 8 mcg/ml) and 100% for the anaerobic species bacteroides sp (mic up to 4 micrograms/ml). "in vitro"  efficacy to hospital pathogens with high frequency of resistance to most antibiotics as pseudomonas aeruginosa and to anaerobes notably bacteroides sp is  emphasized.

TI  == ceftazidime and cefotaxime--the clinician's choice.
AB  == a review of two third-generation cephalosporins, ceftazidime and cefotaxime, is presented. ceftazidime, often used as a single agent, has shown greater activity  than cefotaxime against pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species, enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter sp, and enterobacter sp. it has been effective  as monotherapy in the treatment of peritonitis, gynecologic infections, chronic bronchitis, and infections in patients with leukemia and granulocytopenia, as has cefotaxime when in combination with an aminoglycoside. cefotaxime has shown good  activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli and against staphylococcus. it has been used in respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and septicemia. in contrast to first-generation and most second-generation cephalosporins, third-generation cephalosporins have proven useful in some types  of meningitis. ceftazidime and cefotaxime successfully penetrate into the cerebrospinal fluid and cures of bacterial meningitis have been reported with both drugs. both ceftazidime and cefotaxime have been successfully used in children, infants, and neonates, as well as adults. safety profiles of ceftazidime compare favorably with those of other third-generation cephalosporins.

AB  == inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (lps) synthesis in pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (kdo) caused accumulation  of a lipid a precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid a of mature lps. the enzyme ctp:cmp-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (cmp-kdo synthetase) from p. aeruginosa is inhibited by the  kdo analog alpha-c-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-d-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (i), and i is effectively delivered to p. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (i) which then inhibits activation of kdo by cmp-kdo synthetase causing accumulation of lipid a precursor and subsequent growth stasis. the major lipid a precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, c12:o, 2oh-c12:o and 3oh-c10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3oh-c12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (m - h)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid a from p. aeruginosa. in contrast, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, citrobacter sp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid a precursors which only contained 3-oh-c14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. this difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid a are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == microbiology of the female genital tract.
AB  == patients who contract genital tract infections are predominantly young, are otherwise healthy, and generally respond well to treatment for bacterial infections. these infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. with treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent;  however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. among the aerobic gram-positive organisms,  several varieties of streptococci such as group b streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen.  among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is escherichia coli. klebsiella sp. and proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are peptostreptococci and peptococci. clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are bacteroides bivius and bacteroides disiens. bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. other organisms encountered are chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.

AB  == during six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. all the specimens investigated were taken from patients of  surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. in total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like staphylococus aureus, straphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. out of the enterobacteriaceae escherichia coli and klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive proteus species. the over all isolation rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. in the last time pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional streptococcus faecium and  corynebacterium jk. dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like  bacteroides sp., peptococcus- and peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in  the infectious diseases. the epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. from there preventive measures must be induced.

TI  == microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  == the charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. all patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. the most common organisms cultured were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10  patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, enterobacter, 16  cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. the classic isolates, escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. to determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and s. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. the spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically  ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those  with acute peritonitis. despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.

AB  == o-demethyl-fortimicin-a-sulfate (odmf) is a semisynthetic derivative of fortimicin-a with increased in vitro activity especially against pseudomonas aeruginosa. this study was designed to determine the efficacy of odmf in the treatment of uti and to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of bacteria isolated from the urine of patients to odmf as compared to tobramycin (to), gentamicin (ge) and amikacin (ak). in 28 hospitalized patients with acute uti, odmf (free base) in a dose of 2 to 5 mg/kg was administered during 7 to 14 days. every 2 days and at least 5 times during therapy, odmf serum levels were determined (peak and trough levels) for dosage adjustment. urine cultures were performed on day 0  and between days 2 and 4, and susceptibility of the organisms was determined. patients were monitored for oto and nephrotoxicity. the treatment was successful  in 53.5% of patients. 35.5% of patients relapsed due to severe underlying disease. odmf was discontinued or given in reduced dosages in 10.7% of cases because of an increase in serum creatinine during therapy. among the 37 significant strains recovered from urine, there were 54% e. coli, 10.8% enterobacter sp., 10.8% proteus sp., and 10.8% pseudomonas sp. resistance to odmf was demonstrated in only 5.8% of strains, against 14.7% for ge and 11.7% for to.  susceptibility of the strains was very similar for odmf and ak. on the whole, clinical and bacteriological results were satisfactory and did not differ from those usually obtained with aminoglycosides in the treatment of uti due to gram negative bacilli.

TI  == in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  == ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. of all strains tested, only three (1 acinetobacter sp. and 2 pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin  resistant. ciprofloxacin was more active against escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, acinetobacter sp., proteus sp., shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. it was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa. it was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. it was as active as cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. the minimal  inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc's). ciprofloxacin's mic was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced  by anaerobic conditions. decrease of the medium ph increased the mic substantially. ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. these favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.

TI  == cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. in a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. the data were unsuitable for  determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. all strains of streptococcus equi, streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of actinobacillus  suis were highly susceptible to the drug (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (mic 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of corynebacterium (rhodococcus) equi, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be  highly resistant to cefadroxil (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml).

AB  == the membrane filter (mf) method for detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a green metallic sheen when the filter is incubated on modified endo medium at 35 degrees c for 22 h. large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (spc) technique, can interfere with the detection of  coliforms on mf. this paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific spc bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on mf. pseudomonas aeruginosa and aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3,000 and 220 per filter, respectively. the flavobacterium sp. and bacillus sp. selected for this study from spc did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. excessive crowding of e. coli and enterobacter cloacae colonies on mf also caused a reduction in the number of colonies that produced sheen. even when  there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the e. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified endo medium.

TI  == inhibitory and bactericidal activities of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the activity of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound, against 147 strains of microorganisms was studied and was compared with the activities of cinoxacin, trimethoprim, amikacin, and four beta-lactam antimicrobials. the minimal concentration at which 90% of strains were inhibited by amifloxacin was lowest for escherichia coli and klebsiella sp (less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml), followed by proteus sp (less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml),  enterobacter sp and citrobacter sp (less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml), providencia sp (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia sp, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus var anitratus (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). when compared with the ranges of activity of seven  reference antimicrobials, the range of amifloxacin activity was lowest for p aeruginosa, citrobacter sp, proteus sp, and a calcoaceticus var anitratus and similar to aztreonam's activity against enterobacter sp. for amikacin-resistant p aeruginosa, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of amifloxacin ranged from 1 to 16 micrograms/ml. the mics and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of amifloxacin were similar. for all strains tested, microbial susceptibilities to amifloxacin were greater than those to currently available oral antimicrobial drugs, such as cinoxacin and trimethoprim.

TI  == multicenter clinical trials of cefoperazone in japan.
AB  == the safety and clinical efficacy of cefoperazone were evaluated at 149 institutions in japan. a total of 979 hospitalized patients were treated with cefoperazone alone for 1,059 infections. in the 984 infections evaluated, there was an overall satisfactory clinical response in 824 (83.7%). cefoperazone was effective in 83.0% of the respiratory tract infections, 84.9% of urinary tract infections, and 89.6% of hepatobiliary tract infections. clinical response was satisfactory in 90% or more of the cases in which escherichia coli, serratia sp,  haemophilus influenzae or staphylococcus sp were isolated. sixty percent to 90% of the infections with klebsiella sp, enterobacter sp, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa responded satisfactorily to cefoperazone. cefoperazone was effective in 76.2% of 260 evaluated cases that had failed to respond to prior treatment with other cephalosporins. the adverse reactions that occurred in 19 (1.9%) of the 979 patients included rash (1%), diarrhea (0.6%), and fever (0.4%). cefoperazone appears to be extremely useful in the treatment of various infections in hospitalized patients.

TI  == urinary tract infection and drug-resistant bacteria in different patient populations.
AB  == a 1-year survey of the pathogens causing urinary tract infections was conducted in three institutions: a rehabilitation hospital, a general hospital and outpatient clinics. gram-negative rods accounted for 96% of the infections. in the general hospital and the outpatient clinics, escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen, while proteus sp. were most prevalent in the rehabilitation hospital. the frequency of drug-resistant isolates was significantly higher in the rehabilitation hospital than in the general hospital and the outpatient clinics. this was most conspicuous in the use of the beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides and sulfonamides against such organisms as e. coli, klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp. and proteus sp. urinary e. coli were more sensitive to antimicrobial drugs than were other urinary pathogens. pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were highly resistant to most antibiotics. about half of the isolates were resistant to gentamicin and another half to carbenicillin. in some instances the frequency of drug-resistant isolates was higher in the general hospital than  in the outpatient clinics, reflecting the greater usage of antimicrobials in the  general hospital.

AB  == in a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (bennett ma-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (apha guidelines) dilutions. the paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (p less than 0.001). seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. the direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) cfu/ml. high densities of organisms frequently  were found. sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. the contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas maltophilia, and flavobacterium meningosepticum. fermenters were klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and enterobacter agglomerans. infrequently, gram-positive streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were noted.

TI  == 6-acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. ii. antibacterial properties.
AB  == the beta-lactamase inhibitor ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli. when used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. some synergy between ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of pseudomonas aeruginosa. ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against bacteroides fragilis. in keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus sp. but not against those with enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and e. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type i or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type tem.

TI  == reliability of early identifications obtained with enterobacteriaceae-plus biochemical cards in the automicrobic system.
AB  == the automicrobic system (ams) is capable of identifying most enterobacteriaceae within 8 h and many glucose-nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli after 13 h of incubation. early preliminary results can be readily obtained from the computer as the tests incubate. data with 1,023 bacterial isolates were reviewed to determine the relative accuracy of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 13-h identifications. all automicrobic system identifications with probability (p) values of less than 0.80 were considered equivocal responses which needed supplementary tests before a final report could be issued. analysis of our data suggests that early identifications of morganella morganii, acinetobacter sp., yersinia spp., salmonella spp. (other than salmonella typhi), shigella spp. (other than shigella sonnei), enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas spp. (other than pseudomonas aeruginosa or pseudomonas maltophilia), klebsiella spp. (other than klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca), citrobacter amalonauticus, serratia liquefaciens, or vibrio spp. should be considered nonspecific responses, even when p greater than or equal to 0.80. other identifications reported after 4 h were 96% accurate. at least half of our isolates (60% of our enterobacteriaceae)  could be identified reliably within 4 h, the remaining isolates required longer incubation.

AB  == the frequency with which various bacteria are isolated from samples of hospitalized patients and the occurrence of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents in these bacteria are described. data were collected and summarized by an electronic data processing system. sensitivity data were obtained with the disc diffusion test carried out by the bauer/kirby method. e. coli and s. aureus were  the most frequently isolated organisms. pseudomonas sp. (in 90% pseud. aeruginosa) took second place behind e. coli among gramnegative rod bacteria. as  a rule more than 50% of grampositive and gramnegative bacteria were sensitive to  betalactam antibiotics and broad spectrum agents. aminocyclitols were the most potent drugs. strains resistant to netilmicin or amikacin were only exceptionally observed. a comparison of the occurrence of sensitive bacteria from 1975 to 1980  revealed that with rare exceptions no decrease of sensitivity to standard drug occurred in e. coli, the klebsiella-enterobacter-serratia group, pseudo. aeruginosa and s. aureus.

AB  == in the medical centre of the university of bratislava the period between 1975 and 1976 was studied with regard to a rather limited use of gentamicin (gen) which was then followed by a period of excessive administration thereof due to a change in the availability of the antibiotic. as a consequence, gen-resistant (genr) pseudomonas appeared in two medical wards, which resistance however, was non-transmissible. a few month later, however, transfer of genr was demonstrated  as a co-transfer with other types of resistance. for the first time in 1979 strains of p. aeruginosa transferring genr directly appeared as rather individual, dispersed strains. later in 1979, clustered outbreaks of hospital infections caused by genr entrobacter sp. transferring genr appeared as single as well as mixed infections. interspecies transfer from p. aeruginosa to enterobacteriaceae, and vice versa, was demonstrated in vitro. identity or close  similarity of enzyme patterns inactivating aminoglycoside antibiotics in p. aeruginosa and enterobacter suggest that genes for genr could be transposed from  p. aeruginosa under the massive selective pressure of gen.

AB  == a knowledge of the growth rates of various organisms at the storage temperature of 4 c in the different suspending media used for red blood cells would aid the extension of the thawed storage time of frozen-reconstituted blood beyond the 24  hours allowed by the food and drug administration. knowing these rates, a prediction could be made that the growth rate would be sufficiently slow and the  unit (sterile or minimally contaminated) could be given safely after a longer storage period. the studies reported show that the pathogenic organisms s. aureus, ps. aeruginosa, e. coli, klebsiella sp. and enterobacter sp. grow at such a slow rate at 4 c that they do not represent any great hazard to the recipient unless introduced in great numbers. the studies further show that in the process  of washing frozen blood the number of organisms is reduced by between one and two orders of magnitude (base 10). therefore, extension of frozen red blood cell storage life to at least 72 hours should be considered.

TI  == electrical impedance measurements in the reading and monitoring of broth dilution susceptibility tests.
AB  == electrical impedance changes in the medium were studied during traditional broth  dilution tests. tests involved clinical isolates of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter sp., klebsiella, and  enterococcus and ten antibiotics. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values from overnight visual readings were compared with mic values determined from electrical impedance end points, using inocula of 10(6) organisms per ml. ninety-three percent of the results were within one twofold dilution of each other. when the impedance end point was determined at 6 h, this correlation was lowered to 34%. by increasing the initial electrical impedance inoculum 10-fold,  the correlation between the 6-h impedance mic and the overnight visual mic was improved to 74%. ampicillin, tetracycline, and polymyxin e results accounted for  most discrepancies. continuous monitoring of impedance changes suggested that better correspondence could be obtained by adjusting the end point criteria for the 6-h impedance mic with different antibiotics. electrical impedance methods for reading bacterial end points in automated clinical laboratory instruments appear promising.

TI  == comparison of activity of sisomicin and gentamicin in mouse protection tests with gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the efficacy of sisomicin and gentamicin was compared in mouse protection studies against strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. there was no  significant difference in mortality of the mice in any of the protocol groups when five different dosages of sisomicin and gentamicin given by three separate schedules were compared for each bacterial inoculum in each antibiotic protocol.  the mean protective dose values of sisomicin were at least one-half those of gentamicin for each protocol against pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == comparative activity in vitro of ticarcillin, bl-p1654, and carbenicillin.
AB  == the activity of ticarcillin, bl-p1654, and carbenicillin was compared in vitro using a microtiter tube dilution test in mueller-hinton broth against 50 recent clinical isolates each of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, enterobacter species, proteus species, and  pseudomonas aeruginosa. bactericidal end points were determined using a modified  steers replicator. ticarcillin was generally two to four times more active against all organisms tested except s. epidermidis against which bl-p1654 was most active. median minimum inhibitory concentrations in micrograms per milliliter were for s. aureus: ticarcillin (6.2), carbenicillin (12.5), bl-p1654  (25); for s. epidermidis: bl-p1654 (1.6), ticarcillin (3.2), carbenicillin (3.2); for e. coli: ticarcillin (3.2), bl-p1654 (6.2), carbenicillin (6.2); for klebsiella sp.: >100 for all three drugs; for enterobacter sp.: ticarcillin (3.2), carbenicillin (6.2), bl-p1654 (12.5); for proteus sp.: ticarcillin (1.6),  carbenicillin (1.6), bl-p1654 (3.2); for p. aeruginosa: ticarcillin (31), bl-p1654 (62), carbenicillin (125). bactericidal end points were dependent on both the drug and the species but were in general no more than twofold more than  the minimum inhibitory concentration with the exception of bl-p1654 against p. aeruginosa. bl-p1654 was bactericidal for only 60% of the strains tested at a concentration of 500 mug/ml.

TI  == susceptibilities of gram-negative bacteria to combinations of antimicrobial agents in vitro.
AB  == combinations of either clindamycin or erythromycin with gentamicin, colimycin, or carbenicillin were studied for their antimicrobial effects on clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. no antagonistic effects of the antibiotic combinations were observed. synergistic effects of the antibiotic  combinations were noted against most strains of e. coli tested, especially when either clindamycin or erythromycin was combined with gentamicin or colimycin. of  16 other combinations of antibiotics examined with strains of e. coli as the test organisms, only the combination of penicillin g with either gentamicin or colimycin showed consistent synergy. the marked synergy of clindamycin combined with either gentamicin or colimycin was further demonstrated by following the kinetics of the bactericidal action of the antibiotic combinations and the effects on bacterial protein synthesis.

TI  == cinoxacin: in vitro antibacterial studies of a new synthetic organic acid.
AB  == cinoxacin (compound 64716) is a synthetic organic acid with antibacterial activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli. minimal inhibitory concentrations of cinoxacin (agar-dilution method) were determined for 419 strains. escherichia coli was the most susceptible group of organisms. the majority of klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp., proteus sp., and serratia marcescens were inhibited by 8 mug of cinoxacin per ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa and all gram-positive isolates tested were resistant to 64 mug or less of cinoxacin per ml. zones of inhibition using a 30-mug disk correlated well with agar-dilution minimal inhibitory concentrations (r = -0.9). cinoxacin was bactericidal when tested with inocula of 5 x 10(6) organisms per ml. resistance to cinoxacin was readily developed in all three strains tested by serial passage  on drug-containing agar. the in vitro properties of this agent were similar to those of nalidixic acid.

TI  == [a bacteriological study of otitis in dogs (author's transl)].
AB  == bacteriological examination of 100 cases of otitis in dogs revealed pure cultures of different microorganisms as follows: staphylococcus aureus from 25 animals; escherichia coli from 10; proteus mirabilis from 20; enterobacter sp. from 18 and klepsiella sp. from 7. mixed cultures of proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klepsiella sp. were found in 3 animals; staphylococcus aureus and  enterobacter sp. in 5; staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis in 4. enterobacter sp. and klepsiella sp. in 2 and staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli in 6. theses results indicated that staphylococcus aureus appeared as the most frequent microorganism (36%) followed by proteus mirabilis (23%) and klepsiella sp. (16%). drug resistance studies showed that all tested strains were resistant to the antibiotics and to the nalidixic acid in levels higher than 20microgram/ml except gentamycin which showed for pseudomonas  aeruginosa a resistance level for 10microgram/ml.

TI  == degradation of uric acid by certain aerobic bacteria.
AB  == we have isolated and identified nine cultures of aerobic bacteria capable of growing on an elective medium containing uric acid as the only source of carbon,  nitrogen, and energy. four of these cultures were identified as aerobacter aerogenes, two as klebsiella pneumoniae, and the remainder as serratia killiensis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus species. another culture identified as p. fluorescens required both glucose and uric acid for growth. when 23 laboratory stock cultures were inoculated into the uric acid medium, a. aerogenes, b. subtilis, mycobacterium phlei, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens were able to grow. these five cultures also grew when the uric acid was replaced  with adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, or allantoin, but growth was poor. in all of these media, including the uric acid medium, addition of glucose along  with the nitrogenous compounds yielded good growth. induction experiments demonstrated that the ability of a. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, s. kiliensis, s. marcescens, b. subtilis, and bacillus sp. to degrade uric acid is an induced property. of these organisms, only bacillus sp. accumulated a small amount of intracellular uric acid.

TI  == enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (ph 6.0 to 8.2). this effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. the urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting e. coli and k. pneumoniae even when diluted  up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same ph as the urine. undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable  of inhibiting these organisms. the range of ph (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

TI  == pseudomonas pyocyanea and the arginine dihydrolase system.
AB  == non-pigmented strains of pseudomonas pyocyanea occur frequently and this organism has only limited activity in conventional biochemical tests; 50 strains were tested for the presence of arginine dihydrolase and found positive whereas only salmonella sp. and enterobacter sp. among other gram-negative species were positive. the test for arginine dihydrolase is rapid and simple and suitable for  routine use.
