TI  == enterobacter xiangfangensis sp. nov., isolated from chinese traditional sourdough, and reclassification of enterobacter sacchari zhu et al. 2013 as kosakonia sacchari comb. nov.
AB  == a gram-stain-negative bacterial strain, 10-17(t), was isolated from traditional sourdough in heilongjiang province, china. the bacterium was characterized by a polyphasic approach, including 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, rna polymerase beta subunit (rpob) gene sequence analysis, dna gyrase (gyrb) gene sequence analysis, initiation translation factor 2 (infb) gene sequence analysis, atp synthase beta subunit (atpd) gene sequence analysis, fatty acid methyl ester analysis, determination of dna g+c content, dna-dna hybridization and an analysis of phenotypic features. strain 10-17(t) was phylogenetically related to enterobacter hormaechei cip 103441(t), enterobacter cancerogenus lmg 2693(t), enterobacter asburiae jcm 6051(t), enterobacter mori lmg 25706(t), enterobacter ludwigii en-119(t) and leclercia adecarboxylata lmg 2803(t), having 99.5%, 99.3%, 98.7%, 98.5%, 98.4% and 98.4% 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, respectively. on the basis of polyphasic characterization data obtained in the present study, a novel species, enterobacter xiangfangensis sp. nov., is proposed and the type strain is 10-17(t) ( = lmg 27195(t) = ncimb 14836(t) = ccug 62994(t)). enterobacter sacchari zhu et al. 2013 was reclassified as kosakonia sacchari comb. nov. on the basis of 16s rrna, rpob, gyrb, infb and atpd gene sequence analysis and the type strain is strain sp1(t)( = cgmcc 1.12102(t) = lmg 26783(t)).

TI  == enterobacter mori sp. nov., associated with bacterial wilt on morus alba l.
AB  == two isolates of mulberry-pathogenic bacteria isolated from diseased mulberry roots were investigated in a polyphasic taxonomic study. comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis combined with rpob gene sequence analysis allocated strains r18-2(t) and r3-3 to the genus enterobacter, with enterobacter asburiae,  e. amnigenus, e. cancerogenus, e. cloacae subsp. cloacae, e. cloacae subsp. dissolvens and e. nimipressuralis as their closest relatives. cells of the isolates were gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic rods, 0.3-1.0 microm wide and 0.8-2.0 microm long, with peritrichous flagella, showing a dna g+c content of 55.1 +/- 0.5 mol%. calculation of a similarity index based on phenotypic features and fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analysis suggested that these isolates are members of e. cancerogenus or e. asburiae or a closely related species. biochemical data revealed that the isolates could be differentiated from their nearest neighbours by the presence of lysine decarboxylase activity and their ability to utilize d-arabitol. dna-dna relatedness also distinguished the two isolates from phylogenetically closely related enterobacter strains. based on these data, it is proposed that the isolates represent a novel species of the genus enterobacter, named enterobacter mori sp. nov. the type strain is r18-2(t)  ( = cgmcc 1.10322(t) = lmg 25706(t)).

TI  == population genetics of the nomenspecies enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == the genetic heterogeneity of the nomenspecies enterobacter cloacae is well known. enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter cancerogenus, enterobacter dissolvens, enterobacter hormaechei, enterobacter kobei, and enterobacter nimipressuralis are closely related to it and are subsumed in the so-called e. cloacae complex. dna-dna hybridization studies performed previously identified at least five dna-relatedness groups of this complex. in order to analyze the genetic structure and the phylogenetic relationships between the clusters of the nomenspecies e. cloacae, 206 strains collected from 22 hospitals, a veterinarian, and an agricultural center in 11 countries plus all 13 type strains of the genus and reference strain cdc 1347-71(r) were examined with a combination of sequence and  pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) analyses of the three housekeeping genes hsp60, rpob, and hemb as well as ampc, the gene of a class c beta-lactamase. based on the neighbor-joining tree of the hsp60 sequences, 12 genetic clusters (i to xii) and an unstable sequence crowd (xiii) were identified. the robustness of the genetic clusters was confirmed by analyses of rpob and hemb sequences and ampc pcr-rflps. sequence crowd xiii split into two groups after rpob analysis. only three strains formed a cluster with the type strain of e. cloacae, indicating that the minority of isolates identified as e. cloacae truly belong to the species; 13% of strains grouped with other type strains of the genus, suggesting that the phenotypes of these species seem to be  more heterogeneous than so far believed. three clusters represented 70% of strains, but none of them included a type or reference strain. the genetic clustering presented in this study might serve as a framework for future studies  dealing with taxonomic, evolutionary, epidemiological, or pathogenetic characteristics of bacteria belonging to the e. cloacae complex.

TI  == chromosomal ampc genes in enterobacter species other than enterobacter cloacae, and ancestral association of the act-1 plasmid-encoded cephalosporinase to enterobacter asburiae.
AB  == the amplification and sequence of ampc genes in enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter cancerogenus, enterobacter dissolvens, enterobacter hormaechei and enterobacter intermedius bring the number of known cephalosporinase sequences from the genus enterobacter to seven. expression in escherichia coli of the ampc  genes from e. asburiae, e. hormaechei and e. intermedius established the functional nature of these genes. ampc from e. asburiae shows 96.5% identity to bla(act-1) encoding a plasmid-borne cephalosporinase previously believed to derive from enterobacter cloacae. the reassignment of act-1 ancestry to e. asburiae is confirmed by the 95.5% identity between ampr upstream of bla(act-1) and ampr from e. asburiae.

TI  == identification by 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing of an enterobacteriaceae species with ambiguous biochemical profile from a renal transplant recipient.
AB  == traditional ways of identification of bacteria by phenotypic characteristics cannot be used for non-cultivable organisms and organisms with unusual biochemical profiles. in this study, an enterobacteriaceae was isolated in pure growth from the mid-stream urine of a 67-year old renal transplant recipient with urinary tract infection. conventional biochemical tests did not reveal a pattern  resembling any known member of the enterobacteriaceae family. the vitek system (gni+) showed that it was 18% leclercia adecarboxylata and 55% klebsiella ozaenae; whereas the api system (20e) showed that it was 99.8% rahnella aquatilis. 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing showed that there was 7 base differences between the isolate and enterobacter cloacae, 18 base differences between the isolate and enterobacter asburiae, 17 base differences between the isolate and enterobacter cancerogenus, 35 base differences between the isolate and k. ozaenae, 27 base differences between the isolate and l. adecarboxylata, and 72 base differences between the isolate and r. aquatilis, indicating that the isolate most closely resembled a strain of e. cloacae. identification of the organism in this study is important, as the choice of antibiotics would be radically different. in this case, cephalosporins should be avoided regardless of in-vitro susceptibility as cephalosporins are well-known to select for ampc derepressed mutants in enterobacter, and previous administration of third-generation cephalosporins is more likely to be associated with multidrug resistant enterobacter isolates than is administration of antibiotics that do not include a third-generation cephalosporin.
