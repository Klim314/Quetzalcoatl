TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: whilst certain bacteria have long been known to secrete extracellular deoxyribonuclease (dnase), the purpose in microbial physiology was  unclear. recently, however, this enzyme has been demonstrated to confer enhanced  virulence, enabling bacteria to evade the host's immune defence of extruded dna/chromatin filaments, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). as nets have recently been identified in infected periodontal tissue, the aim of this study was to screen periodontal bacteria for extracellular dnase activity. material and methods: to determine whether dnase activity was membrane bound or secreted, 34 periodontal bacteria were cultured in broth and on agar plates. pelleted bacteria and supernatants from broth cultures were analysed for their ability to degrade dna, with relative activity levels determined using an agarose gel electrophoresis assay. following culture on dna-supplemented agar, expression was determined by the presence of a zone of hydrolysis and dnase activity related to colony size. results: twenty-seven bacteria, including red and orange complex  members porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum,  parvimonas micra, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus and prevotella nigrescens, were observed to express extracellular dnase activity. differences in dnase activity were noted, however,  when bacteria were assayed in different culture states. analysis of the activity  of secreted dnase from bacterial broth cultures confirmed their ability to degrade nets. conclusion: the present study demonstrates, for the first time, that dnase activity is a relatively common property of bacteria associated with advanced periodontal disease. further work is required to determine the importance of this bacterial dnase activity in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == [multiple complications of acute unilateral rhinosinusitis--a case report].
AB  == introduction: intracranial or orbital complications after chronic and acute rhinosinusitis are rare, but could be dangerous. the complications of acute rhinosinusitis more often are observed in young patients. the combination of both intracranial and orbital complications together is found after acute inflammation. material and methods: we present a case of a patient with primary developed orbital complication during acute rhinosinusitis followed by intracranial abscess during the same treatment period. results: one week after intravenous antibiotic therapy with good outcome we observed an aggravated inflammation process with osteitis of frontal bone and brain abscess formation. we performed an external approach for frontal sinus surgery combined with neurosurgical brain abscess evacuation. swabs taken during surgery were positive  for: streptococcus constellatus and parvimonas micra sensitive for penicillin and metronidazol. we observed a good recovery after two weeks of treatment. conclusions: we recommend performing a complementary ct of the sinus and ct of the brain with contrast when complications of acute rhinosinusitis are suspected. the coexistence of intracranial and orbital complications could be observed in younger patients mostly after acute sinusitis.

TI  == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.
