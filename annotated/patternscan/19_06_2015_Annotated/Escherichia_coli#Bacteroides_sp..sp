TI  == determining the role of a probiotic in the restoration of intestinal microbial balance by molecular and cultural techniques.
AB  == the human intestine has a vast variety of microorganisms, and their balance is dependent on several factors. antibiotics affect microfloral balance and allow naturally opportunistic organisms to multiply. azithromycin is the most widely used macrolide antibiotic, active against a wide number of pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. it is currently used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. the use of probiotics has advantages in gastrointestinal conditions, including infectious diarrhea and imbalance due to antibiotic use. in this research, the effect of azithromycin on the intestinal microbiota of sprague dawley rats and the role of lactobacillus acidophilus in the restoration of the balance by employing molecular and cultural techniques was investigated. pcr with universal primers targeting the v3 region of the 16s rrna  gene followed by dgge was used to characterize the overall intestinal microbiota  composition. cultivable fecal bacteria count using microbiological media and semi-quantitative pcr with group-specific primers were also utilized to analyze the effects of antibiotic and probiotic on microflora. we found that the total amount of 16s rrna gene and fecal aerobic bacterial count was reduced following azithromycin administration along with elimination of non-pathogenic escherichia  coli, but it was restored by the use of the probiotic. the results from pcr with  group-specific primers showed that bacteroides sp was present in the control and  probiotic groups, but it was nearly eliminated in the antibiotic group. moreover, semi-quantitative pcr revealed that the numbers of enterobacteriaceae were nearly the same in the probiotic group and decreased in the antibiotic group, while bifidobacterium was significantly increased in the probiotic group and decreased  in the antibiotic group (p < 0.05) as compared with that in the control group. azithromycin-induced dysbiosis can result in prolonged deleterious effects on the host. the present study revealed that the use of lactic acid bacteria particularly l. acidophilus helped to restore intestinal microfloral balance.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == gastrointestinal symptoms in travellers.
AB  == diarrhoea is probably the single most common medical complaint in returning travellers. the most common pathogens are entero-toxigenic escherichia coli, shigella, salmonella and campylobacter. viruses, toxigenic arcobacter and bacteroides fragilis, as well as parasites such as cryptosporidium sp, are increasingly recognised but are not tested for in most diagnostic laboratories. blood in stools is a sign of invasive disease and should trigger exclusion of invasive amoebic disease. the use of empiric antibiotics may shorten illness but  is complicated by the diversity of bacterial causes and emerging resistance.

TI  == isolation and characterization of novel multifunctional recombinant family 26 glycoside hydrolase from mehsani buffalo rumen metagenome.
AB  == rumen microbiota harbor diverse set of carbohydrate active enzymes (cazymes) which play crucial role in the degradation of complex plant polysaccharide thereby providing metabolic energy to the host animals. earlier we reported cazyme analysis from buffalo rumen metagenome by high throughput shotgun sequencing. among the various cazymes, glycoside hydrolase family 26 (gh26) enzymes have number of industrial applications including paper, oil, biofuel, food, feed, pharmaceutical, coffee and detergent industries. here, we report isolation and characterization of gh26 enzyme from buffalo rumen metagenome. a novel gh26 gene comprised of 1119 base pairs was successfully amplified using the gene specific primers inferred based on the contig generated from metagenome sequence assembly and cloned in pet32a (+) expression vector as n-terminal histidine tag fusion protein. a novel gh26 protein from unknown rumen microorganism shared a maximum of 68% identity with the prevotela ruminicola 23 encoded carbohydrate esterase family 7 and 46% with bacteroides sp. 2_1_33b encoded mannan endo-1, 4-beta-mannosidase. the recombinant gh26-histidine tag fusion protein was expressed in escherichia coli and purified using ni- nta affinity chromatography. the purified enzyme displayed multifunctional activities against various carbohydrate substrates including locust bean gum, beech wood xylan, pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose suggesting mannanase, xylanase, pectin  esterase and endoglucanase activities, respectively. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == bacterial community structure associated with elective cesarean section versus vaginal delivery in chinese newborns.
AB  == objectives: increasing attention is being paid to the potential for cesarean birth to influence the taxa of the bacteria that compose the infant intestinal microbiota. the present study characterized the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in newborn infants delivered vaginally (vd) or by cesarean section (cd). methods: a cross-sectional study was performed using fecal specimens collected on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life from 25 vd infants and 16 cd infants. profiles of the fecal microbiota were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing of the clones corresponding to the degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) bands. results: on days 2 and 4 of postnatal  life, vd and cd infants did not differ in the richness and evenness of the fecal  bacterial community; however, the taxa of the fecal microbiota were significantly different between the 2 groups. in vd infants, escherichia coli, bacteroides sp,  and bifidobacterium longum were the dominant microbes. in cd infants, staphylococcus sp, clostridium sp, enterobacter sp, and streptococcus sp were more common. conclusions: these results demonstrate that delivery method has a profound influence on the structure of the intestinal microbiota in chinese newborn infants. this is in accordance with data reported in other regions.

TI  == modulation of small intestinal homeostasis along with its microflora during acclimatization at simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  == at high altitude (ha) hypobaric hypoxic environment manifested several pathophysiological consequences of which gastrointestinal (gi) disorder are very  common phenomena. to explore the most possible clue behind this disorder intestinal flora, the major player of the gi functions, were subjected following  simulated hypobaric hypoxic treatment in model animal. for this, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kpa (approximately 4872.9 m) air pressure consecutively for 30 days for 8 h/day and its small intestinal microflora, their secreted digestive enzymes and stress induced marker protein were investigated of the luminal epithelia. it was observed that population density of total aerobes significantly decreased, but the quantity of total anaerobes and escherichia coli increased significantly after 30 days of hypoxic stress. the population density of strict anaerobes like bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and lactobacillus sp. and obligate anaerobes like clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus sp. were expanded along with their positive growth direction index (gdi). in relation to the huge multiplication of anaerobes the amount of gas formation as well as content of iga and igg increased in duration dependent manner. the activity of some luminal enzymes from microbial origin like a-amylase, gluco-amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated in hypoxic condition. besides, hypoxia induced in formation of malondialdehyde along with significant attenuation of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activity and lowered gsh/gssg pool in the intestinal epithelia. histological study revealed disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier with higher infiltration of lymphocytes in lamina propia and atrophic structure. it can be concluded that hypoxia at ha modified gi microbial imprint and subsequently causes epithelial barrier dysfunction which may relate to the small  intestinal dysfunction at ha.

TI  == causative pathogens, antibiotic sensitivity, resistance patterns, and severity in a contemporary series of fournier's gangrene.
AB  == objective: to identify the causative pathogens and evaluate the antibiotic sensitivity, resistance patterns, and virulence in a contemporary series of patients with fournier's gangrene. materials and methods: the medical records of  41 consecutive cases of fournier's gangrene were evaluated. the patient demographics, causative pathogens, antibiotic sensitivity, and resistance patterns were assessed. the fournier's gangrene severity index and length of stay were analyzed statistically to determine any differences by causative pathogen. results: a total of 122 pathogens were cultured. the wound cultures were polymicrobial for 34 patients (83%). most common pathogens cultured were bacteroides sp (43.9%), escherichia coli (36.6%), and prevotella sp (34.1%). e coli was resistant to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 13.3%, and 40% of isolates respectively. the wound cultures were monomicrobial for 7 patients (17.0%). a monomicrobial isolate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was cultured that was susceptible to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam was seen in providencia sp, klebsiella sp, e coli, and methicillin-resistant s aureus. resistance to ceftriaxone and gentamicin was seen in methicillin-resistant s aureus and e coli, respectively. no resistance to clindamycin was demonstrated. no statistically significant difference was detected between the fournier's gangrene severity index or length of stay and the causative pathogens. conclusion: fournier's gangrene remains a community-acquired polymicrobial infection, with anaerobic bacteria as the most common causative pathogens. candida and methicillin-resistant s aureus are emerging causative pathogens, but  methicillin-resistant s aureus remains sensitive to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. although resistance was demonstrated by some causative pathogens, together, the currently recommended broad-spectrum antibiotics adequately covered all pathogens. coverage with agents such as fluconazole, vancomycin, or piperacillin-tazobactam is indicated in patients at risk of fungal or hospital-acquired organisms.

TI  == [traveller's diarrhea: epidemiology, clinical practice guideline for the prevention and treatment].
AB  == bacterial causes are predominant: enterotoxigenic (etec) ou enteroadherent escherichia coli, salmonella sp., shigella sp., campylobacter jejuni, acrobacter  sp., enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis. prevention relies on the hand and food hygiene standards (heat-cooked meals). watery diarrhea (toxigenic enterocolitis)  is the most frequent clinical presentation associated with a risk of dehydration; the body temperature is normal except in cases of severe dehydration. less frequent are invasive enterocolitis presenting as acute febrile diarrhea with dysentery (abdominal cramps, tenesmus, stools blended with mucus and blood): salmonellosis, shigellosis. bacteremia may occur in immunocompromised patients. early rehydration is essential with oral rehydration solutions (ors) consisting of salt, sugar and water. antibiotics should be reserved for invasive enterocolitis with fever and dysentery, profuse diarrhea with more than three liquid stools within 12 hours. duration of antibiotherapy varies from 1 to 5 days.

TI  == in vitro analysis of the impact of enrofloxacin residues on the human intestinal  microbiota using h-nmr spectroscopy.
AB  == exposure of humans to antimicrobial residues in food-producing animals may alter  the intestinal microbiota which could result in a potential risk to human health. to determine the effect of enrofloxacin on the human intestinal microbiota, fecal suspensions (25%) were cultured in the presence of 0.06-5 microg/ml enrofloxacin. the bacterial community was analyzed by plating on selective culture media, pyrosequencing and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy. pyrosequencing  analysis of 16s rrna genes and viable counts on bacteroides sp., enterococcus sp., and bifidobacterium sp. selection medium indicated that there were no significant changes in the bacteria numbers at the selected enrofloxacin concentrations (0.06, 0.1, and 1 microg/ml) relative to the control samples after a 48 h incubation. nmr analysis showed remarkably similar spectra in cultures treated with 0.06, 0.1, and 1 microg/ml enrofloxacin, with some slight differences in peak heights. however, hierarchical clustering analysis indicated  significant differences in metabolite concentrations between the control and those samples treated with 1 microg/ml enrofloxacin. leucine, phenylalanine, proline, and 2-oxovalerate were positively correlated with the concentration of enrofloxacin. nmr analysis is a potentially useful tool to monitor changes of the human intestinal microbiota, in addition to traditional culture methods and pyrosequencing.

TI  == the inhibitory effect of polyphenols on human gut microbiota.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota (im) is responsible for metabolism of many compounds provided in the diet, such as polyphenols, increasing their bioavailability. however, there are remarkably few studies investigating the influence of polyphenols on the composition and activity of the gut microbial community. this  study evaluated the influence of the polyphenols naringenin (n), naringin (nr), hesperetin (h), hesperidin (hr), quercetin (q), rutin (qr), and catechin (cat) on the growth of human im representatives (bacteroides galacturonicus, lactobacillus sp., enterococcus caccae, bifidobacterium catenulatum, ruminococcus gauvreauii, escherichia coli). polyphenols were added to liquid medium at a final concentration of 20, 100 or 250 mug/ml (for q concentrations were 4, 20 or 50 mug/ml) and their impact on the im was assessed by measurement of the turbidity after 24-h culture. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) for polyphenols that inhibited bacteria was estimated. cat had no impact on the tested im. q had  the strongest impact on r. gauvreauii, b. galacturonicus and lactobacillus sp. (mic 20-50 mug/ml) growth, whilst its rutinoside had no impact. nr and hr had no  impact, but their aglycones n and h inhibited growth of almost all analyzed bacteria (mic >/=250 mug/ml). we conclude that flavonoid aglycones, but not their glycosides, may inhibit growth of some intestinal bacteria. this means that polyphenols probably can modulate the im and indirectly interfere with their own  bioavailability.

TI  == hubac and nifh source tracking markers display a relationship to land use but not rainfall.
AB  == identification of the source of fecal pollution is becoming a priority for states and territories in the u.s. in order to meet water quality standards and to develop and implement total maximum daily loads. the goal of this research was to relate microbial source tracking (mst) assay concentrations to land use and levels of impervious surfaces in order to gauge how increasing development is associated with human fecal contamination in inland watersheds. the concentrations of two proposed mst markers, targeting nifh of methanobrevibacter  smithii and hubac of bacteroides sp., were positively correlated with increasing  anthropogenic development and impervious surfaces. higher concentrations of these mst markers in more urbanized watersheds suggest that increasing development negatively affects water quality. neither mst marker concentration was correlated with antecedent rainfall levels, and detection of markers did not differ between  dry weather and rain events. water samples were also analyzed for norovirus and enterovirus, but these enteric viruses were rarely detected. these mst results differ from previous studies that have found correlations between traditional fecal indicator bacteria (fib) and antecedent rainfall. this difference suggests  that the mst markers used in this study may be more specific for recent, land-based contamination events as opposed to resuspension of particle-associated organisms in waterways. hubac was detected in 98% of samples, correlating with fecal coliform and escherichia coli concentrations. the ubiquity of the hubac marker in our samples suggests that this marker does not provide sufficiently different or additional information than fib, and it is likely this marker was amplifying non-human targets. the nifh marker was detected in 30% of samples. less than half of the nifh-positive samples contained levels of fecal coliforms or e. coli above regulatory thresholds, suggesting that nifh would be more useful when utilized simultaneously with fib than in a tiered monitoring strategy. the results of this research suggests that land use factors play an important role in characterizing and mitigating fecal contamination in watersheds.

TI  == green-lipped mussel extract (perna canaliculus) and glucosamine sulphate in patients with knee osteoarthritis: therapeutic efficacy and effects on gastrointestinal microbiota profiles.
AB  == objective: to investigate how changes in the gastrointestinal tract (git) microbiota profile may influence nutraceutical efficacy in osteoarthritis (oa) and allow the formulation of a hypothesis that explains in part the inconsistent  and contentious findings from oa clinical studies with green-lipped mussel (glm)  and glucosamine. methods: a non-blinded randomised clinical trial was conducted with 38 subjects diagnosed with knee oa. each participant received either 3,000 mg/day of a whole glm extract or 3,000 mg/day of glucosamine sulphate (gs), p.o.  for 12 weeks. faecal microbial analyses were carried out after collecting stools  at t (0) and t (12) weeks. additional pharmacometric measures were obtained from  changes in arthritic scores in the western ontario mcmaster universities arthritis index (womac) and the lequesne algofunctional indices and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (gsrs). an intention-to-treat analysis was  employed and participant data collected at t (0), t (6) and t (12) weeks. results: there were no statistically significant changes in bacterial growth patterns determined by the wilcoxon test. in both groups there was a trend towards a decrease in clostridium and staphylococcus species and increase in lactobacillus, streptococcus and eubacterium species. in the glm group bifidobacterium tended to increase and enterococcus and yeast species to decrease. the gs-treated group demonstrated a trend towards a decrease in bacteroides and an increase in yeasts and coliforms species, most notably escherichia coli. we further confirm significant improvement (p < 0.05) in all oa outcome measures from t (0) to t (12) weeks for both the glm and gs groups. the gsrs scores indicated that git function significantly improved over the 12 weeks  duration with glm and gs supplementation. conclusion: both glm and gs reduced oa  symptoms and non-significantly altered the gut microbiota profile from baseline.  changes in the microbiota profiles occurred in both treatment groups; the most notable being a reduction in the clostridia sp. this study suggests that nutritional supplements such as glm and gs may regulate some of the metabolic and immunological activities of the git microbiota. the decrease in clostridia, a potent modulator of colonic th17 and cd4+ regulatory t cells, was consistent with a decrease in inflammation; improved gsrs scores and oa symptoms for these oa participants. the git microbiota may be important factor in the first-pass metabolism of these nutraceuticals.

TI  == differential interleukin-10 (il-10) and il-23 production by human blood monocytes and dendritic cells in response to commensal enteric bacteria.
AB  == human peripheral blood contains antigen-presenting cells (apc), including dendritic cells (dc) and monocytes, that may encounter microbes that have translocated from the intestine to the periphery in disease states like hiv-1 infection and inflammatory bowel disease. we investigated the response of dc and  monocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) to a panel of representative commensal enteric bacteria, including escherichia coli, enterococcus sp., and bacteroides fragilis. all three bacteria induced significant upregulation of the maturation and activation markers cd40 and cd83 on myeloid dendritic cells (mdc) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdc). however, only mdc produced cytokines, including interleukin-10 (il-10), il-12p40/70, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), in response to bacterial stimulation. cytokine profiles in whole pbmc differed depending on the stimulating bacterial species: b. fragilis induced production of il-23, il-12p70, and il-10, whereas e. coli and enterococcus induced an il-10-predominant response. mdc and monocyte depletion experiments indicated that these cell types differentially produced il-10 and il-23 in response to e. coli and b. fragilis. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron did not induce levels of il-23 similar to those of b. fragilis,  suggesting that b. fragilis may have unique proinflammatory properties among bacteroides species. the addition of recombinant human il-10 to pbmc cultures stimulated with commensal bacteria abrogated the il-23 response, whereas blocking il-10 significantly enhanced il-23 production, suggesting that il-10 controls the levels of il-23 produced. these results indicate that blood mdc and monocytes respond differentially to innate stimulation with whole commensal bacteria and that il-10 may play a role in controlling the proinflammatory response to translocated microbes.

TI  == molecular-phylogenetic characterization of the microbiota in ulcerated and non-ulcerated regions in the patients with crohn's disease.
AB  == background: the dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been established in crohn's disease (cd), but the molecular characterization of this dysbiosis in chinese subjects with cd remains unclear. this study aims to investigate the predominant bacterial composition of the faecal and mucosal-associated microbiota in chinese cd patients using culture-independent techniques. methods/principal findings: eighteen patients with cd and 9 healthy controls were included in this  study. the faeces and the intestinal mucosal tissues from the ulcerated and nonulcerated sites were subjected to bacterial community fingerprinting using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the predominant bacterial composition in the faeces and mucosa was determined with dna sequencing and blast. we showed that the bacterial diversity in the faeces of cd patients was reduced compared with that in healthy controls (p<0.01). the faecal bacterial dysbiosis of the patients was characterized by an elevated abundance of gamma-proteobacteria (especially escherichia coli and shigella flexneri) and a reduced proportion of bacteroidetes and firmicutes. five bacterial species defined the microbiota imbalance of the ulcerated mucosa in cd, including an increase in escherichia coli, a decrease in faecalibacterium prausnitzii, lactobacillus coleohominis, bacteroides sp and streptococcus gallolyticus in the  bacterial community as compared with the nonulcerated (p<0.01). conclusions/significance: this is the first description of intestinal microbiota  dysbiosis in chinese cd patients. these results allow a better understanding of the faecal and mucosal microbiota in cd, showing a predominance of some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial bacterial species. the findings may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of cd in chinese population.

TI  == [analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy chinese women by using dna-fingerprinting].
AB  == objective: to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to chinese females. methods: women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in peking university first hospital from october 2009 to january 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the v3 region of 16s  rdna gene. pcr products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). featured bands on dgge were recovered, cloned and sequenced. alignment with known sequence was made by using blast on genbank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora  in different physiological states. results: (1) vaginal flora in healthy chinese  women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. common bacteria included: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. while l. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) vaginal  bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. common bacteria included: lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gallolyticus, veillonella sp., streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus anginosus, prevotella sp., anaerococcus lactolyticus and bacteroides fragilis. conclusion: based on the dgge analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in chinese healthy women at reproductive age are lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners,and lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus crispatus, escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., prevotella sp.,bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing veillonella sp. and anaerococcus lactolyticus. meanwhile lactobacillus iners was firstly found by dgge to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.

TI  == properties of boage2, a second n-acetyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase from bacteroides ovatus atcc 8483.
AB  == n-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase (age) catalyzes the reversible epimerization between n-acetyl-d-mannosamine (mannac) and n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac). bacteroides ovatus atcc 8483 shows 3 putative genes for age activity (bacova_00274, bacova_01795 and bacova_01816). the bacova_00274 gene encodes an age (boage1) with strong similarity to the age previously characterized in bacteroides fragilis. interestingly, the bacova_01816 gene (boage2) shares 57% identity with anabaena sp. ch1 age, but has an extra 27-amino acid tag sequence in the n-terminal. when cloned and expressed in escherichia coli rosetta (de3)plys, bacova_01816 was able to convert mannac into glcnac and vice versa. it was stable over a broad range of phs and its activity was enhanced by atp (20 mum). the incubation with atp stabilized its structure, raising its melting temperature by about 8 degrees c. in addition, the catalytic efficiency for mannac synthesis was higher than that for glcnac synthesis. these characteristics make boage2 a promising biocatalyst for sialic acid production using cheap glcnac as starting material. boage2 could be considered a renin-binding protein and its  interaction with renin was studied for the first time in a prokaryotic age. surprisingly, renin activated boage2, an effect which is contrary to that described for mammalian age and unrelated with the unique n-terminal tag, since a mutant without this tag was also activated by renin. when boage2 sequence was compared with other related (real and putative) age described in the databases, it was seen that age enzymes can be divided in 3 different groups. the relationship between these groups is also discussed.

TI  == contrasts in concentrations and loads of conventional and alternative indicators  of fecal contamination in coastal stormwater.
AB  == fecal contamination in stormwater is often complex. because conventional fecal indicator bacteria (fib) cannot be used to ascertain source of fecal contamination, alternative indicators are being explored to partition these sources. as they are assessed for future use, it is critical to compare alternative indicators to conventional fib under a range of stormwater delivery conditions. in this study, conventional fib and fecal bacteroides spp. were monitored throughout the duration of five storm events from coastal stormwater outfalls in dare county, north carolina, usa to characterize relationships among  fib concentrations, alternative fecal markers, and loading of contaminants. water samples were collected multiple times during each storm and analyzed for enterococcus sp. and escherichia coli using enzymatic tests and fecal bacteroides spp. by qpcr. both conventional fib and fecal bacteroides spp. concentrations in  stormwater were generally high and extremely variable over the course of the storm events. over the very short distances between sites, we observed statistically significant spatial and temporal variability, indicating that stormwater monitoring based on single grab-samples is inappropriate. loading of fib and fecal bacteroides spp. appeared to be affected differently by various hydrologic factors. specifically, spearman correlations between fecal bacteroides spp. and drainage area and antecedent rainfall were lower than those between conventional fib and these hydrologic factors. furthermore, the patterns of fecal bacteroides spp. concentrations generally increased over the duration of the storms, whereas e. coli and enterococcus sp. concentrations generally followed the patterns of the hydrograph, peaking early and tailing off. given the greater  source-specificity and limited persistence of fecal bacteroides spp. in oxygenated environments, differences in these patterns suggest multiple delivery  modes of fecal contamination (i.e. landscape scouring versus groundwater discharge).

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

AB  == microbial contaminants in stormwater runoff have the potential to negatively impact public health. stormwater runoff to coastal waters is increasing in amount and rate of discharge due to loss of vegetated landscape and increasing coastal development. however, the extent and nature of microbial contamination of stormwater runoff in north carolina (nc) has not been previously characterized. the aim of this study was to measure a range of fecal indicator bacteria (fib) and molecular markers at three coastal sites. e. coli and enterococcus sp. were measured in addition to molecular markers including bacteroides human-specific marker (hs) and fecal bacteroides spp. levels of fib in stormwater far exceeded recreational water quality guidelines, frequently by several orders of magnitude. high concentrations of fecal bacteroides spp. and the presence of hs indicated the presence of human fecal contamination in the stormwater runoff, but only during specific storms. examinations of levels of fecal contamination in stormwater over multiple seasons and a range of storm conditions will allow managers to consider appropriate design of effective mitigation strategies necessary to maintain and restore coastal water quality.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteroides host strain hb-73 used to detect sewage specific phages in hawaii.
AB  == previous studies have shown that escherichia coli and enterococci are unreliable  indicators of fecal contamination in hawaii because of their ability to multiply  in environmental soils. in this study, the method of detecting bacteroides phages as specific markers of sewage contamination in hawaii's recreational waters was evaluated because these sewage specific phages cannot multiply under environmental conditions. bacteroides hosts (gb-124, ga-17), were recovered from  sewage samples in europe and were reported to be effective in detecting phages from sewage samples obtained in certain geographical areas. however, gb-124 and ga-17 hosts were ineffective in detecting phages from sewage samples obtained in  hawaii. bacteroides host hb-73 was isolated from a sewage sample in hawaii, confirmed as a bacteroides sp. and shown to recover phages from multiple sources  of sewage produced in hawaii at high concentrations (5.2-7.3 x 10(5) pfu/100 ml). these bacteroides phages were considered as potential markers of sewage because they also survived for three days in fresh stream water and two days in marine water. water samples from hawaii's coastal swimming beaches and harbors, which were known to be contaminated with discharges from streams, were shown to contain moderate (20-187 cfu/100 ml) to elevated (173-816 cfu/100 ml) concentrations of enterococci. these same samples contained undetectable levels (<10 pfu/100 ml) of f+ coliphage and bacteroides phages and provided evidence to suggest that these enterococci may not necessarily be associated with the presence of raw sewage. these results support previous conclusions that discharges from streams are the major sources of enterococci in coastal waters of hawaii and the most likely source of these enterococci is from environmental soil rather than from sewage.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from mouse caecal samples and description of bacteroides sartorii sp. nov.
AB  == caecal samples from wild-type and tnf(deltaare) mice were cultured on selective media containing bile salts, amino acids or casein macro-peptides. twenty-two strains were isolated and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. twenty-one strains showed >98% similarity to known bacteria (blautia spp., clostridium innocuum, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus murinus, parabacteroides goldsteinii and shigella dysenteriae). one additional isolate, strain a-c2-0, was a new bacterium. the closest relatives were bacteroides massiliensis, bacteroides dorei and bacteroides vulgatus (< or = 94% similarity). strain a-c2-0 is a gram-negative rod that does not form spores and has a g + c content of dna of 41.5%. its major cellular fatty acid is c(15:0 anteiso), and its major respiratory quinone is mk-9. cells are aerotolerant but grow only under strict anoxic conditions. they are resistant to cefotaxime and tobramycin. when compared with related bacteroides spp., the new bacterium was positive for alpha-arabinosidase, negative for glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase and did not  metabolise galactose, glucose, fructose, mannose, raffinose and sucrose. strain a-c2-0 therefore merits recognition as a member of a novel species within the genus bacteroides, for which the name bacteroides sartorii is proposed. the type  strain is a-c2-0(t) (= dsm 21941(t) = ccug 57211(t)).

TI  == the effects of maturation on the colonic microflora in infancy and childhood.
AB  == the composition of colonic mircoflora and its changes with maturation have rarely been investigated in large samples. methods. we used conventional microbiological testing to analyse the colonic flora (kyberstatus, institut formicroecology, herborn, germany) of stool samples from 12 484 children with different intestinal and nonintestinal diagnoses. stool samples were analysed for total colony forming units (cfu) (per g stool) and the abundance of bifidobacteria, bacteroides sp., escherichia coli, enterococcus sp., and lactobacillus sp. with respect to age, gender. a subset of 1089 infants was analysed for monthly changes within the first year of life. results. total cfu and individual microbial species were highest during the first year of life, decreased within the first 2 years, and then stabilized for the remaining childhood. in infants, the total cfu rose until month 5, declined with weaning, and peaked at 9-10 months. significant effects of age, but not of gender, were found in bacteroides sp. and lactobacilli. however bacterioids sp. and lactobacilli increased with age, while enterococci and e. coli decreased, and bifidobacteria remained stable. conclusion. colonic microflora show both a bacteria-specific and general pattern of maturation which  is most profound within the first year.

TI  == rapid qpcr-based assay for fecal bacteroides spp. as a tool for assessing fecal contamination in recreational waters.
AB  == concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (fib; e.g. escherichia coli, and enterococcus sp.) can only be used in limited ways for determining the source of  fecal contamination in recreational waters because they cannot distinguish human  from non-human fecal contamination. several bacteroides spp. have been suggested  as potential alternative indicators. we have developed a rapid, culture-independent method for quantifying fecal bacteroides spp. using quantitative pcr (qpcr) targeting the 16s rrna gene. the assay specifically targets and quantifies the most common human bacteroides spp. the details of the  method are presented, including analyses of a wide range of fecal samples from different organisms. specificity and performance of the qpcr assay were also tested via a laboratory experiment where human sewage and gull guano were inoculated into a range of environmental water samples. concentrations of fecal bacteroides spp., total enterococcus sp., enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus were measured using qpcr, and total enterococcus sp. and e. coli were quantified by membrane filtration (mf). samples spiked with gull guano were highly concentrated with total enterococcus sp., e. coli, e. faecalis, and e. casseliflavus, demonstrating that these indicators are  prominent in animal feces. on the other hand, fecal bacteroides spp. concentrations were high in samples containing sewage and were relatively low in  samples spiked with gull guano. sensitivity and specificity results suggest that  the rapid fecal bacteroides spp. qpcr assay may be a useful tool to effectively predict the presence and concentration of human-specific fecal pollution.

TI  == multidrug resistance gene deficient (mdr1a-/-) mice have an altered caecal microbiota that precedes the onset of intestinal inflammation.
AB  == aim: to compare caecal microbiota from mdr1a(-/-) and wild type (fvb) mice to identify differences in the bacterial community that could influence the intestinal inflammation. methods and results: caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and fvb mice were evaluated at 12 and 25 weeks of age using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and quantitative real-time pcr. dgge fingerprints of fvb and mdr1a(-/-) mice (with no intestinal inflammation) at 12 weeks revealed differences in the presence of dna fragments identified as bacteroides fragilis,  b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus and an uncultured alphaproteobacterium. escherichia coli and acinetobacter sp. were only identified in dgge profiles of mdr1a(-/-) mice at 25 weeks (with severe intestinal inflammation), which also had a lower number of total bacteria in the caecum compared with fvb mice at same age. conclusions: differences found in the caecal microbiota of fvb and mdr1a(-/-) mice (12 weeks) suggest that the lack of abcb1 transporters in intestinal cells due to the disruption of the mdr1a gene might lead to changes in the caecal microbiota. the altered microbiota along with the genetic defect could contribute to the development of intestinal inflammation in mdr1a(-/-) mice. significance and impact of the study: differences in caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and fvb mice (12 weeks) suggest genotype specific colonization. the results provide evidence that abcb1 transporters may regulate host interactions with commensal bacteria. future work is needed to identify the mechanisms involved in this possible cross-talk between the host intestinal cells and microbiota.

TI  == effects of rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of pulverized petal of rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. however, the growth of bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. in liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. but the growth of e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. hydrolyzable tannins isolated from r. rugosa, rugosin d, and tellimagradin ii showed antibacterial activities against e. coli,  s. aureus, b. cereus, and salmonella sp., but little or no effect against bif. breve and l. salivarius. r. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. hydrolyzable tannins in r. rugosa, such as rugosin d and tellimagradin ii, must be active constituents.

TI  == characterization of bcta, a mating apparatus protein required for transfer of the bacteroides fragilis conjugal element btf-37.
AB  == we have previously described the identification of btf-37, an autonomously transferable chromosomal element isolated from bacteroides fragilis clinical isolate lv23. in this study, we determined that btf-37 harbors a 16kb conjugal transfer-encoding region that contains an almost identical copy of a previously identified bacteroides sp. conjugation-specific gene bcta. bcta has been shown to be required for conjugation in other bacteroides sp. strains, but no information  is available regarding its function. we now report strain distribution and gene expression profiles of bcta. the bcta gene was present in conjugative transposon-harboring b. fragilis strains, but not on a non-transferable b. fragilis plasmid. we also showed that recombinant bcta predominantly localized to the bacterial membrane, and that its n-terminal 32 amino acids were cleaved in an escherichia coli protein expression system, indicating the presence of a signal sequence. expression of bcta consistently increased ~3-fold upon pre-exposure of  conjugating b. fragilis lv23 to subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline. maximum expression occurred 60min post-tetracycline induction, which also coincided with the time at which highest conjugation frequencies were seen for strain lv23. based on localization, signal sequence and tetracycline inducibility, our results indicate that bcta is indeed an important member of the bacteroides conjugal apparatus, since its gene is regulated by conditions that specifically control conjugation.

TI  == antagonic effect of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide on the mortality of  mice acutely infected with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == sepsis, the leading cause of death in intensive care units, is associated with overproduction of nitric oxide (no) due to inducible no synthase (inos), responsible for some of the pathologic changes. aminoguanidine (ag) is a selective inos inhibitor with reported inconsistent actions in sepsis. to investigate the influence of inos, we studied models of acute bacterial sepsis using acute challenges with aerobic (escherichia coli) and anaerobic (bacteroides fragilis) bacteria in the presence of ag. six-week-old, 23 g, male and female balb/c and c57bl/6j mice, in equal proportions, were inoculated (ip) with bacteria in groups of 4 animals for each dose and each experiment in the absence  or presence of ag (50 mg/kg, ip, starting 24 h before challenge and daily until day 6) and serum nitrate was measured by chemiluminescence. both types of bacteria were lethal to mice, with an ld50 of 6 nephelometric units (u) for e. coli and 8 u for b. fragilis. nitrate production peaked on the second day after e. coli inoculation with 8 and 6 u (p < 0.05), but was absent after non-lethal lower doses. after challenge with b. fragilis this early peak occurred at all tested doses after 24 h, including non-lethal ones (p < 0.05). ag-treated mice challenged with e. coli presented higher survival (p < 0.05) and increased ld50.  ag-treated mice challenged with b. fragilis had lower ld50 and higher mortality.  control ag-treated animals presented no toxic effects. the opposite effect of inos blockade by ag in these models could be explained by restriction of oxygen for immune cells or an efficient action of no in anaerobic localized infections.  the antagonic role of no production observed in our bacterial models could explain the reported discrepancy of no action in sepsis.

TI  == effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. however, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. in this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-o-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like clostridium spp., bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. this indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. the bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.

TI  == multitiered approach using quantitative pcr to track sources of fecal pollution affecting santa monica bay, california.
AB  == the ubiquity of fecal indicator bacteria such as escherichia coli and enterococcus spp. in urban environments makes tracking of fecal contamination extremely challenging. a multitiered approach was used to assess sources of fecal pollution in ballona creek, an urban watershed that drains to the santa monica bay (smb) near los angeles, calif. a mass-based design at six main-stem sites and four major tributaries over a 6-h period was used (i) to assess the flux of enterococcus spp. and e. coli by using culture-based methods (tier 1); (ii) to assess levels of enterococcus spp. by using quantitative pcr and to detect and/or quantify additional markers of human fecal contamination, including a human-specific bacteroides sp. marker and enterovirus, using quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr (tier 2); and (iii) to assess the specific types of enterovirus genomes found via sequence analysis (tier 3). sources of fecal indicator bacteria were ubiquitous, and concentrations were high, throughout ballona creek, with no  single tributary dominating fecal inputs. the flux of enterococcus spp. and e. coli averaged 10(9) to 10(10) cells h(-1) and was as high at the head of the watershed as at the mouth prior to discharge into the smb. in addition, a signal  for the human-specific bacteroides marker was consistently detected: 86% of the samples taken over the extent during the study period tested positive. enteroviruses were quantifiable in 14 of 36 samples (39%), with the highest concentrations at the site furthest upstream (cochran). these results indicated the power of using multiple approaches to assess and quantify fecal contamination in freshwater conduits to high-use, high-priority recreational swimming areas.

TI  == trypanosoma cruzi: influence of predominant bacteria from indigenous digestive microbiota on experimental infection in mice.
AB  == to verify the influence of some predominant components from indigenous microbiota on systemic immunological responses during experimental chagas disease, germ-free nih swiss mice were mono-associated with escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides vulgatus or peptostreptococcus sp. and then infected with the y strain of trypanosoma cruzi. all the mono-associations predominantly induced a th1 type of specific immune response to the infection by t. cruzi. a direct correlation was observed between a higher survival rate and increased ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha production (p<0.05) in e. faecalis-, b. vulgatus-, and peptostreptococcus-associated mice. moreover, higher levels of anti-t. cruzi igg1 and anti-t. cruzi igg2a were also found in mono-associated animals after infection. on the other hand, with the exception of e. faecalis-associated mice,  mono-association induced a lower il-10 production after infection (p<0.05) when compared with germ-free animals. interestingly, spleen cell cultures from non-infected germ-free and mono-associated mice spontaneously produced higher levels (p<0.05) of il-10 than cultures from infected mono-associated mice, except again for e. faecalis-associated animals. in conclusion, the presence of the components of the indigenous microbiota skews the immune response towards production of inflammatory cytokines during experimental infection with t. cruzi  in gnotobiotic mice. however, the degree of increase in production of cytokines depends on each bacterial component.

TI  == new antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  == background: surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. methods: this paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition.  results: patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring  healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against mrsa, vre, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csssi) and intra-abdominal infections. oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for csssi due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.

(s. viridans and s. agalactiae) were the most common microorganisms isolated. neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis were not isolated by culture or detected by polymerase chain reaction. conclusions: in kenya, persistent toas are associated with endogenous flora similar to that normally found in the gastrointestinal tract.

(5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == isolation and characterization of clv25, a bacteroides fragilis chromosomal transfer factor resembling multiple bacteroides sp. mobilizable transposons.
AB  == horizontal dna transfer contributes significantly to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteroides fragilis. to further our understanding of dna transfer in b. fragilis, we isolated and characterized a new transfer factor, clv25. clv25 was isolated from b. fragilis lv25 by its capture on the nonmobilizable escherichia coli-bacteroides shuttle vector pgat400deltabglii. similar to other bacteroides sp. transfer factors, clv25 was mobilized in e. coli by the conjugative plasmid r751. using tn1000 mutagenesis and deletion analysis of clv25, two mobilization genes, bmga and bmgb, were identified, whose predicted proteins have similarity to dna relaxases and mobilization proteins, respectively. in particular, bmga and bmgb were homologous to moca and mocb, respectively, the two mobilization proteins of the b. fragilis mobilizable transposon tn4399. a cis-acting origin of transfer (orit) was localized to a 353-bp region that included nearly all of the intergenic region between bmgb and  orf22 and overlapped with the 3' end of orf22. this orit contained a putative nic site sequence but showed no significant similarity to the orit regions of other transfer factors, including tn4399. despite the lack of sequence similarity between the orits of clv25 and tn4399, a mutation in the clv25 putative dna relaxase, bmga, was partially complemented by tn4399. in addition to the functional cross-reaction with tn4399, a second distinguishing feature of clv25 is that predicted proteins have similarity to proteins encoded not only by tn4399 but by several bacteroides sp. transfer factors, including nbu1, nbu2, ctndot, tn4555, and tn5520.

AB  == we report the isolation and preliminary characterization of btf-37, a new 52-kb transfer factor isolated from bacteroides fragilis clinical isolate lv23. btf-37  was obtained by the capture of new dna in the nonmobilizable bacteroides-escherichia coli shuttle vector pgat400deltabglii using a functional  assay. btf-37 is self-transferable within and from bacteroides and also self-transfers in e. coli. partial dna sequencing, colony hybridization, and pcr  revealed the presence of tet element-specific sequences in btf-37. in addition, tn5520, a small mobilizable transposon that we described previously (g. vedantam, t. j. novicki, and d. w. hecht, j. bacteriol. 181:2564-2571, 1999), was also coisolated within btf-37. scanning and transmission electron microscopy of tet element-containing bacteroides spp. and btf-37-harboring bacteroides and e. coli  strains revealed the presence of pilus-like cell surface structures. these structures were visualized in bacteroides spp. only when btf-37 and tet element strains were induced with subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline and resembled those encoded by e. coli broad-host-range plasmids. we conclude that we have captured a new, self-transferable transfer factor from b. fragilis lv23 and  that this new factor encodes a tetracycline-inducible bacteroides sp. conjugation apparatus.

TI  == comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppgpp synthetases/hydrolases (the rel, rela and spot proteins).
AB  == in the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppgpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, rela and spot, whereas in the gram-positive model organism bacillus subtilis only one  enzyme named rel is responsible for this activity. rel and spot also possess (p)ppgpp hydrolase activity. blast searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. the construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. four groups could be distinguished: with the exception of neisseria and bordetella (beta subdivision), the rela and spot groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. two rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the bacillus/clostridium group were also identified. the spot proteins are related to the gram positive rel proteins. rela proteins carry substitutions in the hd domain (aravind and koonin, 1998, tibs 23: 469-472) responsible for ppgpp degradation. a theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous rela and spot genes is presented: after  gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spot and rela genes evolved from the duplicated genes. the distribution pattern of the paralogous rela and spot proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (gupta, 2000, fems microbiol. rev. 24: 367-402). this model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. however, two paralogous, closely related genes of porphyromonas gingivalis (cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the rela and spot proteins do not fit in this model. completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (treponema pallidum, chlamydia species, rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont buchnera sp. aps as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes  but they are present in the arabidopsis genome. in crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppgpp as crosslinking reagents and rna polymerase preparations of escherichia coli, binding of ppgpp to distinct regions at the c-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpob gene product) and/or at the n-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpoc gene product) was observed previously. rpob and rpoc sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppgpp binding regions.

AB  == background and aims: hepatolithiasis is prevalent in southeast asia and presents  a difficult management problem. acute repeated episodes of cholangitis are frequently manifested in patients with hepatolithiasis. without proper treatment, such infection can lead to liver abscess, secondary biliary cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and death from sepsis or hepatic failure. in addition to clearance  of the stones and relief of bile stasis either by surgery or by interventional radiologic manipulation, effective antimicrobial therapy also plays a crucial role in the treatment of patients with hepatolithiasis. the aim of this study is  to clarify the bacteriology in hepatolithiasis and to provide the information for an appropriate antimicrobial choice. methods: from july 1993 to june 1996, 150 patients with hepatolithiasis underwent surgical intervention. bile specimens were routinely obtained by syringe aspiration from common bile duct. the syringe  was immediately capped, and the bile was subsequently cultured for both aerobes and anaerobes. results: bacteria were present in the bile of all patients. the bacteria most frequently found were gram-negative bacteria such as klebsiella sp, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas sp, and the gram-positive enterococcus sp. bacteroides sp were the most frequently found anaerobes. conclusions: this study  demonstrated the close relationship between acute cholangitis in hepatolithiasis  and enteric bacteria and also displayed the detailed antibiotic sensitivity results. armed with this fruitful information, we believe the antibiotic treatment for acute cholangitis in hepatolithiasis should first aim at enteric bacteria and be adjusted later according to the results of bacteriologic cultures and clinical situation to achieve an effective microbial control.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of wound infection following spinal fusion in  children.
AB  == objective: to study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of wound infections following spinal fusion in children. methods: retrospective review of clinical and microbiological records. results: aspirates of pus from 18 infection sites showed bacterial growth. anaerobic bacteria only were recovered in 3 (17%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 3 (17%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 12 (67%). forty-two isolates were recovered: 18 anaerobes (1.0 isolates per specimen) and 24 aerobes (1.3 per specimen). the predominant anaerobes were bacteroides sp. (9 isolates, including 8 bacteroides fragilis group) and 5 peptostreptococcus sp. the predominant aerobes were escherichia coli (6) and proteus sp. (5). an increase in recovery of e. coli and b. fragilis was noted in children with bowel or bladder incontinence. conclusions: this study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobic bacteria in wound infections following spinal fusion in children.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

TI  == [trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  == presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (lgt) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. it is currently accepted that infections of the lgt are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. this means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. lactobacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with streptococcus (aerobe), streptococcus agalactiae and others like enterococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides sp., bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, pseudomonas, klebsiella, fusobacterium, escherichia coli. different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). they  are discussed in different sections. trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to chlamydia with excellent clinical results and  a good tolerance. it was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. new fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. the use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover  the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of surgical-site infection following spinal fusion.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of surgical-site infections (ssi) following spinal fusion was retrospectively studied. this was done by reviewing the clinical and microbiological records at the naval hospital in bethesda, md.,  from 1980 to 1992. aspirates of pus from 25 infection sites showed bacterial growth. aerobic bacteria only were recovered from 9 (36%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only were recovered from 4 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 12 (48%). sixty isolates were recovered: 38 aerobes  (1.5 isolates per specimen) and 22 anaerobes (0.9 isolate per specimen). the predominant aerobes were escherichia coli (n = 8) and proteus sp. (n = 7). the predominant anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis group (n = 9) and peptostreptococcus sp. (n = 6) isolates. an increase in recovery of e. coli and b. fragilis was noted in patients with bowel or bladder incontinence. this study  highlights the polymicrobial nature of ssi and the importance of anaerobic bacteria in ssi following spinal fusion.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == cloning of an ef-p homologue from bacteroides fragilis that increases b. fragilis glutamine synthetase activity in escherichia coli.
AB  == investigations of possible regulators of bacteroides fragilis glutamine synthetase (gs) activity were done in escherichia coli using a compatible dual-plasmid system. the b. fragilis glna gene, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions, was cloned onto the low copy number plasmid pacyc184 and expressed in the e. coli glna ntrb ntrc deletion strain, ymc11. gs activity was monitored following co-transformation with a b. fragilis genomic library carried on the compatible plasmid pecor251. a gene was cloned that caused a twofold increase in b. fragilis gs activity but did not affect the activity of the e. coli gs enzyme or the b. fragilis sucrase (scrl). deletion of the b. fragilis glna downstream region decreased basal levels of gs activity, but did not affect the ability of the cloned gene to increase the b. fragilis gs activity. reporter gene analysis, using the b. fragilis glna promoter region fused to the promoterless clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase gene, showed no increase in reporter gene activity. this demonstrated that the increase in gs  activity was not regulated at the transcriptional level, and that the cloned gene product was not affecting the copy number of the plasmid in trans. sequence data  indicated that the cloned gene had good amino acid identity to a range of elongation factor p (ef-p) proteins, the highest being to that of a synechocystis sp (48%), and the least to mycobacterium genitalium (27%). amino acid identity to the e. coli ef-p was intermediate (37%). a possible role for ef-p in enhancing translation of the b. fragilis glna mrna is proposed.

TI  == comparative rectal bacterial flora of four species of flying fox (pteropus sp.).
AB  == the rectal anaerobic and aerobic bacterial flora of four species of flying foxes  were determined and compared. four bacterial species were found in > or = 1 individual from each bat species at a significant (> or = 10%) level of the bacterial population: alpha-hemolytic streptococcus sp. (41 of 56 bats), enterococcus sp. (25/56), escherichia coli (21/ 56), and group d streptococcus sp., not enterococcus sp. (9/56). five other microbial species were also found in all four flying fox species, but at less significant percentages (found in at least one bat species, > or = 5% and < or = 10% of the recovered microbial population). these were nonhemolytic streptococcus sp. (30/56), yeast (26/56), corynebacterium sp. (25/56), staphylococcus sp. (25/56), and staphylococcus aureus (22/56). the majority of the species found were gram-positive, and only two obligate anaerobes, a lactobacillus and a bacteroides sp., were recovered from one bat.

TI  == microbiology of infected atopic dermatitis.
AB  == background: bacterial infections occur frequently in lesions of atopic dermatitis (ad). the objectives of the study were to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected ad. methods: a retrospective review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records and of data obtained  from patients with secondarily infected ad lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. results: bacterial growth was noted in 41 specimens. aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 15 patients (36%), anaerobic bacteria only in eight (20%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 18 (44%). seventy-two isolates were recovered (1.8 per specimen), 34 aerobic or facultative bacteria, 35 strict anaerobes, and three candida sp. the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (12 isolates), group a beta hemolytic streptococcus in five isolates, and escherichia coli in four. the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp. (13 isolates), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. in eight, and fusobacterium spp. in four isolates. single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (34%), seven of which were s. aureus. twenty-one of the organisms isolated from 16 patients (39%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. enteric gram-negative rods and bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on legs and buttocks. group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented prevotella, and porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the finger, scalp, face, and neck. conclusions: the polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected ad lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions are demonstrated.

TI  == development of techniques to genetically manipulate members of the genera cytophaga, flavobacterium, flexibacter, and sporocytophaga.
AB  == the bacteroides-cytophaga-flavobacterium branch of the eubacterial phylogenetic tree contains a diverse group of bacterial species. techniques for the genetic manipulation of bacteroides spp. are well developed (a. a. salyers, n. b. shoemaker, and e. p. guthrie, crit. rev. microbiol. 14:49-71, 1987). recently we  developed techniques to genetically manipulate the gliding bacterium cytophaga johnsonae (m. j. mcbride and m. j. kempf, j. bacteriol. 178:583-590, 1996). we now demonstrate that some of these techniques allow genetic manipulation of a number of environmentally or medically significant bacteria in this group. the bacteroides transposon tn4351 was introduced into cytophaga hutchinsonii, cytophaga succinicans, flavobacterium meningosepticum, flexibacter canadensis, flexibacter sp. strain fs1, and sporocytophaga myxococcoides by conjugation. tn4351 integrated itself into the host chromosomes and conferred erythromycin resistance. we isolated several auxotrophic mutants of flavobacterium meningosepticum following tn4351 mutagenesis. the c. johnsonae-escherichia coli shuttle vector pcp11 functioned in c. succinicans but not in the other bacteria.  plyl03 did not replicate in any of these bacteria and should function as a convenient suicide vector. the identification of a system of gene transfer, a selectable marker, a suicide vector, and a transposon that functions in these diverse bacteria allows genetic manipulations to be performed.

TI  == an open, multicenter clinical trial of piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of pediatric patients with intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == a total of 60 children with secondary peritonitis were enrolled in an open, non-comparative multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerance and  efficacy of parenteral piperacillin/tazobactam (80/10 mg/kg every 8 hours) in young children. the most common diagnosis was perforated appendicitis (90%) and the three most common pathogens, obtained from the peritoneal cavity, were escherichia coli (52 isolates), pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 isolates) and bacteroides sp. (19 isolates). patients were examined daily during therapy, 4-14  days and 4-6 weeks post-therapy. of the 60 patients, 43 were evaluable. the majority of patients had polymicrobial infections (36 patients). all the aerobic  isolates were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam while 19 were resistant to piperacillin alone. four of 43 clinically evaluable patients were considered a clinical failure and 3 of 40 bacteriologically evaluable patients were considered to have an unfavorable microbiological response. there were 2 clinically adverse  events considered related to the study drug and several possibly related, mild and transitory, abnormalities in eosinophil counts and liver function tests. based on the safety and efficacy results from this study, the advantages of using a single agent for the treatment of mixed infections of the peritoneal cavity and its potential activity against resistant organisms, we believe that further comparative clinical trials in children with intra-abdominal infections are warranted.

TI  == intrauterine bacterial findings and hormonal profiles in post-partum cows with normal puerperium.
AB  == the post-partum intrauterine bacterial flora, prostaglandin release, uterine involution and resumption of ovarian activity were studied in 9 swedish dairy cows during the first 8-week period. uterine involution was monitored by transrectal examinations of the reproductive tract 3 times weekly. bacteriological examination was performed from twice weekly uterine biopsies. the main pgf2 alpha metabolite (15-ketodihydro-pgf2 alpha) was monitored from twice daily blood plasma samples, while morning samples were used for progesterone determinations. the cows were assigned to 2 groups: group i (n = 7) with an uncomplicated puerperal period and group ii (n = 2) with signs of intrauterine infections. a total of 143 biopsies were collected, of which 129 (90.2%) were found to be bacteriologically negative. thirteen (9.1%) of the remaining 14 biopsies were bacteriologically positive, while one (0.7%) was probably a contamination on a single occasion. the 13 bacteriologically positive biopsies belonged to the group ii cows from which 31 isolates contained 6 different genera of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. actinomyces pyogenes along with bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium necrophorum were found to predominate in a mixed flora. the bacteria were rapidly eliminated and disappeared completely from the uteri towards the end of the third week post-partum. the average number of days required for completion of uterine involution was 21.8 +/- 3.0 for all animals. the plasma levels of the pgf2 alpha metabolite were significantly elevated for the first 12-18, and 18 and 27 days in group i and group ii, respectively. there was no significant relationship between the duration of pgf2  alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution (p > 0.05). progesterone analysis showed resumption of ovarian activity and subsequent ovulation in 4 of the 9 cows 44-55 days post-partum. thus, intrauterine infections are not commonly seen in cows with normal calving and comparison between the duration of pgf2 alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution showed insignificant correlation. however, the longer duration of pgf2 alpha release recorded in the 2 cows with intrauterine infections are related to the increased frequency of infections.

TI  == microbiological studies of abscesses complicating bothrops snakebite in humans: a prospective study.
AB  == forty patients with abscesses at the site of bothrops bite were evaluated. ten brought the snake responsible for the bite, bothrops jararaca in all cases. on admission a sample was collected from each case for aerobic and anaerobic culture, and no abscesses drained spontaneously. none of the patients had received antibacterial therapy at this time. the bacteria most frequently isolated were morganella morganii (23 patients), providencia rettgeri (7) enterobacter sp. (4), escherichia coli (3), group d streptococcus (11) and bacteroides sp. (6). all enterobacteria tested were sensitive to chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides and cefotaxime. group d streptococci were sensitive to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and penicillin g, whereas anaerobic bacteria were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. these results suggest that in cases of abscess formation secondary to bothrops bite, chloramphenicol alone is a good choice, being both safe and cheap.

(95), bacteroides fragilis  group (80), escherichia coli (43) and bacteroides sp. (39). most strains of b. fragilis group and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. most pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). all patients, except two who died, recovered. these findings illustrate the prevalence of fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.

TI  == a new type of glutamine synthetase in cyanobacteria: the protein encoded by the glnn gene supports nitrogen assimilation in synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803.
AB  == a new glutamine synthetase gene, glnn, which encodes a polypeptide of 724 amino acid residues (m(r), 79,416), has been identified in the unicellular cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803; this is the second gene that encodes a glutamine synthetase (gs) in this cyanobacterium. the functionality of  this gene was evidenced by its ability to complement an escherichia coli glna mutant and to support synechocystis growth in a strain whose glna gene was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis. in this mutant (strain sjcr3), as well as in the wild-type strain, the second gs activity was subject to regulation by the  nitrogen source, being strongly enhanced in nitrogen-free medium. transcriptional fusion of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene with the 5'-upstream region of glnn suggested that synthesis of the second synechocystis gs is regulated at the transcriptional level. furthermore, the level of glnn mrna, a transcript of about 2,300 bases, was found to be strongly increased in nitrogen-free medium. the glnn product is similar to the gs subunits of bacteroides fragilis and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, two obligate anaerobic bacteria whose gss are markedly different from other prokaryotic and eukaryotic gss. however, significant similarity is evident in the five regions which are homologous in all of the gss so far described. the new gs gene was also found in  other cyanobacteria but not in n2-fixing filamentous species.

TI  == piperacillin and tazobactam versus clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with pelvic infection. the piperacillin/tazobactam study group.
AB  == objective: to compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam with that of clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. methods: this was  a randomized open-label trial in hospitalized women with infections of the upper  genital tract. patients were recruited at 12 hospitals in the united states and two hospitals in canada and were randomly assigned to one of two regimens in a 2:1 ratio. one group received piperacillin, 3 g every 6 hours, and tazobactam, 375 mg every 6 hours; the other group received clindamycin, 900 mg every 8 hours, and gentamicin, 2.5-5.0 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. therapy with the assigned regimen was to be administered for a minimum of 3 days. cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the site of infection before initiation of therapy. cultures for chlamydia trachomatis were also obtained from patients with endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease. subjects were evaluated for clinical and bacteriologic response at 24-72 hours and 2-4 weeks after completing therapy. results: two hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 196 were in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 103 were in the clindamycin-gentamicin group. the most common diagnoses were endometritis (146) and pelvic inflammatory disease (115). the most common microorganisms recovered included: peptostreptococcus sp (99), prevotella sp (87), black pigmented bacteroides (29), b fragilis (11), enterococci (64), group b streptococcus (26),  escherichia coli (31), neisseria gonorrhoeae (49), and c trachomatis (19). a favorable clinical response occurred in 84.7% (166 of 196) of piperacillin-tazobactam patients and 87.3% (90 of 103) of clindamycin-gentamicin  patients. among those evaluable for bacteriologic response, 78% (67 of 86) and 82% (23 of 28), respectively, had a favorable response. diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (9.7 versus 2.9%; p = .04), but the majority of episodes were mild to moderate. none of the adverse experiences in either treatment group were considered life-threatening and drug-related. conclusion: the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic regimen for the treatment of infections of the upper genital tract in women.

TI  == peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  == 680 peptostreptococcus sp. (ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. they included 103 ps asaccharolyticus, 74 ps magnus,  56 ps prevotii, 51 ps micros, 46 ps anaerobius, 11 ps morbilorum, and 10 ps saccharolyticus. most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), ps were recovered in pure culture. most ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. these were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). the organisms most commonly isolated with ps were bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 b. fragilis group), prevotella sp. (159), fusobacterium sp. (122), escherichia coli (114), and staphylococcus aureus (97). antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. these data illustrate the importance of ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == necrotizing infections of the perineum.
AB  == during a 6-year period, 10 patients were treated for severe necrotizing infections of the perineum (fournier's gangrene) at the edward hines veterans administration hospital (hines, ill). all were male, and their average age was 60 years. when known, duration of symptoms was 2 to 5 days. prodromal signs such as  edema, erythema, and pain frequently developed into rapidly spreading, full-thickness cutaneous gangrene in less than 24 hours. all patients had significant concomitant disease; 60% were diabetic. all patients had expedient and aggressive initial debridement, usually within 24 hours of presentation to the surgical service. each patient had a "second-look" debridement within 1 or 2  days. debridement was done an average of 2.6 times per patient. the cause of the  infection was noted in seven patients--five with perirectal abscess and two with  urethral trauma. suprapubic catheters were placed in both patients with urethral  trauma. diverting colostomy was done on two patients who had perirectal abscess as a nidus; eight patients were treated without colostomy. polymicrobial bacteriologic flora were found in all patients, with a predominance of escherichia coli, bacteroides sp, and staphylococci. broad spectrum antibiotics and early nutritional supplementation were given. hospital stay averaged 4 weeks  (range, 3 to 12 weeks). one patient died (mortality of 10%). successful management of these patients requires expedient diagnosis, aggressive nutritional supplementation, and early and repeated debridement as clinically indicated. we have not found diverting colostomy to be a necessary part of the management of these patients even when the nidus is perirectal.

TI  == value of cultures of tissue samples taken at operation for lower intestinal perforation.
AB  == tissue cultures from perforations of the lower intestinal tract commonly yield both aerobes (coliform organisms) and anaerobes (bacteroides sp. and clostridium  sp.). to determine the consistency of this pattern and the value of intraoperative cultures, the authors reviewed the hospital records of 115 patients with perforation of the appendix (100 patients) or colon (15 patients),  treated between 1987 and 1990, in whom organisms were cultured from tissue samples taken intraoperatively. attention was paid to the organisms cultured, their distribution and antibiotic sensitivity in initial samples and in subsequent samples obtained when there were septic complications. on average, 4.7 bacterial isolates per patient were obtained. the common organisms were as expected: bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli and clostridium sp. although the culture results did not affect the management of these patients, the sensitivity  of bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin was found to be lower than expected, indicating a shift in sensitivity.

TI  == oral infectivity and bacterial interactions with mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the oral infectivity of a bacterial strain and its susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them. ten bacterial strains tested--all of known oral infectivity--comprised salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes (three strains), escherichia coli (two strains), proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, and a bacteroides sp. the phagocytic uptake of each strain was measured as the bacteria to phagocyte ratio after mononuclear phagocytes in mouse peritoneal exudate were permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo for 3 min. the three listeria strains were the most susceptible  to phagocytic uptake and the salmonella strain was relatively resistant. the intracellular survival of each strain was studied during a subsequent 2 h in-vitro incubation of the mononuclear phagocytes that had been permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo. the strains with the best intracellular survival were ent. faecalis and two of the three listeria strains. the ability of s. typhimurium to survive intracellularly was intermediate but better than that of the two e. coli strains. oral infectivity was not consistently correlated with susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them.

TI  == in-vitro susceptibility and in-vivo efficacy of antimicrobials in the treatment of intraabdominal sepsis in mice.
AB  == cefoxitin, cefotetan, cefmetazole, ceftizoxime, imipenem plus cilastatin, ampicillin plus sulbactam and clindamycin alone or combined with gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin or aztreonam were compared in the therapy of intraabdominal infection in mice caused by escherichia coli in combination with either bacteroides fragilis or bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. mortality in the control group was 45%, and no animal receiving either imipenem, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin or aztreonam died. mortality in mice receiving cefoxitin, cefotetan, cefmetazole, or ceftizoxime was below 7% (p < 0.05%) and mortality following treatment with ampicillin-sulbactam was 23-27% (p > 0.05). the abscesses were examined ten days after inoculation. no abscesses were observed in mice treated with clindamycin or imipenem. therapy with gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, aztreonam or ceftizoxime alone did not prevent abscess  formation by both bacteroides sp. a significant reduction in abscess formation and number of e. coli and b. fragilis was observed with combination therapy of clindamycin with either ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, aztreonam, or gentamicin and single agent therapy with either imipenem, cefoxitin, cefotetan, cefmetazole and  ampicillin-sulbactam alone. however, cefotetan and cefmetazole did not reduce abscess formation or the number of b. thetaiotaomicron. these in-vivo data confirm the in-vitro activity of these antimicrobials.

TI  == microbiology of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.
AB  == specimens obtained from 67 infants with secondarily infected diaper dermatitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. bacteria growth was obtained in 58. aerobic facultative bacteria or candida sp. only were present in 28 patients  (48%), anaerobic bacteria only in 11 (19%), and mixed anaerobic with aerobic, facultative, or yeast flora was present in 19 (33%). ninety-one bacterial or fungal isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 54 (0.9 per specimen) aerobic  or facultative bacteria, 8 (0.1 per specimen) candida sp., and 31 (0.6 per specimen) strict anaerobes. the predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (23 isolates), streptococcus sp. (16), and escherichia coli (6). the predominant anaerobes included bacteroides sp. (12, including 9 bacteroides fragilis group) and peptostreptococcus sp. (11). single bacterial isolates were recovered in 32 (55%) patients, 18 of which were s. aureus. twenty-five beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 22 (51%) of the 43 tested patients. these included 16 s. aureus and 6 b. fragilis group. these data  highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial nature of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.

TI  == microbiology of postoperative wound infection: a prospective study of 1770 wounds.
AB  == a prospective study of postoperative wound infection was carried out over a 12-month period. intra-operative swabs from the patients' anterior nares, the opened viscus and parietes were cultured using standard bacteriological techniques. of the 1770 wounds studied, 167 (9.4%) became infected. wound infection rates, according to clinical wound types, were clean 5.9%, clean-contaminated 10.7%, contaminated 24.3% and dirty 52.9%. the figures according to microbiological wound types were clean 4.7%, and potentially, lightly and heavily contaminated 15.3%, 22.1% and 30.2% respectively. the commonest causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus 23.7%, escherichia coli  16.9%, staphylococcus epidermidis 13.5% and pseudomonas aeruginosa 13.0%. when isolated intra-operatively, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., klebsiella spp. and  p. aeruginosa appeared to have a high probability of causing postoperative wound  infection, but the intra-operative isolation of bacteroides sp. was a poor predictor of subsequent wound infection.

TI  == retroperitoneal necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  == necrotizing fasciitis is a mixed infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues with a characteristic clinical and pathological appearance. early radical surgical excision of all affected tissue is the treatment of choice. in a series  of 19 patients with necrotizing fasciitis, bacteriological assessment in 15 confirmed the mixed nature of the infection, with bacteroides sp. isolated from ten patients. all 12 patients who underwent radical surgical excision survived. a subgroup of patients was identified in whom the appearance of necrotizing fasciitis in the abdomen or perineum was indicative of more extensive disease in  the retroperitoneal tissues. surgical resection of all affected tissue was not feasible in these cases and the outcome was uniformly fatal, giving an overall mortality rate for the series of 37 per cent.

TI  == the role of intestinal microflora on the prevention of salmonella colonization in gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  == the possible role of the intestinal microflora in inhibiting the colonization of  salmonella in the ceca of gnotobiotic chickens was investigated. in the cecal contents of newly hatched (2-day-old) and adult normal (7-mo-old) chickens, a larger number of escherichia coli and a smaller number of lactobacillus sp. were  noticed in 2-day-old chickens than in adult chickens. gnotobiotic chickens treated with cecal contents from either newly hatched or adult birds were orally  exposed to salmonella typhimurium, and on the following day s. typhimurium in the ceca were counted. the adult microflora prevented s. typhimurium colonization more strongly than did the microflora of newly hatched chicks. gnotobiotic chickens treated with e. coli, lactobacillus sp., or the mixture of both organisms were orally inoculated with s. typhimurium. the mixture of both organisms suppressed s. typhimurium colonization most effectively, followed by e. coli alone and lactobacillus sp. alone, escherichia coli may play a role of competitive exclusion only in newly hatched chickens, whereas lactobacillus sp. may have a partial role in adult chickens.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == microbiologic efficacy of intravaginal clindamycin cream for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is characterized by replacement of the normal lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora with gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and mycoplasma hominis. the present study evaluated the vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment with intravaginal clindamycin cream. sixty-seven nonpregnant women with symptoms and signs of bacterial vaginosis, and without other genital tract infections, were randomly assigned to receive placebo cream or 0.1, 1, or 2% clindamycin cream. quantitative vaginal cultures for facultative and anaerobic bacteria and genital  mycoplasmas were performed at enrollment and at 4-7 days and 4-5 weeks after completion of therapy. at enrollment, g vaginalis was recovered from 99%, bacteroides sp from 94%, peptostreptococcus sp from 81%, and m hominis from 58% of the 67 women with bacterial vaginosis. the vaginal cultures yielded a median of 12 isolates per specimen, with equal numbers of aerobic and anaerobic species. the mean log concentration was 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/ml for aerobic and 2.6 x 10(8) cfu/ml for anaerobic bacteria. after treatment, the frequency and concentration of bacteria per milliliter of vaginal fluid decreased for g vaginalis, bacteroides sp, peptostreptococcus sp, and m hominis. the 2% clindamycin cream had the greatest effect on the bacterial vaginosis-associated flora and resulted  in clinical resolution of bacterial vaginosis in 15 (94%) of 16 women. treatment  with lower concentrations of clindamycin cream had less effect on the vaginal flora and resulted in clinical cure in 25 (71%) of 35 women. therapy was associated with an increase in the frequency and concentration of lactobacillus,  and a probably transient increase in the frequency of escherichia coli and enterococcus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the role of bacterial vaginosis as a cause of amniotic fluid infection, chorioamnionitis and prematurity--a review.
AB  == antepartum bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy has been related to premature delivery, the recovery of microorganisms from amniotic fluid of women in premature labor with intact membranes, to histologic chorioamnionitis and to the  recovery of microorganisms from the placenta or membranes. microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis are commonly recovered from the amniotic fluid and chorioamnion of patients who deliver prematurely. in addition, bacterial vaginosis is associated with maternal infectious morbidity during labor and in the postpartum period. very little is known of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which bacterial vaginosis may cause preterm labor and/or premature  rupture of the membranes. however, it is of interest to speculate on possible mechanisms. the high concentration of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the vagina and cervix of pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis may increase the possibility of an ascending infection via the cervix, decidua, fetal membranes, maternal placenta, and amniotic fluid. some of the bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis such as bacteroides sp. are particularly virulent. certain bacteria produce enzymes that potentially could affect the fetal membranes or maternal deciduae. bacteroides sp. and group b streptococcus produce proteases. protease enzymes reduce the chorioamniotic membrane strength in vitro. it is even possible that a high concentration of bacteria in the lower genital tract could produce enough proteases to weaken the fetal membrane strength causing premature  rupture of the membranes. bacterial lipases could also produce tissue injury. schwarz et al. demonstrated that lysosomes within fetal membrane cells contain phospholipase a2 in high concentrations. phospholipase a2 is a precursor of prostaglandin synthesis and the destruction of lysosomes within deciduae or chorioamnion cells may induce prostaglandin synthesis resulting in uterine contractions. bejar et al. found a high rate of phospholipase a2 production by bacteroides sp., anaerobic streptococci, fusobacterium sp., and g. vaginalis. benett et al. demonstrated that bacterial products of group b streptococci, viridans streptococci, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis but not of lactobacillus sp. increase the synthesis of prostaglandins in the membranes. thus, selected bacteria, including some closely related to bacterial vaginosis may play a role in the initiation of uterine contractions by stimulating prostaglandin synthesis. in an alternative mechanism, either the release of prostaglandin in the membrane or uterine contraction could cause microbreaks of the membrane that allow bacterial colonization of the membrane.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == six patients with chronic relapsing diarrhoea caused by clostridium difficile were treated with rectal instillation of homologous faeces (one patient) or a mixture of ten different facultatively aerobic and anaerobic bacteria diluted in  sterile saline (five patients). the mixture led to a prompt loss of cl difficile  and its toxin from the stools and to bowel colonisation by bacteroides sp, which  had not been present in pre-treatment stool samples. strains of escherichia coli, cl bifermentans, and peptostreptococcus productus in the mixture inhibited the in-vitro growth of cl difficile, which in turn inhibited the growth of bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides vulgatus, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. the finding that bacteroides sp had been absent during the patients' illness but was  present after recovery suggests that the absence of bacteroides sp may result in  chronic relapsing cl difficile diarrhoea, and that its presence may prevent colonisation by cl difficile.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in mixed infections in children.
AB  == the recent emergence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillins in the therapy of infection caused by these organisms. these include  respiratory tract, skin of soft tissue, female genital tract, intra-abdominal, and other miscellaneous infections. the important aerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) include staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella sp. the anaerobic blpb are all bacteroidiaceae and include bacteroides fragilis group, b. melaninogenicus group, b. oralis, b. oris-buccae, and fusobacterium sp. laboratory, animal, and clinical studies that support the indirect pathogenicity  of these organisms and the distribution of these blpb in various infections are reviewed. blpb may not only have a direct pathogenic role in causing the infection, but also an indirect pathogenic role. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy, but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic blpb require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == pig bite injuries and infection: report of seven human cases.
AB  == six patients developed local infection after being bitten or gored by swine. wounding was often deep and occurred characteristically on the posterior aspect of the thigh. severity of infection varied from simple wound infection with discharge and slough to cellulitis and abscess formation; pathogens included haemolytic streptococci, pasteurellae, bacteroides sp., proteus sp. and escherichia coli and were usually isolated in mixed culture. a patient with pasteurella aerogenes infection appears to be the first reported in england. a seventh patient developed streptococcus milleri septicaemia after wounding himself while cutting teeth from piglets. it is suggested that a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given as part of the initial treatment when  patients present with the more severe pig bite injuries.

TI  == pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == antibiotics and suction drainage as prophylaxis in vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy.
AB  == a randomized prospective study compared the efficacy of a three-dose perioperative course of intravenously administered cefuroxime and metronidazole versus suction drainage of the vaginal vault for preventing postoperative infection in abdominal and vaginal hysterectomies. in vaginally operated patients, a significant difference in the rate of vaginal cuff abscess formation  was found between the drain group and the antibiotic group (33 versus 0%). in the abdominally operated patients, no significant difference was found (7 versus 0%). the rate of cystitis was not influenced by the prophylactic method. a positive correlation was found between bacteroides sp isolated from the vaginal fluid and  vaginal cuff abscesses in the vaginally operated women. the complications of infection are explained by the decrease in host defense, occurring more frequently in patients treated with the vaginal approach than with the abdominal  technique.

TI  == antimicrobial substance from a human lactobacillus strain.
AB  == lactobacillus sp. strain gg, which was isolated from the feces of a normal person, produced a substance with potent inhibitory activity against a wide range of bacterial species. it inhibited anaerobic bacteria (clostridium spp., bacteroides spp., bifidobacterium spp.), members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp. staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus spp., as demonstrated by a microbiological assay; however, it did not inhibit other lactobacilli. the inhibitory activity occurred between ph 3 and 5 and was heat stable. bactericidal activity against escherichia coli was demonstrated at a dilution of 1:128. the inhibitory substance was distinct from lactic and acetic acids. it had a low molecular weight (less than 1,000) and was soluble in acetone-water (10:1). because of these characteristics, the inhibitory material could not be considered a bacteriocin; it most closely resembled a microcin, which has been associated previously with members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == microbiology of the female genital tract.
AB  == patients who contract genital tract infections are predominantly young, are otherwise healthy, and generally respond well to treatment for bacterial infections. these infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. with treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent;  however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. among the aerobic gram-positive organisms,  several varieties of streptococci such as group b streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen.  among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is escherichia coli. klebsiella sp. and proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are peptostreptococci and peptococci. clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are bacteroides bivius and bacteroides disiens. bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. other organisms encountered are chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.

TI  == ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin in the treatment of soft tissue pelvic infections.
AB  == the clinical efficacy and safety of ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin were evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. forty-four patients were enrolled: 22 received the ampicillin/sulbactam regimen, and 22 received the metronidazole-gentamicin combination. there were 33  cases of severe acute pelvic inflammatory disease, two tuboovarian abscesses, five cases of endomyometritis, and two cases of posthysterectomy pelvic cellulitis. aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the infection sites yielded 447 microorganisms from 44 patients (an average of 10 bacteria per infection; 6.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). the most frequent isolates were bacteroides sp., 54;  bacteroides bivius, 17; black-pigmented bacteroides, 12; bacteroides disiens, 11; fusobacterium, 13; peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 24; peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, 21; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 34; gardnerella vaginalis, 29; neisseria gonorrhoeae, 17; alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 15; and escherichia  coli, five. clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam and 18 of 21 patients treated with metronidazole-gentamicin. one treatment failure occurred in the ampicillin/sulbactam group in a patient who required antichlamydial therapy and had a complex left adnexal mass consistent with an abscess. the cases of metronidazole-gentamicin failure included two patients initially diagnosed as having tuboovarian abscesses who required a change in antibiotic therapy to control the infections. the third patient had postabortion endomyometritis that did not respond to metronidazole-gentamicin therapy within 48 hours, and required a change of medication. no adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted in either group of patients.

TI  == microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  == the charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. all patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. the most common organisms cultured were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10  patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, enterobacter, 16  cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. the classic isolates, escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. to determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and s. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. the spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically  ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those  with acute peritonitis. despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.

AB  == fosfomycin (fom) is a synthetic antibiotic having a unique structural formula and bactericidal mechanism and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against various bacterial species. it has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. as therapy, fom-na in a daily dose of 4 g (2 g x 2) was given by intravenous drip infusion for 5 to 10 days to 6 cases with infectious diseases (2 cases of acute cholecystitis, 3 cases of acute localized peritonitis due to phlegmonous appendicitis and 1 case of acute diffuse peritonitis due to perforative appendicitis). the clinical response was rated as "excellent" in 1 case, "good" in 4 cases, "fair" in 1 case and "poor" in none. no adverse effects were observed in any of the patients. six clinical isolates were obtained, and these consisted  of 4 strains of escherichia coli and 1 strain each of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  bacteroides fragilis. the mics of fom were from 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml for e. coli, 50 micrograms/ml for k. pneumoniae, and 100 micrograms/ml for b. fragilis.  fom-na was administered to the 6 cases intravenously in a dose of 2 g before surgery, and tissue specimens and body fluid samples were taken during the operation. the fom concentration was determined by bioassay with a proteus sp. (mb 838) as the test organism. the mean fom concentration in bile from the common bile duct was 61.85 +/- 17.13 micrograms/ml (n = 5) at 95 to 108 minutes after fom-na intravenous bolus injection. the mean fom concentration in the gall bladder bile was 80.06 +/- 92.36 micrograms/ml, while that in the gall bladder wall was 146.65 +/- 39.10 micrograms/g. the mean fom concentration in purulent ascites was 58.20 +/- 13.29 micrograms/ml, 36.22 +/- 14.63 micrograms/g in the appendix wall and 12.64 +/- 11.34 micrograms/ml in pus in the appendix. the fom concentrations in the infected tissues and body fluids thus exceeded the mics of  fom for the pathogenic bacteria. therefore, fom-na appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy of infections encountered in the surgical field.

(37), bacteroides bivius (23), bacteroides asaccharolyticus (12), peptococcus asaccharolyticus (29), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (19), unidentified anaerobic gram-positive cocci (18), escherichia coli (17), nonhemolytic streptococci (16), neisseria gonorrhoeae (13), and gardnerella vaginalis (38). clinical cure was noted in 29 of 30 moxalactam-treated and 29 of  30 clindamycin/tobramycin-treated patients. moxalactam was effective in five of six cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 22 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, the one case of endomyometritis and the one wound abscess. clindamycin/tobramycin was effective in eight of nine cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 14 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, and all seven cases of endomyometritis. no adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted with either regimen.

AB  == to investigate the modifying role of intestinal microflora in the metabolism of chemical carcinogens in vivo, we subjected bile from fischer rats treated per os  with chemical carcinogens and related compounds to a mutagenicity assay in the presence and absence of a cell-free extract from human feces. a mixture of the bile sample and potassium phosphate buffer was incubated in the presence or absence of human cell-free fecal extract and then further incubated with a bacterial suspension of salmonella typhimurium tester strains ta98 or ta100. bile from rats treated with 1-nitropyrene (1-np) produced about 2700 and 400 revertants per plate in strain ta98 in the presence and absence of the fecal extract, respectively. there was a drug dose- and bile volume-related response. treatment of 1-np-bile with beta-glucuronidase, but not aryl sulfatase, enhanced  its mutagenicity. cell-free extracts of some strains of intestinal bacteria (bacteroides fragilis atcc 12044, b. vulgatus atcc 8482, b. thetaiotaomicron atcc 12290, bacteroides sp. strain 524, eubacterium eligens vpi c15-48, peptostreptococcus sp. strain 204 and escherichia coli a-5-18) also enhanced the  mutagenicity of 1-np-bile. these bacterial cell-free extracts hydrolyzed the synthetic beta-d-glucuronides of phenolphthalein and/or p-nitrophenol. these data indicate that the glucuronide(s) of 1-np-metabolite(s) secreted into bile can be  hydrolyzed in the intestine by bacterial beta-glucuronidases to potent mutagenic  aglycone(s).

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == new orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, proteus sp. indole-positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. none of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against bacteroides fragilis. ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or  ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though  the difference was less marked. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against s. aureus. results with agar and with broth were comparable. the activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the mic values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). the new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.

TI  == infection and the use of antibiotics in crohn's disease.
AB  == many patients with crohn's disease present with the complications of infection. hence, antibiotics play an important role in the medical management of acute inflammatory disease, persistent perianal disease and as prophylaxis for surgical operations. the author's group has demonstrated that bacteria colonize the serosa of the bowel in patients with crohn's disease in 27% of cases. furthermore, pathogenic bacteria could be recovered from the lymph nodes in 33% of patients with crohn's disease, compared with only 5% in a controlled population. extraintestinal bacterial colonization was, therefore, present in approximately half of all patients requiring an operation for crohn's disease. the principal bacteria isolated at these sites were escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, proteus sp and diphtheroids. a prospective controlled trial on the use of 1 month's antimicrobial therapy in patients with relapse of crohn's disease revealed that metronidazole was associated with a 57% response rate, compared with a response of only 17% in patients receiving no metronidazole. these interim findings suggest that metronidazole may have a role in the management of acute relapse in patients with crohn's disease.

TI  == development of the normal gastrointestinal microflora of specific pathogen-free chickens.
AB  == the development of the normal intestinal microflora of the small intestine, caecum and large intestine of specific pathogen-free (spf) chickens, was studied  in the period from hatching to 84 days of age. no bacteria were detected in any of the sites at hatchery (day 1), but by day 3 significant levels of faecal streptococci and coliforms were isolated from all sites. the flora of the small intestine was limited to faecal streptococci and coliforms for the first 40 days  and then lactobacilli became established and dominated the flora. a large variety of facultative and strictly anaerobic organisms colonized the caecum. many of these species were transient and were only present for a limited period; after 40 days the flora stabilized to consist predominantly of faecal streptococci, escherichia coli, bacteroides spp. and lactobacillus sp. the flora of the large intestine was composed of organisms also present in the small intestine or the caecum. these findings differ from previously published studies on conventionally reared chickens in that the number of species isolated and the population levels  of organisms are much lower. this probably reflects the absence of continuous environmental challenge to the chickens because of the housing and feeding facilities in which the chickens were maintained.

TI  == motility as a factor in bowel colonization by roseburia cecicola, an obligately anaerobic bacterium from the mouse caecum.
AB  == roseburia cecicola strain gm is a motile obligate anaerobe that was isolated from mouse caecal mucosa. twenty-five strains of motility mutants were obtained from populations of strain gm (wild-type) that had been exposed to uv light. unlike gm cells, mutant bacteria were either non-motile and non-flagellated (fla-) or migrated slowly or atypically in semi-solid medium. strain gm and two mutant strains, sls (fla-) and wes (atypically motile), were used in mouse colonization  experiments. in separate experiments, each strain colonized (4.8 x 10(9) to 1.5 x 10(10) c.f.u. per g caecum) the caecum of germfree mice inoculated intragastrically with pure cultures of the bacteria. in mice mono-associated with either mutant strain, bacteria which were non-motile or atypically motile predominated in their caeca (greater than 99% of total bacteria recovered). in mice mono-associated with motile cells of strain gm, mutant strains which had lost wild-type motility became predominant in the caecal populations (97% of total bacteria recovered at 48 to 70 days after inoculation). mice mono-associated with either strain sls or strain gm were colonized by one strain  each of escherichia coli, candida pintolopesii, a bacteroides sp., and a clostridium sp. most (99%) of the r. cecicola cells recovered from the caeca of these animals had typical wild-type motility. motility, although not essential for r. cecicola to colonize germfree mice, is apparently advantageous to this bacterium when other micro-organisms are present with it in the mouse caecum. motility may thus be essential for r. cecicola to colonize conventional laboratory mice.

TI  == trends in the development of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == in many ways it is ironic that the first description of a beta-lactamase occurred in 1940 with an enzyme isolated from escherichia coli since in recent years there has been a major interest in gram-negative species and the development of agents  to overcome the hydrolytic action of beta-lactamases of gram-negative species. there have been four distinctly different approaches to the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics. these have been the search for inhibitors of beta-lactamases and agents such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam are examples of  compounds which by virtue of kcat function act as suicide inhibitors and make old antibiotics new. there has been the modification of the penicillin and cephem nucleus to increase beta-lactamase stability or failing that to improve the ability of the compounds to pass through the cell wall and increase affinity for  critical beta-lactam receptors, i.e. penicillin-binding proteins. there has been  the development of carbapenem type of agents such as imipenem which would have broad activity including aerobic, anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative species. there has been the discovery of the monobactam agents of which aztreonam is an example of a compound with great beta-lactamase stability but with activity limited to gram-negative aerobic species. bacterial resistance has indeed been the major factor that has modified use of beta-lactams and influenced the development of the aforementioned types of drugs. the widespread presence of beta-lactamases in common pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis has made it necessary to have beta-lactamase stable compounds for initial therapy of infection. it is possible to analyze structure-activity relations of beta-lactam compounds to determine changes which  will be most advantageous in light of known and expected resistance patterns. but the increased realization in recent years of the importance of the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam drugs has made it essential that the development  of new compounds be based on an integration of microbiological and pharmacokinetic parameters. interest in the prevention of resistant flora has also affected the development of new drugs since it is increasingly appreciated that alteration of intestinal flora contributes to selection of drug resistant microorganisms. finally, new toxicities or adverse effects associated with the use of certain new agents has modified the development of certain compounds.

TI  == comparative study of netilmicin/tinidazole versus netilmicin/clindamycin in the treatment of severe abdominal infections.
AB  == the efficacy of netilmicin combined with tinidazole (n + t) or clindamycin (n + c) in the treatment of severe abdominal infections was evaluated in a prospective randomized study with 20 patients in the n + t group and 21 patients in the n + c group. normally the maintaining dose for netilmicin was 2.25 mg/kg every 12 h, for tinidazole 400 mg every 12 h and for clindamycin 300-600 mg every 6-8 h. the  mean duration time of treatment was 8 days in the n + t group and 10 days in the  n + c group respectively. in the n + t group 18 patients were cured and in the n  + c group 17 patients. among aerobic bacteria escherichia coli was most frequently isolated and among anaerobes bacteroides sp. all aerobic bacteria with 2 exceptions were susceptible to netilmicin and all anaerobic bacteria but 2 to tinidazole or clindamycin. adequate serum levels were obtained for each antibiotic during therapy. in this study with a small number of patients the combination of netilmicin and tinidazole was as effective as netilmicin and clindamycin.

AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

AB  == antibacterial activities of cefmetazole, a new preparation of cephamycin antibiotic, were determined against selected clinical strains of escherichia coli (27 strains), klebsiella sp. (27 strains) and bacteroides fragilis (27 strains).  activities were evaluated at bacteriostatic and also bactericidal levels with particular reference to time of exposure of microbes to the drug. the minimal drug concentrations producing minimal reduction of colony-forming units at time intervals of 3, 6 and 24 hours after exposure to the drug--approximations to the  theoretical bacteriostatic concentrations--were designated as 3-h, 6-h and 24-h mrcs, respectively. conventional mic yielding no turbidity after incubation of antibiotic-containing broth for 24 hours was also determined. the minimal concentrations of the drug producing 99.9% killing at time intervals of 3, 6 and  24 hours after exposure to the drug were designated as 3-h, 6-h and 24-h mlcs, respectively. assuming that the apparent mode of action of a drug is bactericidal when the ratio of bactericidal-bacteriostatic concentrations is low (less than or equal to 4) and bacteriostatic when high (greater than or equal to 8), then cefmetazole appeared to be a bactericidal drug to a considerable number of gram-negative strains when the exposure time exceeded a period of 6 hours. the data that the mode of action of this drug is bactericidal with such relatively brief exposure times--indicating rapid decrease of colony-forming units--would suggest cefmetazole is an excellent antibacterial agent and would be a useful drug in treatment of bacterial infections.

AB  == the activity of ly127935, a beta-lactam antibiotic of novel structure, was studied in vitro against facultative gram-negative bacilli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacteroides fragilis. the strains were recent clinical isolates, many of which were relatively resistant to other antibiotics. ly127935 exhibited striking activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., proteus sp., serratia marcescens, and b. fragilis with median minimum inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was somewhat less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus. cefotaxime (hr 756) showed very similar activity except that it was substantially weaker against b. fragilis. ly127935 was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, or piperacillin; it was also as potent as tobramycin or amikacin against all species except for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == increase in the population of duodenal immunoglobulin a plasmocytes in axenic mice associated with different living or dead bacterial strains of intestinal origin.
AB  == various bacterial strains were tested for their ability to stimulate immunoglobulin a (iga) plasmocytes to populate the duodenal lamina propria in axenic mice. the mice were associated with the strains for at least 4 weeks. the  strains inhabiting the conventional mouse intestine and belonging to the genera lactobacillus, streptococcus, eubacterium, actinobacillus, micrococcus, corynebacterium, and clostridium (including the extremely oxygen-sensitive ones)  are only slightly or nonimmunogenic, whereas the strains belonging to the genera  bacteroides and escherichia have an immunogenic effect. the same result was obtained with bacteroides and escherichia strains isolated from the digestive tract of other animal species. the kinetics of appearance of intestinal iga plasmocytes are similar in axenic mice monoassociated with a stimulatory strain and in conventional mice. the association of two or more strains with axenic mice leads either to the same or a greater number of duodenal iga plasmocytes as that  obtained with the most stimulatory strain monoassociated with axenic mice. the maximum stimulation recorded in all of these trials represents about two-thirds of that observed in conventional mice and was obtained in the duodenum of gnotoxenic mice harboring four bacterial strains isolated from the conventional mouse microflora. the orally administered killed cells of two immunogenic strains, e. coli and bacteroides sp., are as immunogenic as the living cells, provided that their concentration in the digestive tract is sufficient.

TI  == antagonism among the normal anaerobic bacteria of the mouse gastrointestinal tract determined by immunofluorescence.
AB  == strictly anaerobic bacteroides sp., eubacterium sp., and fusobacterium sp. were isolated from the cecum of a conventional mouse. an immunofluorescent method utilizing rabbit antisera specific for each of these three strains was developed  to determine their population levels in the gastrointestinal tracts of gnotobiotic mice. population levels of these anaerobes in groups of gnotobiotic mice colonized with either bacteroides, eubacterium, or fusobacterium were compared with those of gnotobiotes colonized with all three strains. bacteroides  population levels in gnotobiotes colonized with all three strains were 100-fold less than the bacteroides population level in gnotobiotes colonized with only the bacteroides strain. eubacterium or fusobacterium population levels were not reduced by the presence of the other anaerobic strains. thus, strictly anaerobic  eubacterium sp. and fusobacterium sp. that colonized gnotobiotic mice caused a reduction in the in vivo population levels of a strictly anaerobic bacteroides sp.

TI  == colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.

TI  == effects of anaerobic bacteria on eimeria tenella infection in bacteria-free, monofloral, and conventional chickens.
AB  == bacteria-free, monofloral, and conventional chicks were infected with eimeria tenella. monofloral chicks were established by inoculating birds in several gnotobiotic isolators with a single species of escherichia coli or with one of three bacteroides sp. isolates (no. 157, no. 202, or no. 366). daily weights of individual birds were recorded for six days post-infection (pi). on day 6 pi all  birds were sacrificed and cecal lesions were scored. conventional, infected birds lost weight on days 5 and 6 pi and showed severe lesions. birds maintained as monofloral groups with isolates of bacteroides sp. no. 157, no. 202 or e. coli showed equally severe lesions, but lost weight only on day 6 pi. conventional, uninfected birds with no lesions, birds infected with bacteroides sp. isolate no. 366 with mild lesions, and bacteria-free birds with mild to severe coccidial lesions all continued to gain weight on each day post-infection.

TI  == bacteremia and fungemia complicating neoplastic disease. a study of 364 cases.
AB  == during a 14 month period there were 364 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia at memorial sloan-kettering cancer center. the first nine months of the study were retrospective, and the next five prospective. in patients with leukemia or lymphoma (group 1), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently isolated organisms. the mortality in this group was 40.5 per cent. in the patients with solid tumor (group 2), esch. coli, staph. aureus, bacteroides sp. and candida sp. were most frequent. mortality was 27.8 per cent. the source of infection in both groups was often indeterminate. high mortality was associated with pulmonary and intraabdominal infection and with ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae or polymicrobic sepsis. factors of prognostic significance were the causative microorganism, source of infection and shock. although mortality was higher in patients with leukopenia than in those with normal leukocyte counts, the differences were not significant. the mortality in this series was low considering the severity of the underlying diseases and the immunosuppressed state of many of the patients. in a  prospective, randomly controlled study, mortality was further diminished by infectious disease consultation at the time the positive blood culture was reported. severe fungal superinfection, predominantly aspergillosis and candidiasis, was found in 52 per cent of the autopsy patients with leukemia or lymphoma (group 1), but in only 8 per cent of those with solid tumors (group 2).

TI  == a simplified method using commercial milk powder for hand-rearing of the caesarean-derived infant rabbits (author's transl).
AB  == an efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. the caesarean-derived infant dutch or japanese-white rabbits and their hybrids (f1; japanese-white female x dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, a and b, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (table 2) and  administered intragastrically once a day through a nelaton's catheter. bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. on the third day, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus, and bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. the weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. there was, however, no significant difference milk diet a and b on the weaning rate.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in diabetic foot ulcers.
AB  == twenty diabetic foot ulcers were cultured using optimal microbiologic techniques. anaerobic bacteria coexisted with the more commonly recognized aerobic bacteria in 18 specimens. there were a total of 116 isolates with an average of 5.8 species per specimen (3.2 aerobes and 2.6 anaerobes). the principal isolates were bacteroides species (sp.) (17 strains), peptococci (16), proteus sp. (11), enterococci (9), staphylococcus aureus (7), clostridia (7), and escherichia coli  (6). when antimicrobial therapy is indicated the selection of agents should consider the likelihood of a complex aerobic-anaerobic flora.

TI  == influence of certain indigenous gastrointestinal microorganisms on duodenal alkaline phosphatase in mice.
AB  == alkaline phosphatase activity was assayed in duodenal homogenates or extracts from adult specific pathogen-free (spf) and germfree mice and gnotobiotic mice monoassociated with a lactobacillus sp., a bacteroides sp., or a coliform strain  indigenous to spf mice. activity levels of the enzyme were much higher in the preparations from germfree mice than in those from the spf controls. in the gnotobiotes monoassociated either with a freshly isolated lactobacillus sp. or a  bacteroides sp., the levels of alkaline phosphatase activity were intermediate between the values for germfree and spf mice. by contrast, in the gnotobiotes monoassociated with a coliform strain, alkaline phosphatase activity remained at  high germfree levels. butanol extracts of duodenal tissue from spf mice, germfree mice, and exgermfree mice associated with an indigenous microflora from spf mice  (conventionalized) were subjected to acrylamide gel electrophoresis. a stain for  alkaline phosphatase activity revealed three major bands in the gels prepared with extracts from spf and conventionalized mice, but only two in the gels prepared with extracts from germfree mice. all three bands may have been present  in the latter gels. one of the bands (the middle one) may have been obscured, however, by high activity in the slowest moving band. as determined by densitometric scanning, the slowest moving band had much higher activity in the preparations from germfree animals than in those from spf or conventionalized mice. these findings suggest that the indigenous microbial flora affects not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively, the activity of alkaline phosphatases in  the mouse intestinal mucosa.

TI  == [in vitro examination on antibacterial activities of broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative clinical isolates (author's transl)].
AB  == in vitro studies were undertaken on clinically isolated strains of various bacteria to examine the antibacterial activity of ampicillin (ab-pc), carbenicillin (cb-pc), sulbenicillin (sb-pc) cephalothin (cet), cefazolin (cez) and gentamicin (gm). fifty three % of escherichia coli strains 53.3% of citrobacter sp., 80% of proteus mirabilis, 42.9% of morganella and 80% of bacteroides sp. were susceptible (mic being not higher than 12.5 mug/ml) to ab-pc. the eight other species were not so susceptible to this penicillin. cb-pc  and sb-pc were almost as effective as ab-pc against escherichia coli and citrobacter sp. they were less active against klebsiella sp., but more active against enterobacter sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus group and pseudomonas sp. than ab-pc, sb-pc was more effective than cb-pc against pseudomonas sp. the strains of pseudomonas sp. which were resistant to higher concentrations of cb-pc and sb-pc were pyocyanine-negative strains. all strains (100%) of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp. and citrobacter sp. were susceptible to cet and cez, while none of enterobacter sp. , serratia sp., proteus vulgaris.  morganella, rettgerella, providencia and pseudomonas sp. were susceptible to these cephalosporins. the mics of cet and cez against bacteroides sp. were moderately low. some strains of providencia and alkaligenes sp. were resistant of gm but the other 10 species were not resistant to this antibiotic, though it showed comparatively high mics against bacteroides sp. when seen from the mic distribution of each antibiotic, there was a tendency that the strains isolated from the pus were more resistant than those isolated from the other sources (urine, sputum and bile).

TI  == the reduction of n-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

TI  == the relationship between nitro group reduction and the intestinal microflora.
AB  == the capacity of rats to reduce a 25-mg dose of p-nitrobenzoic acid (pnba) was measured by quantifying the amount of this compound recovered in the urine as p-aminobenzoic acid (paba) and its conjugates. it was found that germfree rats converted approximately 1% of pnba to paba; in conventional rats the conversion was approximately 25%. various bacteria isolated from the rat cecum were selectively associated with germfree rats and it was demonstrated that these bacteria colonized their gastrointestinal tracts. in assoication with lactobacillus plantarum, the conversion of pnba to paba increased to 3.9%. when these rats were further associated with clostridium sp. and streptoccocus faecalis, the conversion increased to approximately 12%. a general correlation was found between the capacity of constituents of the microflora to reduce pnba in vitro and when associated with the germfree rat. cecectomy, which removes a substantial portion of the microflora of the rat, decreases the capacity of the conventional rat to reduce pnba. similar experiments with p-nitrobenzenesulfonamide indicate that this compound is also largely reduced by  the flora. evidence that the reduction of the nitro group in these compounds is carried out by the intestinal microflora explains previous observations in which  the reduction of these compounds in rats did not correlate with the activity of liver enzymes putative for these reactions.

TI  == susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  == the susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. the three strains of listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. there was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of salmonellae, citrobacter sp., enterobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas sp. cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus sp., providence sp., flavobacter sp., herellea vaginicola, and mima polymorpha. cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against bacteroides sp. thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.

TI  == studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  == a study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on  a rumen fluid roll tube medium (m98-5). seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as propionibacterium acnes and eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as bacteroides clostridiiformis,  b. hypermegas and b. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as clostridium sp.).  two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. the distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy  source, minerals, reducing agent, trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). the growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by co(2) and rumen fluid. these preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen  anaerobes.
