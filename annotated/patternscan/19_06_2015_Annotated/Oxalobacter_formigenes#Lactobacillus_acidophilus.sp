TI  == screening of different probiotic strains for their in vitro ability to metabolise oxalates: any prospective use in humans?
AB  == background: oxalate is the salt-forming ion of oxalic acid and can generate oxalate salts combining with various cations, such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. approximately 75% of all kidney stones are composed primarily of calcium oxalate (caox) and hyperoxaluria, a condition involving high urinary oxalate concentration, is considered a primary risk factor for kidney stone formation, known as nephrolithiasis. current therapeutic strategies often fail in their compliance or effectiveness, and caox stone recurrence is still common. after an initial stone, there is a 50% chance of forming a second stone within 7 years if the condition is left untreated. the potential therapeutic application of some probiotics, mainly lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, in reducing hyperoxaluria in vivo through intestinal oxalate degrading activity is compelling and initial reports are promising. this study was undertaken to screen different lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains for their capacity to degrade oxalate in vitro using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). methods: the oxalate-degrading activity of 13 lactobacilli and 5 bifidobacteria was tested using a novel hplc method after growth in a broth culture added with 10 mm ammonium oxalate. experiments were repeated 3 times. oxalobacter formigenes (dsm 4420) was used as positive reference to validate hplc oxalate-degrading capability assays. results: lactobacillus strains were more efficient than bifidobacteria in degrading oxalates. l. paracasei lpc09 (dsm 24243) gave the best result, as 68.5% of ammonium oxalate was converted at the end of incubation, whereas the following best converters belong to the l. gasseri and l. acidophilus species. the relatively low conversion rate observed for most  bifidobacteria can probably be attributed to intrinsic oxalate toxicity toward this genus. conclusions: humans lack the enzymes needed to directly metabolise oxalate, and this potentially toxic compound is, therefore, managed using alternative pathways. as oxalate-degrading bacteria are present in the endogenous microbiota of the human intestine, although with significant individual differences, it is possible to hypothesise that the administration of selected oxalate-degrading probiotics could be an alternative and innovative approach to reducing the intestinal absorption of oxalate and the resulting urinary excretion.

TI  == determination of oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase activity in oxalobacter formigenes and lactobacillus acidophilus by capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == oxalyl-coenzyme a decarboxylase (oxc) is a key enzyme in the catabolism of the highly toxic oxalate, catalysing the decarboxylation of oxalyl-coenzyme a (ox-coa) to formyl-coenzyme a (for-coa). in the present study, a capillary electrophoretic (ce) method was proposed for the assessment of the activity of recombinant oxc from two bacteria, namely oxalobacter formigenes dsm 4420 and lactobacillus acidophilus la 14. in particular, the degradation of the substrate  ox-coa occurring in the enzymatic reaction could be monitored by the off-line ce  method. a capillary permanently coated with polyethylenimine (pei) was used and in the presence of a neutral background electrolyte (50 mm phosphate buffer at ph 7.0), a reversal of the electroosmotic flow was obtained. under these conditions, the anodic migration of ox-coa (substrate) and for-coa (reaction product) occurred and their separation was accomplished in less than 12 min. the ce method was validated for selectivity, linearity (range of ox-coa within 0.005-0.650 mm), sensitivity (lod of 1.5 microm at the detection wavelength of 254 nm), precision  and accuracy. steady state kinetic constants (v(max), k(m) or k') of oxc were finally estimated for both the bacteria showing that although l. acidophilus la 14 provided a lower oxalate breakdown than o. formigenes dsm 4420, it could be a  potentially useful probiotic in the prevention of diseases related to oxalate.

TI  == reduction of oxaluria after an oral course of lactic acid bacteria at high concentration.
AB  == background: hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. we tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. methods: six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid  bacteria (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. brevis, s. thermophilus, b. infantis)  for four weeks. the 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. the ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and  the gene expression of ox1t, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange  of oxalate, also were investigated. results: the treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. mean  levels +/- sd were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3  +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (p < 0.05). the treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (l. acidophilus and s. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. one strain (b. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. l. plantarum and l. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. no strain expressed the ox1t gene. conclusions: the urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. we postulate that the biological manipulation  of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.
