baseline activity of telavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented infections in u.s. hospitals (2011-2012) as determined by the revised susceptibility testing method.
telavancin had mic50 and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml (100.0% susceptible), respectively, against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococcus aureus. telavancin was active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 100% susceptible) and enterococcus faecium (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mug/ml), while higher mic values were obtained against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (mic50/90, 1/2 mug/ml) and e. faecalis (mic50/90, >2/>2 mug/ml). streptococci showed telavancin modal mic results of </= 0.015 mug/ml, except against streptococcus agalactiae (i.e., 0.03 mug/ml). this study reestablishes the telavancin spectrum of activity against isolates recovered from the united states (2011-2012) using the revised broth microdilution method.
[influence of probiotic enterococci on the growth of streptococcus agalactiae].
individual features of sensitivity of some strains of group b streptococci (gbs)  to influence of 2 probiotic cultures of enterococcus faecium (sf68 and l3) have been studied by double agar test. e. faecium l3 strain had higher antagonistic activity to gbs. two genes encoding enterocins a and b as well as genes responsible for the expression of the former two genes were found in the genome of this strain. the supernatant and peptide extract of e. faecium l3 contained thermostable low molecular weight peptides which inhibited growth of listeria and gbs but at lesser extent compared with native enterococci. obtained data allow to suggest that antagonistic activity of enterococci against gbs may be affiliated with production of enterocins a and b and can be increased by the presence of other metabolites.
susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in 839 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci from norway.
a total of 839 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci from norway including staphylococcus aureus (n = 214), coagulase negative staphylococcus spp. (n = 100), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 99), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 80), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 127), streptococcus spp. viridans group (n = 70), enterococcus faecalis (n = 75), and enterococcus faecium (n = 74), were tested by e-test for susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid. subgroups of oxacillin resistant s. aureus and coagulase negative staphylococcus spp., penicillin non-susceptible s. pneumoniae and vancomycin resistant enterococcus spp. were specifically included as they are the intended targets for these new drugs. all isolates were susceptible to linezolid (mic5o and mic9o 0.25-2.0 mg/l, mic range 0.12-2 mg/l). staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were also susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin except for some intermediately susceptible viridans group isolates (mic54, and mic90 0.25-2 mg/l, mic range 0.125-2 mg/l). enterococcus faecium (mic90 = 4.0 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (mic50 = 8.0 mg/l, mic90 > or = 32 mg/l) were less susceptible to this substance. there was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. the study demonstrated a high prevalence of in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, which is necessary for their use in the treatment of infections with resistant gram-positive pathogens. the results were used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in norway.
[post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae, was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.
[yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--i. gram-positive bacteria].
the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in italy.
objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
this report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pyogenes. the study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in q/d worldwide phase iii comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. q/d was highly active, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) < or = 1.0 microg/ml against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. q/d was active (mics < or = 1 microg/ml) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. q/d was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant s. aureus strains (mic90=1 microg/ml), as was vancomycin (mic90=2 microg/ml), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (mic90=32 vs 1 microg/ml). given its spectrum of activity, q/d may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.
[comparative antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
we have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. in-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. although pristinamycin's mean mic for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (mic greater than or equal to 3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin showed poor activity against haemophilus influenzae (mode mic 1.56 and mic90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin inhibited all nine clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. it was less effective against the bacteroides fragilis group: (mic90 3.12 mg/l). pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.
