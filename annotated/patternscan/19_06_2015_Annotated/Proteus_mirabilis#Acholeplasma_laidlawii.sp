TI  == differentiation of mycoplasmatales from bacterial protoplast l-forms by assay for penicillin binding proteins.
AB  == membrane proteins with the specific ability for binding penicillin with high affinity (penicillin binding proteins) were found to be present in two strains of the cell wall-less protoplast l-form of p. mirabilis and were absent from different species of mycoplasma and from acholeplasma laidlawii. thus, the assay  for penicillin binding proteins appeared to be suitable for the differentiation of the cell wall-less procaryotes. the absence of penicillin binding proteins from the mycoplasmatales further confirmed the unrelatedness of this group to the bacteria.

TI  == cholesterol incorporation into bacterial membranes.
AB  == the wall-covered bacteria micrococcus lysodeikticus, bacillus megaterium, and proteus mirabilis incorporated exogenous cholesterol into their cytoplasmic membrane in quantities resembling those incorporated by sterol-nonrequiring mycoplasmas. cholesterol incorporation into the outer membrane of p. mirabilis was much more restricted than into the cytoplasmic membrane.
