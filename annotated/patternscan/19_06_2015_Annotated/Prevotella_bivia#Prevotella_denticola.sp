TI  == antimicrobial resistance and beta-lactamase production of clinical isolates of prevotella and porphyromonas species.
AB  == background: this study determined the beta-lactamase production and the antimicrobial resistance of 72 prevotella species and 48 porphyromonas species isolated from different clinical specimens. methods: all strains were identified  using api 32 id. the beta-lactamase production was determined by nitrocefin disks. e test strips of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cefoxitin, clindamycin, metronidazole and imipenem were tested for each strain. results: nineteen prevotella melaninogenica, 18 prevotella intermedia, 16 prevotella denticola, 11 prevotella loescheii and 8 prevotella bivia strains were identified. four were clindamycin resistant. the highest beta-lactamase production was found at a rate of 68.4% in p. melaninogenica species. additionally, 33 porphyromonas asaccharolytica and 15 porphyromonas gingivalis strains were identified. none of them produced beta-lactamase. conclusion: in view of the emerging antibiotic resistance among anaerobes, the current local susceptibility profile of our prevotella and porphyromonas species will establish the basis for additional surveys tracing significant changes in the antimicrobial resistance of our clinical isolates.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  == past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. the antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems single bond, prime&bond nt, and excite were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus intermedius, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella oris, prevotella bivia, prevotella denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and clostridium  ramosum with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. prime&bond nt showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to single bond, whereas ex produced no inhibitory effect on porphyromonas endodontalis, although  the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. the variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among 149 anaerobic gram-negative  rods isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  == in a prospective study, 47 adults presenting a rapidly progressive periodontitis  were selected in order to evaluate the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among oral anaerobic gram-negative rods. predominant anaerobes were identified from two of the deepest periodontal pockets. beta-lactamase-positive strains fulfilled to at least two of three criteria: positive nitrocefin test, penicillin etest minimal inhibitory concentration > 1 microgram/ml, and disk diffusion synergy between amoxycillin and clavulanic acid > 10 mm. at least one beta-lactamase-producing strain was found in 53.2% of patients and 39.4% of the periodontal pockets investigated. prominent beta-lactamase-positive species were  prevotella buccae and prevotella intermedia (respectively 16 of 38: 42% and 18 of 52: 35% positive strains), followed by prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum (respectively 1 of 6: 17%, 1 of  10: 10%, 1 of 10: 10%, and 1 of 13: 8% positive strains). no beta-lactamase producer could be evidenced in porphyromonas gingivalis (10 strains tested). all  the beta-lactamase-positive strains with the nitrocefin test had penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations > 1 microgram/ml with the etest, and a strong synergy between amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was always observed.

TI  == genetic relationships within the genus prevotella analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == the genetic diversity and relationships within the genus prevotella were studied  by analyzing twenty-five strains by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (mlee) at nine metabolic enzyme loci and dna-dna hybridization. mlee revealed a high genetic diversity with 25 electrophoretic types (ets) for the 25 strains studied, a mean number of alleles per enzyme locus of 6.8 and a mean genetic diversity per locus of 0.786. the index of association described by maynard smith et al. (1993) revealed a clonal structure within the genus prevotella. a dendrogram generated by cluster analysis of a matrix of ets showed that species like p. bivia, p. buccae, p. oris, p. oralis, p. nigrescens, and p. denticola form clusters that are consistent with dna homologies. however, strains identified as p. melaninogenica or p. loescheii by dna-dna hybridization did not constitute distinct subpopulations in mlee. mlee analysis demonstrated its high power in differentiating closely related strains. it provides an alternative to 16s rrna analysis for the study of phylogenetic relationships within the genus prevotella, especially for differentiating strains with high dna homology or high rrna homology.

TI  == isolation and speciation of prevotella strains from periodontal abscesses.
AB  == the aims of the study were to isolate and to identify at species level the prevotella strains in pus samples collected by needle aspiration from 25 romanian patients with periodontal abscesses. gram-stained smears and cultures on selective and nonselective media were performed from each of the 25 pus samples.  the isolates were identified on the basis of gram staining, cultural characteristics and standard biochemical reactions. the gram-negative anaerobic bacilli isolates were biochemically characterized and identified at species level using the rapid id 32 a system (bio merieux, france). fifteen prevotella isolates belonging to one of the following species: p. melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. oralis, p. loescheii and p. bivia were recovered. all prevotella isolates reacted similarly in 20 tests in the rapid id 32 a system. the p. melaninogenica strain showed approximately the same biochemical profile and only two sugar fermentation tests were not constantly positive. the study confirmed that prevotella is often  involved in periodontal abscesses (> 50% of the cases) in association with other  anaerobic or/and aerobic bacteria. p. melaninogenica was the most frequently isolated prevotella species from the investigated cases.

TI  == a pyrolysis mass spectrometry study of the non-pigmented prevotella species.
AB  == collection strains (21) and non-pigmented clinical isolates (96) provisionally identified as prevotella spp. were classified numerically on the basis of pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms) data and reaction patterns in conventional tests (ctrps) for volatile and non-volatile fatty acids, pre-formed enzymes and biochemical activity. pms and ctrp classifications were compared with a previous  classification based on visual analysis of sds-page patterns. although the order  of clusters differed, cross-tabulation of cluster membership revealed strong correlations between classifications. cluster membership in the pms classification correlated particularly well with sds-page results. ctrp clusters  corresponded largely to the recognised species of prevotella, but pms and sds-page divided two species into sub-groups: two in p. buccae and five in p. veroralis. the latter subgroups could be discriminated by small but consistent differences in ctrps. an undesignated, well differentiated cluster of strains appeared closest to the main group of p. buccae strains in pms and ctrps. b. (p.) capillus could not be distinguished from p. buccae; these species are regarded as synonymous. strains of p. zoogleoformans and b. (p.) pentosaceus were well separated from other strains in pms. a complex comprising clusters of p. disiens, p. oralis, p. veroralis, p. loescheii and a further undesignated group similar to p. melaninogenica was well differentiated from p. buccae and p. oris in pms; clusters corresponding to p. bivia, p. corporis, p. intermedia and p. denticola formed another complex.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
