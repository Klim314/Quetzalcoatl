TI  == combined inactivation of the clostridium cellulolyticum lactate and malate dehydrogenase genes substantially increases ethanol yield from cellulose and switchgrass fermentations.
AB  == background: the model bacterium clostridium cellulolyticum efficiently degrades crystalline cellulose and hemicellulose, using cellulosomes to degrade lignocellulosic biomass. although it imports and ferments both pentose and hexose sugars to produce a mixture of ethanol, acetate, lactate, h2 and co2, the proportion of ethanol is low, which impedes its use in consolidated bioprocessing for biofuels production. therefore genetic engineering will likely be required to improve the ethanol yield. plasmid transformation, random mutagenesis and heterologous expression systems have previously been developed for c. cellulolyticum, but targeted mutagenesis has not been reported for this organism, hindering genetic engineering. results: the first targeted gene inactivation system was developed for c. cellulolyticum, based on a mobile group ii intron originating from the lactococcus lactis l1.ltrb intron. this markerless mutagenesis system was used to disrupt both the paralogous l-lactate dehydrogenase (ccel_2485; ldh) and l-malate dehydrogenase (ccel_0137; mdh) genes, distinguishing the overlapping substrate specificities of these enzymes. both mutations were then combined in a single strain, resulting in a substantial shift in fermentation toward ethanol production. this double mutant produced 8.5-times  more ethanol than wild-type cells growing on crystalline cellulose. ethanol constituted 93% of the major fermentation products, corresponding to a molar ratio of ethanol to organic acids of 15, versus 0.18 in wild-type cells. during growth on acid-pretreated switchgrass, the double mutant also produced four times as much ethanol as wild-type cells. detailed metabolomic analyses identified increased flux through the oxidative branch of the mutant's tricarboxylic acid pathway. conclusions: the efficient intron-based gene inactivation system produced the first non-random, targeted mutations in c. cellulolyticum. as a key  component of the genetic toolbox for this bacterium, markerless targeted mutagenesis enables functional genomic research in c. cellulolyticum and rapid genetic engineering to significantly alter the mixture of fermentation products.  the initial application of this system successfully engineered a strain with high ethanol productivity from cellobiose, cellulose and switchgrass.

TI  == gene transfer to clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319.
AB  == although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process  of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. to remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319. firstly, transfer of tn1545 has been obtained using an enterococcus faecalis donor. secondly, incp-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. the yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic c. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. a restriction endonuclease was detected  in crude extracts of c. cellulolyticum. this enzyme, named cce:i, is an isoschizomer of msp:i (hpa:ii). electro-transformation was employed to establish  plasmids containing the replication functions of pamss1 (en. faecalis), pim13 (bacillus subtilis), pcb102 (clostridium butyricum), pip404 (clostridium perfringens) and pwv01 (lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in c. cellulolyticum. transformants were only obtained if the dna was appropriately methylated on the external c of the sequence 5'-ccgg-3' using either bsu:fi methylase in vivo or msp:i methylase in vitro. plasmids based on the pamss1 and pim13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pcb102 replicon. selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg dna) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg dna). the methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.
