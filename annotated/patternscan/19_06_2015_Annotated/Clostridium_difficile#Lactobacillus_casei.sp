TI  == lactobacillus species: taxonomic complexity and controversial susceptibilities.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus is a taxonomically complex and is composed of over 170 species that cannot be easily differentiated phenotypically and often require molecular identification. although they are part of the normal human gastrointestinal and vaginal flora, they can also be occasional human pathogens.  they are extensively used in a variety of commercial products including probiotics. their antimicrobial susceptibilities are poorly defined in part because of their taxonomic complexity and are compounded by the different methods recommended by clinical laboratory standards institute and international dairy foundation. their use as probiotics for prevention of clostridium difficile infection is prevalent among consumers worldwide but raises the question of will  the use of any concurrent antibiotic effect their ability to survive. lactobacillus species are generally acid resistant and are able to survive ingestion. they are generally resistant to metronidazole, aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin with l. acidophilus being susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin, whereas l. rhamnosus and l. casei are resistant to metronidazole and vancomycin.

TI  == a decade of experience in primary prevention of clostridium difficile infection at a community hospital using the probiotic combination lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2 (bio-k+).
AB  == in august 2003, the 284-bed community hospital pierre-le gardeur (plgh) in quebec experienced a major outbreak associated with the clostridium difficile nap1/027/bi strain. augmented standard preventive measures (spms) were not able to control this outbreak. it was decided in february 2004 to give to every adult  inpatient on antibiotics, without any exclusion, a probiotic (bio-k+: lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2) within 12 hours of the antibiotic prescription. augmented spms were continued. the use of the probiotic in addition to spms was associated with  a marked reduction of c. difficile infection (cdi). during the 10 years of observation, 44 835 inpatients received bio-k+, and the cdi rate at plgh declined from 18.0 cases per 10 000 patient-days and remained at low mean levels of 2.3 cases per 10 000 patient-days. additionally, 10-year data collected by the ministry of health in quebec comparing the cdi rate between quebec hospitals showed that cdi rates at plgh were consistently and continuously lower compared with those at similar hospitals. blood cultures were monitored at plgh for lactobacillus bacteremia through the 10 years' experience, and no lactobacillus bacteremias were detected. despite the limitation of an observational study, we concluded that the probiotic bio-k+ was safe and effective in decreasing our primary cdi rate.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2 (bio-k+): characterization, manufacture, mechanisms of action, and quality control of a specific probiotic combination for primary prevention of clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == a specific probiotic formulation composed of lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2 (bio-k+) has been marketed in north america since 1996. the strains and the commercial products have been evaluated for safety, identity, gastrointestinal survival, and stability throughout shelf life. the capacity of both the fermented beverages and the capsules to reduce incidences of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection (cdi) has been demonstrated in human clinical trials. individual strains and the finished products have shown antimicrobial activity against c. difficile and toxin a/b neutralization capacity in vitro. the use of this specific probiotic formulation as part of a bundle of preventive measures to control cdi in healthcare settings is discussed.

TI  == probiotics for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in older patients: a systematic review.
AB  == objective: here, we evaluated the efficacy of probiotic interventions in prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (aad) and clostridium difficile diarrhoea (cdd) in older patients. methods: pubmed, embase, central, cinahl, and  web of science were comprehensively searched from their dates of inception to may 2014. only randomised controlled trials reporting data on probiotics including lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, saccharomyces, streptococcus, enterococcus, and bacillus-alone or in combination-versus placebo or absence of treatment in older  patients (age >/=65 years) were included. risk ratios (rrs) for aad and cdd relative to placebo or absence of treatment were estimated. results: six trials with a total of 3562 patients were included. only one trial showed that bacillus  licheniformis was effective for preventing aad in older patients. however, there  was no preventive effect for aad and cdd with lactobacillus acidophilus (florajen), lactobacillus casei shirota, saccharomyces cerevisiae (boulardii) lyo, mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum (cultech strains), and mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus cul60, cul21, bifidobacterium  bifidum cul20 and b. lactis cul34. conclusions: our findings indicate that probiotics may not reduce the risk of aad and cdd in older patients. however, with current published data, it is difficult to draw concrete conclusions. to confirm these findings, sample sizes, multi-centre, double-blind studies that consider factors such as probiotic strains and types of antibiotics are required.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus l34 and lactobacillus casei l39 suppress clostridium difficile-induced il-8 production by colonic epithelial cells.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile is the main cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea and colitis known as c. difficile-associated disease (cdad).with increased severity and failure of treatment in cdad, new approaches for prevention and treatment, such as the use of probiotics, are needed. since the pathogenesis of cdad involves an inflammatory response with a massive influx of neutrophils recruited by interleukin (il)-8, this study aimed to investigate the probiotic effects of lactobacillus spp. on the suppression of il-8 production in response to c. difficile infection. results: we screened lactobacillus conditioned media from 34 infant fecal isolates for the ability to suppress c. difficile-induced il-8 production from ht-29 cells. factors produced by two vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli, l. rhamnosus l34 (lr-l34) and l.casei l39 (lc-l39), suppressed the  secretion and transcription of il-8 without inhibiting c. difficile viability or  toxin production. conditioned media from lr-l34 suppressed the activation of phospho-nf-kappab with no effect on phospho-c-jun. however, lc-l39 conditioned media suppressed the activation of both phospho-nf-kappab and phospho-c-jun. conditioned media from lr-l34 and lc-l39 also decreased the production of c. difficile-induced gm-csf in ht-29 cells. immunomodulatory factors present in the  conditioned media of both lr-l34 and lc-l39 are heat-stable up to 100 degrees c and > 100 kda in size. conclusions: our results suggest that l. rhamnosus l34 and l. casei l39 each produce factors capable of modulating inflammation stimulated by c. difficile. these vancomycin-resistant lactobacillus strains are potential probiotics for treating or preventing cdad.

TI  == role of lactobacillus in the prevention of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) is a major public health problem because of significant morbidity and mortality, and many clinicians pay attention to lactobacillus as a potentially effective treatment. the purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of lactobacillus in the prevention of cdad. methods: the databases medline, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, metaregister of controlled trials, national institutes of health, cnki, vip, and wanfang data were searched to locate all reported randomized controlled trials (rct) from 1990 to december 2012. only rct  in english and chinese using lactobacillus for the prevention of documented cdad  were considered for study inclusion. the data was analyzed by review manager and  spss software. results: seven placebo-controlled rcts that evaluated the prevention of cdad, which included 1486 subjects, accorded with inclusion and exclusion criteria. the mean age of the subjects ranged from 4.15 to 64.75 years  and the proportion of male subjects ranged from 42.0% to 59.1%. the total daily dose of lactobacillus ranged from 1.2x10(9)-1.2x10(12) colonyforming units (cfu). a low risk of bias was attributed to two studies and four studies evaluated a medium-level risk of bias. the combined risk ratio (rr) of developing cdad was significantly lower in subjects who received lactobacillus compared with subjects who received placebo (rr 0.38, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.22-0.67). a combination regimen of lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and lactobacillus casei (l. casei) (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36) showed significant effect sizes for the prevention of cdad, while single regimens of lactobacillus plantarum (l. plantarum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (l. rhamnosus) did not. across all trials, positive significant effects of lactobacillus were observed in the elderly subgroup (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36). whether the 1x10(12)-9x10(12) cfu/d lactobacillus could prevent cdad significantly or not was unclear. conclusion: there is a sufficient evidence to recommend lactobacillus (l. acidophilus and l. casei) as a prevention therapy for cdad.

TI  == bacterial counts from five over-the-counter probiotics: are you getting what you  paid for?
AB  == there is concern that the bacterial colony counts present at the time of manufacture and listed on the probiotic package may not be reflective of the numbers viable colonies at the time of purchase and patient consumption thereby diminishing efficacy. we performed a colony count study of three separate samples of five different probiotics purchased from three different stores: bifidobacterium infantis (align((r))); lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and  lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) (bio-k+((r))); lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (culturelle((r))); saccharomyces boulardii (florastor((r))) and "l. acidophilus"  and "lactobacillus helveticus" (lactinex((r))). approximately 1 g of powder of each (lactinex((r)) tablets were crushed before testing) was reconstituted in sterile distilled water, serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared and plated in duplicate onto blood agar plates, with incubation for 48 h in an anaerobic chamber (except the saccharomyces which was incubated aerobically) after which colony counts were performed. the florastor((r)) packaging did not state an expected concentration and was found to have 9.2 x 10(9)-1.3 x 10(10) cfu/g. lactinex((r)), align((r)), bio-k+((r)), and culturelle((r)) had viable colony counts that were similar to those stated on the package.

TI  == antipathogenic activity of probiotics against salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies  in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  == probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: lactobacillus casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), lactobacillus acidophilus ncimb 30184 (pxn 35), bifidobacterium breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera on the survival of salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile using ph-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on  probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). there was also a significant reduction in s. typhimurium and c. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely l. casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), and b. breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of s. typhimurium and c. difficile. in addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally  detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.

TI  == a lactobacillus casei shirota probiotic drink reduces antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in patients with spinal cord injuries: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == certain probiotics may prevent the development of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (aad) and clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (cdad), but their effectiveness depends on both strain and dose. there are few data on nutritional  interventions to control aad/cdad in the spinal cord injury (sci) population. the present study aimed to assess (1) the efficacy of consuming a commercially produced probiotic containing at least 6.5 x 10(9) live lactobacillus casei shirota (lcs) in reducing the incidence of aad/cdad, and (2) whether undernutrition and proton pump inhibitors (ppi) are risk factors for aad/cdad. a  total of 164 sci patients (50.1 (sd 17.8) years) with a requirement for antibiotics (median 21 d, range 5-366) were randomly allocated to receive lcs (n  76) or no probiotic (n 82). lcs was given once daily for the duration of the antibiotic course and continued for 7 days thereafter. nutritional risk was assessed by the spinal nutrition screening tool. the lcs group had a significantly lower incidence of aad (17.1 v. 54.9%, p< 0.001). at baseline, 65%  of patients were at undernutrition risk. undernutrition (64.1 v. 33.3%, p< 0.01)  and the use of ppi (38.4 v. 12.1 %, p= 0.022) were found to be associated with aad. however, no significant difference was observed in nutrient intake between the groups. the multivariate logistic regression analysis identified poor appetite ( < 1/2 meals eaten) (or 5.04, 95% ci 1.28, 19.84) and no probiotic (or  8.46, 95% ci 3.22, 22.20) as the independent risk factors for aad. the present study indicated that lcs could reduce the incidence of aad in hospitalised sci patients. a randomised, placebo-controlled study is needed to confirm this apparent therapeutic success in order to translate into improved clinical outcomes.

TI  == impact of adding prophylactic probiotics to a bundle of standard preventative measures for clostridium difficile infections: enhanced and sustained decrease in the incidence and severity of infection at a community hospital.
AB  == background: in 2003, hospitals in quebec, canada experienced an increase of nap1/027 clostridium difficile infections following antibiotic administration (cdiaa). at pierre-le gardeur hospital (plgh), the incidence increased from 10 to over 25 cases per 1000 patient admissions. methods: we report a quasi-experimental, prospective cohort study evaluating the effect on cdiaa of a  probiotic added to existing c. difficile infection (cdi) standard preventative measures (spm) in 31,832 hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics. phase i (1580) measured the impact of spm alone. in phase ii, 50 to 60 x 10(9) cfu daily  dose of oral lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285 and l. casei lbc80r probiotic formula (bio-k+) was administered to all patients receiving antibiotics. phase iii included the same intervention after a move to a new hospital facility. phases ii and iii included 4968 patients. during phase iv, 25,284 patients were submitted to the same regimen but outcome data were compared to those of similar  hospitals in quebec. results: at the end of phase iii, cdiaa had decreased from more than 18 cases per 1000 patient admissions in phase i to less than 5 cases. reductions of cdi cases (73%) (p < 0.001) and severe cdi cases (76.4%) (p < 0.001) were observed. cdi recurrence rate was reduced by 39% (p < 0.001). during  the following 6 years, the cdi rate averaged 2.71 cases per 10,000 patient-days at plgh compared to 8.50 cases per 10,000 patient-days in equivalent hospitals located in quebec. study limitation: this study is not a randomized clinical trial; it is an open prospective study and should be treated as such. also, following phase ii, plgh moved into a new facility and this could have contributed to lower cdi. conclusions: specific probiotic product added to spm and antibiotic stewardship activities resulted in a further reduction in cdi rates and was shown to be safe.

TI  == is primary prevention of clostridium difficile infection possible with specific probiotics?
AB  == background: the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of clostridium difficile infection (cdi) is highly controversial, particularly with regard to the prevention of recurrent cdi. we hypothesize that primary prevention of cdi among patients receiving antibiotics might be a more achievable goal for probiotics than prevention in patients with previous cdi where the host flora is  markedly altered. methods: we conducted a literature search for randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy studies of probiotic use among adults receiving antibiotics, in which cdi was one of the outcomes measured. in addition, we conducted meta-analyses of probiotics that were included in more than one randomized trial. results: eleven studies were identified; most were seriously underpowered to determine the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of cdi. two showed significantly lower rates of cdi among the probiotic recipients. a meta-analysis of three studies that used the probiotic combination lactobacillus  acidophilus cl1285 and lactobacillus casei lbc80r and a combined analysis of those studies with four studies that used saccharomyces boulardii, showed lower cdi rates in recipients of probiotics compared with recipients of placebo (risk ratio=0.39; 95% confidence interval 0.19-0.79). conclusions: while potential flaws in study design were identified, a review of the available literature suggests that the primary prevention of cdi with specific probiotic agents may be achievable. additional studies of sufficient size and with rigorous design are needed to confirm these findings.

TI  == savings from the use of a probiotic formula in the prophylaxis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  == objective: antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) and particularly clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) are the most common causes of healthcare associated infectious diarrhea. a double-blind, dose response, placebo-controlled trial of the probiotic formula (bio-k+ lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285 and lactobacillus casei lbc80r formula) for prophylaxis of aad and cdad was published in 2010. the bio-k+ lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285 and lactobacillus casei lbc80r formula is a registered trademark of bio-k plus international inc. (laval, quebec, canada). results indicated that the incidence of aad and cdad were lower  for patients assigned to the probiotic formula compared with the placebo option.  the present study aims to estimate the savings in direct medical costs that might result from the use of two different doses of the probiotic formula vs placebo. methods: a cost-consequence analysis was conducted to compare the two doses of the probiotic formula compared to placebo. the analysis was based upon published  data and adjusted to the north american context. results: economic analyses showed that the use of the probiotic formula would result in estimated mean per patients savings of us$1968 for the single dose and us$2661 for the double dose compared with the placebo option if used an average of 13 days by all patients at risk of developing aad and cdad. limitations: several key parameters considered within the economic model were not captured within the gao et al. study. numerous sensitivity analyses were conducted to address this issue. conclusion: the use of the probiotic formula in prophylaxis of aad and cdad would lead to estimated savings in direct medical costs that would substantially offset its acquisition cost. treating 1000 hospitalized patients on antibiotics with the double dose of  the product compared to current practice would save a single payer system the sum of $2,661,218.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

TI  == alternative therapies for clostridium difficile infections.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection is a serious condition responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, especially in patients being treated with antimicrobials. increasing frequency of the infection and hypervirulent c. difficile strains have resulted in more severe disease as well as therapeutic failures with traditional treatment (metronidazole and vancomycin). to review the studies assessing nontraditional therapies for the prevention and treatment of primary or recurrent c. difficile infection, we conducted a literature search of  the pubmed-medline databases (1984-2010). of the 98 studies identified, 21 met our inclusion criteria. five clinical trials and one retrospective medical record review evaluated probiotic or prebiotic formulations for the prevention of c. difficile infection. only one of these studies, which included lactobacillus casei and l. bulgaricus in the probiotic formulation, showed efficacy. ten clinical trials evaluated treatment of an initial episode of c. difficile infection (primary treatment) with the anti-microbials fidaxomicin, fusidic acid, rifampin, teicoplanin, and nitazoxanide, as well as the toxin-binding polymer, tolevamer. only nitazoxanide and teicoplanin demonstrated noninferiority when compared with vancomycin or metronidazole. four prospective studies and one retrospective study evaluated treatment of relapsing c. difficile infection. prebiotic formulations for the prevention and treatment of recurrent c. difficile infection have not proved to be clinically warranted. nitazoxanide, teicoplanin,  and fidaxomicin may be considered as alternatives to traditional treatment; however, clinical experience is limited with these agents for this indication. bacteriotherapy with fecal instillation has demonstrated high clinical cure rates in case studies and in a retrospective study; however, to our knowledge, randomized clinical trials are lacking for this therapeutic approach. as c. difficile infection rates continue to increase and hypervirulent strains continue to emerge, it is important for future clinical studies to assess alternative therapies.

TI  == dose-response efficacy of a proprietary probiotic formula of lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285 and lactobacillus casei lbc80r for antibiotic-associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea prophylaxis in adult patients.
AB  == objectives: standard therapies for antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) and clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) have limited efficacy. probiotic prophylaxis is a promising alternative for reduction of aad and cdad incidence. methods: in this single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study, we randomized 255 adult inpatients to one of three groups: two probiotic capsules per day (pro-2, n=86), one probiotic capsule and one placebo capsule per day (pro-1, n=85), or two placebo capsules per day (n=84). each probiotic capsule contained 50 billion c.f.u. of live organisms (lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285 +lactobacillus casei lbc80r bio-k+ cl1285). probiotic prophylaxis began within 36 h of initial antibiotic administration, continued for 5 days after the last antibiotic dose, and patients were followed for an additional 21 days. results: pro-2 (15.5%) had a lower aad incidence vs. pro-1 (28.2%). each probiotic group had a lower aad incidence vs. placebo (44.1%). in patients who acquired aad, pro-2 (2.8 days) and pro-1 (4.1 days) had  shorter symptom duration vs. placebo (6.4 days). similarly, pro-2 (1.2%) had a lower cdad incidence vs. pro-1 (9.4%). each treatment group had a lower cdad incidence vs. placebo (23.8%). gastrointestinal symptoms were less common in the  treatment groups vs. placebo and in pro-2 vs. pro-1. conclusions: the proprietary probiotic blend used in this study was well tolerated and effective for reducing  risk of aad and, in particular, cdad in hospitalized patients on antibiotics. a dose-ranging effect was shown with 100 billion c.f.u., yielding superior outcomes and fewer gastrointestinal events compared to 50 billion c.f.u. (clinicaltrials.gov number nct00958308).

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of rep3123 against clostridium difficile and other  anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the anaerobic spectrum of activity of rep3123, a novel diaryldiamine that inhibits bacterial methionyl-trna synthetases in gram-positive bacteria. methods: fifty recent clinical isolates of clostridium difficile from patients diagnosed with c. difficile infection and 223 other intestinal normal flora anaerobes were tested for their susceptibility to rep3123 and four or five comparator agents by the agar dilution method using supplemented brucella agar with 5% laked sheep blood. results: all strains of c.  difficile were inhibited by 0.5-1 mg/l rep3123, including those resistant to moxifloxacin and clindamycin. rep3123 lacked activity against many normal flora anaerobes in the gut, including clostridium ramosum, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli of the lactobacillus casei-rhamnosus-plantarum group and gram-negative anaerobes. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated good potency against c. difficile, but limited  activity against many other intestinal anaerobic species, thus, in theory, maintaining the colonization resistance barrier.

TI  == altered early infant gut microbiota in children developing allergy up to 5 years  of age.
AB  == background: early colonization with bifidobacteria and lactobacilli is postulated to protect children from allergy, while clostridium (c.) difficile colonization might be associated with allergic disease. previous studies of infant gut microbiota in relation to subsequent allergy development have mostly employed culture-dependent techniques, studied genera of bacteria and the follow-up period was limited to 2 years. objective: to relate gut microbiota in early infancy, notably bifidobacteria and lactobacilli at species level, to allergy development  during the first 5 years of life and study if environmental factors influence the early infant gut microbiota. methods: fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 47 swedish infants, followed prospectively to 5 years of age. bacterial dna was analysed with real-time pcr and related to allergy development, family size as well as endotoxin and fel d 1 levels in house dust samples. primers binding to c. difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and bacteroides fragilis were used. children regarded as  allergic manifested allergic symptoms and were skin prick test positive during their first 5 years while non-allergic children were neither. results: children who developed allergy were significantly less often colonized with lactobacilli group i (lactobacillus (l.) rhamnosus, l. casei, l. paracasei), bifidobacterium adolescentis and c. difficile during their first 2 months. infants colonized with several bifidobacterium species had been exposed to higher amounts of endotoxin and grew up in larger families than infants harbouring few species. conclusion: a more diverse gut microbiota early in life might prevent allergy development and may be related to the previously suggested inverse relationship between allergy,  family size and endotoxin exposure.

TI  == use of probiotic lactobacillus preparation to prevent diarrhoea associated with antibiotics: randomised double blind placebo controlled trial.
AB  == objective: to determine the efficacy of a probiotic drink containing lactobacillus for the prevention of any diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use  and that caused by clostridium difficile. design: randomised double blind placebo controlled study. participants: 135 hospital patients (mean age 74) taking antibiotics. exclusions included diarrhoea on admission, bowel pathology that could result in diarrhoea, antibiotic use in the previous four weeks, severe illness, immunosuppression, bowel surgery, artificial heart valves, and history of rheumatic heart disease or infective endocarditis. intervention: consumption of a 100 g (97 ml) drink containing lactobacillus casei, l bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus twice a day during a course of antibiotics and for one week after the course finished. the placebo group received a longlife sterile milkshake. main outcome measures: primary outcome: occurrence of antibiotic associated diarrhoea. secondary outcome: presence of c difficile toxin and diarrhoea. results: 7/57 (12%) of the probiotic group developed diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use compared with 19/56 (34%) in the placebo group (p=0.007). logistic regression to control for other factors gave an odds ratio 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.85) for use of the probiotic, with low albumin and sodium also increasing the risk of diarrhoea. the absolute risk reduction was 21.6% (6.6% to 36.6%), and the number needed to treat was 5 (3 to 15). no one in the probiotic group and 9/53 (17%) in the placebo group had diarrhoea caused by c difficile (p=0.001). the absolute risk reduction was 17% (7% to 27%), and the number needed to treat was 6 (4 to 14). conclusion: consumption of a probiotic drink containing l casei, l bulgaricus, and s thermophilus can reduce the incidence of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and c difficile associated diarrhoea. this has the potential to decrease morbidity, healthcare costs, and mortality if used routinely in patients aged over 50. trial registration: national research register n0016106821.

TI  == in vitro activities of the new semisynthetic glycopeptide telavancin (td-6424), vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and four comparator agents against anaerobic gram-positive species and corynebacterium spp.
AB  == telavancin is a new semisynthetic glycopeptide anti-infective with multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition of bacterial membrane phospholipid synthesis and inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. we determined the in vitro activities of telavancin, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin against 268 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive organisms and 31 corynebacterium strains using agar dilution methods according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards procedures. plates with daptomycin were supplemented with ca(2+) to 50 mg/liter. the mics at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited (mic(90)s) for telavancin and vancomycin were as follows: actinomyces spp. (n = 45), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium difficile (n = 14), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium ramosum (n =  16), 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium innocuum (n = 15), 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium clostridioforme (n = 15), 8 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; eubacterium group (n = 33), 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; lactobacillus spp. (n = 26), 0.5 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; propionibacterium spp. (n = 34), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; peptostreptococcus spp. (n  = 52), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; and corynebacterium spp. (n = 31),  0.03 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of td-6424 was similar to that of quinupristin-dalfopristin for most strains except c. clostridioforme and lactobacillus casei, where quinupristin-dalfopristin was three- to fivefold more  active. daptomycin had decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against 14 strains  of actinomyces spp. and all c. ramosum, eubacterium lentum, and lactobacillus plantarum strains. linezolid showed decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against c. ramosum, two strains of c. difficile, and 15 strains of lactobacillus  spp. imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were active against >98% of strains. the mics of ampicillin for eight clostridium spp. and three strains of l. casei were >1 microg/ml. the mic(90) of td-6424 for all strains tested was </=2 microg/ml. td-6424 has potential for use against infections with gram-positive anaerobes and deserves further clinical evaluation.

TI  == probiotics up-regulate muc-2 mucin gene expression in a caco-2 cell-culture model.
AB  == enteral probiotics such as lactobacillus casei gg (lgg) have been used in the treatment of a variety of intestinal disorders in infants and children, including diarrhea, malabsorption, and clostridium difficile colitis. previous studies have identified the gene locus for mucin (muc-2) and its expression in caco-2 cells. others have demonstrated that mucin, located on the surface of the intestinal epithelium, inhibits bacterial translocation (bt). we previously demonstrated that both mucin and the probiotic bacterium lgg have an inhibitory effect on bt in both an in-vitro caco-2 cell model and a neonatal rabbit model. we hypothesized that the decline in bt by lgg is mediated by up-regulation of epithelial muc-2. human enterocyte caco-2 cells were grown to confluence and incubated at 37 degrees c with either medium (control group) or 10(4) or 10(8) lgg for 180 min. non-adherent lgg was washed away. caco-2 cells were then lysed,  purified, and quantified for muc-2 protein and mrna. the addition of lgg to the enterocyte monolayer surface resulted in significantly ( p < 0.05) increased muc-2 expression compared to the untreated monolayers. protein densities for muc-2 significantly ( p < 0.05) increased with lgg. density (expressed as ratio to control group) was 8.6 +/- 1.3 in the low-dose group (10(4) lgg) and 15.6 +/-  2.3 in the high-dose group (10(8) lgg). lgg may thus bind to specific receptor sites on the enterocyte and stimulate the up-regulation of muc-2, resulting in increased inhibition of bt.

TI  == lack of effect of lactobacillus gg on antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == objectives: to assess the efficacy of lactobacillus gg in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) in adults and, secondarily, to assess the effect of coadministered lactobacillus gg on the number of tests performed to determine the cause of diarrhea. patients and methods: in this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from july 1998 to october 1999, 302 hospitalized patients receiving antibiotics were randomized to  receive lactobacillus gg, 20 x 10(9) cfu/d, or placebo for 14 days. subjects recorded the number of stools and their consistency daily for 21 days. the primary outcome was the proportion of patients who developed diarrhea in the first 21 days after enrollment. weekly telephone follow-up was also performed. results were analyzed in an intention-to-treat fashion. results: diarrhea developed in 39 (29.3%) of 133 patients randomized to receive lactobacillus gg and in 40 (29.9%) of 134 patients randomized to receive placebo (p=.93). no additional difference in the rate of occurrence of diarrhea was found between treatment and placebo patients in a subgroup analysis of those treated with beta-lactam vs non-beta-lactam antibiotics. too few patients had stool cultures,  additional laboratory tests for diarrhea, or a positive diagnosis of clostridium  difficile infection to assess between-group differences. conclusion: lactobacillus gg in a dose of 20 x 10(9) cfu/d did not reduce the rate of occurrence of diarrhea in this sample of 267 adult patients taking antibiotics initially administered in the hospital setting.

TI  == effect of probiotics on enterocyte bacterial translocation in vitro.
AB  == enteral probiotics such as lactobacillus casei gg (lgg) have been used in the treatment of a variety of intestinal disorders in infants and children, including diarrhea, malabsorption, and clostridium difficile colitis. we have previously demonstrated that the probiotic bacterium lgg has an inhibitory effect on bacterial translocation (bt) in a neonatal rabbit model. however, this in-vivo model is limited for investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for probiotic inhibition of bt. the purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of lgg in reducing the rate of escherichia coli c25 (e. coli c25) translocation using an in-vitro enterocyte cell-culture model. human colonic carcinoma (caco-2) enterocytes were seeded in porous filters in the apical chamber of a two-chamber cell-culture system and grown for 14 days to confluence. the monolayers were incubated at 37 degrees c with lgg for 180 min. non-adherent lgg was washed away prior to a 120-min incubation period with 10(5)  cfu e. coli c25. e. coli that had translocated across the enterocyte monolayer were quantified by growing basal-chamber media samples on gram-negative bacteria-specific macconkey's agar. in order to determine monolayer integrity, transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) was measured across caco-2 cells treated with lgg and e. coli. statistical analysis was by anova with p < 0.05 considered significant. lgg inhibited e. coli translocation at all lgg concentrations tested. the teer ratio was not significantly altered by addition of lgg or e. coli (0.9 +/- 0.03 vs 0.8 +/- 0.05). these results demonstrate that  the probiotic bacterium lgg inhibits bt of e. coli c25 in a dose-dependent manner in an in-vitro cell-culture model. this model should be valuable in investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibition of pathological  enteral bacteria by probiotic agents.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == treatment and prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  == mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) are common side effects of antibiotic therapy. the incidence of aad differs with the antibiotic and varies from 5 to 25%. the major form of intestinal disorders is the pseudomembranous colitis associated with clostridium difficile which occurs in 10-20% of all aad. in most cases of aad discontinuation or replacement of the inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower aad risk can be effective. for more severe cases involving c. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. another approach to aad treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem. several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of aad such as selected strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus faecium. another biotherapeutic agent, a non-pathogenic yeast, saccharomyces boulardii has been used. in animal models of  c. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with s. boulardii  (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in c. difficile colony-forming units, and of toxin b production. in several clinical randomised trials (versus placebo), s. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by decreasing significantly the occurrence of c. difficile colitis and preventing the pathogenic effects of toxins a and b of c. difficile. it has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in relapses of c. difficile colitis. a good response has been seen in children with aad, treated by s. boulardii only. in icus prevention of aad remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of c. difficile or other agents of aad should be prevented by improved hygiene measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand washing for personnel). in addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents such as s. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of antibiotics, i.e. aad in at risk patients.

TI  == probiotics and gastrointestinal health.
AB  == evidence for positive health benefits of lactobacilli applies to only a few strains used for commercial applications. it is generally agreed that a probiotic must be capable of colonizing the intestinal tract to influence human health; this requirement disqualifies many of the strains currently used in fermented dairy products. lactobacillus gg, a variant of l. casei sps rhamnosus, has been studied extensively in adults and children. when consumed as a dairy product or as a lyophilized powder, lgg colonizes the gastrointestinal tract for 1-3 days in most individuals and up to 7 days in about 30% of subjects. traveler's diarrhea,  antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and relapsing clostridium difficile colitis are improved with lgg. in infantile diarrhea, the severity and duration of the attack is reduced. lgg-fermented milk lessens the intestinal permeability defects caused by exposure to cows milk or rotavirus infection. lgg has proven beneficial effects on intestinal immunity. it increases the numbers of iga and other immunoglobulin-secreting cells in the intestinal mucosa. lgg stimulates local release of interferon. it facilitates antigen transport to underlying lymphoid cells, which serves to increase antigen uptake in peyer's patches. lgg also acts  as an immunoadjuvant for oral vaccines. in an animal model of colon cancer, lgg reduced the incidence of chemically induced tumors in the large bowel of rodents. extensive safety testing has shown no pathogenic potential in humans or animals.  probiotic cultures of lactobacilli have the potential to bring substantial health benefits to the consumer. the purported benefits for any probiotic must pass the  highest standards of scientific scrutiny before the claims can be accepted.

AB  == pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. the overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:saccharomyces boulardii, lactobacillus casei gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, bifidobacterium bifidum, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. vaginitis has been experimentally studied  using l. acidophilus and l. casei gg. the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements  involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.
