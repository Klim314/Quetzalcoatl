TI  - Efficacy of amoxicillin and metronidazole combination for the management of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of metronidazole-amoxicillin combination on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients were randomly included. The test group (n = 12) received amoxicillin-metronidazole combination and scaling and root planing; the control group (n = 16) received scaling and root planing alone. In addition to the clinical examinations, subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for total cultivable bacteria and the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella pallens, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) using polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: All clinical parameters improved significantly compared to baseline (P <0.05) in both groups. There was a statistically significant reduction of pockets and clinical attachment gain in the combined group compared to the control group (P <0.05). Total counts of bacteria also decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months in both groups (P <0.05). T. denticola and T. forsythia were the most prevalent bacteria throughout the study. T. denticola showed a continuous decrease over 6 months in the test group, whereas no change was seen in the control group beyond 3 months. P. gingivalis decreased significantly at 3 months (P <0.05), whereas T. forsythia was the only pathogen decreased below detection limits by the combination therapy with a significant difference compared to the control group (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggest that combined amoxicillin and metronidazole use as an adjunct to scaling and root planing leads to better clinical healing compared to mechanical treatment alone. The polypharmaceutical approach used results in a significant and substantial decrease in T. forsythia and prevents its recolonization for 6 months, suggesting that T. forsythia may determine the long-term stability of periodontal treatment outcomes.
TI  - Direct quantitative differentiation between Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella  nigrescens in clinical specimens.
AB  - This paper describes a quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for the differential identification of Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens in clinical samples, and compares its performance with less discriminatory culture and quantitative immunofluorescence (IF) assays. Fluorescence-labelled oligonucleotide probes directed to specific 16S rRNA sequences of P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Prevotella pallens and Prevotella denticola were hybridized under stringent conditions with cultured reference strains or plaque samples from deep periodontal pockets. Probe specificity was defined with strains from multiple oral Prevotella species. The lower detection level of the assays was approximately 3x10(3) target cells per ml of plaque-sample suspension. P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, P. pallens and P. denticola were detected in plaques with prevalences of 69, 67, 0 and 28%, respectively. On average, 3.9 x 10(6) P. intermedia, 3.1 x 10(6) P. nigrescens and 5.6 x 10(5) P. denticola cells were counted per positive sample. All three species were found almost exclusively in dense mixed aggregates. Quantitative FISH data agreed satisfactorily with corresponding IF data (r=0.711). Both FISH and IF enumerations of the sum of P. intermedia and P. nigrescens markedly exceeded the c.f.u. counts of black-pigmented colonies in Porphyromonas gingivalis-free cultured subgingival plaques. The results demonstrate the validity of this new assay. Unlike established IF, culture, PCR or checkerboard DNA hybridization assays, this FISH assay differentiates quantitatively between P. intermedia and P. nigrescens, provides visual accuracy control, and offers insights into the spatial distribution of the target cells within a clinical sample.
