TI  == arabinoxylans and inulin differentially modulate the mucosal and luminal gut microbiota and mucin-degradation in humanized rats.
AB  == the endogenous gut microbiota affects the host in many ways. prebiotics should favour beneficial intestinal microbes and thus improve host health. in this study, we investigated how a novel class of potential prebiotic long-chain arabinoxylans (lc-ax) and the well-established prebiotic inulin (in) modulate the gut microbiota of humanized rats. six weeks after axenic rats were inoculated with a human faecal microbiota, their colonic microbiota was similar to this inoculum ( approximately 70%), whereas their caecal microbiota was enriched with  verrucomicrobia and firmicutes concomitant with lower abundance of bacteroidetes. moreover, different bifidobacterium species colonized the lumen (b. adolescentis) and mucus (b. longum and b. bifidum). both lc-ax and in increased scfa levels and induced a shift from acetate towards health-promoting propionate and butyrate respectively. by applying a high-resolution phylogenetic micro-array (hitchip) at the site of fermentation (caecum), in and lc-ax were shown to stimulate bacterial groups with known butyrate-producers (roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, anaerostipes caccae) and bifidobacteria (b. longum) respectively. prebiotic administration also resulted in lower caecal abundances of the mucin-degrading akkermansia muciniphila and potentially more mucin production by  the host. both factors might explain the increased caecal mucin levels for lc-ax  (threefold) and in (sixfold). these mucins were degraded along the colon, resulting in high faecal abundances of akkermansia muciniphila for lc-ax and especially in-treated rats. finally, the microbial changes caused an adaptation period for the host with less weight gain, after which the host fine-tuned the interaction with this altered microbiota. our results demonstrate that next to in, lc-ax are promising prebiotic compounds by stimulating production of health-promoting metabolites by specific microbes in the proximal regions. further, prebiotic supplementation shifted mucin degradation to distal regions, where mucin-degraders may produce beneficial metabolites (e.g. propionate by akkermansia muciniphila), so that prebiotics may potentially improve gut health along the entire length of the intestine.

TI  == highlighting new phylogenetic specificities of crohn's disease microbiota.
AB  == background: recent studies suggest that gastrointestinal (gi) microbes play a part in the pathogenesis of crohn's disease (cd). methods: fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 16 cd patients (age- and sex-matched).  the dna extracted from these samples were subjected to two different methods of microbiome analysis. specific bacterial groups were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods using primers designed using a high-throughput in-house bioinformatics pipeline. the same dna extracts were also used to produce fluorescently labeled crna amplicons to interrogate a custom-designed phylogenetic microarray for intestinal bacteria. results: even though the intersubject variability was high, differences in the fecal microbiomes of healthy and cd patients were detected. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and escherichia coli were more represented in healthy and ileal cd patients, respectively. additionally, probes specific for ruminococcus bromii, oscillibacter valericigenes, bifidobacterium bifidum, and eubacterium rectale produced stronger hybridization signals with the dna samples from healthy subjects. conversely, species overrepresented in cd patients were e. coli, enterococcus faecium, and species from the proteobacteria not normally found in the healthy human gi tract. furthermore, we detected "healthy specific" molecular species or operational taxonomic units (otus) that are not closely related to any known species (faecalibacterium, subdoligranulum, and oscillospora species), indicating that the phylogenetic dysbiosis is broader than at strain or species level. conclusions: these two techniques of microbiome analysis provided a statistically robust new picture of the dysbiosis in fecal microbiota from ileal  cd patients. specifically, we identified a set of six species discriminant for cd, which provides a preliminary diagnostic tool.

TI  == selective colonization of insoluble substrates by human faecal bacteria.
AB  == insoluble plant polysaccharides and endogenous mucin are important energy sources for human colonic microorganisms. the object of this study was to determine whether or not specific communities colonize these substrates. using faecal samples from four individuals as inocula for an anaerobic in vitro continuous flow system, the colonization of wheat bran, high amylose starch and porcine gastric mucin was examined. recovered substrates were extensively washed and the  remaining tightly attached bacterial communities were identified using polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s rrna gene sequences and fluorescent in situ hybridization. the substrate had a major influence on the species of attached bacteria detected. sequences retrieved from bran were dominated by clostridial cluster xiva bacteria, including uncultured relatives of clostridium hathewayi, eubacterium rectale and roseburia species. bacteroides species were also detected. the most abundant sequences recovered from starch were related to the cultured species ruminococcus bromii, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve and e. rectale. the most commonly recovered sequences from  mucin were from bifidobacterium bifidum and uncultured bacteria related to ruminococcus lactaris. this study suggests that a specific subset of bacteria is  likely to be the primary colonizers of particular insoluble colonic substrates. for a given substrate, however, the primary colonizing species may vary between host individuals.

TI  == genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.
