TI  == effects of long-term ingestion of difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii) on intestinal bacteria and bile acid metabolism in humans.
AB  == changes in the intestinal microbiota of 10 human subjects with long-term ingestion of 3 g/d difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii; 4 persons, 2 months; 3 persons, 6 months; and 3 persons, 12 months) were examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). according to the answers to questionnaires, the subjects were divided into two groups (constipated and normal). the dgge profile  was different for every individual and each subject had unique profiles of intestinal microbiota. in the dgge profiles of constipated subjects, the intensities of bands related to bacteroides spp. increased. moreover, the dfa iii-assimilating bacteria, ruminococcus sp. were isolated from subjects who ingested dfa iii for 12 months. these strains showed 95% similarity of their 16s  rdna sequences with that of ruminococcus obeum atcc 29174(t) (x85101) and produced large amounts of acetic acid. dfa iii ingestion for 2 months tended to increase total organic acids in feces, and tended to decrease fecal ph and the secondary bile acid (sba) ratio in total bile acids. the sba ratio in total bile  acids corresponded to fecal ph. the production of sba was decreased by low ph in  vitro. these results indicated that dfa iii ingestion in humans tended to lower intestinal ph, inhibited bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation activities and also tended to decrease the sba ratios in total bile acids. moreover, as another cause for the decrease in the sba ratio in total bile acids, it was suggested that the  number of bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria were decreased by dfa iii ingestion.
