TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == [retrospective analysis of fusobacterium associated infections; experience at aomori prefectural hospital with 108 cases from 1995 to 1999].
AB  == we experienced 108 cases of fusobacterium associated infections, including otolaryngeal, oral, pleuropulmonary, intraabdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, at aomori prefectural hospital during the 5 year-period from 1995 to  1999. a total of 433 organisms, included 113 fusobacterium spp. (80 fusobacterium nucleatum, 18 fusobaterium necrophorum, 5 fusobacterium varium, 4 fusobacterium mortiferum, 6 fusobacterium spp.), were recovered with an average of 4.0 organisms per case of the 108 cases, 68% were mixed aerobic and anaerobic and yielded 185 anaerobic bacteria (2.5 per case) and 137 aerobic bacteria (1.9 per case) with an average of 4.4 per case. the remaining 32% were purely anaerobic and yielded 111 organisms with an average of 3.2 per case, prevotella spp., bacteroides fragilis group, streptococcus milleri group, enterobacteriaceae, peptostreptococcus spp. staphylococcus spp. were most frequently coisolated with  fusobacterium spp.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of shallow periodontal pockets in individuals after head and neck irradiation.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the subgingival plaque microorganisms of shallow pockets (< or = 5 mm) in subjects who previously received irradiation in  the head and neck region for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. direct microscopy and anaerobic culture were used. subgingival paper point samples were  taken from 6 tooth-sites (one/sextant) per subject for direct microscopy (n = 108). another set of paper points was taken from the deepest of the previously selected sites (one per subject) with: group a) no bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 9) and group b) bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 6) for microscopic and anaerobic culture study. under the microscope, the microflora was found to be a complex mixture comprising gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, rods and filaments, fusiforms, curved rods and spirochetes. low level of fungi were observed and mycelia were occasionally detected. there was no significant variation in the plaque bacterial morphotypes observable according to sites of isolation and no significant difference between group a and group b in morphotypes of the different microflora. the predominant cultivable microflora comprised several species of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria: gemella, peptostreptococcus, staphylococcus, stomatococcus, streptococcus, actinomyces, eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, neisseria, veillonella, bacteroides, campylobacter, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, kingella, porphyromonas and prevotella species. there was no difference between the two groups except the significantly higher proportion of kingella dentrificans isolated from group b sites. however, colonization of the gingival sulcus in these individuals by microbes that are normal flora of: skin (peptostreptococcus  prevotii and propionibacterium granulosum) and gut (eubacterium aerofaciens, fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium) was detected. these findings appear to suggest that the major components of the subgingival microflora of shallow sites in previously head- and neck-irradiated individuals are similar to  that of gingivitis sites in the normal population although they may contain bacterial or fungal species uncommon in normal subjects.

TI  == intergeneric protoplast fusion between fusobacterium varium and enterococcus faecium for enhancing dehydrodivanillin degradation.
AB  == intergeneric protoplast fusion between fusobacterium varium (pcs glu+) and enterococcus faecium (pcr glu-) was performed under strictly anaerobic conditions to improve dehydrodivanillin (ddv) degradation. the fusion frequency obtained from the selective medium (pc+ glu-) was about 0.9 x 10(-5) to 1.3 x 10(-5). the  seven fusants isolated were all gram-negative anaerobes with rod shapes like that of f. varium and with main phenotypical properties of cocci like those of e. faecium such as esculin and starch hydrolysis, milk clotting, and lactate production. five fusants showed enhanced ddv degradation activities that were 2 to 4 times higher than those of parental strains. genetic relatedness between a fusant (fe7) and the parents was estimated by dna-dna southern blot hybridization with 32p-labeled chromosomal dna fragments of f. varium and e. faecium as respective probes. the fusant fe7 presented a very high cross-hybridization with  both probes, indicating a high dna homology between the fusant and both parental  strains. almost all the fusants obtained here have stably kept the properties described above for about 2 years. these results suggest that intergeneric gene transfer takes place through protoplast fusion and that the fusants that were obtained are stable recombinants.

TI  == protoplast formation and regeneration of dehydrodivanillin-degrading strains of fusobacterium varium and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == two strains of rumen anaerobes isolated from dehydrodivanillin-degrading cultures were identified as fusobacterium varium and enterococcus faecium. these organisms degraded dehydrodivanillin synergistically to 5-carboxymethylvanillin and vanillic acid. specific conditions for protoplast formation and cell wall regeneration for both bacteria were determined, under strictly anaerobic conditions, to be as follows. the cell wall of each bacterium in yeast extract medium was loosened by adding penicillin g during early log-phase growth. the cell wall of f. varium was lysed by lysozyme (1 mg/ml) in glycerol (0.2 m)-phosphate buffer (0.05 m; ph 7.0). the addition of nacl (0.08 m) with lysozyme was necessary for lysis of e. faecium in this solution. almost all cells were converted to protoplasts after 2 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. regeneration of both protoplasts was 20 to 30% on an agar-containing yeast extract medium.

TI  == potent antagonism of escherichia coli, bacteroides ovatus, fusobacterium varium,  and enterococcus faecalis, alone or in combination, for enteropathogens in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  == interactions between representative strains of four predominant resident bacteria of the human colon, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus,  and fusobacterium varium, and strains of seven enteropathogens, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio parahaemolyticus, v. cholerae serogroup non o1, staphylococcus aureus, and clostridium perfringens, were examined in studies with an anaerobic continuous flow culture system and medium resembling the content of the mouse caecum (mcm).  potent unilateral antagonism attributable to synergic activities of the resident  bacteria against the enteropathogens was evident. the four resident bacteria persisted at levels of c. 10(6) cfu/ml or more in single and in any mixed cultures of the resident species. the seven enteropathogens also persisted in single cultures. in contrast, y. enterocolitica was excluded in several days in mixed cultures with each of the four resident bacteria. sh. flexneri and staph. aureus were excluded in the presence of e. coli alone. c. perfringens, v. parahaemolyticus and v. cholerae serogroup non o1 were excluded in the presence of e. coli with b. ovatus and, in some cases, with additional species. s. typhimurium was the most resistant; only c. 10(2)-fold reduction of the population level was observed in mixed culture with all four of the resident species. when the amounts of some components in the medium, such as peptone and yeast extract, were increased, c. perfringens grew and persisted even in the presence of the four resident bacteria. sh. flexneri, in contrast decreased steadily, even in enriched media.

TI  == the relationship between fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  == mixed infections with three fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. fifteen fusobacterium isolates (eight f. nucleatum, four f. necrophorum, and three f. varium) and one isolate each of bacteroides fragilis, b. asaccharolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, group a beta-haemolytic streptococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before  and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. after co-inoculation  of fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were fusobacterium isolates, while fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than group a streptococci  and e. coli. mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with fusobacterium spp. and k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa or bacteroides spp. suppression of fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with group a streptococci. the additive or synergistic capabilities of fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.
