TI  == diverse and bioactive endophytic aspergilli inhabit cupressaceae plant family.
AB  == aspergilli are filamentous, cosmopolitan and ubiquitous fungi which have significant impact on human, animal and plant welfare worldwide. due to their extraordinary metabolic diversity, aspergillus species are used in biotechnology  for the production of a vast array of biomolecules. however, little is known about aspergillus species that are able to adapt an endophytic lifestyle in cupressaceae plant family and are capable of producing cytotoxic, antifungal and  antibacterial metabolites. in this work, we report a possible ecological niche for pathogenic fungi such as aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillus flavus. indeed, our findings indicate that a. fumigatus, a. flavus, aspergillus niger var. niger and a. niger var. awamori adapt an endophytic lifestyle inside the cupressaceous plants including cupressus arizonica, cupressus sempervirens var. fastigiata, cupressus semipervirens var. cereiformis, and thuja orientalis. in addition, we found that extracts of endophytic aspergilli showed significant growth inhibition and cytotoxicity against the model fungus pyricularia oryzae and bacteria such as bacillus sp., erwinia amylovora and pseudomonas syringae. these endophytic aspergilli also showed in vitro antifungal effects on the cypress fungal phytopathogens including diplodia seriata, phaeobotryon cupressi and spencermartinsia viticola. in conclusion, our findings clearly support the endophytic association of aspergilli with cupressaceae plants and their possible  role in protection of host plants against biotic stresses. observed bioactivities of such endophytic aspergilli may represent a significant potential for bioindustry and biocontrol applications.

TI  == antiproliferative, antifungal, and antibacterial activities of endophytic alternaria species from cupressaceae.
AB  == recent research has shown the bioprospecting of endophytic fungi from cupressaceae. here, we further uncover that the healthy cypress plants such as cupressus arizonica, cupressus sempervirens var. cereiformis, and thuja orientalis host highly bioactive endophytic alternaria fungal species. indeed, endophytic alternaria alternata, alternaria pellucida, and alternaria tangelonis  were recovered from healthy cupressaceous trees. biodiversity and bioactivity of  recovered endophytic alternaria species were a matter of biogeography and host identity. we further extracted such alternaria's metabolites and highlighted their significant antiproliferative, growth inhibitory, and antibacterial activities against the model target fungus pyricularia oryzae and the model pathogenic bacteria bacillus sp., erwinia amylovora, and pseudomonas syringae. in vitro assays also indicated that endophytic alternaria species significantly inhibited the growth of cypress fungal phytopathogens diplodia seriata, phaeobotryon cupressi, and spencermartinsia viticola. in conclusion, since the recovered alternaria species were originally reported as pathogenic and allergenic fungi, our findings suggest a possible ecological niche for them inside the foliar tissues of cupressaceous trees. moreover, in this study, the significant bioactivities of endophytic alternaria species in association with cupressaceae plant family are reported.

TI  == cis-antisense rna, another level of gene regulation in bacteria.
AB  == a substantial amount of antisense transcription is a hallmark of gene expression  in eukaryotes. however, antisense transcription was first demonstrated in bacteria almost 50 years ago. the transcriptomes of bacteria as different as helicobacter pylori, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, mycoplasma pneumoniae, sinorhizobium meliloti, geobacter sulfurreducens, vibrio cholerae, chlamydia trachomatis, pseudomonas syringae, and staphylococcus aureus have now been reported to contain antisense rna (asrna) transcripts for a high percentage of genes. bacterial asrnas share functional similarities with trans-acting regulatory rnas, but in addition, they use their own distinct mechanisms. among their confirmed functional roles are transcription termination, codegradation, control of translation, transcriptional interference, and enhanced stability of their respective target transcripts. here, we review recent publications indicating that asrnas occur as frequently in simple unicellular bacteria as they do in higher organisms, and we provide a comprehensive overview of the experimentally confirmed characteristics of asrna actions and intimately linked quantitative aspects. emerging functional data suggest that asrnas in bacteria mediate a plethora of effects and are involved in far more processes than were previously anticipated. thus, the functional impact  of asrnas should be considered when developing new strategies against pathogenic  bacteria and when optimizing bacterial strains for biotechnology.

TI  == characteristics and antimicrobial activity of bacillus subtilis strains isolated  from soil.
AB  == antagonistic bacillus strains were isolated from soil and analyzed for the purpose of determining whether they could be used as natural biological agents. primary in vitro screening for antagonism of the isolates was performed against five phytopathogenic mould fungi. strains ts 01 and zr 02 exhibited the most pronounced inhibitory effects. they were identified as bacillus subtilis on the basis of their morphological, cultural and physiology-biochemical properties as well as their hierarchical cluster analysis conducted by means of computer program spss. the antimicrobial activity of the strains from cultural medium and  sterile filtrate were determined in vitro against a great number of predominantly phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria. ts 01 and zr 02 strains exhibited very broad  and at the same time degree varying antibiotic spectra of activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. many of them were tested against  sensitivity to the antimicrobial action of b. subtilis for the very first time. b. subtilis ts 01 and zr 02 showed highest antifungal activity (sterile zone in diameter over 37 mm) against alternaria solani, botrytis cinerea, monilia linhartiana 869, phytophthora cryptogea 759/1 and rhizoctonia sp. the most sensitive bacterial species were found to be pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato ro and xanthomonas campestris with sterile zones 48.0 and 50.0 mm in diameter, respectively. the latter draws a conclusion that the isolated and identified bacillus subtilis strains are promising natural biocontrol agents and should be further studied and tested for control of numerous plant diseases.

TI  == protection against pathogen and salt stress by four plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria isolated from pinus sp. on arabidopsis thaliana.
AB  == the ability of four plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, isolated in a previous  study, to induce systemic resistance on arabidopsis thaliana col 0 against biotic and abiotic stress was evaluated. all the bacteria enhanced protection against the foliar pathogen pseudomonas syringae dc3000 and increased plant tolerance to  salt stress (nacl 60 mm). bacillus sp. strain l81 and arthrobacter oxidans strain bb1 performed best with a decrease in the disease index of 61.2 and 52.3%, respectively, and a reduction in the mortality due to salt stress of 72.4 and 57.8%, respectively. additionally, significant differences were found in growth and photosynthesis, again, l81 and bb1 performed best either in normal or under stress conditions. in order to elucidate the pathway elicited by these two strains to induce systemic resistance, experiments with the transgenic line of arabidopsis thaliana nahg (defective in salicylic acid [sa]) and with the jar1 mutant (defective in jasmonic acid) were carried out. results showed that the sa-dependent pathway was involved in the defense response induced by strains l81  and bb1. results from quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the pr1 gene, related to the sa-dependent pathway and the pdf1.2 gene related to the sa-independent pathway, showed an increased expression of pr1 in bb1-treated plants, confirming involvement of the sa-dependent pathway  in the defensive response.

TI  == development of biocontrol agents from food microbial isolates for controlling post-harvest peach brown rot caused by monilinia fructicola.
AB  == an unconventional strategy of screening food microbes for biocontrol activity was used to develop biocontrol agents for controlling post-harvest peach brown rot caused by monilinia fructicola. forty-four microbial isolates were first screened for their biocontrol activity on apple fruit. compared with the pathogen-only check, seven of the 44 isolates reduced brown rot incidence by >50%, including four bacteria: bacillus sp. c06, lactobacillus sp. c03-b and bacillus sp. t03-c,  lactobacillus sp. p02 and three yeasts: saccharomyces delbrueckii a50, s. cerevisiae ye-5 and s. cerevisiae a41. eight microbial isolates were selected for testing on peaches by wound co-inoculation with mixtures of individual microbial  cultures and conidial suspension of m. fructicola. only two of them showed significant biocontrol activity after five days of incubation at 22 degrees c. bacillus sp. c06 suppressed brown rot incidence by 92% and reduced lesion diameter by 88% compared to the pathogen-only check. bacillus sp.t03-c reduced incidence and lesion diameter by 40% and 62%, respectively. the two isolates were compared with pseudomonas syringae ma-4, a biocontrol agent for post-harvest peach diseases, by immersing peaches in an aliquot containing individual microbial isolates and the pathogen conidia. treatments with isolates ma-4, c06 and t03-c significantly controlled brown rot by 91, 100, and 100% respectively. however, only isolates ma-4 and c06 significantly reduced brown rot by 80% and 15%, respectively when bacterial cells alone were applied. on naturally infected  peaches, both the bacterial culture and its cell-free filtrate of the isolate c06 significantly controlled peach decay resulting in 77 and 90% reduction, respectively, whereas the treatment using only the bacterial cells generally had  no effect. isolate c06 is a single colony isolate obtained from a mesophilic cheese starter, and has been identified belonging to bacillus amyloliquefaciens.  the results have clearly demonstrated that isolate c06 has a great potential for  being developed into a biocontrol agent.

TI  == syringopeptin sp25a-mediated killing of gram-positive bacteria and the role of teichoic acid d-alanylation.
AB  == the pseudomonas syringae syringopeptins are cationic cyclic lipodepsipeptides that inhibit fungi and bacteria. the homolog syringopeptin (sp)25a was strongly inhibitory to several gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging between 1.95 and 7.8 microg ml(-1). in contrast, it was not inhibitory to several gram-negative bacteria. at 5 and 10 microg ml(-1), sp25a rapidly inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis and was bacteriocidal. teichoic acid d-alanylation dltb- and dltd-defective mutant strains of b. subtilis were more susceptible to sp25a compared with the parental wild-type strain. the degree of susceptibility of the parent strain, but not the dltb and dltd mutant strains, increased at alkaline ph (9.0). in contrast, the parental and mutant strains had the same susceptibilities to syringopeptins sp22a and sp508a at ph 7.0 and 9.0. these results suggest that the cell wall anionic teichoic acids modulate sp25a action against b. subtilis, and they provide an explanation for the selective inhibition of gram-positive bacteria by sp25a.

TI  == a new syringopeptin produced by bean strains of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.
AB  == two strains (b728a and y37) of the phytopathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae isolated from bean (phaseolus vulgaris) plants were shown to produce in culture both syringomycin, a lipodepsinonapeptide secreted by the majority of  the strains of the bacterium, and a new form of syringopeptin, sp(22)phv. the structure of the latter metabolite was elucidated by the combined use of mass spectrometry (ms), nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy and chemical procedures. comparative phytotoxic and antimicrobial assays showed that sp(22)phv did not differ substantially from the previously characterized syringopeptin 22 (sp(22)) as far as toxicity to plants was concerned, but was less active in inhibiting the growth of the test fungi rhodotorula pilimanae and geotrichum candidum and of the gram-positive bacterium bacillus megaterium.

TI  == the extracytoplasmic function sigma factors: role and regulation.
AB  == alternative sigma factors provide a means of regulating gene expression in response to various extracellular changes. one such class of sigma factors appears to control a variety of functions, including expression of heat-shock genes in escherichia coli, biosynthesis of alginates and carotenoids in pseudomonas aeruginosa and myxococcus xanthus, respectively, iron uptake in e. coli and pseudomonas spp., nickel and cobalt efflux in alcaligenes europhus, plant pathogenicity in pseudomonas syringae and synthesis of outer membrane proteins in photobacterium sp. strain ss9. most of these activities deal with extracytoplasmic functions, and such sigmas have been designated as ecf sigma factors. they have also been characterized in mycobacteria as well as gram-positive bacteria such as streptomyces coelicolor and bacillus subtilus and  the archaea sulpholobus acidocaldarius. ecf factors belong to a subfamily of the  sigma 70 class, based on their sequence conservation and function across bacterial species. the promoter consensus sequences recognized by the ecf factors are also highly conserved. in most of the cases, the activity of these factors is modulated by a cognate inner membrane protein that has been shown, both in e. coli and in p. aeruginosa, to act as an anti-sigma activity. this inner membrane  protein is presumed to serve as a sensor and signalling molecule, allowing an adaptive response to specific environmental change. presumably, an on-and-off switch of the anti-sigma activity leads to the release of the sigma factor and thereby to the co-ordinate transcription of the specific regulon it governs.

TI  == distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp. (0.98%),micrococcus sp. (0.82%),serratia marcescens (0.81%),bacillus subtilis (0.57%),cellulomonas flavigena (0.4%),erwinia sp. (0.37%),zymomonas mobilis (0.3%),bacillus sp. (0.29%),alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andpseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on  the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. the communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.

TI  == composition of the microflora of witloof chicory seeds.
AB  == the bacterial microflora of nine varieties of witloof chicory (cichorium intybus  l. var.foliosum hegi) seeds was studied. the 184 isolates were characterized by protein profiles determined by sds-protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of  the total cell proteins. isolates with identical protein profiles were grouped into one fingerprint type. sixty-seven fingerprint types were distinguished. two  quantitatively major fingerprint types,erwinia herbicola and an arthrobacter, represented 52% of the total number of isolates and were found on different chicory varieties. the latter organism was inhibited at seed germination. other isolates, i.e.,xanthomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas paucimobilis, agrobacterium radiobacter, pseudomonas syringae, and a fluorescentpseudomonas, were only occasionally found. a minority were gram-positive isolates, i.e.,bacillus sp.,streptomyces sp., and coryneforms. in vitro activity of the isolates was tested against five fungi. isolates with strong antifungal activity were found amongerwinia herbicola andbacillus sp.

TI  == identification and population dynamics of bacteria in symptomatic oat leaves.
AB  == bacteria isolated from symptomatic oat leaves included pseudomonads,erwinia herbicola, and others.pseudomonas coronafaciens was isolated predominantly from leaves with halo blight symptoms or necrotic spots. leaves with red leaf symptoms yielded many types of bacteria, including saprophytic pseudomonads,p. syringae, e. herbicola, bacillus sp.,micrococcus sp.,corynebacterium sp., a yeast, and other unidentified species. only isolates ofp. coronafaciens were pathogenic on the plant hosts tested. the bacteria associated with red leaf symptoms exist as saprophytes and/or epiphytes on leaves with those symptoms. it is concluded that  bacteria do not contribute to red leaf symptom development in oats, but symptomatic leaves provide an environment for their growth.
