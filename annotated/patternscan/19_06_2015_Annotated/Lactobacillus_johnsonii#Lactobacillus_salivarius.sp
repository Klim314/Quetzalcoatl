TI  == identification and characterization of intestinal lactobacilli strains capable of degrading immunotoxic peptides present in gluten.
AB  == aim: identify and characterize bacteria from the proximal gastrointestinal tract  of pigs capable of degrading immunogenic gluten peptides. methods and results: bacteria were cultured from the small intestine of pigs fed a 20% gluten diet and from an enrichment media with the 18-mer peptide lqlqpfpqpqlpypqpql. isolates were screened for the production of specialized proteolytic enzymes and the ability to degrade and remove metastable peptides from alpha-gliadin (16-mer and  33-mer) and omega-gliadin (17-mer), with established roles in the aetiology of coeliac disease. degradation was determined by elisa and mass spectrometry (uhplc-ms/ms in mrm mode), and hydrolysis fragments were characterized by lc-ms/ms. four strains from the species lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus amylovorus and lactobacillus salivarius showed the highest peptide-degrading activities. strains displayed different degradation rates and cleavage patterns that resulted in reduction but not complete removal of immunotoxic epitopes. conclusions: we employed a unique enrichment process to  select for bacteria adapted to the conditions of the proximal gastrointestinal tract with the ability to partially detoxify well-characterized peptides involved in coeliac disease. significance and impact of the study: this study provides a basis for the selection of lactobacillus strains for probiotic applications aimed to reduce epitope-containing gluten peptides before reaching the epithelium of the small intestine of patients with coeliac disease.

TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == characterization of the most abundant lactobacillus species in chicken gastrointestinal tract and potential use as probiotics for genetic engineering.
AB  == the count and diffusion of lactobacilli species in the different gastrointestinal tract (gi) regions of broilers were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the probiotic characteristics of six l. reuteri species isolated from broilers' gi tract were also investigated to obtain the potential target for genetic engineering. lactobacilli had the highest diversity  in the crop and the lowest one in the cecum. compared with the lower gi tract, more lactobacilli were found in the upper gi tract. lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, and l. aviarius were the  predominant lactobacillus species and present throughout the gi tract of chickens. lactobacillus reuteri was the most abundant lactobacillus species. lactobacillus reuteri xc1 had good probiotic characteristics that would be a potential and desirable target for genetic engineering.

TI  == identification of lactobacillus strains of goose origin using maldi-tof mass spectrometry and 16s-23s rdna intergenic spacer pcr analysis.
AB  == the objective of our study was to identify lactobacillus sp. strains of goose origin using maldi-tof mass spectrometry, its-pcr and its-pcr/rflp. all three techniques proved to be valuable tools for identification of avian lactobacilli and produced comparable classification results. lactobacillus strains were isolated from 100% of geese aged 3 weeks to 4 years, but from only 25% of chicks  aged 1-10 days. among the 104 strains isolated, we distinguished 14 lactobacillus species. the dominant species was lactobacillus salivarius (35.6%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18.3%), lactobacillus ingluviei (11.5%) and lactobacillus agilis (7.7%). the intact-cell maldi-tof mass spectrometry enabled  rapid species identification of the lactobacilli with minimal pretreatment. however, it produced more than one identification result for 11.5% examined strains (mainly of the species l. johnsonii). its-pcr distinguished 12 genotypes  among the isolates, but was not able to differentiate closely related strains, i.e. between lactobacillus amylovorus and lactobacillus kitasatonis and between lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus zeae. these species were differentiated by its-pcr/rflp using the restriction enzymes taqi and msei. the results obtained indicate that its-pcr and its-pcr/rflp assays could be used not only for interspecific, but also for intraspecific, typing.

TI  == eradication of helicobacter pylori infection by the probiotic strains lactobacillus johnsonii mh-68 and l. salivarius ssp. salicinius ap-32.
AB  == background: the current therapy for helicobacter pylori infection includes antimicrobial agents and proton pump inhibitors. we have examined the ability of  lactobacillus spp. to inhibit h. pylori infection. materials and methods: probiotic strains isolated from samples of adult feces, infant feces, breast milk, and vaginal swab collected from healthy volunteers in taiwan and commercially available strains were screened for antagonism toward h. pylori. inhibition liquid culture assay was used to screen potential anti-h. pylori activity. then, we performed agar plate inhibition assay, and assays to determine the capacity of probiotics for adhesion, and inhibition and killing of h. pylori, and measured the levels of il-8 and il-10. using animal models, we studied regulation of gastric acid and histopathological changes accompanying anti-h. pylori activity. results: we found that six of the tested strains suppressed urease activity of h. pylori: lactobacillus acidophilus tyca08, l. acidophilus tyca15, l. johnsonii mh-68, and l. salivarius subsp. salicinius ap-32 were more effective than the others. in vivo, l. johnsonii mh-68 and l. salivarius subsp. salicinius ap-32 alone or in combination, reduced the h. pylori load in the gastric mucosa, and also reduced inflammatory chemokine expression and lymphocyte infiltration. conclusions: lactobacillus johnsonii mh-68 and l. salivarius subsp. salicinius ap-32 effectively suppress h. pylori viability, and when used as probiotics, they may help decrease the occurrence of gastritis, and even reduce the risk of h. pylori infection.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from chicken carcasses with inhibitory activity against salmonella spp. and listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == this study was conducted to isolate psychrotrophic lactic acid bacteria (lab) from chicken carcasses with inhibitory activity against strains of salmonella spp. and listeria monocytogenes. a total of 100 broiler samples were examined for the presence of lab. ninety-two lab isolates that showed antimicrobial effects against salmonella spp. and l. monocytogenes were further analysed to examine their lab (gram-positive, catalase negative, oxidase negative) and psychrotrophic characteristics (ability to grow at 7 degrees c). fifty isolates were further selected and identified initially using standard biochemical tests in miniature (micro-kits api ch 50) and then by sequencing of the 16s-23s rrna gene boundary region (intergenic spacer region). by molecular identification, these isolates were classified into 5 different lab species: lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus johnsonii, pediococcus acidilactici, and lactobacillus paralimentarius. none of the isolates produced tyramine or histamine.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == diversity of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. these species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against candida spp.
AB  == urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. the treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. in this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against candida spp. the lab were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with c. albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, and c. tropicalis, adhesion to caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). all  lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four candida species into different degrees; among them l. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. the highest amount of lactic acid was produced  by l. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by l. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), l. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and l. jensenii (5.4 g/l). all isolates produced h2o2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri,  l. johnsonii, and l. vaginalis. only l. agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii and l.  ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial caco-2 cells. among the isolates evaluated, l agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii, and l. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.

TI  == ai-2 signalling is induced by acidic shock in probiotic strains of lactobacillus  spp.
AB  == survival and ability to respond to various environmental stresses such as low ph  are important factors for lactobacilli for their function as probiotics. luxs-mediated quorum sensing mechanism, which is based on the production of universal signal molecule called autoinducer-2 (ai-2), regulates important physiological traits and a variety of adaptive processes in different bacteria. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acidic stress on luxs-mediated quorum sensing (ai-2 signalling) in four probiotic strains of different lactobacillus species. initially, the production of ai-2-like molecule  was investigated in four strains of lactobacillus spp. at standard growth conditions using vibrio harveyi bioluminescence assay. species variation in ai-2  activity was observed. ai-2 activity started at early-exponential growth phase and increased during the mid-exponential phase concomitant with the reduction of  ph, reaching maximum at late exponential phase (l. rhamnosus gg) or at stationary phase (l. salivarius ucc118, l. acidophilus ncfm and l. johnsonii ncc533). acidic shock experiments were conducted on l. rhamnosus gg and l. acidophilus ncfm after exposure to different acidic shocks (ph 5.0, 4.0 and 3.0) and to ph 6.5 as control, measuring ai-2 activity and transcription of the luxs gene. ai-2 activity increased by lowering the ph in a dose dependent manner and was negatively influenced by acid adaptation. in both species, the luxs gene was repressed after exposure to ph 6.5 as control. however, after acidic shock (ph 4.0) a transient response of luxs gene was observed and the transcription augmented over time, reaching a maximum level and decreased subsequently. acid adaptation of cells attenuated the transcription of this gene. based on the observations done in the present study, the luxs gene appears to have a clear role in acidic stress response in probiotic lactobacilli. this might be important in the survival of these bacteria during the passage through the gastrointestinal tract, and further influence the cell-to-cell communication among bacteria in the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == ecophysiology of the developing total bacterial and lactobacillus communities in  the terminal small intestine of weaning piglets.
AB  == weaning of the pig is generally regarded as a stressful event which could lead to clinical implications because of the changes in the intestinal ecosystem. the functional properties of microbiota inhabiting the pig's small intestine (si), including lactobacilli which are assumed to exert health-promoting properties, are yet poorly described. thus, we determined the ecophysiology of bacterial groups and within genus lactobacillus in the si of weaning piglets and the impact of dietary changes. the si contents of 20 piglets, 4 killed at weaning (only sow  milk and no creep feed) and 4 killed at 1, 2, 5, and 11 days post weaning (pw; cereal-based diet) were examined for bacterial cell count and bacterial metabolites by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). lactobacilli were the predominant group in the si except at 1 day pw because of a marked reduction in their number. on day 11 pw, bifidobacteria and e. coli were not detected, and enterobacteriaceae and members of the clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale cluster were only found occasionally. l. sobrius/l. amylovorus became dominant species whereas the abundance of l. salivarius and l. gasseri/johnsonii declined. concentration of lactic acid increased pw whereas ph, volatile fatty acids, and ammonia decreased. carbohydrate utilization of 76 lactobacillus spp. isolates was studied revealing a shift from lactose and galactose to starch, cellobiose, and xylose, suggesting that the bacteria colonizing the si of piglets adapt to the newly introduced nutrients during the early weaning period. identification of isolates based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence data and comparison with fermentation data furthermore suggested adaptation processes below the species level. the results of our study will help to understand intestinal bacterial ecophysiology and to develop nutritional regimes to prevent or counteract complications during the weaning transition.

TI  == characterization of dominant cultivable lactobacilli and their antibiotic resistance profiles from faecal samples of weaning piglets.
AB  == aims: to examine the lactic acid bacteria flora of weaning piglets, to define the distribution of different lactobacilli species in piglet faecal samples, and to determine the susceptibility phenotype to 11 antibiotic of different families. methods and results: the faecal samples were taken from piglets with good herd status at 11 and 28 days after weaning. the lactobacillus isolates (n = 129) from 78 animals housed in pairs in 39 pens were preliminarily identified by their morphology and biochemical characteristics. partial 16s ribosomal dna (16s rdna)  was used to identify the isolates to the species level, and rapd (randomly amplified polymorphism dna) profiles to differentiate lactobacillus isolates to the strain level. based on these studies, 67 strains were selected for antibiotic resistant tests. the most numerous lactobacillus species found in the piglets was lactobacillus reuteri (n = 43). other lactobacilli were l. salivarius (n = 15), l. agilis (n = 4), l. johnsonii (n = 2), l. vaginalis (n = 1), l. mucosae (n = 1) and l. gallinarum (n = 1). all the strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin. two l. salivarius isolates and two l. reuteri isolates were found to be multiresistant. conclusions: this study indicates that the faecal lactobacillus flora in piglets consists mainly of l. reuteri, l. salivarius and l. acidophilus group lactobacilli, and the distribution of lactobacilli is similar between individuals of the same age and with the same diet. most of the lactobacillus isolates tested were sensitive to the antibiotics used in this study. significance and impact of the study: valuable information on lactobacillus species distribution and their antibiotic resistance profiles in piglets is obtained.

TI  == molecular profiling of lactobacillus, streptococcus, and bifidobacterium species  in feces of active racehorses.
AB  == diversity and compositions of the lactobacillus, streptococcus, and bifidobacterium group in the feces of six healthy, actively racing horses (thoroughbreds) were analyzed by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and real-time pcr with primer sets specific for each group. pcr-dgge analysis of the feces showed that lactobacillus equi, lactobacillus johnsonii, a phylogenetic relative of lactobacillus salivarius, a phylogenetic relative of lactobacillus gastricus, and weissella confusa were predominant in almost all of the feces tested, and streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus was predominant in the streptococcus group. the bifidobacterium group was not detected by single-pcr but atypical species of the  group were found in three of the six thoroughbreds tested by nested-pcr. calculation and estimation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria revealed that lactic acid bacteria were predominant in the feces and bifidobacteria were minor. these results indicate that the community of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in horse feces are unique because of the presence of specific species for horse feces and a minority of the bifidobacterium group. repeated tests of the feces from the same horse over 3 months showed that the diversity and composition of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the feces was basically stable throughout the test period.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens and characterization for potential use as probiotics to control salmonella enteritidis.
AB  == aims: to select lactobacillus strains from laying hens for potential use as probiotic to control salmonella enteritidis infection. methods and results: one hundred and eighty-six lactobacilli were isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens, and identified at the species level by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. all isolates belonged to the lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri or lactobacillus salivarius phylogenetic groups, with the l. reuteri group being the most predominant group. based on genetic diversity, about 50 representative strains were selected and tested for in vitro properties that could be predictive for probiotic activity in laying hens. salmonella inhibition  was shown to be species dependent, and correlated to some extent with the production of lactic acid. a selection of strains was evaluated in a s. enteritidis challenge experiment. two strains, l. reuteri r-17485 and lactobacillus johnsonii r-17504 significantly decreased the colonization of chicks by s. enteritidis in caeca, liver and spleen. conclusions: lactobacilli isolated from laying hens were observed to inhibit salmonella growth in vitro, most probably through production of lactic acid, and to decrease in vivo the s. enteritidis colonization of chicks. significance and impact of the study: the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from laying hens may have probiotic  potential in reducing s. enteritidis infection.

TI  == influence of intensive and extensive breeding on lactic acid bacteria isolated from gallus gallus domesticus ceca.
AB  == in the present study, lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. the lab identified by 16s-23s rrna pcr-ardra were mainly of lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of enterococcus spp. for all animals. free-range chickens  showed a higher presence of lactobacillus acidophilus while lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and  lactobacillus salivarius in both types. enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. all lab isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of lab from chicken cecum. lab isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth  promoters.

TI  == diversity of the genus lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. the authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii and l. sakei. this paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested  that l. salivarius was closer to l. plantarum than to l. sakei, which was closest to enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16s rrna gene relatedness. a total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. a lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising l. salivarius-l. plantarum; l. sakei; e. faecalis; and l. acidophilus-l. johnsonii.  the extreme divergence of the lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.

AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == detection and identification of lactobacillus species in crops of broilers of different ages by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis.
AB  == the microflora of the crop was investigated throughout the broiler production period (0 to 42 days) using pcr combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and selective bacteriological culture of lactobacilli  followed by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). the birds were  raised under conditions similar to those used in commercial broiler production. lactobacilli predominated and attained populations of 10(8) to 10(9) cfu per gram of crop contents. many of the lactobacilli present in the crop (61.9% of isolates) belonged to species of the lactobacillus acidophilus group and could not be differentiated by pcr-dgge. a rapid and simple ardra method was developed  to distinguish between the members of the l. acidophilus group. haeiii-ardra was  used for preliminary identification of isolates in the l. acidophilus group and to identify lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius. msei-ardra generated unique patterns for all species of the l. acidophilus group, identifying lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus gallinarum among crop isolates. the results of our study provide comprehensive knowledge of the lactobacillus microflora in the crops of birds of different ages using nucleic acid-based methods of detection and identification based on current taxonomic criteria.

TI  == lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  == aims: to examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. methods and results: the crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. the isolates were identified using tdna-pcr. lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. a lactobacillus species related to l. fermentum and l. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. three pigeons carried enterococcus cecorum. minor species found were e. columbae, e. faecalis,  e. hirae, l. johnsonii, l. salivarius, and streptococcus gallolyticus. a description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the l. agilis pigeon strains. conclusions, significance and impact of the study: l. agilis is found to be the main component of the lab flora in the pigeon crop.

TI  == the ability of probiotic bacteria to bind to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == human mucus was isolated from faecal samples of newborns, two and six month old infants and adults. the adhesion to this mucus by the bacteria mentioned below was assessed in vitro. depending on the age group: 44-46% of the applied lactobacillus gg, 23-30% of bifidobacterium lactis bb-12, 9-14% of lactobacillus  johnsonii lj-1, 3-10% of lactobacillus salivarius lm2-118, lactobacillus crispatus m247, lactobacillus paracasei f19 and 2% of l. crispatus mu5 adhered. all the strains adhered better to the mucus of adults than to that of infants. with some of the strains significant differences between the infant age groups were also observed. in conclusion, the age of the target group may be worthy of consideration when planning a schedule for probiotic or functional food therapy.
