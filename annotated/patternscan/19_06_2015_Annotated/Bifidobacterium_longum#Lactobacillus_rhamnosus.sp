TI  == nitrate reduction to nitrite, nitric oxide and ammonia by gut bacteria under physiological conditions.
AB  == the biological nitrogen cycle involves step-wise reduction of nitrogen oxides to  ammonium salts and oxidation of ammonia back to nitrites and nitrates by plants and bacteria. neither process has been thought to have relevance to mammalian physiology; however in recent years the salivary bacterial reduction of nitrate to nitrite has been recognized as an important metabolic conversion in humans. several enteric bacteria have also shown the ability of catalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia via nitrite during dissimilatory respiration; however, the importance of this pathway in bacterial species colonizing the human intestine has been little studied. we measured nitrite, nitric oxide (no) and ammonia formation in cultures of escherichia coli, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species grown at different sodium nitrate concentrations and oxygen levels. we found that the presence of 5 mm nitrate provided a growth benefit and induced both nitrite and ammonia generation in e.coli and l.plantarum bacteria grown at oxygen concentrations compatible with the content in the gastrointestinal tract.  nitrite and ammonia accumulated in the growth medium when at least 2.5 mm nitrate was present. time-course curves suggest that nitrate is first converted to nitrite and subsequently to ammonia. strains of l.rhamnosus, l.acidophilus and b.longum infantis grown with nitrate produced minor changes in nitrite or ammonia levels in the cultures. however, when supplied with exogenous nitrite, no gas was readily produced independently of added nitrate. bacterial production of lactic acid causes medium acidification that in turn generates no by non-enzymatic nitrite reduction. in contrast, nitrite was converted to no by e.coli cultures even at neutral ph. we suggest that the bacterial nitrate reduction to ammonia, as well as the related no formation in the gut, could be an important aspect of the overall mammalian nitrate/nitrite/no metabolism and is yet another way in which the microbiome links diet and health.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of human beta-defensins against lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == in this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd-1), human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2) and human beta-defensin-3 (hbd-3) against  three internationally common probiotic strains of lactic acid bacterium. our results indicated that hbd-1, hbd-2 and hbd-3 at the range of 0.08-10 mug/ml do not have obvious antimicrobial activity against these strains. viability of bifidobacterium longum jdm301 (b. longum jdm301), bifidobacterium lactis hn019 (b. lactis hn019) and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) were still very high even  at concentration of 10 mug hbd/ml. then, we explored the mechanism of resistance  by using carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (cccp) to inhibit efflux pumps. in the presence of cccp, hbd-1, hbd-2 and hbd-3 exhibited enhanced antibacterial  effect against b. longum jdm301 and b. lactis hn019, but not against lgg. efflux  pumps in b. longum jdm301 and b. lactis hn019 may partly contribute to their resistance to hbd-1, hbd-2, and hbd-3.

TI  == growth and safety evaluation of infant formulae containing oligosaccharides derived from bovine milk: a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial.
AB  == background: a limited number of nondigestible oligosaccharides are available for  use in infant formula. this study evaluated growth and safety in infants fed formula supplemented with a mixture of bovine milk-derived oligosaccharides (bmos). this mixture, which was generated from whey permeate, contains galactooligosaccharides and other oligosaccharides from bovine milk, such as 3'-  and 6'-sialyllactose. we hypothesized that growth in infants fed bmos-supplemented formula would be noninferior to that in infants fed standard formula. methods: healthy term infants </=14 days old were randomly assigned to standard formula (control; n = 84); standard formula with bmos (if-bmos; n = 99); or standard formula with bmos and probiotics (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus rhamnosus) (if-bmos + pro; n = 98). a breastfed reference group was also enrolled (n = 30). the primary outcome was mean weight gain/day from enrollment to age 4 months (noninferiority margin: -3.0 g/day). results: 189 (67.3%) formula-fed infants were included in the primary analysis. mean differences in weight gain between the control and if-bmos and if-bmos + pro groups were <1 g/day, with 97.5% confidence intervals above -3.0 g/day, indicating noninferior weight gain in the bmos formula groups. compared with control, infants in the bmos groups had more frequent (p < 0.0001) and less hard  (p = 0.0003) stools. no significant differences were observed between the control and bmos groups in caregivers' reports of flatulence, vomiting, spitting up, crying, fussing, and colic. when based on clinical evaluation by the investigator, the incidence of colic was higher (p = 0.01) in if-bmos than in control; the incidence of investigator-diagnosed colic was not significantly different in control and if-bmos + pro (p = 0.15). stool bifidobacteria and lactobacilli counts were higher with if-bmos + pro compared with control (p < 0.05), whereas clostridia counts were lower (p < 0.05) in both bmos groups compared with control. conclusions: infant formula containing bmos either with or without probiotics provides adequate nutrition for normal growth in healthy term  infants. further studies are needed to fully explore the digestive tolerance of bmos formula. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct01886898 . registered 24  june 2013.

TI  == probiotic bacteria, b. longum and l. acidophilus inhibit infection by rotavirus in vitro and decrease the duration of diarrhea in pediatric patients.
AB  == background and objectives: evidence suggests that specific probiotics may be antagonistic to enteric pathogens and enhance immunity, and thus, provide a means of preventing or treating diarrheal diseases. in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic strains isolated from koreans for the treatment of viral gastroenteritis in young children and against rotavirus in vitro. methods: in vitro antiviral activities of probiotic isolates on rotavirus  infection were investigated in the vero cell using a plaque reduction assay. then several probiotic strains with the high antiviral activity were chosen for further clinical trials. twenty-nine pediatric patients who presented with symptoms of viral gastroenteritis were enrolled in a double-blind trial and randomly assigned at admission to receive six probiotic strains (bifidobacterium  longum, b. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, and pediococcus pentosaceus) at a dose of 10(9) colony forming units/g or a comparable placebo twice daily for 1 week. results and conclusions: of the tested probiotic strains, b. longum isolated from an infant showed the greatest inhibitory effect and l. acidophilus showed the second-highest inhibitory effect. these probiotics significantly shortened the duration of diarrhea as compared with a placebo (6.1 +/- 0.5 vs 7.2 +/- 1.9, p = 0.030) and did not induce any adverse effects. our findings suggest that the probiotic strains selected in the  present study may be useful for the treatment of acute rotaviral gastroenteritis  or as an alternative therapy without adverse effects.

TI  == the effect of a multi-strain probiotic on the resistance toward escherichia coli  challenge in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention study.
AB  == background: several probiotic strains have been shown to enhance human resistance to infectious disease. it is speculated that these strains may impose this effect by excretion of anti-microbial components, by competing with pathogens for intestinal nutrients and/or mucosal adhesion sites or modulating the immune system. objective: a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled 4-week intervention was performed in healthy males, to study the effect of a blend of probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus helveticus rosell-52, lactobacillus rhamnosus rosell-11, bifidobacterium longum ssp. longum rosell-175) and a probiotic yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae var boulardii cncm i-1079) on enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) challenge. primary outcomes studied were fecal etec excretion and total fecal output per day. subjects/methods: subjects were randomized to the probiotic (5 x 10(9) colony-forming units (cfus); twice daily;  n=30) or placebo group (twice daily; n=30). after 2 weeks, subjects were orally challenged with a live attenuated etec (3 x 10(9) cfu), previously demonstrated to induce mild, short-lived symptoms of a foodborne infection. before and after etec challenge, subjects collected 24 h fecal samples. compliance to study guidelines, stool consistency (bristol stool score), stool frequency, and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal (gi) complaints were recorded by the subjects on a daily record questionnaire. results: etec challenge induced a significant increase in fecal etec excretion in both groups. however, a statistically significant increase in fecal output was only observed in the probiotic group. etec challenge resulted in a decrease in the percentage of fecal dry weight, and an increase in reported bristol stool score, stool frequency and  gi complaints. dietary probiotics significantly decreased the percentage of fecal dry weight. in addition, etec increased c-reactive protein, total secretory immunoglobulin a (iga) and immunoglobulin g colonization factor antigen ii. conclusion: dietary probiotics did not increase resistance to oral attenuated etec challenge in human subjects.

TI  == probiotics for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is common in intensive care units (icus). some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of vap. several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing vap in icus. we aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of vap. objectives: to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing vap. search methods: we searched central (2014, issue 8), medline (1948 to september week 1, 2014) and embase (2010 to september 2014). selection criteria: randomised controlled trials (rcts) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding rcts that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent vap. data collection and analysis: two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. main results: we included eight rcts, with 1083 participants. all studies compared a form of probiotic (lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; lactobacillus plantarum; synbiotic 2000forte; ergyphilus; combination bifidobacterium longum +  lactobacillus bulgaricus + streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). the analysis of  all rcts showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of vap (odds ratio (or) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). however, the aggregated results were uncertain for icu mortality (or 0.84, 95% ci 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (or 0.78, 95% ci 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (or 0.72, 95% ci 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of icu stay (mean difference (md) -1.60, 95% ci -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (md -6.15, 95% ci -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (or 1.23, 95% ci 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). antibiotics for vap were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (md -3.00, 95% ci -6.04 to 0.04). however, the ci of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. there were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.the overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. the  study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.to  explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (itt) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. however, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of vap. authors' conclusions: evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of vap. however, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of vap increased the uncertainty in this finding. the available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in icu or hospital mortality with probiotic use. three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no  clear evidence of a difference. the results of this meta-analysis do not provide  sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics  for the prevention of vap in icu patients.

TI  == short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB  == aim: : although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and permeability in chronic liver disease. methods: fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. six bacterial species were used: bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus. after 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, sibo, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. results: three of the six probiotic species, b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. acidophilus, increased in the  feces of the probiotic therapy group (p<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. sibo disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, p<0.05). general gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, p=0.248). numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (p for trend<0.05). liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. conclusions: we conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating sibo and clinical symptoms,  but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.

TI  == influence of bovine lactoferrin on the growth of selected probiotic bacteria under aerobic conditions.
AB  == bovine lactoferrin (blf) is a natural glycoprotein, and it shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. however, reports on the influences of blf on probiotic bacteria have been mixed. we examined the effects of apo-blf (between 0.25 and 128 mg/ml) on both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of probiotics. we found that blf had similar effects on the growth of probiotics under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, and that it actively and significantly (at concentrations of >0.25 mg/ml) retarded the growth rate of bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 29521), b. longum (atcc 15707), b. lactis (bcrc 17394), b. infantis (atcc 15697), lactobacillus reuteri (atcc 23272), l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103), and l. coryniformis (atcc 25602) in a dose-dependent manner. otherwise, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 128 or >128 mg/ml against b. bifidum, b. longum, b. lactis, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus (atcc 53103). with regard to mics, blf showed at least four-fold lower inhibitory effect on probiotics than on pathogens. intriguingly, blf (>0.25 mg/ml) significantly enhanced the growth of rhamnosus (atcc 7469) and l. acidophilus (bcrc 14065) by approximately 40-200 %,  during their late periods of growth. supernatants produced from aerobic but not anaerobic cultures of l. acidophilus reduced the growth of escherichia coli by about 20 %. thus, blf displayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the growth  of most probiotic strains under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. an antibacterial supernatant prepared from the aerobic cultures may have significant practical use.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and bifidobacterium longum attenuate lung injury and inflammatory response in experimental sepsis.
AB  == introduction: probiotic use to prevent nosocomial gastrointestinal and potentially respiratory tract infections in critical care has shown great promise in recent clinical trials of adult and pediatric patients. despite well-documented benefits of probiotic use in intestinal disorders, the potential  for probiotic treatment to reduce lung injury following infection and shock has not been well explored. objective: evaluate if lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) or bifidobacterium longum (bl) treatment in a weanling mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (clp) peritonitis will protect against lung injury. methods: 3 week-old fvb/n mice were orally gavaged with 200 microl of either lgg, bl or sterile water (vehicle) immediately prior to clp. mice were euthanized at 24 h. lung injury was evaluated via histology and lung neutrophil infiltration was evaluated by myeloperoxidase (mpo) staining. mrna levels of il-6, tnf-alpha,  myd88, tlr-4, tlr-2, nfkappab (p50/p105) and cox-2 in the lung analyzed via real-time pcr. tnf-alpha and il-6 in lung was analyzed via elisa. results: lgg and bl treatment significantly improved lung injury following experimental infection and sepsis and lung neutrophil infiltration was significantly lower than in untreated septic mice. lung mrna and protein levels of il-6 and tnf-alpha and gene expression of cox-2 were also significantly reduced in mice receiving lgg or bl treatment. gene expression of tlr-2, myd88 and nfkappab (p50/p105) was  significantly increased in septic mice compared to shams and decreased in the lung of mice receiving lgg or bl while tlr-4 levels remained unchanged. conclusions: treatment with lgg and bl can reduce lung injury following experimental infection and sepsis and is associated with reduced lung inflammatory cell infiltrate and decreased markers of lung inflammatory response. probiotic therapy may be a promising intervention to improve clinical lung injury following systemic infection and sepsis.

TI  == antibodies to lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in young children with different propensity to develop islet autoimmunity.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota is essential to the maturation and homeostasis of the immune system. immunoblot assays were used to establish the prevalence of serum igg, igm, and iga antibodies specific for bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg proteins in young children presenting with or without type 1 diabetes (t1d). we demonstrated that children between the ages of 6 and 12 months had a substantial increase in the frequency of igg antibodies specific for l. rhamnosus gg proteins. we measured igg, igm, and iga class antibody reactivity against b. adolescentis dsm 20083, b. adolescentis dsm 20086, and b. longum dsm 20088 proteins demonstrating significantly higher iga responses against b. adolescentis dsm 20083 strain proteins in children who developed islet autoimmunity and t1d later in life. b. adolescentis strains showed more igm type antibodies in children who developed t1d later in life, but the difference was not statistically significant. b. longum proteins were recognized by igg and iga antibodies to a higher extent compared to other bacteria studied. these results confirm that differences in immune reactivity against some commensal strains in young children may represent  a different risk factor for developing t1d.

TI  == cohort study of probiotics in a north american neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine whether routine probiotic administration to very preterm  infants would reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) without adverse consequences. study design: since the end of july 2011, we have administered a probiotic mixture to all admitted infants of <32 weeks' gestation. we give 0.5 g of a mixture of 4 bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium breve, bifidum, infantis, and longum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus ha-111 [corrected] (2 x 10(9) colony-forming units) per day, starting with the first feed, until the infant reaches 34 weeks. we compared complications among infants admitted during the first 17 months of routine use with those admitted during the previous 17 months. results: two hundred ninety-four infants received probiotics, and 317 infants formed the comparison group. introduction of probiotics was associated with a reduction in nec (from 9.8% to 5.4%, p < .02), a nonsignificant decrease in death (9.8% to 6.8%), and a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or nec (from 17% to 10.5%, p < .05). after adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, and sex, the improvements remained significant (or for nec, 0.51; 95% ci, 0.26-0.98; or for death or nec, 0.56; 95% ci, 0.33-0.93). there was no effect of probiotics on health care-associated infection. discussion: a product that is readily available in north america, that has excellent quality control, and that contains strains similar to those that have been shown effective in randomized controlled trials substantially reduced the frequency of nec in our neonatal intensive care unit.

TI  == probiotic modulation of dendritic cell function is influenced by ageing.
AB  == dendritic cells (dcs) are critical for the generation of t-cell responses. dc function may be modulated by probiotics, which confer health benefits in immunocompromised individuals, such as the elderly. this study investigated the effects of four probiotics, bifidobacterium longum bv. infantis ccug 52486, b. longum sp 07/3, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (l.gg) and l. casei shirota (lcs), on  dc function in an allogeneic mixed leucocyte reaction (mlr) model, using dcs and  t-cells from young and older donors in different combinations. all four probiotics enhanced expression of cd40, cd80 and ccr7 on both young and older dcs, but enhanced cytokine production (tgf-beta, tnf-alpha) by old dcs only. lcs  induced il-12 and ifngamma production by dc to a greater degree than other strains, while b. longum bv. infantis ccug 52486 favoured il-10 production. stimulation of young t cells in an allogeneic mlr with dc was enhanced by probiotic pretreatment of old dcs, which demonstrated greater activation (cd25) than untreated controls. however, pretreatment of young or old dcs with lps or probiotics failed to enhance the proliferation of t-cells derived from older donors. in conclusion, this study demonstrates that ageing increases the responsiveness of dcs to probiotics, but this is not sufficient to overcome the impact of immunosenescence in the mlr.

TI  == utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  == human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are not digested in the proximal intestine. in distal intestine, hmos collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the hmos is not well defined. here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated hmos in anaerobic culture. this allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific hmos on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. most bifidobacteria spp. and bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-l-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (scfas) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl), 3-fl, and lactodifucotetraose (ldft). lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258 exhibited slight growth, ph reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-fl or 3-fl, but not ldft. supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-sl) and 6'-sl promoted moderate growth of bifidobacterium longum jcm7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, atcc15708, bacteroides vulgatus atcc8482, and b. thetaiotaomicron atcc29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, scfa, or both. lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830 also consumed 6'-sl. in contrast, clostridium spp., l. rhamnosus atcc53103, e. faecalis atcc29200, staphylococcus spp., enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli k12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. specific bifidobacteria and bacteroides differentially digest specific individual hmos, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. this suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.

TI  == effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: we are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. objective: this study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. methods: this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. the multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) cfu), l. casei (7 x 10(9) cfu), l. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), l. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) cfu), bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) cfu), b. longum (7 x 10(9) cfu), streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (gsh). results: between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (fpg) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in fpg (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group  and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. we observed a significant increase in homa-ir (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). mean changes in serum hs-crp were significantly different between the two  groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group,  p = 0.02). probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma gsh  levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). conclusion:  in conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in fpg and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-crp and an increase in plasma total gsh.

TI  == [outcomes of clostridium difficile enterocolitis after administration of antibiotics along with probiotic supplement].
AB  == introduction: clostridium difficile enterocolitis is a potentially fatal disease  showing increasing incidence in hospital environment. therapeutic approach in the management of clostridium difficile enterocolitis is highly complex, particularly because of its tendency to relapse and reinfection. the study was aimed at investigating the factors influencing the development of clostridium difficile enterocolitis and outcomes of enterocolitis after administration of standard antimicrobial therapy combined with probiotic supplement. material and methods: a non-comparative prospective observational study encompassed 42 patients (22 males and 20 females) diagnosed with clostridium difficile enterocolitis and treated at the department of infectious diseases in novi sad in the period october 2011 - april 2012. results: higher incidence of the disease was found in elderly patients (78.6% of them were over 60 years of age), after antimicrobial therapy (83.8%), after hospitalization (83.3%) and in comorbid conditions (85.7%). the clinical picture revealed predominantly mild to moderate symptoms. a good clinical response to the standard antimicrobial therapy (metronidazole, vancomycin) combined with probiotic given for 10 days was observed in all patients, and the improvement in parameters such as the number and appearance of  stools, abdominal distension and pain was recorded. statistically significant changes in laboratory parameters (leukocyte count, c-reactive protein level) were recorded on day 5 after the onset of disease. recurrent infection after successful therapy was observed in 9.5% of the patients. conclusion: administration of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus rosell-52, lactobacillus rhamnosus rosell-11 and bifidobacterium longum rosell-175 alongside the standard antimicrobial therapy in the patients with clostridium difficile enterocolitis demonstrated positive effects on the severity or clinical picture and normalization of laboratory parameters. recurrent infection after successful  therapy was observed in only a small number of patients as compared with the literature data.

TI  == effect of multispecies probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background and aim: the efficacy of treatment with multispecies probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) symptoms and the alterations of gut microbiota in  patients who have taken probiotics were investigated. methods: this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 49 ibs patients (probiotics: 25,  placebo: 24) diagnosed according to the rome iii criteria. patients were randomly assigned to two groups: either to receive multispecies probiotics (a mixture of bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b. lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus) twice a day for 4 weeks or to receive  a placebo twice a day for 4 weeks. the primary efficacy end-point was the proportion of participants whose ibs symptoms were substantially relieved at week 4. secondary end-points were the intensity of abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, stool frequency/consistency, alterations in fecal microflora over the 4 weeks. fecal microflora were analyzed in 34 patients (probiotics: 17, placebo: 17) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. results: the proportion of patients whose ibs symptoms were substantially relieved at week 4 was significantly higher in the probiotics group than in the placebo group: 68.0% (17/25) versus 37.5% (9/24) (p < 0.05). secondary end-points such as improvement  in abdominal pain/discomfort and bloating occurred in the probiotics group but not in the placebo group. fecal analysis revealed that b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and s. thermophilus had increased significantly in the probiotics group after 4 weeks and that b. lactis had increased in the placebo group. conclusions: multispecies probiotics are effective in ibs patients and induce the alterations  in the composition of intestinal microbiota.

AB  == in this study, we investigated whether probiotic lysates can modify the tight-junction function of human primary keratinocytes. the keratinocytes were grown on cell culture inserts and treated with lysates from bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum,  or lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. with the exception of l. fermentum (which decreased cell viability), all strains markedly enhanced tight-junction barrier function within 24 h, as assessed by measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (teer). however, b. longum and l. rhamnosus gg were the most efficacious, producing dose-dependent increases in resistance that were maintained for 4 days. these increases in teer correlated with elevated expression of tight-junction protein components. neutralization of toll-like receptor 2 abolished both the increase in teer and expression of tight-junction proteins induced by b. longum, but not l. rhamnosus gg. these data suggest that some bacterial strains increase tight-junction function via modulation of protein components but the different pathways involved may vary depending on the bacterial strain.

TI  == probiotic administration reduces mortality and improves intestinal epithelial homeostasis in experimental sepsis.
AB  == background: recent clinical trials indicate that probiotic administration in critical illness has potential to reduce nosocomial infections and improve clinical outcome. however, the mechanism(s) of probiotic-mediated protection against infection and sepsis remain elusive. the authors evaluated the effects of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) and bifidobacterium longum (bl) on mortality, bacterial translocation, intestinal epithelial homeostasis, and inflammatory response in experimental model of septic peritonitis. methods: cecal ligation and puncture (n=14 per group) or sham laparotomy (n=8 per group) were performed on 3-week-old fvb/n weanling mice treated concomitantly with lgg, bl, or vehicle (orally gavaged). at 24 h, blood and colonic tissue were collected. in survival studies, mice were given probiotics every 24 h for 7 days (lgg, n=14; bl, n=10; or vehicle, n=13; shams, n=3 per group). results: probiotics significantly improved mortality after sepsis (92 vs. 57% mortality for lgg and 92 vs. 50% mortality for bl; p=0.003). bacteremia was markedly reduced in septic mice treated with either probiotic compared with vehicle treatment (4.39+/-0.56 vs. 1.07+/-1.54; p=0.0001 for lgg; vs. 2.70+/-1.89; p=0.016 for bl; data are expressed as mean+/-sd). sepsis in untreated mice increased colonic apoptosis and reduced colonic proliferation. probiotics significantly reduced markers of colonic apoptosis and returned colonic proliferation to sham levels. probiotics led to significant reductions in systemic and colonic inflammatory cytokine expression versus septic animals. our data suggest that involvement of the protein kinase b pathway (via akt) and down-regulation of toll-like receptor 2/toll-like receptor 4 via myd88 in the colon may play mechanistic roles in the observed probiotic benefits. conclusions: our data demonstrate that probiotic administration at initiation of sepsis can improve survival in pediatric experimental sepsis. the mechanism of this protection involves prevention of systemic bacteremia, perhaps via improved intestinal epithelial homeostasis, and  attenuation of the local and systemic inflammatory responses.

TI  == effect of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharides and inflammatory cytokines: an in vitro study using a human colonic microbiota model.
AB  == gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (lps) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. in this study, the effects of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using  a human colonic microbiota model. lactobacillus reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. longum subsp.  infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. colonic lipopolysaccharides, and gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. raw 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-4 cytokines were measured. lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of b. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), l. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), b. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and b. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). cell counts  of gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic  administered. there was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of raw 264.7 macrophage cells. b. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce tnf-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase il-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with tnf-alpha and il-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as b. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. this study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == is a multispecies probiotic mixture effective in constipation during pregnancy? 'a pilot study'.
AB  == background: constipation during pregnancy is a common problem. nowadays only few  effective interventions are published preventing or treating constipation during  pregnancy. however, their use is limited due to side-effects. this uncontrolled intervention study was performed to determine if a mixture of probiotics in the treatment of constipation during pregnancy is effective. methods: women aged >/=  18 years with functional constipation were included at the obstetrical outpatient clinic and midwife practices. patients received during four weeks a daily dose of ecologic(r)relief (bifidobacterium bifidum w23, bifidobacterium lactis w52, bifidobacterium longum w108, lactobacillus casei w79, lactobacillus plantarum w62 and lactobacillus rhamnosus w71 (total 4*10(9) cfu)). for all analyses, the non-parametric paired wilcoxon test was used. primary outcome measure was change  in defecation frequency. secondary outcome measures were stool consistency, sensation of incomplete evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction, manual manoeuvres to facilitate defecation, abdominal pain, adverse effects, presence of reflux episodes and intake of bisacodyl. results: 20 women were included. defecation frequency significantly increased from 3.1 at baseline to 6.7 in week  four (p < 0.01). compared to baseline, a significant decrease in 1) sensation of  anorectal obstruction from 90.0% to 45.0% (p < 0.01), 2) sensation of incomplete  evacuation from 90.0% to 40.0% (p < 0.01), 3) straining during defecation from 100% to 65% (p = 0.01), 4) episodes of abdominal pain from 60% to 20% (p = 0.01)  and 5) the presence of reflux episodes from 60% to 20% in week four (p = 0.01) was found. other secondary outcomes did not decrease significantly. no side effects were reported. conclusions: ecologic(r)relief is effective in the treatment of constipation during pregnancy. a randomised placebo controlled trial is required to confirm these data.

TI  == evidence of immunomodulatory effects of a novel probiotic, bifidobacterium longum bv. infantis ccug 52486.
AB  == bifidobacterium longum bv. infantis ccug 52486 was originally isolated from healthy elderly subjects and demonstrated to have particular ecological fitness and anti-pathogenic effects. bifidobacteria are commonly associated with immuno-modulatory properties, especially in older people, but this strain has not been investigated for effects on immune function. this study aimed to explore the immunomodulatory effects of this novel probiotic, compared with three commercial  strains, b. longum sp 07/3, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (l.gg) and lactobacillus casei shirota (lcs). human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were isolated from fasting blood of young or older volunteers and exposed to probiotic strains or con a. nk activity and activation, and cytokine release was enhanced by all probiotics with strain specificities. the effect of b. infantis on nk activity was influenced by ageing. except for l.gg, probiotics increased ifn-gamma production to a much greater degree in young subjects and increased il-6 production to a much greater degree in older subjects. based on il-10/il-12  ratios, b. infantis resulted in the most anti-inflammatory profile of all of the  probiotics. these results suggest that b. infantis ccug 52486 has strong immunomodulatory potential compared with well-known commercial strains and that the immune response to probiotics may be influenced by ageing.

AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == effect of water activity and protective solutes on growth and subsequent survival to air-drying of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium cultures.
AB  == probiotic cultures of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus were grown in media having water activities (a (w)) adjusted between 0.99 and 0.94 with nacl or with a mixture of glycerol and sucrose in order to find conditions of osmotic stress which would still allow for good growth. cultures grown at a (w) = 0.96 or 0.99 were then recovered by centrifugation, added to a sucrose-phosphate medium and air-dried. in some assays, a 2-h osmotic stress was  applied to the cell concentrate prior to air-drying. assays were also carried out where betaine, glutamate and proline (bgp) supplements were added as protective compounds to the growth or drying media. for most strains, evidence of osmotic stress and benefits of bgp supplementation on growth occurred at a (w) = 0.96. growing the cells in complex media adjusted at a (w) = 0.96 did not enhance their subsequent survival to air-drying, but applying the 2-h osmotic stress did. addition of the bgp supplements to the growth medium or in the 2-h stress medium  did not enhance survival to air-drying. furthermore, addition of bgp to a sucrose-phosphate drying medium reduced survival of the cultures to air-drying. this study provides preliminary data for producers of probiotics who wish to use  air-drying in replacement of freeze-drying for the stabilization of cultures.

TI  == cytokine profile and induction of t helper type 17 and regulatory t cells by human peripheral mononuclear cells after microbial exposure.
AB  == the immunomodulatory effects of probiotics were assessed following exposure of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), cord blood cells and the spleen-derived monocyte/macrophage cell line crl-9850 to lactobacillus acidophilus lavri-a1, lb. rhamnosus gg, exopolysaccharides (eps)-producing streptococcus thermophilus st1275, bifidobacteriun longum bl536, b. lactis b94 and escherichia coli tg1 strains. the production of a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by pbmc following bacterial stimulation was measured, using live, heat-killed or mock gastrointestinal tract (git)-exposed bacteria, and results show that (i) all bacterial strains investigated induced significant  secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines from pbmc-derived monocytes/macrophages; and (ii) cytokine levels increased relative to the expansion of bacterial cell numbers over time for cells exposed to live cultures. bifidobacteria and s. thermophilus stimulated significant concentrations of transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta, an interleukin necessary for the differentiation of regulatory t cells (t(reg) )/t helper type 17 (th17) cells and, as such, the study further examined the induction of th17 and t(reg) cells after pbmc exposure to selected bacteria for 96 h. data show a significant increase in the numbers of both cell types in the exposed populations, measured by cell surface marker expression and by cytokine production. probiotics have been shown to induce cytokines from a range of immune cells following ingestion of these organisms. these studies suggest that probiotics' interaction with immune-competent cells produces a cytokine milieu, exerting immunomodulatory effects on local effector cells, as well as potently inducing differentiation of  th17 and t(reg) cells.

TI  == the impact of meals on a probiotic during transit through a model of the human upper gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == commercial literature on various probiotic products suggests that they can be taken before meals, during meals or after meals or even without meals. this has led to serious confusion for the industry and the consumer. the objective of our  study was to examine the impact of the time of administration with respect to mealtime and the impact of the buffering capacity of the food on the survival of  probiotic microbes during gastrointestinal transit. we used an in vitro digestive system (ividis) model of the upper gastrointestinal tract to examine the survival of a commercial multi-strain probiotic, protecflor(r). this product, in a capsule form, contains four different microbes: two lactobacilli (lactobacillus helveticus r0052 and lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011), bifidobacterium longum r0175 and saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii. enumeration during and after transit of the stomach and duodenal models showed that survival of all the bacteria in the product was best when given with a meal or 30 minutes before a meal (cooked oatmeal with milk). probiotics given 30 minutes after the meal did not survive in high numbers. survival in milk with 1% milk fat and oatmeal-milk gruel were significantly better than apple juice or spring water. s. boulardii was not affected by time of meal or the buffering capacity of the meal. the protein content of the meal was probably not as important for the survival of the bacteria as the fat content. we conclude that ideally, non-enteric coated bacterial probiotic products should be taken with or just prior to a meal containing some fats.

AB  == there is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. the present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) model in vitro. live cells of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei shirota, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum ncimb 8826 and l. reuteri ncimb 11951) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3 and b. bifidum mf 20/5) were individually incubated with pbmc from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. probiotic strains increased the proportion of cd69+ on lymphocytes, t cells, t cell subsets and natural killer (nk) cells, and increased the proportion of cd25+, mainly on lymphocytes and nk cells. the effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. nk cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. probiotic strains increased production of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of il-2, il-4, il-5 or tnf-beta. the cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included il-10, interferon-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-12p70, il-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. the lactobacillus strains tended to promote t helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. the results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to t cell and nk cell activation or nk cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.

AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the enhancement of antioxidant, antimicrobial, enzymatic, cytotoxic, and cognitive activities of codonopsis lanceolata extracted by high pressure treatment followed by probiotic fermentation. dried c. lanceolata samples were subjected to 400 mpa for 20 min and then fermented with bifidobacterium longum b6 (hpe-blf) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (hpe-lrf) at 37 degrees c for 7 days. compared to conventional extraction (ce-nf, 6.69 mg gae/g), the phenol amounts of hpe-blf and hpe-lrf were significantly increased to more than 8 mg gae/g, while the lowest flavonoid contents were observed for hpe-blf (0.44 mg re/ml) and hpe-lrf (0.45 mg re/ml) (p<0.05). cinnamic acid was the most abundant phenolic acid in the fermented c. lanceolata. the highest dpph scavenging activities were observed for hpe-blf and  hpe-lrf, with minimum ec(50) values of 1.26 and 1.18 mg/ml, respectively. the hpe-blf and hpe-lrf samples exhibited the most noticeable antimicrobial activities against staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and shigella boydii (mics<15 mg/ml). the fermented c. lanceolata samples effectively inhibited alpha-glucosidase and tyrosinase activities and potentially improved a scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. the application of a fermentation process can effectively improve the biological and  pharmacological activities of high-pressure-extracted c. lanceolata by increasing the extraction efficacy and inducing probiotic conversion. the results suggest that the combined treatment of hpe and a fermentation process could be used as alternative extraction method over ce.

TI  == improved growth of toddlers fed a milk containing synbiotics.
AB  == bifidobacterium longum (bl999), lactobacillus rhamonosus (lpr), prebiotics (inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides), and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids  (lcpufa) are believed to have health benefits. in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial we compared growth and development of toddlers fed milk containing synbiotics (bl999, lpr, and prebiotics) and lcpufa or a control milk.  three hundred and ninety three healthy, 12 month-old toddlers were fed approximately 400 ml/day for 12 months. anthropometric measurements were taken at 12, 14, and 16 months. toddlers' response to measles and hepatitis a vaccine was  measured at 16 months, and bayley scale for motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions made at 24 months. the primary outcome was weight gain between 12 and 16 months. secondary outcomes were gain in length, head circumference, and body mass index, gastrointestinal tolerance (stool characteristics), stool bacterial counts, safety, anti-vaccine igg, and neurodevelopment. weight gain was greater in the synbiotics group (mean+/-sd, 7.57+/-4.13 g/day) compared with the control  group (6.64+/-4.08 g/day). the difference of 0.93 g/day (with a 95% confidence interval of 0.12 to 1.75) is significant (p=0.025). the gain in the synbiotics group resulted in a change in z-score weight-for-age closer to who child growth standard. there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and enterococci counts between 12 months and 16 months in the synbiotic group. we conclude that in healthy toddlers milk containing synbiotics and lcpufa provides better growth and promotes favorable gut colonization, as shown by higher lactobacillus counts.

TI  == the effect of rice fibre fractions on the growth of co-cultures of probiotics.
AB  == the fermentation of rice dietary fibre was measured by the cell yield, ph, optical density specific growth rate and biomass using nine co-cultures of four probiotics at 0, 6, 24 and 48 h incubation. the results from the fermentation of  the soluble, insoluble and total dietary fibre (sdf, idf, and tdf) of two rice varieties were compared. overall there was no significant difference (p < 0.05) in the fermentation of the six different rice fibre fractions. however, co-cultures showed a preference for glucose as a fermentation substrate rather than the fibre fractions. bifidobacteria species produced a higher cell count than the lactobacillus species after 24 and 48 h of fermentation (p < 0.05). there was evidence of synergistic activity with increased growth observed when lactobacilli and bifidobacterium were grown together. growth was limited by the ph reaching 4.2-4.45. specific growth rates of the co-cultures varied for different culture combinations. combinations of the same species produced less biomass than combinations of mixed species. bifidobacterium breve + bifidobacterium longum + lactobacillus rhamnosus was the most efficient. these findings showed that synergism between microorganisms in co-cultures affected the degree of fermentation of dietary fibre.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains abrogate in vitro the cytotoxic effect of bacterial toxins on eukaryotic cells.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the capability of the exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria from human and dairy origin to antagonize the cytotoxic effect of bacterial toxins. methods and results: the cytotoxicity of bacillus cereus extracellular factors on caco-2 colonocytes in the presence/absence of the eps was determined by measuring the integrity of the tissue monolayer and the damage to the cell membrane (extracellular lactate dehydrogenase activity). additionally, the protective effect of eps against the haemolytic activity of the streptolysin-o was evaluated on rabbit erythrocytes. the eps produced by bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis a1 and ipla-r1, bifidobacterium longum nb667 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg were able to counteract the toxic effect of bacterial toxins on the eukaryotic cells at 1mg ml(-1) eps concentration. the eps a1 was the most effective in counteracting the  effect of b. cereus toxins on colonocytes, even at lower doses (0.5mg ml(-1) ), whereas eps nb667 elicited the highest haemolysis reduction on erythrocytes. conclusions: the production of eps by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could antagonize the toxicity of bacterial pathogens, this effect being eps and biological marker dependent. significance and impact of the study: this work allows gaining insight about the mechanisms that probiotics could exert to improve the host health.

TI  == the determination of viable counts in probiotic cultures microencapsulated by spray-coating.
AB  == an assessment of various methods to determine viable counts (cfu) in freeze-dried and dried microencapsulated (me) probiotic cultures was carried out. microencapsulation was done by spray-coating of dried lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011 or bifidobacterium longum atcc 15708 cultures with fat. rehydration of the  me powders was incomplete when they were added to water and gently agitated. as a result analytical methods based on vortexing of rehydrated me cultures and which  did not incorporate a high-shear homogenization (hsh) step underestimated the viable counts. the cfu of me cultures were identical when methods using either blender or generator probes high-shear homogenization (hsh) were carried out. furthermore hsh reduced the variability of the cfu results of both free-cell and  me cultures by a factor of three. the addition of an emulsifier (tween 80) in the rehydrating medium to dissolve fat did not improve cfu counts when generator probes were used for hsh. the presence of fat in the me product, or when added to the rehydration medium, improved cfu counts of b. longum but not of l. rhamnosus.

TI  == probiotics in the treatment of acute rotavirus diarrhoea. a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial using two different probiotic preparations in bolivian children.
AB  == background: evidence suggests that probiotics reduce rotavirus diarrhoea duration. although there are several probiotic strains potentially useful, daily  practice is often limited by the type and number of products locally available. in general, information about combined products is scarce. in this study we compare the effect of two probiotic products in the treatment of diarrhoea in children less than 2 years of age. methods: a randomized double-blind controlled  clinical trial in children hospitalized for acute rotavirus diarrhoea, in the paediatric centre albina patino, cochabamba, bolivia.participants were children aged 1 - 23 months, who were randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments: oral rehydration therapy plus placebo; oral rehydration solution plus saccharomyces boulardii; or oral rehydration solution plus a compound containing  lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum and saccharomyces boulardii. sample size was 20 per group and the outcomes were duration of diarrhoea, of fever, of vomiting and of hospitalization. results: 64  cases finished the protocol. on admission, patients' characteristics were similar. median duration of diarrhoea (p = 0.04) in children who received the single species product (58 hours) was shorter than in controls (84.5 hrs). comparing children that received the single probiotic product and controls showed shorter duration of fever (18 vs 67 hrs) (p = 0.0042) and the mixed probiotic of  vomiting (0 vs 42.5 hrs) (p = 0.041). there was no effect on duration of hospitalization (p = 0.31). when experimental groups were merged, statistical significance of changes increased (total duration of diarrhoea, fever and vomiting p = 0.025, p = 0.025 and p = 0.014, respectively). conclusions: both products decreased the duration of diarrhoea compared to oral rehydration solution alone. this decrease was significant only for the single species product which also decreased the duration of fever. with the multiple species product there was no vomiting subsequent to the initiation of treatment. the quantity of  probiotic bacteria needed for optimum treatment of gastroenteritis remains to be  determined, particularly when multiple species are included in the product.trial  registration: clinicaltrials.gov id: nct00981877link: https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/prs/app/action/selectprotocol/sid/s0002653/se lectaction/view/ts/2/uid/u0000n04 trial registration: clinical trials nct id: nct00981877.

TI  == enhancing the biotransformation of isoflavones in soymilk supplemented with lactose using probiotic bacteria during extended fermentation.
AB  == soymilk (sm) lacks lactose; hence supplementation of sm with lactose is likely to enhance the growth of probiotic bacteria and biotransformation of isoflavone glycosides to isoflavone aglycones. in this study, 11 strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, howaru l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium lactis type bi-07, b. longum, howaru b. bifidum, and b lactis type bi-04 were inoculated individually or as mixed cultures into sm and soymilk  supplemented with lactose (sml). a total of 2% of lactose was added to 1 l of sm  with the aim of improving the growth of probiotic organisms and promoting the biotransformation of isoflavone isomers to bioactive isoflavone aglycomes. samples of sm were incubated at 37 degrees c and 10 ml aliquots of sm were taken  at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h to monitor the growth of probiotic bacteria and changes in isoflavone contents using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). results  indicated that sml fermented with probiotics had higher viable counts by >2.4 log cfu/ml than that in sm at the end of the 72 h fermentation period. mixed cultures grew at different rates and in general lactobacilius spp. had >1.02 log cfu/ml more cells than bifidobacterium spp. at the end of the fermentation period. the total aglycone content in sm at 72 h of fermentation was 0.924 mg/100 ml, whereas that in sml was 1.623 mg/100 ml. addition of lactose not only improved the growth of probiotic bacteria in sm but also enhanced the biotransformation of isoflavone glucosides to the more bioactive isoflavone aglycones. mixed cultures did not improve the biotransformation of bioactive isoflavones when compared to single cultures.

TI  == probiotic colonization of the adherent mucus layer of ht29mtxe12 cells attenuates campylobacter jejuni virulence properties.
AB  == the ht29mtxe12 (e12) cell line harbors an adherent mucus layer, providing a novel technique to model mucosal infection in vitro. in this study, we have characterized the interaction of campylobacter jejuni with the e12 cell line and  exploited its unique mucus layer to examine the potential efficacy of probiotic treatment to attenuate c. jejuni virulence properties. c. jejuni 81-176 colonized and reproduced in e12 mucus. adhesion to and internalization of c. jejuni were enhanced in e12 cells harboring mucus compared to parental cells without mucus. translocation of c. jejuni occurred at early time points following infection. c.  jejuni aligned with tight junctions and colocalized with the tight junction protein occludin, suggesting a paracellular route of translocation. probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus r0011, lactobacillus helveticus r0052, lactobacillus salivarius ah102, bifidobacterium longum ah1205, a commercial combination of l. rhamnosus r0011 and l. helveticus r0052 (lacidofil), and a cocktail consisting of l. rhamnosus, l. helveticus, and l. salivarius (rhhesa) colonized e12 mucus and bound to underlying cells. probiotics attenuated c. jejuni association with and internalization into e12 cells and translocation to the basolateral medium of transwells. live bacteria and prolonged precolonization of e12 cells with probiotics were necessary for probiotic action. these results demonstrate the potential for e12 cells as a model of mucosal pathogenesis and provide a rationale for the further investigation of probiotics as prophylaxis against human campylobacteriosis.

TI  == combined effects of probiotic fermentation and high-pressure extraction on the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antimutagenic activities of deodeok (codonopsis lanceolata).
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the combined effects of probiotic fermentation and high-pressure extraction (hpe) on the functional properties of codonopsis lanceolata. the ground c. lanceolata samples were anaerobically fermented with lactobacillus acidophilus adh, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, or lactobacillus paracasei at 37 degrees c for 10 days and subjected to 500 mpa at 50 degrees c for 30 min. the extraction yields of c. lanceolata samples were noticeably increased to 29-32% by hpe. the b. longum-fermented c. lanceolata samples extracted by high pressure (blf-hpe) exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity (mic < 14 mg/ml) against listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, shigella boydii, and salmonella typhimurium. the nonfermented c. lanceolata samples extracted with high pressure  (nf-hpe) had the highest total phenolic content (13.3 mg of gae/g). the lowest effective concentrations (ec(50) and ec(0.5)) were 4.55 and 1.76 mg/ml, respectively, for nf-hpe extracts, indicating its highest antioxidant activity. the blf-hpe and l. rhamnosus-fermented c. lanceolata samples extracted by high pressure (lrf-hpe) exhibited the highest antimutagenic activities in s. typhimurium ta 100, which were 82 and 83% inhibition, respectively. the use of probiotic fermentation and hpe can produce more biologically active compounds in  c. lanceolata than the conventional solvent extraction method. the results provide pharmaceutically useful information for improving biological properties and an approach to drug discovery.

TI  == effect of natural commensal-origin dna on toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) signaling cascade, chemokine il-8 expression, and barrier integritiy of polarized intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == background and aim: the intestinal epithelium is constantly exposed to high levels of genetic material like bacterial dna. under normal physiological conditions, the intestinal epithelial monolayer as a formidable dynamic barrier with a high-polarity structure facilitates only a controlled and selective flux on components between the lumen and the underlining mucosa and even is able to facilitate structure-based macromolecules movement. the aim of this study was to  test the effect of natural commensal-origin dna on the tlr9 signaling cascade and the barrier integrity of polarized intestinal epithelial cells (iecs). methods: : polarized ht-29 and t84 cells were treated with tnf-alpha in the presence or absence of dna from lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) and bifidobacterium longum.  tlr9 and interleukin-8 (il-8) mrna expression was assessed by semiquantitative and taqman real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. expression  of tlr9 protein, degradation of inhibitor of kappa b alpha (ikappabalpha), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 map) phosphorylation were assessed by western blotting. to further reveal the role of tlr9 signaling, the tlr9 gene was silenced by sirna. il-8 secretion was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activity was assessed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa) and nf-kappab-dependent luciferase reporter gene assays. as an indicator of tight junction formation and monolayer integrity of epithelial cell monolayers, transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) was repetitively monitored. transmonolayer movement of natural commensal-origin dna across monolayers was monitored using qrt-pcr and nested pcr based on bacterial 16s rrna genes. results: in response to apically applied natural commensal-origin dna, polarized ht-29 and t84 cells enhanced expression of tlr9 in a specific manner, which was subsequently associated with attenuation  of tnf-alpha-induced nf-kappab activation and nf-kappab-mediated il-8 expression. tlr9 silencing abolished this inhibitory effect. apically applied lgg dna attenuated tnf-alpha-enhanced nf-kappab activity by reducing ikappabalpha degradation and p38 phosphorylation. lgg dna did not decrease the ter but rather  diminished the tnf-alpha-induced ter reduction. translocation of natural commensal-origin dna into basolateral compartments did not occur under tested conditions. conclusions: our study indicates that tlr9 signaling mediates, at least in part, the anti-inflammatory effects of natural commensal-origin dna on the gut because tlr9 silencing abolished the inhibitory effect of natural commensal-origin dna on tnf-alpha-induced il-8 secretion in polarized iecs. the nature of the tlr9 agonist, the polarity of cells, and the tight junction integrity of iecs has to be taken into account in order to predict the outcome of tlr9 signaling.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == oral supplementation with probiotics in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants: a  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background: although recent reports suggest that supplementation with probiotics  may enhance intestinal function in premature infants, the mechanisms are unclear, and questions remain regarding the safety and efficacy of probiotics in extremely low-birth-weight infants. objective: the objective was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on the digestive tolerance to enteral feeding in preterm infants born with a very low or extremely low birth weight. design: in a bicentric, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial that was stratified for center and birth weight, 45 infants received enteral probiotics (bifidobacterium longum  bb536 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg; bb536-lgg) and 49 received placebo. the primary endpoint was the percentage of infants receiving >50% of their nutritional needs via enteral feeding on the 14th day of life. a triangular test  was used to perform sequential analysis. results: the trial was discontinued after the fourth sequential analysis concluded a lack of effect. the primary endpoint was not significantly different between the probiotic (57.8%) and placebo (57.1%) groups (p = 0.95). however, in infants who weighed >1000 g, probiotic supplementation was associated with a shortening in the time to reach full enteral feeding (p = 0.04). other than colonization by the probiotic strains, no alteration in the composition of intestinal microbiota or changes in  the fecal excretion of calprotectin was observed. no colonization by probiotic strains was detected in infants who weighed < or =1000 g, presumably because of more frequent suspensions of enteral feeding, more courses of antibiotic treatment, or both. conclusions: supplementation with bb536-lgg may not improve the gastrointestinal tolerance to enteral feeding in very-low-birth-weight infants but may improve gastrointestinal tolerance in infants weighing >1000 g. this trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct 00290576.

TI  == an improved method of microencapsulation of probiotic bacteria for their stability in acidic and bile conditions during storage.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to develop a method for applying an extra coating of palm oil and poly-l-lysine (popl) to alginate (alg) microcapsules to enhance the survival of probiotic bacteria. eight strains of probiotic bacteria including lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l.  acidophilus, l. paracasei, b. lactis type bl-o4, and b. lactis type bi-07 were encapsulated using alginate alone or alginate with popl. electron microscopy was  used to measure the size of the microcapsules and to determine their surface texture. to assess if the addition of popl improved the viability of probiotic bacteria in acidic conditions, both alg and popl microcapsules were inoculated into ph 2.0 mrs broths and their viability was assessed over a 2-h incubation period. two bile salts including oxgall bile salt and taurocholic acid were used  to test the bile tolerance of probiotic bacteria entrapped in alg and popl microcapsules. to assess the porosity and the ability of the microcapsule to hold small molecules in an aqueous environment a water-soluble fluorescent dye, 6-carboxyflourescin (6 fam), was encapsulated and its release was monitored using a uv spectrophotometer. the results indicated that coating the microcapsules with popl increased the overall size of the capsules by an average of 3 microm +/- 0.67. however, microcapsules with added popl had a much smoother surface texture  when examined under an electron microscope. the results also indicated that the addition of popl to microcapsules improved the average viability of probiotic bacteria by > 1 log cfu/ml when compared to alg microcapsules at 2 h of exposure  to acidic conditions. however, similar plate counts were observed between alg and popl microcapsules when exposed to bile salts. this suggests that an extra coating of popl could be readily broken down by bile salts that are commonly found in the lower gastrointestinal tract (git). upon testing the porosity of the microcapsules, findings suggest that popl microcapsules were less porous and hold 52.2% more fluorescent dye over a 6-wk storage period.

TI  == probiotic supplementation in the first 6 months of life in at risk asian infants--effects on eczema and atopic sensitization at the age of 1 year.
AB  == background: the role of probiotics in allergy prevention remains uncertain but has been shown in some studies to have a possible protective effect on eczema. objective: we aimed to assess the effect of probiotic supplementation in the first 6 months of life on eczema and allergic sensitization at 1 year of age in asian infants at risk of allergic disease. methods: a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial involving 253 infants with a family  history of allergic disease was carried out. infants received at least 60 ml of commercially available cow's milk formula with or without probiotic supplementation [bifidobacterium longum (bl999) 1 x 10(7) colony forming unit (cfu)/g and lactobacillus rhamnosus (lpr) 2 x 10(7) cfu/g] daily for the first 6  months. clinical evaluation was performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months of age, with serum total ige measurement and skin prick tests conducted at the 12-month visit. the primary and secondary end-points were eczema and allergen sensitization, respectively. results: the incidence of eczema in the probiotic (22%) group was similar to that in the placebo group (25%) (p=0.53). the median scoring atopic dermatitis score at 12 months was 17.10 (9.74) in the probiotic group and 11.60 (8.40) in the placebo group (p=0.17). the prevalence of allergen sensitization showed no difference (probiotic=24% vs. placebo=19%, p=0.26). the total ige geometric mean (95% confidence interval) was 18.76 (12.54-24.98) ku/l in the probiotic group and 23.13 (16.01-30.24) ku/l in the placebo group (p=0.15). atopic eczema (with sensitization) in the probiotic (7.3%) group was comparable to the placebo group (5.8%) (p=0.86). conclusion: early life administration of a  cow's milk formula supplemented with probiotics showed no effect on prevention of eczema or allergen sensitization in the first year of life in asian infants at risk of allergic disease. further work is needed to determine whether timing of supplementation, dose and probiotic strain are important considerations.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna on th1/th2-cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy and allergic  subjects.
AB  == among the factors potentially involved in the increased prevalence of allergic diseases, modification of the intestinal flora or lack of microbial exposure during childhood has been proposed. t(h)2-cytokines increase the production of ige and stimulate mast cells and eosinophils, whereas t(h)1-cytokines, such as ifn-gamma, may suppress ige synthesis and stimulate the expression of the secretory piece of iga. thus, a dysregulation in the expression of t(h)1- and t(h)2-cytokines may contribute to the initiation and maintenance of allergic diseases. lactobacilli belonging to the natural intestinal microflora were reported to reduce the incidence of atopic dermatitis and the severity of allergic manifestations and to modulate t(h)1/t(h)2 responses. the mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. we sought to assess the effect of different probiotics, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus gasseri (pa16/8), bifidobacterium bifidum (mp20/5), and bifidobacterium longum (sp07/3), on the t(h)1 and t(h)2 responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from healthy subjects and from patients with allergy against house dust mite to staphylococcus enterotoxin a (sea) and dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (dpt). to elucidate the molecular basis of these effects, the effects of bacterial genomic  dna were compared with the effects of viable bacteria. pbmcs from allergic patients and from healthy donors were incubated for 24 or 48 h, respectively, with or without sea and dpt allergens. the effects of preincubation with live probiotic bacteria and the effect of their genomic dna, added simultaneously to cultures and incubated for 24h, were assessed by measuring t(h)1/t(h)2-cytokine production. the tested live gram-positive probiotic bacteria and their genomic dna inhibited sea- and dpt-stimulated secretion of t(h)2-cytokines (il-4 and il-5) and enhanced the stimulation of ifn-gamma. this effect was dose-dependent with a dosage-optimum, which was identical for all lactic acid producing bacteria (lab) tested (10 bacteria per pbmc) and their dna (75 ng/ml). based on the maximal effects achieved with lab and their dna, more than 50% of the effects seem to be contributed by dna. no significant effect was induced by the control,  gram-negative escherichia coli tg1. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria reduced sea-stimulated il-4 and il-5 production more effectively in pbmcs from healthy subjects than from allergic patients. in contrast to this, inhibition of dpt-stimulated il-4- and il-5-secretion was more pronounced in cells from allergic subjects. compared with living lab, bacterial dna inhibited il-4- and il-5-secretion in a similar manner. sea- and even more so dpt-stimulated ifn-gamma stimulation by living lab was less pronounced in allergic than in healthy subjects, whereas ifn-gamma stimulation by their dna was more pronounced  in allergic subjects. the tested probiotic bacteria as well as their genomic dna  modulated the t(h)1/t(h)2 response to some allergens dose-dependently. dna seems  to contribute to 50% of the effect exerted by living bacteria in this in vitro model. the magnitude of the probiotic effects differed between healthy and allergic subjects. whether the modulation found for the tested strains might be useful for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases has to be assessed in clinical trials.

TI  == bifidobacterium longum pl03, lactobacillus rhamnosus kl53a, and lactobacillus plantarum pl02 in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children: a randomized controlled pilot trial.
AB  == aim: to determine the efficacy of a combination of bifidobacterium longum pl03, lactobacillus rhamnosus kl53a and lactobacillus plantarum pl02 for the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children. methods: seventy-eight children (age: 5 months to 16 years) with otitis media, and/or respiratory tract infections, and/or urinary tract infections were enrolled in a double-blind randomized control trial in which they received standard antibiotic treatment plus a food supplement containing 10(8) colony-forming units of b. longum, l. rhamnosus and l. plantarum (n = 40) or a placebo (n = 38) orally twice daily for  the duration of antibiotic treatment. results: patients receiving probiotics had  a similar rate of diarrhea (> or =3 loose or watery stools/day for > or =48 h occurring during or up to 2 weeks after the antibiotic therapy) as those receiving placebo (relative risk 0.5, 95% ci 0.06-3.5). the mean number of stools per day was significantly lower in the experimental group (mean difference -0.3 stool/day, 95% ci -0.5 to -0.07). no adverse events were reported. conclusion: the administration of the 3 probiotics did not significantly alter the rate of diarrhea, although it reduced the frequency of stools per day. as the overall frequency of diarrhea was surprisingly low, these results should be interpreted with caution.

TI  == specific strains of probiotic bacteria are efficient in removal of several different cyanobacterial toxins from solution.
AB  == the ability of specific strains of probiotic bacteria to remove the pure cyanobacterial peptide toxins microcystin-lr, -rr, -lf, and a combination of microcystins from the cyanobacterial extracts microcystis pcc 7820 and nies 107,  as well as the cyanobacterial cytotoxin cylindrospermopsin, from aqueous solutions was assessed. the probiotic bacterial strains studied were lactobacillus rhamnosus strains gg and lc-705, bifidobacterium lactis strains 420 and bb12 and bifidobacterium longum 46, all previously shown to be effective in toxin removal. the maximum removal of microcystin-lr, 60.3%, was observed with l. rhamnosus gg, of microcystin-rr, 62.8%, and microcystin-lf, 77.4%, with l. rhamnosus lc-705, and of cylindrospermopsin, 31.6%, with b. longum 46 (toxin concentration 100mugl(-1), 37 degrees c, 24h). several microcystins could be removed simultaneously as observed by removal of microcystins present in the cyanobacterial extracts. a combination of three probiotic strains enhanced their  removal ability as compared to the removal properties of the individual strains.  we conclude that specific strains of probiotic bacteria are effective in elimination of different cyanotoxins from solution.

TI  == top-down systems biology integration of conditional prebiotic modulated transgenomic interactions in a humanized microbiome mouse model.
AB  == gut microbiome-host metabolic interactions affect human health and can be modified by probiotic and prebiotic supplementation. here, we have assessed the effects of consumption of a combination of probiotics (lactobacillus paracasei or l. rhamnosus) and two galactosyl-oligosaccharide prebiotics on the symbiotic microbiome-mammalian supersystem using integrative metabolic profiling and modeling of multiple compartments in germ-free mice inoculated with a model of human baby microbiota. we have shown specific impacts of two prebiotics on the microbial populations of hbm mice when co-administered with two probiotics. we observed an increase in the populations of bifidobacterium longum and b. breve, and a reduction in clostridium perfringens, which were more marked when combining prebiotics with l. rhamnosus. in turn, these microbial effects were associated with modulation of a range of host metabolic pathways observed via changes in lipid profiles, gluconeogenesis, and amino-acid and methylamine metabolism associated to fermentation of carbohydrates by different bacterial strains. these results provide evidence for the potential use of prebiotics for beneficially modifying the gut microbial balance as well as host energy and lipid homeostasis.

TI  == assessment of the safety, tolerance, and protective effect against diarrhea of infant formulas containing mixtures of probiotics or probiotics and prebiotics in a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == background: probiotics and prebiotics are considered to be beneficial to the gastrointestinal health of infants. objective: the objective was to evaluate infant formulas containing probiotics and synbiotics (combinations of probiotics  and prebiotics) for safety and tolerance. design: in a prospective, controlled, double-blind, randomized trial, healthy full-term infants were exclusively fed a  control formula or study formulas containing bifidobacterium longum bl999 (bl999) + lactobacillus rhamnosus lpr (lpr), bl999 + lpr + 4 g/l of 90% galactooligosaccharide/10% short-chain fructooligosaccharide (gos/scfos), or bl999 + lactobacillus paracasei st11 (st11) + 4 g/l gos/scfos from < or = 2 to 16 wk of age (treatment period). safety and tolerance were assessed based on weight  gain during the treatment period (primary outcome) as well as recumbent length, head circumference, digestive tolerance, and adverse events (secondary outcomes), which were evaluated at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 52 wk of age. results: two hundred eighty-four infants were enrolled. during the treatment period, difference in mean weight gain between control and study formula groups in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations were within the predefined equivalence boundaries of +/-3.9 g/d, indicating equivalent weight gain. secondary outcomes did not show significant differences between groups during the treatment period. conclusion: infants fed formulas containing probiotics or synbiotics show a similar rate in weight gain compared with those fed a control formula and tolerate these formulas well.

TI  == fecal microflora of greek healthy neonates.
AB  == this study aimed to explore, in our geographical region, the development of intestinal microflora and the colonization patterns of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria during the first three months of life and to investigate the effect of the mode of delivery. fecal specimens from 82 healthy, full-term infants were collected prospectively 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery and subcultured on nonselective and selective media. identification of isolates was performed by microbiological and molecular methods. for the delivery effect, two  groups of vaginally or caesarean-delivered exclusively breast-fed infants were studied. despite the early high total counts of aerobes and anaerobes, colonization of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria was overall limited until 3 months of age. furthermore, caesarean-delivered infants were less often colonized with lactobacilli at day 4 (4% vs. 59%, p = 0.000) and with bifidobacteria at day 4 (0% vs. 23%, p = 0.015) and 30 (0% vs. 35%, p = 0.042) compared to vaginally delivered ones. no bacterial populations differences were detected to compare colonized infants. identification results indicated the predominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus paracasei species in neonatal gut microflora up to the first month of life and diversity of lactobacillus species in vaginally delivered, colonized newborns, at fourth day.  furthermore, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium breve were the most frequently detected bifidobacterium species in vaginally delivered, breast-fed infants. in conclusion our study revealed a restricted colonization pattern of lactic acid bacteria in greek infants and a delay in the development of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium spp. microbiota after caesarean section. further analysis of potential consequences of these findings is required.

TI  == rapid identification of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in probiotic products using multiplex pcr.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract and reinforce immunity in human health. recently, many functional products using the  lactic acid bacteria have been developed. among these lab, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium bifidum are frequently used for probiotic products. in order to monitor these lab in commercial probiotic products, a multiplex pcr method was developed. we designed four species-specific primer pairs for multiplex pcr from the 16s rrna,  16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region, and 23s rrna genes in lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium bifidum. using these primer pairs, 4 different lab were detected with high specificity in functional foods. we suggest that the multiplex pcr method developed in this study would be an efficient tool for simple, rapid, and reliable identification of lab used as probiotic strains.

TI  == the role of a probiotics mixture in the treatment of childhood constipation: a pilot study.
AB  == background: inconsistent data exist about the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of constipation. several studies in adults with constipation showed positive effects of probiotics on constipation. inconsistent data exist regarding the effect of a single probiotic strain in constipated children. the aim of this  pilot study was to determine the effect of a mixture of probiotics containing bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the treatment of childhood constipation. methods: children aged 4-16 years with constipation as defined by the rome iii criteria were eligible for the study. during a 4 week period, children received a daily mix of 4 x 109 colony forming units of a probiotic mixture (ecologic(r)relief) containing bifidobacteria (b.) bifidum, b. infantis, b. longum, lactobacilli (l.) casei, l. plantarum and l. rhamnosus. primary outcome measures were frequency of bowel movements (bms) per week and stool consistency.  secondary outcome measures were number of faecal incontinence episodes per week,  abdominal pain and side effects. results: twenty children, 50% male, median age 8 (range 4-16) were included. the frequency of bms per week increased from 2.0 (1.0-5.0) to 4.2 (0.0-16.0) in week 2 (p = 0.10) and 3.8 (2.1-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.13). in 12 children presenting with <3 bms/week, bms per week increased significantly from 1.0 (0.0-2.0) to 3.0 (0.0-7.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 3.0 (0.0-10.0) in week 4 (p = 0.01). the stool consistency was reported as hard in 7  children at baseline, in 4 children at week 2 (p = 0.23) and in 6 children after  4 weeks of treatment (p = 1.00). a significant decrease in number of faecal incontinence episodes per week was found in the entire group: 4.0 (0.0-35.0) to 1.5 (0.0-14.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 0.3 (0.0-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.001). the  presence of abdominal pain decreased significantly from 45% to 25% in week 2 (p = 0.04) and 20% at week 4 (p = 0.006). no side effects were reported. conclusion: this pilot study shows that a mixture of probiotics, has positive effects on symptoms of constipation. to confirm these findings, a large randomised placebo controlled trial is required.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == effect of maternal consumption of lactobacillus gg on transfer and establishment  of fecal bifidobacterial microbiota in neonates.
AB  == background: establishment of the gut microbiota at birth provides a substantial source of microbial stimuli for the maturation of the immune system. deviations in this process precede the development of specific diseases providing the rationale for the use of probiotics to counteract them. objective: this study was designed to characterize both the mother-infant bifidobacteria transfer at birth  and the development of bifidobacteria microbiota during the first weeks of life in infants whose mothers received lactobacillus rhamnosus gg or placebo. methods: species-specific pcr was used to assess the fecal bifidobacterial composition of  mothers before and after delivery and in infants at 5 days and 3 weeks of age. results: bifidobacterium longum was the species most commonly found in the mothers. bifidobacterium catenulatum was the most prevalent group in infants at 5 days of age and b. longum the predominant species at 3 weeks. at 5 days of age, infants whose mothers received l. rhamnosus gg showed a significantly higher occurrence of b. breve and lower of b. adolescentis than those from the placebo group. in addition, l. rhamnosus gg consumption increased the bifidobacterial diversity in infants and reduced the bifidobacterium microbiota similarity between mother and infant. conclusions: these results indicate that specific changes in the transfer and initial establishment of bifidobacteria in neonates take place as consequence of the consumption of l. rhamnosus gg by the mothers.

AB  == a dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. the dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees c, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. the model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (bifidobacterium  animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus kefir, lactobacillus kefirgranum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. five strains were not  able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at ph 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. two strains (bifidobacterium animalis atcc 25527 and lactobacillus johnsonii la-1 ncc 533) showed good survival with both methods. the dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper gi tract  transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to ph levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

TI  == probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  == antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. in some cases, it could represent a life-threatening event. clostridium difficile colitis is a further distinct complication of antibiotic administration. treatment options for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and clostridium difficile colitis include supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper. three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic effect of saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in two double-blind controlled studies. other studies focusing on lactobacillus as a new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind. among these, a positive effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum and enterococcus faecium sf68 has been reported. effectiveness of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more rigorous dose standardisation.

TI  == probiotics: "living drugs".
AB  == the uses, mechanisms of action, and safety of probiotics are discussed. probiotics are live microorganisms or microbial mixtures administered to improve  the patient's microbial balance, particularly the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. the yeast saccharomyces boulardii and the  bacterium lactobacillus rhamnosus, strain gg, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. other probiotics  that have demonstrated at least some promise as prophylaxis for this type of diarrhea are lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium longum, and enterococcus  faecium. the use of s. boulardii as an adjunctive treatment to therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin has been found in controlled studies to decrease further recurrences of clostridium difficile-associated disease. other gastrointestinal disorders for which probiotics have been studied include traveler's diarrhea, acute infantile diarrhea, and acute diarrhea in adults. several lactobacillus species given in yogurt or in tablet or suppository form have shown clinical efficacy as a treatment for vaginal infections. lactobacillus strains have also been examined as a treatment for urinary-tract infections. putative mechanisms of action of probiotics include production of pathogen-inhibitory substances, inhibition of pathogen attachment, inhibition of  the action of microbial toxins, stimulation of immunoglobulin a, and trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. the available probiotics are considered nonpathogenic, but even benign microorganisms can be infective when a patient is  severely debilitated or immunosuppressed. probiotics have demonstrated an ability to prevent and treat some infections. effective use of probiotics could decrease  patients' exposure to antimicrobials. additional controlled studies are needed to clearly define the safety and efficacy of these agents.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
