TI  - Detection of bacterial DNA in atheromatous plaques by quantitative PCR.
AB  - This is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial DNA from ten species, including periodontal species and Chlamydia pneumoniae. We examined 129 samples of DNA extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences from ten different species: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.), Tannerella forsythensis, Eikenella corrodens, Prevotella intermedia, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, Treponema denticola and C. pneumoniae. All determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods employing SYBR Green. Species from the Bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. Almost half of the samples contained DNA from A. a. and C. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. S. aureus and S. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. S. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. The proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic DNA. The data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. We conclude that DNA from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of C. pneumoniae to the inflammation may be minimal.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  - We studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot for anaerobes. Ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/L with only 4/5 Campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 Campylobacter rectus strains requiring . or = 16 mg/L for inhibition. Ertapenem was only moderately active (MIC 8 mg/L) against 4/6 Enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. All Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella septica, Pasteurella canis, Pasteurella dagmatis, Moraxella spp. and EF-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/L. MIC(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: Corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/L; Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/L; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/L; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/L; Streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/L; Eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/L; and Bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/L. For anaerobes the range of MICs and MIC(90)s were: Prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/L; Porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/L; Fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/L; Bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/L; and Peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/L. Ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.
TI  - The changing face of odontogenic infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to compare characteristics of patients hospitalized with odontogenic infections during the 1980s to those of the 1990s. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was a retrospective record review that compared 2 cohorts of patients admitted to the same institution during two 81-month periods, one decade apart. Admission criteria were face or neck swelling suggesting abscess or cellulitis and one or more of the following: temperature above 38 degrees C, white blood cell (WBC) count greater than 10.8 x 10(3)/microL, or concern about airway compromise. Characteristics reviewed were age, gender, race, admission temperature, admission WBC count, fascial space(s) involved, tooth of etiology, duration of hospitalization, and bacteria isolated. Data were compared for statistical significance (P <.05). RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the 2 cohorts for age, gender, race, admission temperature, admission WBC count, space involvement, or length of stay (P <.05). One tooth (mandibular left first molar) of 52 was involved more frequently in the 1990 group (P <.03). Gram-positive cocci were isolated significantly more frequently from the 1990s patients than from the 1980s patients (P <.03). There were also significant differences (P <.02) between cohorts in the isolation frequency of individual genera, such as alpha-hemolytic Streptococci, coagulase negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides melanogenicus, beta-lactamase positive Bacteroides, Eikenella corrodens, and Neisseria species. Eighty-one percent of the bacteria cultured from the 1990s patients were resistant to one or more common antibiotics; 47% of these organisms were Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: No clinically significant differences existed in the characteristics of patients hospitalized with odontogenic infections between the 1980s and the 1990s. Although there were differences in the type and prevalence of bacteria isolated, this was probably a result of changes in nomenclature, identification protocols, and isolation techniques.
TI  - Simian bites and bacterial infection.
AB  - Three patients with simian bites and resultant infection are described. The bacteriology of the wounds was diverse and included alpha-hemolytic streptococci and other streptococci in all wounds, enterococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterobacteriaceae. A literature review revealed brief mentions of 132 cases of simian bites in some of which Bacteroides species, Fusobacterium species, and Eikenella corrodens were isolated. Infection, despite antimicrobial therapy, and complications, such as osteomyelitis and flexion contractures, occurred frequently.
TI  - Microbiology of cerebral abscess: a four-year study in Malaysia.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology of cerebral abscess in relation to the primary source of infections. Seventy-five patients with cerebral abscess were included in the study in the period January 1985 to December 1988. More than half of the patients studied had single lesions and the overall most common sites were in the frontal and parietal regions. Chronic suppurative otitis media, cyanotic congenital heart diseases and meningitis were among the important predisposing conditions in these patients. Approximately 25% of the patients with cerebral abscesses had no documented antecedent infections. Pure cultures were found to be predominant (66.7%) and sterile cultures were obtained from 10 (13.3%) patients. Streptococci were isolated from 23 (30.7%) patients, the commonest species being Streptococcus milleri. Proteus sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putrifaciens and Bacteroides sp were almost exclusively found in cerebral abscesses secondary to chronic suppurative otitis media; these organisms were found in mixed cultures. Streptococcus milleri, Bacteroides sp and Eikenella corrodens were found in pure cultures in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. In patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts in-situ, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and diphtheroids were common. Anaerobes were found in 15 (20.0%) patients, the majority in mixed cultures. Culture, as well as gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of volatile fatty acids of cerebral pus, was carried out to enhance the detection of the anaerobes. Based on these findings, an antibiotic regimen consisting of penicillin, chloramphenicol and metronidazole is recommended as an initial therapy while awaiting culture and sensitivity results.
TI  - Bacteria reactive to plaque-toxin-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are related  to the severity of gingivitis at the sampled site.
AB  - Certain monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) neutralize the inhibition of HL60 cell growth by bacterial plaque extracts. The aim of this study was to enumerate and identify the bacteria reactive to these Mabs at sites where periodontal disease was measured by gingival index, pocket depth and attachment loss. The bacterial colonies were grown on blood agar and the colonies counted directly and after immunoblotting. Sites that bled on probing (n = 15) had a mean of 3.35% Mab-positive colonies (SEM = 0.52%) and sites that did not bleed (n = 9) had a mean of 1.61% (SEM = 0.41%). The percentage of Mab-positive colonies also correlated with gingival index but not with the total number of colonies sampled, attachment loss or pocket depth. Antigen was expressed by 4 genera: strains of Streptococcus sanguis and/or Eikenella corrodens (8 sites), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4 sites) and Corynebacterium minutissimus (1 site). The results suggest that the antigens detected on these bacteria by the Mabs may be processed to form toxins and maintain gingivitis by irritating the surrounding cells.

TI  - Efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin in endocarditis.
AB  - Imipenem, a potent new beta-lactam antibiotic, which is bactericidal against most pathogenic bacteria, and cilastatin, a dehydropeptidase inhibitor combined with imipenem to prevent the metabolism of imipenem in the kidney, were evaluated in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis. Seventeen patients, including 14 who used intravenous drugs, were treated with imipenem/cilastatin in a dose of 500 mg each infused over 30 minutes every six hours. The mean duration of treatment was 29 days with a range of 21 to 56 days. Causative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus in 10 patients, S. aureus plus group B Streptococcus in one, viridans group Streptococcus in two, Neisseria subflava, Eikenella corrodens, and group G Streptococcus in one patient, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Hemophilus aphrophilus, and Enterobacter aerogenes in one patient each. The minimal bactericidal concentration of imipenem against 16 of 18 isolates tested was 0.04 micrograms/ml, 1 microgram/ml against H. aphrophilus, and 0.4 micrograms/ml against E. aerogenes. The site of infection was the right side of the heart in 11 patients, the left side in five, and both sides in one. The mean number of days to defervescence was 9.7. All patients were cured, and none required cardiac surgery. Adverse effects were few and interrupted treatment occurred in only one patient who had acute dyspnea during an infusion on Day 26 of therapy. Imipenem/cilastatin appears to be a relatively safe and highly effective treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis in intravenous drug users; too few patients with endocarditis caused by other bacteria were treated to allow a firm statement about efficacy in non-staphylococcal endocarditis.
