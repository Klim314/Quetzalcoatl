TI  - A derivative of the thiopeptide GE2270A highly selective against Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - A chemical derivative of the thiopeptide GE2270A, designated NAI003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few Gram-positive bacteria. In particular, NAI003 retained low MICs against all tested isolates of Propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against Enterococcus faecalis. Furthermore, NAI003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive P. acnes isolate. Gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, NAI003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (EF) Tu derived from Escherichia coli, E. faecalis or P. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. In contrast, EF-Tu's derived from the NAI003-insenstitive Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. These results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that NAI003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the P. acnes EF-Tu. P. acnes mutants resistant to NAI003 were isolated by direct plating. With one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding EF-Tu. Because of its selective effect on P. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, NAI003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a Phase 1 clinical study.
TI  - Green synthesis of copper nanoparticles by Citrus medica Linn. (Idilimbu) juice and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - We report an eco-friendly method for the synthesis of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) using Citron juice (Citrus medica Linn.), which is nontoxic and cheap. The biogenic copper nanoparticles were characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometer showing a typical resonance (SPR) at about 631 nm which is specific for CuNPs. Nanoparticles tracking analysis by NanoSight-LM20 showed the particles in the range of 10-60 nm with the concentration of 2.18 x 10(8) particles per ml. X-ray diffraction revealed the FCC nature of nanoparticles with an average size of 20 nm. The antimicrobial activity of CuNPs was determined by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method against some selected species of bacteria and plant pathogenic fungi. It was reported that the synthesized CuNPs demonstrated a significant inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes and Salmonella typhi. Among the plant pathogenic fungi tested, Fusarium culmorum was found to be most sensitive followed by F. oxysporum and F. graminearum. The novelty of this work is that for the first time citron juice was used for the synthesis of CuNPs.
TI  - Infection after primary anatomic versus primary reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deep periprosthetic infection is a serious complication after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and is associated with suboptimal clinical results. This retrospective study aimed to determine whether a difference in infection rate existed after primary anatomic TSA (aTSA) and primary reverse TSA (rTSA). METHODS: A TSA database was retrospectively reviewed to identify primary TSAs performed from 2004 to 2012 and isolate cases of confirmed deep periprosthetic infection. Data collected included age, sex, preoperative diagnosis, previous nonarthroplasty operative history, implant type, and infecting organism. RESULTS: From 814 primary TSAs performed, deep periprosthetic infections were confirmed in 16 shoulders. Infections occurred in 6 aTSAs and 10 rTSAs, with no significant difference among the prosthesis types. Pathogens included Staphylococcus spp, Propionibacterium acnes, and Escherichia coli. In the subgroup of shoulders with no previous operations, no significant difference in infection rate was found among the prosthesis types. Shoulders with previous nonarthroplasty operations undergoing primary TSA exhibited a significantly higher (P = .016) infection rate compared with shoulders with no operative history. Both aTSA and rTSA performed in previously operated-on shoulders demonstrated higher infection rates compared with shoulders with no prior operative intervention. The infection rate was significantly higher (P = .016) in the rTSA group. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in infection rate after primary aTSA and primary rTSA in shoulders that have not undergone previous operative interventions. Infection is more likely to develop in shoulders undergoing primary rTSA that have had one or more nonarthroplasty operative procedures.
TI  - Reduced Expression of Dermcidin, a Peptide Active Against Propionibacterium acnes, in Sweat of Patients with Acne Vulgaris.
AB  - Dermcidin (DCD), an antimicrobial peptide with a broad spectrum of activity against bacteria such as Propionibacterum acnes, is expressed constitutively in sweat in the absence of stimulation due to injury or inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between DCD expression and acne vulgaris associated with P. acnes. The antimicrobial activity of recombinant full-length DCD (50 mug/ml) was 97% against Escherichia coli and 100% against Staphylococcus aureus. Antimicrobial activity against P. acnes ranged from 68% at 50 mug/ml DCD to 83% at 270 mug/ml DCD. DCD concentration in sweat from patients with acne vulgaris (median 9.8 mug/ml, range 6.9-95.3 mug/ml) was significantly lower than in healthy subjects (median 136.7 mug/ml, range 45.4-201.6 mug/ml) (p = 0.001). DCD demonstrated concentration-dependent, but partial, microbicidal activity against P. acnes. These results suggest that reduced DCD concentration in sweat in patients with inflammatory acne may permit proliferation of P. acnes in pilosebaceous units, resulting in progression of inflammatory acne.
TI  - Enzymatic treatment of specimens before DNA extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by DNA amplification techniques (PCR). Moreover the targeted DNA has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. The goal of the present work was to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make DNA available for further extraction and amplification. METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase K; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase K. DNAs was manually extracted using the QIAmp DNA Mini kit or the MagNA Pure Compact automate. DNA extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid Herpesvirus. Bacterial detection was performed using TaqMan real-time PCR and yeasts and filamentous Fungi with HRM (real-time PCR followed by high-resolution melting analysis). RESULTS: Viral DNA was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. Either the manual or the automatic DNA extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for Fungi and Proteinase K for Bacteria. The addition of lyticase and proteinase K did not improve results. For Fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for Proteinase K, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. DISCUSSION: Columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting DNA and separate PCR inhibitors. Detection rates cannot be related to DNA-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.
TI  - Vaccination of lambs against Haemonchus contortus infection with a somatic protein (Hc23) from adult helminths.
AB  - A somatic protein from adult Haemonchus contortus (Hc23), the most abundant component in a low molecular weight fraction with known immunizing effect against experimental haemonchosis, has been purified by immunochromatography. The immunoprophylactic value of Hc23 was tested in groups of 5-6 months old Assaf lambs using Al(OH)(3) or Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide+inactivated Propionibacterium acnes as adjuvant and the results compared with uninfected control, uninfected and challenged or infected and challenged lambs. Immunization with Hc23 in either adjuvant elicited significant reductions in fecal egg counts after challenge with 15,000 L3s (70.67%-85.64%, respectively) and reduced (67.1% and 86%) abomasal worm counts (45 days post-challenge). Immunized lambs displayed higher peripheral eosinophil counts, were less anaemic and had weight gains than challenged controls. The results suggest that the Hc23 antigen can induce a partially protective response against haemonchosis in lambs.
TI  - Lower complication rates for cranioplasty with peri-operative bundle.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The overall benefits of craniectomy must include procedural risks from cranioplasty. Cranioplasty carries a high risk of surgical site infections (SSI) particularly with antibiotic resistant bacteria. The goal of this study was to measure the effect of a cranioplasty bundle on peri-operative complications. METHODS: The authors queried a prospective, inpatient neurosurgery database at Kaiser Sacramento Medical Center for craniectomy and cranioplasty over a 7 year period. 57 patients who underwent cranioplasties were identified. A retrospective chart review was completed for complications, including surgical complications such as SSI, wound dehiscence, and re-do cranioplasty. We measured cranioplasty complication rates before and after implementation of a peri-operative bundle, which consisted of peri-operative vancomycin (4 doses), a barrier dressing through post-operative day (POD) 3, and de-colonization of the surgical incision using topical chlorhexidine from POD 4 to 7. RESULTS: The rate of MRSA colonization in cranioplasty patients is three times higher than the average seen on ICU admission screening (19% vs. 6%). The cranioplasty surgical complication rate was 22.8% and SSI rate was 10.5%. The concurrent SSI rate for craniectomy was 1.9%. Organisms isolated were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (4), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (1), Propionibacterium acnes (1), and Escherichia coli (1). Factors associated with SSI were peri-operative vancomycin (68.6% vs. 16.7%, p=0.0217). Complication rates without (n=21) and with (n=36) the bundle were: SSI (23.8% vs. 2.8%, p=0.0217) and redo cranioplasty (19% vs. 0%, p=0.0152). Bundle use did not affect rates for superficial wound dehiscence, seizures, or hydrocephalus. CONCLUSIONS: The cranioplasty bundle was associated with reduced SSI rates and the need for re-do cranioplasties.
TI  - Propionic acid and its esterified derivative suppress the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus USA300.
AB  - Previously, we demonstrated that Propionibacterium acnes, a human skin commensal  bacterium, ferments glycerol into short-chain fatty acids, including propionic acid. Propionic acid suppressed the growth of Staphylococcus aureus USA300, a community-acquired methicillin-resistant bacterium, in vitro and in vivo. In this study, it is demonstrated that the anti-USA300 activity of propionic acid persisted after buffering the acid with 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1- piperazineethanesulfonic acid. This suggests that the growth suppression of USA300 mainly resulted from the antimicrobial activity of propionic acid per se and not from the acidity of the medium. In addition, proprionic acid significantly reduced the intracellular pH of USA300 and exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. P. acnes showed a higher tolerance to propionic acid. Next, an esterified derivative of propionic acid was synthesised. Propionic acid and the esterified derivative were equivalent in their efficacy to suppress the growth of USA300 in vitro. The esterified derivative thus provides an alternative to propionic acid as an antimicrobial agent against S. aureus.
TI  - In search of a candidate pathogen for giant cell arteritis: sequencing-based characterization of the giant cell arteritis microbiome.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the microbiome of the temporal artery in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA), and to apply an unbiased and comprehensive shotgun sequencing-based approach to determine whether there is an enrichment of candidate pathogens in the affected tissue. METHODS: Temporal artery biopsy specimens were collected from patients at a single institution over a period of 4 years, and unbiased DNA sequencing was performed on 17 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. Twelve of the 17 patients fulfilled the clinical and histopathologic criteria for GCA, and the other 5 patients served as controls. Using PathSeq software, human DNA sequences were computationally subtracted, and the remaining non-human DNA sequences were taxonomically classified using a comprehensive microbial sequence database. The relative abundance of microbes was inferred based on read counts assigned to each organism. Comparison of the microbial diversity between GCA cases and controls was carried out using hierarchical clustering and linear discriminant analysis of effect size. RESULTS: Propionibacterium acnes and Escherichia coli were the most abundant microorganisms in 16 of the 17 samples, and Moraxella catarrhalis was the most abundant organism in 1 control sample. Pathogens previously described to be correlated with GCA were not differentially abundant in cases compared to controls. There was not a significant burden of likely pathogenic viruses. CONCLUSION: DNA sequencing of temporal artery biopsy specimens from GCA cases, in comparison with non-GCA controls, showed no evidence of previously identified candidate GCA pathogens. A single pathogen was not clearly and consistently associated with GCA in this case series.
TI  - LPS and inactivated Propionibacterium acnes elicit a partially protective response in primary infections of Heligmosomoides polygyrus.
AB  - Intestinal helminth infections are common and of paramount economic importance in domestic animals. Available chemotherapy is limited and anthelmintic resistance is widespread in some hosts. This scenario favors the exploration of alternative methods of control, among them immune modulators. The effect of Escherichia coli LPS+Propionibacterium acnes on a primary infection of Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Trichostongyloidea) in mice has been tested. Nematode infection induced a rise of specific IgG1, both serum and intestinal, and a significant reduction in the unspecific (ConA) lymphoproliferative response. Treatment with the immune modulator (days -2, 0, 7 and 14 post infection) elicited an apparent delay of larval intramucosal development. Moreover cumulative nematode egg shedding in treated mice was significantly lower (p=0.0041). Preliminary results point toward the interest of immune modulators to control intestinal helminths.
TI  - Influence of different additives and their concentrations on corneal toxicity and antimicrobial effect of benzalkonium chloride.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the ophthalmic additives responsible for modulating acute corneal epithelial toxicity induced by benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and investigate the ability of polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 (HCO-40) and polysorbate 80 (PS-80) to reduce the corneal toxicity and antimicrobial effects of BAC. METHODS: Cytotoxicity of the additives, which included glycerin, polyvinyl alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and PS-80, on rabbit corneal epithelial cells was examined using the cell proliferation assay in the presence and absence of 0.02% BAC. The corneal transepithelial electrical resistance change after a 60-second exposure to HCO-40 or PS-80 mixed with 0.02% BAC was measured in living rabbits. Corneal damage was examined using scanning electron microscopy. The antimicrobial activities of HCO-40 and PS-80 with 0.02% BAC against Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were assessed. RESULTS: Of all the tested additives, only PS-80 could prevent the BAC-induced cytotoxicity. Corneal epithelial barrier function disorder caused by 0.02% BAC was significantly alleviated by either PS-80 or HCO-40 in a concentration-dependent manner. Scanning electron microscopy images showed an improvement of BAC-induced corneal epithelial toxicity after the addition of HCO-40 or PS-80. The antimicrobial effect of the BAC against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. pneumoniae was reduced after adding HCO-40 or PS-80. CONCLUSIONS: HCO-40 and PS-80 reduce acute corneal toxicity and the antimicrobial effect of BAC. Possible interactions between BAC and other additives should be taken into consideration when evaluating the toxicity and antibacterial properties of BAC.
TI  - Effects of cryopreservation on microbial-contaminated cord blood.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cord blood units (CBUs) are associated with significant risk of exposure to microbial contamination during collection and processing; however, the survival of bacteria within a CBU is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine whether contaminating organisms in CBU survive the cryopreservation, frozen storage, and subsequent thawing conditions before infusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 134 CBUs rejected from banking due to known contamination were thawed and rescreened using blood culture bottles (BacT/ALERT, bioMerieux). An additional 61 fresh CBUs were deliberately spiked with a range of microbial organisms and evaluated both before freeze and after thaw. RESULTS: Microbial contaminants were detected after thaw in 63% of stored contaminated CBUs and 85% of spiked CBUs. Postthaw organism detection in spiked cord blood (CB) was higher in adult culture bottles (80%) than pediatric culture bottles (61%). Twenty percent of spiked organisms, particularly Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sporogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes, were not detected in prefreeze samples but were detectable after thaw. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the majority of contaminating organisms isolated in a prefreeze sample of CB have the ability to survive cryopreservation, frozen storage, and thawing. Further, CBUs reported as microbial free may contain microbial contamination, which could result in transplantation of contaminated CB and be potentially deleterious to a patient.
TI  - [Role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  - According to the data of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),  at least 6 virus species (HPV, EBV, HHV-8/KSHV, HTLV-1, HBV, HCV), 4 helminthes species (Schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis) and I bacterium species (Helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. The analysis of the data available shows that Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV), monkey virus 40 (SV40), cytomegalovirus (CMV), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMRV), Helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Prevotella spp., Streptococcus bovis and anginosus, Treponema denticola, Salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Propionibacterium acnes, Tropheryma whippelii, Schistosoma mansoni, Opistorchis felineus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia solium, Candida spp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Histoplasma capsulatum and Trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. Apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of a novel series of 17-azapentacyclo [6.6.5.0(2.7).0(9.14).0(15,19)]nonadeca-2,4,6,9,11,13-hexaen-16,18-dione derivatives.
AB  - In the search for novel antimicrobial agents, a series of new derivatives - N-substituted imides were prepared. All of the compounds were characterized by 'H NMR and ESI MS spectra. These derivatives were tested for antimicrobial activity. Microorganisms used in this study included aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and obligatory anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Propionibacterium acnes. Moreover, Candida albicans yeast was used. For representatives of all species the MICs of the investigated compounds were determined. Most of investigated derivatives had no antimicrobial activity (MIC > 512 mg/L) except the derivative 22 which showed slight activity against Gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes.
TI  - Target- and resistance-based mechanistic studies with TP-434, a novel fluorocycline antibiotic.
AB  - TP-434 is a novel, broad-spectrum fluorocycline antibiotic with activity against  bacteria expressing major antibiotic resistance mechanisms, including tetracycline-specific efflux and ribosomal protection. The mechanism of action of TP-434 was assessed using both cell-based and in vitro assays. In Escherichia coli cells expressing recombinant tetracycline resistance genes, the MIC of TP-434 (0.063 mug/ml) was unaffected by tet(M), tet(K), and tet(B) and increased to 0.25 and 4 mug/ml in the presence of tet(A) and tet(X), respectively. Tetracycline, in contrast, was significantly less potent (MIC >/= 128 mug/ml) against E. coli cells when any of these resistance mechanisms were present. TP-434 showed potent inhibition in E. coli in vitro transcription/translation (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 0.29 +/- 0.09 mug/ml) and [(3)H]tetracycline ribosome-binding competition (IC(50) = 0.22 +/- 0.07 muM) assays. The antibacterial potencies of TP-434 and all other tetracycline class antibiotics tested were reduced by 4- to 16-fold, compared to that of the wild-type control strain, against Propionibacterium acnes strains carrying a 16S rRNA mutation, G1058C, a modification that changes the conformation of the primary binding site of tetracycline in the ribosome. Taken together, the findings support the idea that TP-434, like other tetracyclines, binds the ribosome and inhibits protein synthesis and that this activity is largely unaffected by the common tetracycline resistance mechanisms.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - Nickel allergy-promoting effects of microbial or inflammatory substances at the sensitization step in mice.
AB  - Microbial components stimulate innate immunity via Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), and/or IL-1. We recently reported that in mice, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS, TLR4-ligand) promotes allergic responses to nickel (Ni) at both the sensitization and elicitation steps. Here, we examined in mice the effects of administering other microbial or inflammatory materials at the Ni-sensitization step. A mixture of 1mM NiCl(2) and a test solution was injected into BALB/c mice intraperitoneally (0.1 ml/10 g body weight), and 10 days later 5mM NiCl(2) was challenged intradermally into the ear pinnas of the mice (20 mul/ear). The following preparations or substances exhibited adjuvant activities: Prevotella intermedia LPS, Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan, a synthetic muramyl dipeptide (NOD2-stimulating cell-wall component of bacteria), Pam(3)Cys-SKKKK (TLR2-stimulating synthetic peptide), poly I:C (TLR3-stimulating double-stranded RNA), concanavalin A (a typical T-cell mitogen and T-cell-mediated hepatitis-inducer), heat-killed Propionibacterium acnes (Gram-positive bacterium that causes pimples and induces macrophage-mediated experimental hepatitis), and nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (chemicals stimulating IL-1 production). Unexpectedly, P. intermedia LPS, which displayed the most potent adjuvant activity among the tested preparations, was effective in TLR4-dysfunctional mutant mice, but not in TLR2-deficient mice, whereas the reverse was true for S. cerevisiae mannan. These results suggest that (i) for the establishment of Ni-allergy in mice, stimulation of innate immunity (including TLRs, NLRs, IL-1 production, and/or other factors) may be important at the sensitization step, and (ii) P. intermedia may produce a substance(s) that potently promotes Ni-allergy via stimulation of TLR2.
TI  - Evaluation of the ScanRDI(R) as a Rapid Alternative to the Pharmacopoeial Sterility Test Method: Comparison of the Limits of Detection.
AB  - Two sterility test methods, the ScanRDI(R) rapid sterility test and the United States Pharmacopeia/European Pharmacopoeia/Japanese Pharmacopoeia (USP/EP/JP) compendial sterility test, were compared with respect to the limits of detection for the presence of viable microorganisms in aqueous solutions at low inoculation levels. The ScanRDI(R) system employs a combination of direct fluorescent labeling techniques and solid-phase laser scanning cytometry to rapidly enumerate viable microorganisms from aqueous samples, whereas the compendial sterility test is a qualitative, growth-based method that uses a visual assessment of turbidity to indicate microbial contamination. Eight microorganisms were evaluated, seven compendial microorganisms (Clostridium sporogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans) and the Gram-positive anaerobe Propionibacterium acnes. The number of viable organisms was estimated using the ScanRDI(R) method and the conventional sterility test method using most probable number methodology. The mean difference between the methods was computed and 95% confidence intervals around the mean difference were estimated. The ScanRDI(R) method was found to be numerically superior and statistically non-inferior to the compendial (USP/EP/JP) sterility test with respect to the limits of detection for all organisms tested.
TI  - Efficacy of an anaerobic swab transport system to maintain aerobic and anaerobic  microorganism viability after storage at -80 degrees C.
AB  - An Amies agar gel swab transport system was evaluated for its ability to maintain bacterial viability and relative quantity after freezing at -80 degrees C. Nine American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) bacterial strains were used: 3 anaerobic strains (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sporogenes) and 6 facultative or strict aerobic bacterial strains (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Escherichia coli ([ATCC 25922 and ATCC 11775], Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Lactobacillus casei). The bacterial species were chosen because they corresponded to bacteria identified in psittacine feces and cloacal samples. There were no significant differences between growth scores at baseline and after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days for any of the bacteria examined after 48 and 72 hr of incubation, with the exception of P. anaerobius. For P. anaerobius, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the growth score after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days from that of the baseline; however, the bacteria were still viable. The tested swab transport system may be useful when lengthy storage and transport times necessitate freezing samples prior to culture.
TI  - Evaluation of the epinecidin-1 peptide as an active ingredient in cleaning solutions against pathogens.
AB  - We tested the activity of epinecidin-1, a novel antimicrobial peptide structurally related to pleurocidin, in commercial cleaning solutions stored at 4 and 25 degrees C for 7 and 14 days. The peptide's activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, and Candida albicans were measured in a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination, minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) determination, disk diffusion test, and a count of the bacterial numbers. Exposure to epinecidn-1 in a cleaning solution following MIC value comparisons in the disk diffusion test and counts of bacterial numbers after 16, 24, 48, and 72 h suggested that bacterial numbers were much lower than those treated with only commercial cleaning solutions for all bacteria. The efficacy of the antimicrobial activities of inhibiting bacterial numbers by epinecidin-1 in cleaning solutions at a low pH and a low temperature was not affected. Given its simple structure and antimicrobial activity, epinecidin-1 may be a useful component of microbicides designed to prevent pathogen infections and/or remediate abnormal vaginal or skin flora.
TI  - Metagenomic detection of phage-encoded platelet-binding factors in the human oral cavity.
AB  - The human oropharynx is a reservoir for many potential pathogens, including streptococcal species that cause endocarditis. Although oropharyngeal microbes have been well described, viral communities are essentially uncharacterized. We conducted a metagenomic study to determine the composition of oropharyngeal DNA viral communities (both phage and eukaryotic viruses) in healthy individuals and to evaluate oropharyngeal swabs as a rapid method for viral detection. Viral DNA was extracted from 19 pooled oropharyngeal swabs and sequenced. Viral communities consisted almost exclusively of phage, and complete genomes of several phage were recovered, including Escherichia coli phage T3, Propionibacterium acnes phage PA6, and Streptococcus mitis phage SM1. Phage relative abundances changed dramatically depending on whether samples were chloroform treated or filtered to remove microbial contamination. pblA and pblB genes of phage SM1 were detected in the metagenomes. pblA and pblB mediate the attachment of S. mitis to platelets and play a significant role in S. mitis virulence in the endocardium, but have never previously been detected in the oral cavity. These genes were also identified in salivary metagenomes from three individuals at three time points and in individual saliva samples by PCR. Additionally, we demonstrate that phage SM1 can be induced by commonly ingested substances. Our results indicate that the oral cavity is a reservoir for pblA and pblB genes and for phage SM1 itself. Further studies will determine the association between pblA and pblB genes in the oral cavity and the risk of endocarditis.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of minerals from ores indigenous to Korea.
AB  - We tested the antibacterial properties of a mix of minerals consisting mainly of  sericite, talc, and halloysite from Korea. The preparation showed clear growth inhibition of the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus, as well as the anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes. These results indicate that this preparation, made from ore minerals indigenous to Korea, could be used to develop new antibacterial reagents.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of silver-processed catheters for neurosurgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of silver-processed catheters for use in neurosurgery using clinically predictive tests. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of a commercially available silver-processed external ventricular drain catheter was evaluated against Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli and Propionibacterium acnes. Non-impregnated catheters were used as controls. Two assays were performed: (i) testing the ability of the catheter to kill 100% of the attached bacteria (tK100); and (ii) in vitro challenge to determine the ability to prevent colonization under flow conditions. High and low inocula (10(4) and 10(7) cfu/mL) were used. Silver-processed and control catheters were examined by scanning electron microscopy and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy; electron back-scatter and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses were used to investigate the distribution of silver within the processed catheter. RESULTS: The silver-processed catheters were not able to kill any of the bacteria tested in the tK100 assay at high inoculum. At low inoculum S. epidermidis was eradicated and some activity was seen against E. coli but without complete eradication. MRSA was also not eradicated even at low inoculum. The in vitro challenge test showed no prevention of colonization for any of the strains. Silver particles were shown to be >500 nm in size. CONCLUSIONS: The commercial silver-impregnated catheter was not able to eradicate MRSA or E. coli and while it showed activity against S. epidermidis in one assay it was unable to prevent colonization in vitro under in-flow conditions. This is consistent with clinical studies on silver-processed catheters.
TI  - Detection and hazard assessment of pathogenic microorganisms in medical wastes.
AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the types and concentrations of microbial agents in various medical wastes as well as to characterize their survivals in these wastes at different temperatures for microbial risk assessment. Medical wastes collected from 5 major hospitals in South Korea were classified and stored at three different temperatures (-20, 6, and 30 degrees C). Presence of various microorganisms such as pathogenic viruses and bacteria were investigated by both cultivation and by (RT)-PCR assays. A number of (opportunistic) pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas spp., Lactobacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., Kocuria spp., Brevibacillus spp., Microbacterium oxydans, and Propionibacterium acnes, were identified from the various medical wastes. In addition, pathogenic viruses such as noroviruses and hepatitis B virus were also detected in one of the human tissue wastes. Commonly identified bacterial and viral pathogens such as Pseudomonas spp., Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus spp., and respiratory synctial virus (RSV) were inoculated into either gauzes or diapers, and their survivals were characterized. Viral agents such as RSV showed poor survival in most environmental conditions, and demonstrated that various pathogens could be present in medical wastes but that the associated health risk appeared to be low. However, medical waste should be carefully controlled and monitored to prevent nosocomial infection associated with the exposure to these wastes.
TI  - Novel mechanism of C-reactive protein for enhancing mouse liver innate immunity.
AB  - Although C-reactive protein (CRP) is a representative acute-phase protein produced by hepatocytes, the role of CRP in liver innate immunity remains unclear. Using C57BL/6 mice, the present study investigated how CRP affects the functions of liver macrophages, Kupffer cells, and natural killer / natural killer T (NK/NKT) cells under various conditions, including Escherichia coli infection, septic shock, and multiorgan dysfunction induced by interleukin (IL)-12/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (generalized Shwartzman reaction [GSR]), and LPS-induced lethal hepatitis in Propionibacterium acnes-primed mice. When mice were challenged with a lethal dose of E. coli, synthetic CRP peptide decreased the mortality without decreasing serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF), presumably by enhancing the phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells. Synthetic CRP greatly decreased the production of TNF and reactive oxygen species from Kupffer cells and thereby rescued mice after lethal LPS challenge. CRP also decreased the mortality from GSR and lethal hepatitis by inhibiting TNF production from Kupffer cells, especially phagocytosing Kupffer cells. However, interferon-gamma production from NK/NKT cells was generally not so affected. CRP reportedly binds to FcgammaRI and FcgammaRII, and the injection of anti-FcgammaRII/III Ab into mice abrogated TNF production from, but increased the phagocytic activity of, Kupffer cells. Furthermore, CRP pretreatment restored the decreased phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells in burn-injured mice and decreased TNF production by Kupffer cells and thereby inhibited mortality after sublethal E. coli infection. If CRP was injected into mice at 1 hour after lethal E. coli challenge, it slightly but significantly increased the survival rate. CONCLUSION: CRP thus enhances the phagocytosis of Kupffer cells but decreases their TNF production in a complex manner in which the pathway by way of FcgammaRII may be involved.
TI  - Cloning and expression of antibacterial goat lactoferricin from Escherichia coli  AD494(DE3)pLysS expression system.
AB  - Goat lactoferricin (GLfcin), an antibacterial peptide, is released from the N terminus of goat lactoferrin by pepsin digestion. Two GLfcin-related cDNAs, GLfcin L and GLfcin S, encoding Ala20-Ser60 and Ser36-Ser60 of goat lactoferrin, respectively, were cloned into the pET-23a(+) expression vector upstream from (His)6-Tag gene and transformed into Escherichia coli AD494(DE3)pLysS expression host. After being induced by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), two (His)6-Tag fused recombinant lactoferricins, GLfcin L-His*Tag and GLfcin S-His*Tag, were expressed in soluble form within the E. coli cytoplasm. The GLfcin L-His*Tag and GLfcin S-His*Tag were purified using HisTrap affinity chromatography. According to an antibacterial activity assay using the agar diffusion method, GLfcin L-His*Tag had antibacterial activity against E. coli BCRC 11549, Staphylococcus aureus BCRC 25923, and Propionibacterium acnes BCRC 10723, while GLfcin S-His*Tag was able to inhibit the growth of E. coli BCRC 11549 and P. acnes BCRC 10723. These two recombinant lactoferricins behaved as thermostable peptides, which could retain their activity for up to 30 min of exposure at 100 degrees C.
TI  - Expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of the soluble domain of PPA0092, a putative nitrite reductase from Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - The soluble domain (residues 483-913) of PPA0092, a putative copper-containing nitrite reductase from Propionibacterium acnes KPA171202, has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant protein was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. X-ray diffraction data were collected and processed to a maximum resolution of 2.4 A. The crystal belonged to space group P2(1)3, with unit-cell parameters a = b = c = 108.63 A. Preliminary diffraction data show that one molecule is present in the asymmetric unit; this corresponds to a V(M) of 2.1 A(3) Da(-1).
TI  - In vitro anti-adhesive activity of green tea extract against pathogen adhesion.
AB  - Camellia sinensis polysaccharide has been reported to possess anti-adhesive activity against pathogens. The present study was designed to investigate whether hot water extracts obtained from green tea leaves might inhibit pathogen adhesion to human or mouse cell lines. Green tea extract-4 (CSI-4) with the maximum yield of 4% (w/v) is composed of a major proportion of carbohydrates containing 40% uronic acids, but lack of catechins. It showed strong inhibitory activities against hemagglutination mediated by pathogens Helicobacter pylori, Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.01-0.5 mg/mL. CSI-4 further demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of these pathogens to host cell lines with the IC(50) values (50% inhibition of adhesion) of 0.14-2.3 mg/mL. It exhibited the highest activity against P. acnes, but no inhibitory effects were observed against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that CSI-4 may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria with no adverse effects against beneficial or commensal bacteria.
TI  - Proteomics integrated with Escherichia coli vector-based vaccines and antigen microarrays reveals the immunogenicity of a surface sialidase-like protein of Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - Proteomics is a powerful tool for the identification of proteins, which provides  a basis for rational vaccine design. However, it is still a highly technical and time-consuming task to examine a protein's immunogenicity utilizing traditional approaches. Here, we present a platform for effectively evaluating protein immunogenicity and antibody detection. A tetanus toxin C fragment (Tet-c) was used as a representative antigen to establish this platform. A cell wall-anchoring sialidase-like protein (SLP) of Propionibacterium acnes was utilized to assess the efficacy of this platform. We constructed an Escherichia coli vector-based vaccine by overexpressing Tet-c or SLP in E. coli and utilized an intact particle of E. coli itself as a vaccine (E. coli Tet-c or SLP vector). After ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the E. coli vector-based vaccines were administered intranasally into imprinting control region mice without adding exogenous adjuvants. For antibody detection, we fabricated antigen microarrays by printing with purified recombinant proteins including Tet-c and SLP. Our results demonstrated that detectable antibodies were elicited in mice 6 weeks after intranasal administration of UV-irradiated E. coli vector-based vaccines. The antibody production of Tet-c and SLP was significantly elevated after boosting. Notably, the platform with main benefits of using E. coli itself as a vaccine carrier provides a critical template for applied proteomics aimed at screening novel vaccine targets. In addition, the novel immunogenic SLP potentially serves as an antigen candidate for the development of vaccines targeting P. acnes-associated diseases.
TI  - Monitoring the physiologic stress response: a novel biophysical approach for the  rapid detection of bacteria in platelet concentrate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently approved culture-based methods for the bacterial testing of platelet concentrates (PCs) require an extended period of time to obtain results. A new approach based on the monitoring of the bacterial response to physiologic stress is presented. Because the stress response is independent of the growth rate, decisive results can be obtained in near real time. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PCs were spiked with Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes and Gram-negative Escherichia coli organisms commonly implicated in posttransfusion septic reactions. All suspensions were treated with Triton X-100 at concentrations that caused human cell lysis while acting as a stressor for bacterial cells. Normalized impedance response (NIR) profiles of these suspensions were recorded using the BioSense Technologies differential impedance sensing platform specifically designed to monitor subtle changes in the dielectric properties of biologic suspensions. Further development of the approach included measurement of NIRs for spiked PCs treated with nonlysing chemical stressors. RESULTS: NIR profiles for bacteria conventionally growing under optimal conditions were characterized by an overall increase in the NIR values. In contrast, the corresponding responses from chemically stressed bacteria revealed immediate and continuous decreases in value-enabling bacterial detection in less than 30 minutes. CONCLUSION: These pilot experiments demonstrated that monitoring of the bacterial stress response is a fast and effective way to detect bacteria in PCs. In addition, special culture conditions are not required for detecting anaerobes and fastidious species.
TI  - Ribosomal RNA-based analysis of the bacterial flora from the conjunctivae of cattle with bovine keratoconjunctivitis (BKC).
AB  - Bovine keratoconjunctivitis (BKC), colloquially referred to as 'pinkeye', is a disease affecting cattle worldwide; it costs cattle producers millions of dollars in economic loss annually. While Moraxella spp. are the primary etiologic agent of pinkeye, surveys of flora from the conjunctivae of livestock from around the world have indicated that a variety of bacterial commensals occupy this niche. We used molecular biology-based methods to determine the composition of bacterial flora in the conjunctivae of normal dairy and beef cattle from Maryland (n=113), and beef cattle with clinical BKC from Louisiana (n=42). Three regimens were used: 16S rRNA PCR and DGGE analysis of amplicons; 16S rRNA PCR and cloning of amplicons into Escherichia coli followed by screening and sequencing of clones harboring inserts; and culture of bacteria on chromogenic agar followed by 16S rRNA PCR and sequencing. Most taxa were comprised of saprophytes found in the environment, such as Bacillus, Pantoea, E. coli, and Exiguobacterium. Moraxella spp. were infrequently observed. Some species, such as Propionibacterium acnes, represent taxa not previously associated with the conjunctivae. Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus licheniformis isolates from the conjunctivae of Maryland cattle were genetically distinct from isolates previously implicated in septic infections in cattle at the same location. We conclude that employing 16S rRNA-based methods for bacterial identification can be useful in defining the flora present in the conjunctivae of normal cattle, and those with BKC.
TI  - Treatment of primary isolated shoulder sepsis in the adult patient.
AB  - Isolated shoulder sepsis is an uncommon clinical problem with little information  in the literature on causative organisms and potential sequelae. We examined the organisms involved, surgical treatments, antibiotic treatments rendered, and complications in these cases. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 19 adult patients (19 shoulders) who underwent operative treatment of isolated shoulder sepsis from 1996 to 2005. Patient age, gender, laboratory studies, previous treatment, surgical procedures, surgical findings, cultured organism, antibiotic treatment, and complications were reviewed. The organisms included methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (five), Streptococcus B beta hemolytic (five), Staphylococcus epidermidis (three), negative cultures (two), Streptococcus viridans (one), Escherichia coli (one), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (one), and Propionibacterium acnes (one). We treated patients with intravenous antibiotics an average of 4.2 weeks (range, 3-8 weeks). One patient underwent humeral head resection with an antibiotic spacer. Another patient died during hospitalization. Open or arthroscopic debridement in conjunction with appropriate antibiotics appears effective in eradicating infection in most adults who present with shoulder sepsis. Functional outcome is poor in those patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears and/or cartilage loss. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
TI  - Optimization of electrotransformation conditions for Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - Propionibacterium acnes has been known to be involved in the pathology of acne. However, the definite mechanism in the development of acne and the inflammation are unknown. For P. acnes, a transformation method has not been established, although it is believed to be a basic tool for gene manipulation. This study attempted to develop a P. acnes transformation method by using electroporation. Various parameters were used to develop and optimize the transformation of P. acnes. Among them two factors were crucial in the transformation for P. acnes: one was the E. coli strain from which the plasmid DNA had been isolated and the other the growth temperature of P. acnes-competent cells. It was essential to prepare plasmid DNA from a dam(-) E. coli strain, ET12567. When plasmid DNAs isolated from the other E. coli strains such as JM109 and HB101 were tested, transformation efficiency was extremely low. When P. acnes cells were cultivated at 24 degrees C for competent cell preparation, transformation efficiency increased considerably. When plasmid DNA isolated from a dam(-) mutant strain of E. coli was used for transformation of P. acnes which had been grown at 24 degrees C, maximum transformation efficiency of 1.5 x 10(4) transformants per mug of plasmid DNA was obtained at a field strength of 15 kV/cm with a pulse time of 3.2 ms. This is believed to be the first report on the transformation of P. acnes which can be employed for gene manipulations including knock-out of specific genes.
TI  - Linoleic acid isomerase from Propionibacterium acnes: purification, characterization, molecular cloning, and heterologous expression.
AB  - Propionibacterium acnes strain ATCC 6919 catalyzes the isomerization of the double bond at the C9 position in linoleic acid (c9,c12, 18:2) to form t10,c12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA, 18:2). CLA has significant health benefits in animal and human. The linoleic acid C9 isomerase was purified to an apparent homogeneity by successive chromatography on diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and chromatofocusing columns. Two degenerated oligonucleotide primers were synthesized according to the N-terminal peptide sequence to clone, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a short nucleotide sequence (62 bp) of the isomerase gene. The linoleic acid isomerase gene (lai) was subsequently cloned by inverse PCR. The amino acid sequence deduced from the lai coding sequence predicts a protein of 424 amino acid residues (48 kDa), excluding the N-terminal methionine, which was absent in the polypeptide purified from the native host. The isomerase shares no significant sequence homology to other enzymes except a flavin-binding domain in the N-terminal region. The recombinant isomerase purified from Escherichia coli showed a typical ultraviolet spectrum for FAD-bound proteins. The recombinant enzyme produced a single isomer of t10,c12-CLA from linoleic acid, as demonstrated by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrum analysis. The recombinant isomerase protein was expressed at high levels in E. coli, but it was almost totally sequestered in inclusion bodies. The level of active isomerase was increased 376-fold by medium and process optimization in bench-scale fermentors.
TI  - [Co-occurence of indol-producing bacterial strains in the vagina of women infected with Chlamydia trachomatis].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine if cervicitis, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis), has an influence on the frequency of occurrence of selected aerobic and anaerobic bacterial strains, connected with etiology of aerobic vaginitis (AV) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). Indole-producing bacteria have received particular attention due to their possibly inductive role in chronic cervicitis caused by C. trachomatis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The swabs from vagina and cervical canal have been obtained from 122 women (aged 18-40). The presence of C. trachomatis antigen had been detected and diagnosed with the help of direct immunofluorescence, BV with Amesl and Nugent criteria, whereas the AV with Donders criteria. The identification of the bacterial strains isolated from vagina has been performed according to classical microbiological diagnostics. RESULTS: Disruption of vaginal microflora (4-10 in Nugent score) was determined in 11,5% of observed women. AV was diagnosed in 4.5% women with chlamydial cervicitis, BV was diagnosed in 10.9% and 5.45% of these women, on the basis of Amsel and Nugent criteria respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Indole-producing bacterial strains connected with BV and AV (Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli) have been isolated significantly more often from vagina of women infected with C trachomatis (p = 0.0405, chi2 = 4.20) and these findings confirm co-importance of indole-producing bacterial strains in cervicitis caused by C trachomatis .
TI  - Microcalorimetry: a novel method for detection of microbial contamination in platelet products.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (PLTs). Microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated PLT products was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis PLTs to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL of PLTs. Contaminated PLTs in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees C for 5 days in a calorimeter. Positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microW above the lowest value of the power-time curve. RESULTS: With microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 CFUs per mL PLTs could be detected with the following detection times: S. epidermidis (31.65 hr), S. aureus (24.24 hr), S. sanguinis (7.82 hr), E. coli (7.53 hr), P. acnes (73.57 hr), and C. albicans (43.77 hr). The detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) CFUs per mL PLTs for S. aureus, S. sanguinis, and E. coli. Noncontaminated PLTs remained negative. The total heat ranged from 2.8 (S. sanguinis) to 8.3 J (E. coli). The shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. CONCLUSION: The detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 CFUs per mL PLTs. Microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated PLTs. Applying this method to all PLT products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of PLTs.
TI  - Heterologous expression of linoleic acid isomerase from Propionibacterium acnes and anti-proliferative activity of recombinant trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - The linoleic acid isomerase enzyme from Propionibacterium acnes responsible for bioconversion of linoleic acid to trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10, c12 CLA) was cloned and overexpressed in Lactococcus lactis and Escherichia coli, resulting in between 30 and 50 % conversion rates of the substrate linoleic acid to t10, c12 CLA. The anti-proliferative activities of the fatty acids produced following isomerization of linoleic acid by L. lactis and E. coli were assessed using the human SW480 colon cancer cell line. Fatty acids generated from both L. lactis and E. coli contained a mixture of linoleic acid and t10, c12 CLA at a ratio of approximately 1.35 : 1. Following 5 days of incubation of SW480 cells with 5-20 microg ml(-1) (17.8-71.3 microM) of the t10, c12 CLA, there was a significant (P<0.001) reduction in growth of the SW480 cancer cells compared with the linoleic acid control. Cell viability after treatment with the highest concentration (20 microg ml(-1)) of the t10, c12 CLA was reduced to 7.9 % (L. lactis CLA) and 19.6 % (E. coli CLA), compared with 95.4 % (control linoleic acid) and 31.7 % (pure t10, c12 CLA). In conclusion, this is believed to represent the first report in which recombinant strains are capable of producing CLA with an anti-proliferative potential.
TI  - Prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (PLT) components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one double-dose PLTs were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL). After split, each PLT unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 CFUs. One unit was photochemically treated (PCT; 150 micromol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A). The other unit was untreated. All units were stored and sampled on Days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux). PLTs were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. RESULTS: In all PCT PLTs, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. In untreated PLTs, Staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. Growth of 1 to 10 CFUs per unit Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 CFUs per unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 to 1000 CFUs per unit Propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. Low levels of Streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 CFUs/unit), Escherichia coli (1-100 CFUs/unit), and Clostridium perfringens (1-100 CFUs/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: For the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated PLTs may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. In contrast, bacterial inactivation by PCT could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of PLTs contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. Recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. The aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. METHODS: Universal eubacterial primers were used to amplify 16S rRNA bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. Subsequently, PCR amplicons were cloned into Escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in GenBank. RESULTS: Sequences of Stenotrophomonas spp., including S. maltophilia (formerly Pseudomonas homology group V) were detected in six aneurysm samples. Propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and Brevundimonas diminuta (formerly P. diminuta) in four samples. Other species previously assigned to the Pseudomonas genus such as Comamonas testosteroni, Delftia acidovorans, Burkholderia cepacia, Herbaspirillum sp., and Acidovorax sp. were also detected. Some clones fell into other environmental species, including Methylobacterium sp. and Bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria that have not yet been cultivated. DNA sequences from oral bacteria, including Streptococcus sanguinis, Tannerella forsythia, and Leptotrichia buccalis were detected. Sequences from Prevotella melaninogenica and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. Additional species included Dermacoccus spp. and Corynebacterium vitaeruminis. CONCLUSIONS: A wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development. Several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although Chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. Overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. In the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. The presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at C.pneumoniae.
TI  - Inhibition of pathogenic bacterial adhesion by acidic polysaccharide from green tea (Camellia sinensis).
AB  - An acidic polysaccharide CS-F2 from Camellia sinensis was examined to characterize its anti-adhesive effects against pathogenic bacteria, most notably Helicobacter pylori, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. CS-F2 showed marked inhibitory activity against the pathogen-mediated hemagglutination with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/mL, which is lower than the previously reported MIC values for Panax ginseng and Artemisia capillaris. The inhibitory effects of CS-F2 on the adhesion of H. pylori to AGS adenocarcinoma gastric epithelial cells, or P. acnes and S. aureus to NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells, were further assessed resulting in MIC values between 0.063 and 0.13 mg/mL. Importantly, CS-F2 showed no inhibitory effects against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that CS-F2, which is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a molecular weight of approximately 8.0 x 10(4) Da, may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria, while exerting no effects against beneficial and commensal bacteria.
TI  - Microbial contamination of "in use" bar soap in dental clinics.
AB  - Bar soap from 18 different dental clinics were investigated for microbial contamination, while it was "in-use". Of the 32 samples obtained from the bar soap, 100% yielded positive culture. A total of 8 different genera of organisms were isolated. Each bar soap was found to harbor 2-5 different genera of micro organisms. Heavily used soap had more micro organisms compared to less used soap. The microbial load of the "in-use" bar soap constituted a mixed flora of gram positive, gram negative, aerobes, anaerobes, and fungi. The results indicate that the bar soap under "in-use" condition is a reservoir of microorganisms and handwashing with such a soap may lead to spread of infection.
TI  - Association between the presence of bacterial 16S RNA in prostate specimens taken during transurethral resection of prostate and subsequent risk of prostate cancer (Sweden).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study bacterial 16S RNA in archival prostate samples from 352 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and evaluate whether the presence of bacterial DNA was different in those who later developed prostate cancer (n = 171) and in the matched controls that did not progress to cancer (n = 181). METHODS: 16S DNA PCR followed by cloning and sequencing the positive samples. RESULTS: In 96/352 (27%) of the prostate tissue specimens 16S RNA were detected. Sequence analysis revealed Propionibacterium acnes as the predominant microorganism (23% of 16S RNA positive patients). The second most frequent isolate-Escherichia coli was found in 12 (12%) patients. The other isolates included Pseudomonas sp. (3 patients), Actinomyces sp. (2), Streptococcus mutans (1), Corynebacterium sp. (2), Nocardioides sp. (1), Rhodococcus sp. (1) Veillonella sp. (2). In P. acnes positive samples 62% exhibited severe histological inflammation versus 50% in the bacteria-negative group (p = 0.602). The presence of P. acnes in the prostate was associated with prostate cancer development (OR 2.17, 95% CI 0.77-6.95). CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed P. acnes as the most common bacteria in the prostate in BPH. Further studies are needed to clarify its role in contributing to the development of prostatic inflammation and prostate cancer.
TI  - Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide induce the expression of antimicrobial peptides and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in human sebocytes.
AB  - Acne is a common skin disorder of the pilosebaceous unit. In addition to genetic, hormonal and environmental factors, abnormal colonization by Propionibacterium acnes has been implicated in the occurrence of acne via the induction of inflammatory mediators. To gain more insight into the role that sebocytes play in the innate immune response of the skin, particularly in acne, we compared the antimicrobial peptide and proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression at mRNA and protein levels, as well as the viability and differentiation of SZ95 sebocytes in response to co-culture with representative isolates of P. acnes type IA and type IB as well as Escherichia coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that, in vitro, P. acnes type IA and IB isolates and LPS induced human beta-defensin-2 and proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression, and influenced sebocyte viability and differentiation. Our results provide evidence that sebocytes are capable of producing proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and antimicrobial peptides, which may have a role in acne pathogenesis. Furthermore, since P. acnes types IA and IB differentially affect both the differentiation and viability of sebocytes, our data demonstrate that different strains of P. acnes vary in their capacity to stimulate an inflammatory response within the pilosebaceous follicle.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of Dead Sea black mineral mud.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The unique, black, hypersaline mud mined from the Dead Sea shores is  extensively used in mud packs, masks, and topical body and facial treatments in spas surrounding the lake, and in cosmetic preparations marketed worldwide, but little is known about its antimicrobiological properties. METHODS: We performed detailed microbial and chemical analysis of Dead Sea mineral mud compounded in dermatological and cosmetic preparations. RESULTS: Using conventional bacteriological media (with or without salt augmentation), we found surprisingly low numbers of colony-forming microorganisms in the mud. The highest counts (up to 20,000 colonies per gram, mostly consisting of endospore-forming bacteria) were obtained on sheep blood agar. Test microorganisms (i.e. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, Candida albicans) rapidly lost their viability when added to the mud. Zones of growth inhibition were observed around discs of Dead Sea mud placed on agar plates inoculated with Candida or with Propionibacterium, but not with Staphylococcus or Escherichia. The effect was also found when the mud was sterilized by gamma irradiation. Using (35)S-labeled sulfate as a tracer, bacterial dissimilatory sulfate reduction could be demonstrated at a low rate (0.13 +/- 0.03 nmol/cm(3).d). CONCLUSION: The antibacterial properties of Dead Sea mud are probably owing to chemical and/or physical phenomena. Possible modes of antimicrobial action of the mud in relation to its therapeutic properties are discussed.
TI  - Pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from Panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of Panax ginseng against the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of Porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. In this study, this acidic polysaccharide from P. ginseng, PG-F2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/mL. However, results showed no inhibitory effects of PG-F2 against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. PG-F2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean MW of 1.2 x 10(4) Da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. The complete hydrolysis of PG-F2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (EC. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor PG-F2 (the MIC of ca. 0.01 mg/mL against H. pylori and P. gingivalis). Our results suggest that PG-F2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.
TI  - In-house SIRAS phasing of the polyunsaturated fatty-acid isomerase from Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - The polyenoic fatty-acid isomerase from Propionibacterium acnes (PAI) catalyzes the double-bond isomerization of linoleic acid to conjugated linoleic acid, which is a dairy- or meat-derived fatty acid in the human diet. PAI was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as a yellow-coloured protein. The nature of the bound cofactor was analyzed by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Single crystals of PAI were obtained in two crystal forms. Cubic shaped crystals belong to space group I2(1)3, with a unit-cell parameter of 160.4 A, and plate-like crystals belong to the monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 133.7, b = 60.8, c = 72.2 A, beta = 115.8 degrees. Both crystal forms contain one molecule per asymmetric unit and diffract to a resolution of better than 2.0 A. Initial phases were obtained by SIRAS from in-house data from a cubic crystal that was soaked with an unusually low KI concentration of 0.25 M.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - Detection of potentially novel bacterial components of the human skin microbiota  using culture-independent molecular profiling.
AB  - Although the micro-organisms forming the cutaneous microbiota are considered to play important roles in the modification and prevention of skin diseases, a comprehensive analysis of their composition has not yet been carried out because of difficulties in determining yet-to-be-cultured micro-organisms in the samples. Swab-scrubbed forehead skin samples of five healthy volunteers were analysed by profiling 16S rRNA genes, as well as by conventional culture methods, to provide a profile of the cutaneous microbiota that included yet-to-be-cultured bacteria from normal human skin. Cluster analyses of the 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated a marked increase in diversity compared with that derived from the culture methods. Nineteen previously recognized species and 13 novel phylotypes were obtained from the analysis of 416 clones. In addition to well-known bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes, phylotype A, the 16S rRNA gene of which is 97 % similar to that of Methylophilus methylotrophus, was detected in three of the five samples, in one of which it was the predominant clone. Culture-independent genetic profiling of 16S rRNA genes for detecting human cutaneous microbiota has allowed us to detect potentially novel components of the cutaneous microbiota in humans.
TI  - Optimal sampling time after preparation of platelet concentrates for detection of bacterial contamination by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A universal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), based on bacterial 16S rDNA, to detect bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs), was developed previously and compared with automated culturing. In the present study, this real-time PCR method was evaluated to determine the optimal sampling time for screening of bacterial contamination in PCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Routinely prepared PCs were spiked with suspensions of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Propionibacterium acnes to 1, 10 and 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml and stored at room temperature for 7 days. The presence of bacteria in these PCs was monitored by quantitative real-time PCR. As a reference method (additional control), BacT/Alert automated culturing was used. For PCR, 1-ml aliquots were drawn from all (spiked) PCs on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of storage. As a control, triplicate samples (10 ml) were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic BacT/Alert culture bottles immediately after spiking (day 0) and after storage for 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7 days. RESULTS: With quantitative real-time PCR, all bacterial species tested were reproducibly detected on day 1 after spiking at original concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU/ml. Bacteria were also detected on day 1 from PCs spiked with an initial concentration of 1 CFU/ml, except for E. coli, which was detected in only one of the three samples and P. aeruginosa, for which analysis was not performed on day 1. With the reference method, bacteria were detected in culture bottles (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 20.1 h, with the exception of P. acnes which was detected at a mean time of 102.3 and 49.3 h (for original spiking concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU/ml respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PCR enables the rapid detection of low initial numbers of bacteria in PCs. For reliable detection, our results support that sampling of PCs for real-time PCR screening should not be carried out earlier than 1 day after preparation (48 h after blood collection). Importantly, the real-time PCR approach has the potential to be used before the release of PCs from the blood centre or shortly before they are transfused in the hospital.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - [Study on anti-bacterium activity of ginkgolic acids and their momomers].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ginkgolic acids and their three monomers were separated from ginkgo sarcotestas. The anti-bacterium activity of ginkgolic acids were tested. The relation between the anti-bacterium activity and side chain of ginkgolic acid were studied. METHOD: The MIC of ginkgolic acids and their three monomers and salicylic acid were tested. RESULTS: Ginkgolic acid has strong inhibitive effect on G+-bacterium. Salicylic acid has no side chain, so no anti-bacterial activity. When the length of gingkolic acid side chain is C13:0, it has the strongest anti-bacterial activity in three monomers. CONCLUSION: The side chain of ginkgolic acid is the key functional group that possessed anti-bacterial activity. The length of Ginkgolic acid was the main effective factor of anti-bacterial activity.
TI  - Enhanced resistance to Gram-positive bacterium and increased susceptibility to bacterial endotoxin in mice sensitized with Propionibacterium acnes: involvement of Toll-like receptor.
AB  - Mice sensitized with Propionibacterium acnes showed an enhanced resistance against infection with Listeria monocytogenes in contrast to the increased susceptibility to LPS-induced endotoxin shock. The enhanced protection to L. monocytogenes was mediated by activated innate immunity but not by generation of Listeria-specific acquired immunity. After infection with L. monocytogenes, the elimination of bacteria was observed earlier in accordance with a higher level of endogenous cytokine production in P. acnes-sensitized mice than in control mice. Peritoneal cells from P. acnes-sensitized mice produced a larger amount of IL-12p70 and nitric oxide after stimulation with heat-killed L. monocytogenes or peptidoglycan purified from Staphylococcus aureus. RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of TLR2 but not TLR1, TLR4 nor TLR6 was induced by injection of P. acnes in peritoneal cells. These results indicated that P. acnes-sensitization could induce the activation of innate immunity against L. monocytogenes through increased recognition of bacterial components by TLR2.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - [Microbiology of acute exacerbation chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  - The bacterial flora taken by sinus puncture from 115 patients with uni and bilateral acute exacerbation of chronic maxillary sinusitis was analyzed. Germ-free culture was obtained in 49 cases (40%) and in 69 cases (60%) bacteria were isolated from all sinus aspirates. Microbiological evaluation shows, that in majority of cases (90%) of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis there were pathogenic bacteria namely aerobic and anaerobic. The most frequent pathogens isolated from the aspirates were; Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus hominis, Propionibacterium acnes i Candida albicans. The culture analysis proves that one or more pathogens can be the etiological factor. In the majority of cases (64%) the sinusitis is caused by monoculture.
TI  - Validation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial detection of platelet (PLT)-rich-plasma (PRP)-derived PLTs  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. This study validated the BacT/ALERT for use in testing pooled PRP-derived PLTs with nine contaminating organisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two PRP-derived PLT pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 CFUs/mL). Four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 mL was plated onto blood agar. RESULTS: All organisms (excluding P. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respective). P. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively). With E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. This was most notable with S. viridans where the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for the detection of bacteria in PRP-derived PLTs in a pooled format. Overall, the use of the BacT/ALERT system allowed the detection of pooled PRP-derived PLTs inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 CFUs per mL in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding P. acnes).
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts and flavonoids from Eucalyptus maculata.
AB  - AIMS: We investigated the antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts to find effective antibacterial agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial activities of leaf extracts from 26 species of eucalyptus were measured. Extracts of Eucalyptus globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis significantly inhibited the growth of six Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Propionibacterium acnes), and of a fungus (Trichophyton mentagrophytes), but they did not show strong antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida). 2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxy-dihydrochalcone, eucalyptin and 8-desmethyl-eucalyptin, isolated from E. maculata extracts, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against seven micro-organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.0 to 31 mg l(-1). CONCLUSIONS: The eucalyptus extracts and three compounds from E. maculata were found to be effective against micro-organisms that cause food poisoning, acne and athlete's foot. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows potential uses of extracts from E. globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis, and antimicrobial compounds isolated from E. maculata.
TI  - Proinflammatory cytokine production by human keratinocytes stimulated with Propionibacterium acnes and P. acnes GroEL.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Keratinocytes form the first line of defence in the skin and alert the host to danger by the production of a number of cytokines and chemokines. However, the interaction of commensal microorganisms with keratinocytes has not been well studied. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of viable and nonviable cells of Propionibacterium acnes in both exponential and stationary growth phases, and of P. acnes GroEL on cytokine production by human primary keratinocytes. METHODS: Actively proliferating or contact-inhibited keratinocytes were cocultured with viable or formaldehyde-killed P. acnes cells in either the exponential or stationary phase of growth. Culture supernatants were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1alpha, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Keratinocytes were also stimulated with different concentrations of P. acnes GroEL and supernatants assayed for cytokines. RESULTS: Viable P. acnes in the stationary phase of growth stimulated keratinocyte monolayers to produce significantly higher amounts of IL-1alpha, TNF-alpha and GM-CSF than unstimulated keratinocytes. Viable exponential-phase bacteria stimulated production of significantly higher amounts of TNF-alpha and GM-CSF but these levels were significantly lower than those for stimulation with stationary-phase bacteria. Nonviable P. acnes from either growth phase was not able to stimulate cytokine production. P. acnes GroEL at concentrations in the range 0.05-1.0 micro g mL(-1) was able to induce increased production of cytokines by keratinocytes in a dose-dependent manner. This was analogous to stimulation with Escherichia coli GroEL. CONCLUSIONS: Stimulation of cytokine production by P. acnes and P. acnes GroEL may be important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory acne vulgaris and may have wider implications for the immunomodulation of the human immune system by commensal skin microorganisms.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in PLT components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux [formerly Organon Teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in PLTs. The recovery of nine organisms seeded into PLTs with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. The use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into Day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis PLT units to 10 and 100 CFUs per mL. Replicate samples (4 mL) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. RESULTS: All organisms (with the exception of P. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 CFUs/mL). In aggregate (with the exception of P. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). In all cases, the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. P. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 CFUs/mL), respectively. The narrower bottle neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.
TI  - Palmitoleic acid isomer (C16:1delta6) in human skin sebum is effective against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The percent lipid composition of pooled human sebum analyzed by thin-layer chromatography was: ceramides (13%), fatty acid (47%), cholesterol (7%), cholesterol esters (2%), squalene (11%), triglycerides (3%), and wax esters (17%). Total sebum lipids (2- 4 mg/ml), sonicated into bacterial culture medium, caused 4- to 5-fold log reduction in growth of gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius and the anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum, but was ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. Fractionation of the sebum lipids showed that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contained the bulk of the antimicrobial activity. Lauric acid (C12:0) was the most active saturated fatty acid. The unsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (C16:1delta6, cPA) was both the most predominant monoene and the most active antimicrobial fatty acid. Purified cPA (>99%) yielded typical minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 10-20 microg/ml against gram-positive bacteria. Organically synthesized cPA isomer gave MIC values comparable to the natural material. Both natural and synthetic cPA were found to be the most active sebum lipid fraction in blocking the adherence of a pathogenic strain of Candida albicans to porcine stratum corneum. Ethanol in combination with cPA exerts a synergistic bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, and several methacillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. Palmitoleic acid may be useful in topical formulations for treatment of secondary gram-positive bacterial infections, as a gram-positive bacteria antimicrobial in wound dressings, and as a natural gram-positive antimicrobial preservative in skin and hair care products.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - [Amyloidosis associated with chronic granulomatous disease in a patient with a renal transplant and recurrent urinary tract infections].
AB  - Chronic granulomatous disease is a group of syndromes which share a defect in a component of the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase complex. Without this enzyme activity, phagocytic cells cannot produce superoxide, peroxide, and other potent microbicidal radicals, and are less able to kill ingested pathogens. The clinical picture is characterised by recurrent life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and abnormal tissue granuloma formation. On the other hand, amyloidosis is a systemic disease with renal involvement occurring in the majority of cases. Recurrent amyloidosis is a rare but well documented event in renal transplant recipients. However, graft loss secondary to amyloidosis has been noted infrequently. In addition, de novo amyloidosis has not been previously associated with graft loss. We report here a renal transplant recipient with chronic granulomatous disease and history of recurrent urinary tract infections, who developed nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal insufficiency secondary to de novo AA amyloidosis leading to graft loss 66 months after transplantation.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An automated bacterial culture system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. The recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into Day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU per mL. Samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. RESULTS: All organisms, except P. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 CFU/mL) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 CFU/mL) hours. P. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 CFU/mL) or 66.0 (100 CFU/mL) hours. The 10-fold increase in inoculum was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. The aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours) between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: No difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. The new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.
TI  - Prevalent bacterial species and novel phylotypes in advanced noma lesions.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16S ribosomal DNA bacterial genes from DNA isolated from advanced noma lesions of four Nigerian children were PCR amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into Escherichia coli. Partial 16S rRNA sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. Nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. A total of 67 bacterial species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. Nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. Other known species that were detected included Achromobacter spp., Afipia spp., Brevundimonas diminuta, Capnocytophaga spp., Cardiobacterium sp., Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium spp., Gemella haemoylsans, and Neisseria spp. Phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera Eubacterium, Flavobacterium, Kocuria, Microbacterium, and Porphyromonas and the related Streptococcus salivarius and genera Sphingomonas and TREPONEMA: Since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. Several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and Fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. However, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.
TI  - Toxicity of Australian essential oil Backhousia citriodora (Lemon myrtle). Part 1. Antimicrobial activity and in vitro cytotoxicity.
AB  - The antimicrobial and toxicological properties of the Australian essential oil, lemon myrtle, (Backhousia citriodora) were investigated. Lemon myrtle oil was shown to possess significant antimicrobial activity against the organisms Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Aspergillus niger, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Propionibacterium acnes comparable to its major component-citral. An in vitro toxicological study based on the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium) cytotoxicity assay was performed. In vitro cytotoxicity testing indicated that both lemon myrtle oil and citral had a very toxic effect against human cell lines: HepG2 (a hepatocarcinoma-derived cell line); F1-73 (a fibroblast cell line derived from normal skin) and primary cell cultures of human skin fibroblasts. Cytotoxicity IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) values ranged from 0.008 to 0.014% (w/v) at 4 h to 0.003-0.012% (w/v) at 24 h of exposure. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for lemon myrtle oil was calculated as 0.5 mg/l at 24 h exposure and the RfD (reference dose) was determined as 0.01 mg/l. A product containing 1% lemon myrtle oil was found to be low in toxicity and could potentially be used in the formulation of topical antimicrobial products.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of mycobacterial and propionibacterial DNA in lymph nodes of Japanese and European patients with sarcoidosis.
AB  - The cause(s) of sarcoidosis is unknown. Mycobacterium spp. are suspected in Europe and Propionibacterium spp. are suspected in Japan. The present international collaboration evaluated the possible etiological links between sarcoidosis and the suspected bacterial species. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections of biopsy samples of lymph nodes, one from each of 108 patients with sarcoidosis and 65 patients with tuberculosis, together with 86 control samples, were collected from two institutes in Japan and three institutes in Italy, Germany, and England. Genomes of Propionibacterium acnes, Propionibacterium granulosum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, and Escherichia coli (as the control) were counted by quantitative real-time PCR. Either P. acnes or P. granulosum was found in all but two of the sarcoid samples. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was found in no sarcoid sample. M. tuberculosis was found in 0 to 9% of the sarcoid samples but in 65 to 100% of the tuberculosis samples. In sarcoid lymph nodes, the total numbers of genomes of P. acnes or P. granulosum were far more than those of M. tuberculosis. P. acnes or P. granulosum was found in 0 to 60% of the tuberculosis and control samples, but the total numbers of genomes of P. acnes or P. granulosum in such samples were less than those in sarcoid samples. Propionibacterium spp. are more likely than Mycobacteria spp. to be involved in the etiology of sarcoidosis, not only in Japanese but also in European patients with sarcoidosis.
TI  - Microwave-assisted preparation of cyclic ketals from a cineole ketone as potential cosmetic ingredients: solvent-free synthesis, odour evaluation, in vitro cytotoxicity and antimicrobial assays.
AB  - Some cyclic ketals derived from (+)1,3,3-trimethyl-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-6-one were obtained in excellent yields by microwave activation under solvent-free conditions, as a 'green chemistry' procedure. The results obtained using acidic alumina containing 7% p-toluenesulfonic acid, as mineral support, are reported and compared with those obtained by classical methods. The new compounds were tested for their olfactive character and for a potential cosmetic use. In vitro skin cytotoxicity tests were carried out on the most promising compounds, by using NCTC 2544 human keratinocytes as target cells. They all displayed slight cytotoxic effects which were one order of magnitude lower than those found with sodium dodecylsulphate positive control. Two compounds that resulted interesting as toothpaste aromas, were submitted to antimicrobial assays and showed their activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus hominis, Propionibacterium acnes and Candida albicans.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of antibiotic-resistant Propionibacterium acnes isolated from acne patients attending dermatology clinics in Europe, the U.S.A., Japan and Australia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Propionibacterium acnes is the target of antimicrobial treatments for acne vulgaris. Acquired resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracyclines has been reported in strains from diverse geographical loci, but the molecular basis of resistance, via mutations in genes encoding 23S and 16S rRNA, respectively, has so far only been elucidated for isolates from the U.K. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether similar or different resistance mechanisms occur in resistant P. acnes isolates from outside the U.K. METHODS: The phenotypes and genotypes of 73 antibiotic-resistant strains of P. acnes obtained from the skin of acne patients in the U.K., U.S.A., France, Germany, Australia and Japan were compared. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements, and polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing were used to identify mutations in genes encoding rRNA. RESULTS: Most erythromycin-resistant isolates (MIC(90) > or = 512 microg mL(-1)) were cross-resistant to clindamycin but at a much lower level (MIC(90) > or = 64 microg mL(-1)). As in the U.K., resistance to erythromycin was associated with point mutations in 23S rRNA in 49 of 58 strains. An A-->G transition at Escherichia coli equivalent base 2058 was present in 24 strains. This gave a unique cross-resistance phenotype against a panel of macrolide, lincosamide and type B streptogramin antibiotics. Two further point mutations (at E. coli equivalent bases 2057 and 2059) were identified (in three and 22 isolates, respectively) and these were also associated with specific cross-resistance patterns originally identified in isolates from the U.K. However, nine of 10 erythromycin resistant-strains from Germany did not exhibit any of the three base mutations identified and, in six cases, cross-resistance patterns were atypical. Consistent with previous U.K. data, 34 of 38 tetracycline-resistant strains carried a base mutation at E. coli 16S rRNA equivalent base 1058. Tetracycline-resistant isolates displayed varying degrees of cross-resistance to doxycycline and minocycline, but isolates from the U.S.A. had higher MICs for minocycline (4--16 microg mL(-1)) than isolates from other countries and, in particular, Australia. All the P. acnes isolates resistant to one or more of the commonly used antiacne antibiotics were sensitive to penicillin, fusidic acid, chloramphenicol and the fluoroquinolone, nadifloxacin. All but one isolate (from the U.K.) were sensitive to trimethoprim. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that 23S and 16S mutations identified in the U.K. conferring antibiotic resistance in P. acnes are distributed widely. However, resistant strains were isolated in which mutations could not be identified, suggesting that as yet uncharacterized resistance mechanisms have evolved. This is the first report of high-level resistance to minocycline and is of concern as these strains are predicted to be clinically resistant and are unlikely to remain confined to the U.S.A. Epidemiological studies are urgently required to monitor how resistant strains are selected, how they spread and to ascertain whether the prevalence of resistance correlates with antibiotic usage patterns in the different countries.
TI  - Heat shock proteins and inflammatory acne vulgaris: molecular cloning, overexpression and purification of a propionibacterium acnes GroEL and DnaK homologue.
AB  - Propionibacterium acnes is associated with inflammatory acne. The genes encoding  two putative mediators of inflammation, the heat shock proteins GroEL and DnaK, were cloned from this organism and sequenced. groEL and dnaK encode proteins of 56.8 and 66.4 kDa, respectively, which show a high degree of homology (>75% similarity) to the GroEL and DnaK proteins of mycobacteria and streptomycetes. The promoter regions of both genes contain inverted repeat sequences believed to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of heat shock genes. Recombinant P. acnes GroEL and DnaK were overexpressed in Escherichia coli with C-terminal histidine tags. The recombinant proteins were purified from E. coli by metal affinity chromatography. These proteins will now be used in immunological investigations to determine their role in inflammatory acne.
TI  - Optimizing breast pocket irrigation: an in vitro study and clinical implications.
AB  - Subclinical infections have been implicated in the etiology of capsular contracture. Intraoperatively, breast pocket irrigation with povidone-iodine or other antibiotic solutions has been popularized; however, detrimental effects on wound healing for these agents have been reported and their efficacy against common organisms found around breast implants has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro efficacy of serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and two double antibiotic solutions DAB-1 (gentamicin/polymyxin B) and DAB-2 (gentamicin/cefazolin), against organisms most commonly found around breast implants. In phase I trials, serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and DAB were combined 1:1 with cultures of five common organisms found around implants. In phase II, povidone-iodine was serially diluted in DAB-1 rather than saline. In phase III, povidone-iodine was serially diluted with DAB-2. Efficacy for all phases was determined by plating the mixture onto agar plates and incubating at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. Povidone-iodine was 100 percent effective at a dilution of 12.5% against Staphylococcus epidermidis and 25% against Staphylococcus aureus but relatively ineffective against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas, DAB-1 was found to be ineffective against S. epidermidis but effective against S. aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, E. coli, and Pseudomonas. In phase II trials, a concentration of 12.5% povidone-iodine in DAB was effective at killing all experimental bacteria. In phase III trials, 10% povidone-iodine in DAB-2 was effective at killing all bacteria tested. In conclusion, to maximize bacterial control of common breast implant organisms and to minimize the detrimental effects on wound healing, 10% povidone-iodine in gentamycin/cefazolin may be used with excellent results and its use clinically may reduce the incidence of capsular contracture.
TI  - [Development of a vaccine for treatment of urinary tract infections].
AB  - Receiving uroinfections are predominantly treated with antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. An effective alternative treatment can be immunotherapy with inactivated bacteria. The authors have focused on the development of polybacterial vaccine with both specific and nonspecific immunostimulatory activity. The vaccine contains killed bacteria which most frequently occur as an etiological agent in urinary tract infections. Determining for the selection of particular strains for the vaccine preparation were their immunostimulatory properties evaluated after intraperitoneal application of killed cells to mice. The results were evaluated according to weight gain of liver and spleen and verified by histological examination of these organs. The final form of the vaccine URVAKOL contains immunogenically most active strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, representing specific effective part of the preparation, adjuvant activity is provided by Propionibacterium acnes. (Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Ref. 27.)
TI  - Microbiology of infected pustular psoriasis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections can occur in lesions of pustular psoriasis (PP). The objective of this study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected PP. METHODS: A retrospective 10-year review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records from patients with secondarily infected PP lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 23 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 patients (52%), anaerobic bacteria only in four (17%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in seven (30%). Thirty-six isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 23 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 13 strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (15 isolates), Group D Enterococcus (two isolates), and Escherichia coli (two isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (six isolates) and Bacteroides fragilis group, Propionibacterium acnes, and pigmented Prevotella spp. in two each. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (61%), 11 of which were S. aureus. Nineteen of the organisms isolated from 18 patients (78%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. S. aureus was isolated from all body sites. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. Enteric Gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on the legs and buttocks. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella, and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the hand. CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected PP lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions were demonstrated.
TI  - Suppression of murine endotoxin response by E5531, a novel synthetic lipid A antagonist.
AB  - As a consequence of blood-borne bacterial sepsis, endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria can trigger an acute inflammatory response, leading to a series of pathological events and often resulting in death. To block this inflammatory response to endotoxin, a novel lipid A analogue, E5531, was designed and synthesized as an LPS antagonist, and its biological properties were examined in vitro and in vivo. In murine peritoneal macrophages, E5531 inhibited the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by Escherichia coli LPS with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2.2 nM, while E5531 elicited no significant increases in TNF-alpha on its own. In support of a mechanism consistent with antagonism of binding to a cell surface receptor for LPS, E5531 inhibited equilibrium binding of radioiodinated LPS ([125I]2-(r-azidosalicylamido)-1, 3'-dithiopropionate-LPS) to mouse macrophages with an IC50 of 0.50 microM. E5531 inhibited LPS-induced increases in TNF-alpha in vivo when it was coinjected with LPS into C57BL/6 mice primed with Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). In this model, the efficacy of E5531 was inversely correlated to the LPS challenge dose, consistent with a competitive antagonist-like mechanism of action. Blockade of the inflammatory response by E5531 could further be demonstrated in other in vivo models: E5531 protected BCG-primed mice from LPS-induced lethality in a dose-dependent manner and suppressed LPS-induced hepatic injury in Propionibacterium acnes-primed or galactosamine-sensitized mice. These results argue that the novel synthetic lipid A analogue E5531 can antagonize the action of LPS in in vitro and suppress the pathological effects of LPS in vivo in mice.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of chronic venous ulcers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of chronic venous leg ulcers (CVLU) is unclear. The objective of the study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of CVLU. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of the clinical and microbiological laboratory records obtained from patients with CVLU. Microorganisms were grown from 43 specimens obtained from 41 patients. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria alone were present in 18 (42%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only in three (7%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 22 (51%). In total, there were 97 isolates, 64 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, an average of 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.5 aerobes and 0.8 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (26 isolates), group D streptococci (5), and Escherichia coli(5). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (15), Bacteroides fragilis group (6), Propionibacterium acnes (4), and Prevotella spp. (3). CONCLUSIONS: CVLU have a polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora.
TI  - Prevalence and identity of translocating bacteria in healthy dogs.
AB  - Bacterial translocation is characterized by the passage of intestinally derived bacteria across the intestinal mucosa to local or regional tissues. This phenomenon is believed to be important in the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacteremia and septicemia; however, the pathway or route of translocation remains unclear. To define the route of translocation better, mesenteric lymph nodes from 50 apparently healthy dogs undergoing elective ovariohysterectomies were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of bacterial translocation and to quantify and identify types of organisms found in mesenteric lymph nodes. Peripheral blood and portal blood samples were similarly cultured to rule out hematogenous organisms as a source of lymph node contamination. Bacteria were isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes of 26 dogs (52%). The number of bacteria varied from 50 to > 10(5) organisms/g of tissue. Bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus intermedius (n = 3), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (n = 2), nonhemolytic Streptococcus (n = 4), Bacillus species (n = 5), Escherichia coli (n = 6), Salmonella species (n = 3), Pseudomonas species (n = 2), Enterococcus species (n = 2), Clostridium sordelli (n = 1), Micrococcus species (n = 1), Lactobacillus species (n = 1), and Propionibacterium acnes (n = 1). One of 50 peripheral blood samples yielded an unidentified gram-positive coccus and a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. No bacteria were isolated from portal blood samples of any dog. Further studies of this type on sick dogs are warranted before clinical recommendations can be made to culture mesenteric lymph nodes routinely.
TI  - pH-dependent changes of nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and reactive oxygen species  in hepatocellular damage.
AB  - Low arterial blood pH and sustained nitric oxide (NO) production are critical parameters in inflammatory events such as sepsis, and appropriate treatment is still under debate. Because the stability of nitrogen and oxygen intermediates is dependent on the surrounding pH, we investigated whether the relationship among NO, peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and reactive oxygen species production also depends on the pH value, particularly with respect to their effects on hepatocellular damage. Our studies demonstrate that the extracellular pH influences NO and hydroxyl radical (OH) production in hepatocytes. Acidification (pH 7.0) of the medium revealed a significant increase (P < 0.05) of OH-like radicals, enhanced hepatocellular damage, and a sharp drop in cellular glutathione (GSH) content compared with levels measured at physiological or alkaline pH conditions. Furthermore, inhibition of NO synthesis at all pH conditions resulted in decreased NO production and cellular GSH levels but a simultaneous increase of OH-like radicals and hepatocellular damage with a maximum seen at pH 7.0. Our results suggest that hepatocellular damage is in part regulated by the surrounding pH and that inhibition of NO synthesis at acidic conditions (e.g., in sepsis) leads to increased reactive oxygen-mediated cell injury.
TI  - Ribotyping of bacteria from root canal and blood of patients receiving endodontic therapy.
AB  - DNA restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of 26 bacterial isolates (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Actinomyces israelii, Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus sanguis) recovered from patients with infected root canals and their peripheral blood, collected during and after endodontic therapy, were examined. Eleven additional reference strains including type strains were also examined. Purified DNA was digested with BglI,EcoRI, and HindIII. Hybridization was carried out with a digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probe obtained by reverse transcription of Escherichia coli 16S + 23S rRNA. Ribotypes of the bacteria recovered from root canal and blood showed identical characteristics within the patients, and differed between the patients. The results were confirmed when the similarity coefficient (S(AB)) of the ribotypes from the isolates were assessed by the Dendron computer-assisted system. These results suggested that the bacteria isolated from the blood originated from the root canal.
TI  - Propionibacterium acnes, a resident of lipid-rich human skin, produces a 33 kDa extracellular lipase encoded by gehA.
AB  - Five independent clones of the Propionibacterium acnes P-37 lipase gene (gehA) were obtained in Escherichia coli, and the gene was localized to a 2.75 kb Xhol fragment by subcloning. The five clones were shown to contain the same gene by Southern blotting with a DIG-labelled probe to gehA. The nucleotide sequence of gehA was determined, and shown to contain a single ORF of 1017 kb, encoding a protein of 339 amino acids. The predicted molecular mass was 36 kDa. A 33 kDa (PAGE) radiolabelled polypeptide was detected from E. coli minicell preparations harbouring gehA, which could correspond to GehA after cleavage of the putative 26 amino acid residue signal peptide. gehA was overexpressed in E. coli under the control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter, and the corresponding polypeptide was found to be present in insoluble aggregates. Active lipase was produced when the overexpressing strain was incubated at a reduced temperature in the presence of sucrose. Purification of lipase from P. acnes culture supernatant fluids confirmed the production of a 33 kDa (PAGE) lipase.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the hyaluronate lyase gene from Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - The hyaluronate lyase (hyaluronidase) gene from Propionibacterium acnes was cloned and sequenced. The gene was isolated on an EcoRI-generated 3-kb piece of DNA. Expression was less in Escherichia coli than in P. acnes; in E. coli, active enzyme was only cell associated and not secreted. The gene is 2256-pb long and codes for a protein of 82 kDa. Amino terminal sequencing of the protein of the partially purified gene indicated the presence of a 32-amino-acid leader sequence. The leader sequence showed a membrane-spanning domain and all of the features usually associated with the leader for a secreted protein. The amino acid sequence is predicted to share homology with the hyaluronidase enzymes from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A potential hyaluronate-binding domain was identified and antibody against this domain was inhibitory to the enzyme.
TI  - Microbial evaluation: 139 implants removed from symptomatic patients.
AB  - Possible adverse effects of microbial organisms have been implicated in symptomatic silicone implant patients. In the literature, numerous authors have investigated the possible role of infection with respect to implant problems. To date, various bacterial species have been reported, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococci, and Clostridium perfringens. Infections in polyurethane-coated prostheses also have been shown to prolong morbidity. Antibiotic use has been relatively empirical in this regard. The purpose of this study was, first, to determine the frequency, type, and clinical relevance of microbial colonization on implant surfaces removed from symptomatic patients and, second, to determine possible effects of microbial colonization on implant integrity (gel bleed, rupture). A total of 139 implants from 72 symptomatic patients were entered into the prospective clinical study between February of 1993 and July of 1994 at the UCLA Medical Center. The implant shell types included smooth (79 percent), polyurethane (8 percent), textured (7 percent), and smooth and Dacron (6 percent). The implant locations were subglandular (71 percent), submuscular (28 percent), and subcutaneous (1 percent). Of the 139 implants removed, 69 percent were intact and 31 percent were ruptured. Forty-seven percent of 139 implants were culture-positive. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated most frequently (57.5 percent), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (41 percent), and then Escherichia coli (1.5 percent). No fungal infections were identified. Culture positivity was not significantly associated with systemic symptoms. Sixty-seven percent of the positive culture implants were intact; 33 percent were ruptured. The frequency (47 percent) and types (P. acnes and S. epidermidis) of microbial colonization are determined in symptomatic silicone implant patients.
TI  - Use of fura-2/AM to measure intracellular free calcium in Selenomonas ruminantium.
AB  - This paper describes a procedure for loading the acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (fura-2/AM), and the subsequent measurement of the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in Selenomonas ruminantium (S. ruminantium) using this technique. To ascertain the optimal loading conditions, the effect was examined on the loading of fura-2/AM of ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), lysozyme, pluronic F127 alone, or the simultaneous application of EDTA and pluronic F127. Individual administration of either EDTA, lysozyme or pluronic F127 did not produce an optimal loading of fura-2/ AM. The co-application of pluronic F127 and bovine serum albumin after treatment with EDTA increased the ratio of the fluorescence due to excitation at 340 nm to that at 380 nm (R340/380) markedly, with a high signal intensity for intracellular fura-2, indicating that adequate loading had been obtained. Using the present loading method, it was found that the resting free [Ca2+]i of S. ruminantium was 48.1 +/- 2.2 nM (n = 6). This is approximately one half that found in Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcus bovis and eucaryote cells. This is the first measurement of free [Ca2+]i using fura-2/AM in the Gram-negative strict anaerobe S. ruminantium.
TI  - Heat-killed Corynebacterium parvum enhances endotoxin lung injury with increased  TNF production in guinea pigs.
AB  - Corynebacterium parvum (CP) is known to increase susceptibility to endotoxin, which is associated with increased production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF). We investigated the effect of CP-priming on the pathogenesis of acute lung injury caused by intratracheal Escherichia coli endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]). Guinea pigs were divided into four groups: (1) control (n=6), (2) CP-alone (n=6), (3) LPS-alone (n=6) and (4) CP + LPS (n=6). A CP dose of 4 mg/kg was injected intraperitoneally 7 d before the study. Animals were observed for 4 h after intratracheal administration of 0.02 mg/kg of LPS. The lung wet-to-dry weight ratio (W/D), [125I] albumin concentration ratio of lung tissue to plasma (T/P) and of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid to plasma (B/P) and differential cell count in BAL fluid were examined. In the LPS-alone group, neither excess lung water nor increased albumin leakage was observed. The CP + LPS group showed increased lung water and albumin leakage as compared with the other three groups (p<0.05). We also observed increased cell counts in BAL fluid (p<0.05), in the CP + LPS group. The spleen weight was increased in guinea pigs pretreated with CP, indicating reticuloendothelial system (RES) activation. In the CP + LPS group, the TNF level was increased in both plasma and BAL fluid. We conclude that pretreatment with CP enhances LPS-induced acute lung injury in parallel with increasing TNF production, which suggests that the activation of mononuclear phagocytes contributes to increased susceptibility to intratracheal endotoxin in guinea pigs.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. SETTING: Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. Aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Escherichia coli (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella sp (n = 3). The most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), Prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; B fragilis and Enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and S aureus and P aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp, with burns. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - [Bone and joint infections due to unusual pathogens].
AB  - Between 1989 and 1993, 7 patients--2 men and 5 women from 19 to 70 years of age--with osteomyelitis due to an unusual organism were observed. 3 cases with Salmonella typhimurium and one at a time with Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus, Propionibacterium acnes and Pasteurella multocida. 5 patients were treated operative accompanied with antibiotics and 1 without operation. 1 patient declined the indicated surgical therapy. The outcome were total healing in 3 cases, healing with ankylosis of the concerning joints in 2 cases and healing with defect in 1 case.
TI  - [Antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in Salmonella typhimurium].
AB  - It is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of Propionibacterium shermanii, P. pentosaceum, P. thoenii, P. coccoides, P. acnes, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus thermophilus, Str. faecalis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Escherichia coli AB 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) in Salmonella typhimurium TA 100 decreases significantly. The highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. The cells passaged in the medium containing 4-NQO demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. Young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of Str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. Thiol accumulation in culture liquid from P. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. Over 24 h thiol content decreased. The maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. It is suggested that desmutagenesis of the bacteria studied towards 4-NQO is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of gentamicin and streptomycin in Optisol-GS, a preservation  medium for donor corneas.
AB  - Increasing reports of gentamicin-resistant bacteria contaminating donor corneas and causing endophthalmitis have indicated that preservation of corneal storage media with 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin alone needs reevaluation. We investigated the stability and possible cytotoxicity of streptomycin as a supplement to gentamicin in Optisol corneal storage medium. The combination of gentamicin and streptomycin in Optisol solution was stable at room temperature for at least 4 weeks and inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, alpha hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus Group D, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, and diphtheroids, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The addition of vancomycin did not significantly improve the antibacterial effectiveness of the gentamicin and streptomycin combination when stored at 4 degrees C. The growth of 15 of 20 clinical ocular isolates of Ps. aeruginosa was suppressed by the gentamicin-streptomycin combination. Streptomycin in concentrations of up to 1,000 micrograms/ml did not decrease the mitotic activity of corneal endothelial cells as evaluated by the in vitro incorporation of tritiated thymidine or cause cytotoxicity. The addition of 200 micrograms/ml of streptomycin to Optisol corneal storage medium containing 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin may significantly improve activity against gentamicin-sensitive and gentamicin-resistant contaminants.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Induced hyporesponsiveness in rat Kupffer cells is not specific for lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The phenomenon of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hyporesponsiveness has been reported to occur in macrophage cell lines and primary cells. Hyporesponsiveness was evidenced by a diminution or lack of production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) after sequential doses of LPS. In order to characterize the hyporesponsive state in Kupffer cells, the production of TNF-alpha was quantified after varying the concentration of a primary low dose of LPS prior to a challenge with a high, normally stimulatory dose of LPS. The kinetics of establishment of the hyporesponsive state and the effect of varying the bacterial serotype and genus of the challenge dose were determined. The specificity of the hyporesponsive state for LPS was examined. Our results demonstrate that complete hyporesponsiveness with no detectable production of TNF-alpha (< 30 pg/ml) was achieved after a primary dose > or = 10 ng/ml. Establishment of the hyporesponsive state took place within 6 hr. Induction of hyporesponsiveness was not dependent upon the serotype or genus of the challenge dose of LPS and was not specific for LPS. Complete hyporesponsiveness was induced after a primary dose (10 micrograms/ml) of the Gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium parvum (Cp) and was evident upon challenge with 100 micrograms/ml Cp. The data indicate that the mechanisms by which LPS and Cp induce hyporesponsiveness are not identical in that a primary dose of LPS (10 ng/ml) induced only partial hyporesponsiveness upon challenge with Cp (100 micrograms/ml). These studies improve our understanding of Kupffer cell function.
TI  - Therapy of experimentally induced coliform mastitis with a Propionibacterium acnes product.
AB  - The efficacy of a Propionibacterium acnes product for treatment of coliform mastitis was evaluated following intramammary infusion of Escherichia coli. Ten cows were injected intravenously with a product containing heat-killed P. acnes at 3 h, 3 d, and 7 d after bacterial challenge. Five cows served as untreated negative controls. Bacterial counts in milk, rectal temperatures, and milk SCC did not differ between treated cows and control cows. Intravenous infusion of P. acnes had no effect on milk production or DMI of treated cows compared with untreated controls. Therapy of experimentally induced coliform mastitis with a P. acnes product had no effect on severity or duration of clinical signs.
TI  - Molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding an inducible calmodulin-dependent nitric-oxide synthase from rat liver and its expression in COS 1 cells.
AB  - Calmodulin-dependent nitric-oxide synthase, with an apparent molecular mass of 125 kDa, was induced in the liver of rats treated with Propionibacterium acnes and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. Clones were isolated from a cDNA library obtained from induced rat liver using oligonucleotide probes which were synthesized based on the amino acid sequences of peptides of the purified enzyme. Four overlapping cDNA clones for a 3.8-kbp region were isolated and the nucleotide sequences were determined. These clones encompassed an open-reading frame of 3441 bases encoding 1147 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA suggested that the protein contains binding sites for NADPH, FAD and FMN. The structure of the possible calmodulin-binding site, consisting of a strongly hydrophobic region surrounded by basic amino acids, is present. The full-length cDNA was expressed in COS 1 cells under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter and the expressed enzyme was found to be a calmodulin-dependent nitric-oxide synthase. A structural comparison suggested that the liver nitric-oxide synthase is the same as the macrophage enzyme. Northern-blot analysis showed that the mRNA in the liver is approximately 4.2 kb long and is induced transcriptionally by treatment with P. acnes and lipopolysaccharide.
TI  - Increased endogenous N-nitrosamine and nitrate formation by induction of nitric oxide synthase in rats with acute hepatic injury caused by Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide administration.
AB  - In rats treated i.v. with heat-killed Propionibacterium acnes (100 mg/kg body wt), followed 5 days later by an i.v. dose of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg/kg body wt), acute hepatic cell necrosis was accompanied by significant induction of nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity in the liver. Endogenous nitrosation of thiazolidine 4-carboxylic acid (TCA, 50 mumol/rat) administered by three different routes (i.v., i.p. and p.o.) 5 h after LPS injection to the P. acnes-treated rats was assessed by analysing its nitrosated product (NTCA) excreted in 24 h urine. The amounts of NTCA formed in vivo after i.v., i.p. and p.o. administration of TCA were 4.07 +/- 1.00, 5.79 +/- 2.15 and 58.3 +/- 20.7 nmol/rat (n = 5-10) respectively, which were about 5-, 10- and 8-fold greater than those excreted by rats which had not been treated with P.acnes and LPS but received TCA by the same route. Nitrate concentration in plasma and NO synthase activity in the liver started to increase within 2.5 h after LPS injection, reached a maximum at 7.5 h and remained at high levels for several further hours. Levels of nitrite and nitrate in gastric contents were also increased significantly after LPS administration. The co-administration of N omega-nitro-L-arginine (an inhibitor of NO synthase) and LPS resulted in a marked reduction of urinary levels of nitrate and NTCA, indicating that nitrosation is mediated by NO synthase. These results together suggest that induction of NO synthase by infection with bacteria, parasite and viruses could result in increased endogenous nitrosation not only in the infected tissues but also in the stomach, where nitrosamines would be formed more rapidly under acidic conditions.
TI  - Identification of inducible calmodulin-dependent nitric oxide synthase in the liver of rats.
AB  - A calmodulin-dependent nitric oxide synthase was significantly induced in the liver of rats treated intravenously with heat-killed Propionibacterium acnes and 5 days later with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. The apparent calmodulin-dependent and -independent isozymes were separated by Mono Q column chromatography after their partial purification by 2',5'-ADP-agarose affinity chromatography. Both enzymes had a molecular weight of 125,000 as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and required NADPH, tetrahydrobiopterin, and dithiothreitol as cofactors. Their activities were completely inhibited by the specific nitric oxide synthase inhibitors NG-monomethyl-L-arginine and N omega-nitro-L-arginine at 80 and 800 microM, respectively. The peptide maps of these two isozymes with lysylendopeptidase and their reverse-phase column chromatographic profiles were indistinguishable. In the presence of bovine calmodulin, the purified calmodulin-dependent isozyme behaved as a calmodulin-independent isozyme on Mono Q column chromatography. The purified calmodulin-independent isozyme was converted to a calmodulin-dependent isozyme by EDTA and EGTA. Calmodulin blot analysis using 125I-calmodulin showed that the two isozymes bound calmodulin equally efficiently.
TI  - Prevention of 5-fluorouracil-induced infection with indigenous Escherichia coli in tumor-bearing mice by nonspecific immunostimulation.
AB  - We have previously reported that the lethal toxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in  specific-pathogen-free mice is due to an indigenous infection with Escherichia coli (K. Nomoto, T. Yokokura, Y. Yoshikai, et al. Can. J. Microbiol. 37:244-247, 1991). In the present study, we demonstrate that nonspecific immunostimulation augments host resistance against the lethal toxicity of 5-FU in tumor-bearing mice. Intravenous administration of a preparation of heat-killed Lactobacillus casei (LC 9018), a nonspecific immunostimulant, at a dose of 20 mg/kg to BALB/c mice augmented their resistance against the lethal toxicity of 5-FU if the preparation was injected into the mice 10-40 days before administration of 5-FU. Injection of LC 9018 into BALB/c mice bearing Meth A fibrosarcoma also enhanced their resistance against the lethality of 5-FU. Systemic infection with E. coli was induced in all of the 5-FU-treated tumor-bearing mice 10 days or more after administration of the drug at a lethal dose of 500 mg/kg, and it was accompanied by an overgrowth of the bacteria in the intestine. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with LC 9018 resulted in decreased rates of occurrence of systemic infection with E. coli and inhibition of overgrowth of the bacteria in the intestine after administration of 5-FU. A single administration of either LC 9018 or 5-FU significantly inhibited the growth of Meth A cells in vivo, and a combined antitumor effect was shown in the mice treated with both 5-FU and LC 9018.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. Of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; D-sphingosine; D,L-sphinganine; 4-D-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; N,N-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against Staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microM]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microM]). The sphingosines were similarly active against Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Propionibacterium acnes, Brevibacterium epidermidis, and Candida albicans, moderately active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. Both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. Optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees C and at pH 6.5. Antimicrobial activity, which was Ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. Because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - To better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. Sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). We cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, Streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group D streptococcus in five patients, Corynebacterium in five patients, Haemophilus influenzae in three patients, Neisseria in three patients, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. Cultures yielded no growth in nine patients. A strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. A poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). All seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. Only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. Cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. The presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.
TI  - The importance of positive bacterial cultures of specimens obtained during clean  orthopaedic operations.
AB  - Microbiological cultures of specimens of tissue and of fluids from the wound in forty patients who had had consecutive clean, elective orthopaedic operations (excluding total joint replacements) and had not received antibiotics preoperatively were analyzed. Of the forty patients, twenty-three (58 per cent) had a positive culture on at least one of the media that were used and seventeen (43 per cent) had negative cultures. Of the forty specimens that were obtained from swabbing of the wound, eight (20 per cent) were positive on culture, compared with twenty (50 per cent) that were obtained from biopsy of tissue. Of these twenty-eight positive cultures, thirteen (46 per cent) were on routine blood-agar plates and fifteen (54 per cent), in broth only. Of the thirty-three bacterial organisms that were identified in the twenty-eight positive cultures of the wound, nineteen (58 per cent) were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; eight (24 per cent), Propionibacterium acnes; two (6 per cent), Peptostreptococcus; and four (12 per cent), miscellaneous organisms. In all of the positive cultures on the blood-agar plates, except in those showing Propionibacterium acnes, there were five colonies or fewer. One patient had a clinical infection with Staphylococcus aureus that developed later, but the initial cultures of the wound had been positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis only. None of the bacteria that grew on culture were Staphylococcus aureus or the less common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, or Klebsiella.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The appearance of T cells bearing self-reactive T cell receptor in the livers of  mice injected with bacteria.
AB  - We demonstrated in the present study that with bacterial stimulation, an increased number of alpha/beta T cells proliferated in the liver of mice and that even T cells bearing self-reactive T cell receptor (TCR) (or forbidden T cell clones), as estimated by anti-V beta monoclonal antibodies in conjunction with immunofluorescence tests, appeared in the liver and, to some extent, in the periphery. The majority (greater than 80%) of forbidden clones induced had double-negative CD4-8-phenotype. In a syngeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction, these T cells appear to be self-reactive. Such forbidden clones and normal T cells in the liver showed a two-peak pattern of TCR expression, which consisted of alpha/beta TCR dull and bright positive cells, as seen in the thymus. A systematic analysis of TCR staining patterns in the various organs was then carried out. T cells from not only the thymus but also the liver had the two-peak pattern of alpha/beta TCR, whereas all of the other peripheral lymphoid organs had a single-peak pattern of TCR. However, T cells in the liver were not comprised of double-positive CD4+8+ cells, which predominantly reside in the thymus. The present results therefore suggest that T cell proliferation in the liver might reflect a major extrathymic pathway for T cell differentiation and that this hepatic pathway has the ability to produce T cells bearing self-reactive TCR under bacterial stimulation, probably due to the lack of a double-positive stage for negative selection.
TI  - [Counts of selected strict and facultatively anaerobic microorganisms in the crop and appendix of chickens and their adhesion characteristics].
AB  - The counts of strictly anaerobic amylolytic and lactate-utilizing bacteria, streptococci, lactobacilli, Escherichia coli and lactoso-negative bacteria were followed in chicks at the age of three to seven weeks. Age dependences of the counts in the given groups were investigated. An increase in the counts of amylolytic bacteria was observed in the caecum contents in the seventh week (4.63 +/- 0.322), and on the other hand a decrease in their counts in the caecum wall in the seventh week (3.30 +/- 0.833). The counts of E. coli adherent to the caecum wall also showed a decreasing tendency. Lactobacilli and streptococci were a stable component of the microflora of craw wall, in contrast with the decreasing counts of anaerobic amylolytic and lactate-utilizing bacteria. The average adherence index of lactobacillum isolates for adherence to the epithelial cells of craw or caecum wall ranged from 7.433 +/- 1.521-11.866 +/- 2.661, and/or 4.366 +/- 1.373-9.70 +/- 0.935. The average adherence index of the Propionibacterium acnes ranged from 7.766 +/- 0.408 to 17.40 +/- 4.721, and/or 5.10 +/- 0.738 to 7.60 +/- 1.784.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Propionibacterium acnes in mixed infections with facultative bacteria.
AB  - Single and mixed infections with 11 clinical isolates of Propionibacterium acnes  and three facultative bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Abscesses were induced by pure cultures of six of 11 strains of P. acnes and by the three facultative bacteria. The abscesses produced by each of the six "virulent" P. acnes isolates mixed with S. aureus, E. coli or K. pneumoniae were larger than those induced by the single organisms in 16 of the 18 combinations. There was a significant increase in the numbers of the six P. acnes strains in 13 of the 18 bacterial mixtures and in the numbers of the facultative bacteria in 17 of the 18 combinations. These data illustrate the potential virulence of some P. acnes strains and their synergic capacity with facultative bacteria.
TI  - Effect of cytochrome P-450 inhibition and stimulation on intensity of polyethylene degradation in microsomal fraction of mouse and rat livers.
AB  - Polyethylene (PE) is degraded in microsomal fractions of mouse and rat livers with the formation of carbonyl groups. Infrared spectroscopy demonstrated formation of predominantly ketone groups and to a lesser degree ester and aldehyde groups. The inhibition and stimulation of cytochrome P-450 in mouse livers affected the formation of oxidative groups on PE. Phenobarbital doses of 3 x 0.05 mg per mouse increased the concentration of cytochrome P-450 and ketone groups on PE, whereas the vaccine Propionibacterium acnes (0.5 mg) and its pyridine fraction (0.5 and 1 mg) had the opposite effect. The coherence of cytochrome P-450 with oxidative changes on PE is compared and discussed with findings on implants in man.
TI  - Bacteria from solid tumours.
AB  - Bacteria were grown from 63 (69%) of 91 specimens from necrotic tumours in 63 patients. Of the tumours, 14 were abdominal, 5 pelvic, 23 of the head and neck, 4 of the lungs, 4 mediastinal, 2 lymphatic, 3 of the breast, and 8 were miscellaneous. Aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 (19%) specimens, anaerobes only in 10 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 41 (65%). A total of 83 anaerobic and 47 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were isolated. The predominant anaerobic bacteria were Bacteroides spp. (36 isolates), and anaerobic cocci (21) and Propionibacterium acnes (22). The aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria most frequently isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli (seven isolates each), S. epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five isolates each). These data demonstrate that infection of tumours is usually polymicrobial.
TI  - Contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet laser acts as a sterilizing scalpel.
AB  - As a cold knife cuts through contaminated or infected wounds, bacteria are dragged along with the blade of the knife through the entire wound. Herein, the effect of incisions made with a cold knife is compared with that of incisions made by a contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. Agar plates were inoculated with multiple strains of exogenous, endogenous, hospital-acquired and multiple antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. While the cold knife dragged bacteria to sterile areas, incisions made with the contact laser were always sterile. In addition to not dragging bacteria, the tip of the contact laser sterilized itself and provided a bacteria-free zone on either side of the cut, depending on the power density applied. It appears that the contact Nd:YAG laser acts as a sterilizing wand while providing much needed tactile feedback, precision and hemostasis during surgical treatment with the laser.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. III. Microbiological aspects].
AB  - A retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy). A total of 4386 vials from 619 patients were examined. There were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). Ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. There were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). A total of 165 microorganism were isolated: Gram-positive (52.7%) and Gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). The predominant families were: Enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), Micrococcaceae (27.3%), Pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), Bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and Streptococcus "Genus" (18.8%). The species frequencies were: Escherichia coli (20%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Enterococcus (8.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), Proteus mirabilis (4.2%), Brucella spp. (2.4%), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus bovis e Propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). These findings are compared with those published in the Italian and international literature. Stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - Effects of tetracyclines on the production of extracellular proteins by members of the propionibacteriaceae.
AB  - The effect of tetracyclines on the synthesis of proteins in Propionibacterium avidum and P. acnes was examined. Synthesis of an extracellular lipase by P. avidum was slightly more sensitive to inhibition by tetracycline than total (cellular and extracellular) protein synthesis. The effect of tetracycline and other analogues on the synthesis of secreted proteins was also examined in P. avidum and P. acnes by protein radiolabelling experiments. In all cases the synthesis of secreted proteins was only about 2-fold more sensitive to inhibition by tetracyclines than total protein synthesis. These results contrast with previously published findings in Escherichia coli which show that synthesis of secreted proteins is highly susceptible to inhibition by tetracycline. The implications of these findings in relation to inhibition of membrane bound ribosomes by tetracyclines are discussed.
TI  - Intravascular coagulation in the development of massive hepatic necrosis induced  by Corynebacterium parvum and endotoxin in rats.
AB  - When Escherichia coli endotoxin was intravenously injected into rats given killed Corynebacterium parvum 6 days previously, fibrin deposition and endothelial cell injury occurred in hepatic sinusoids at 1.5 h and were intensified thereafter. Serum alanine aminotransferase values were increased along with prothrombin time and decreased plasma levels of antithrombin III and coagulation factor VIII:C at 5 h. Antithrombin III concentrate (plus heparin) or superoxide dismutase infused concurrently with injection of endotoxin significantly attenuated the derangements of these variables and the histologic extent of liver injury at 5 h. Intravascular coagulation, probably developing through the action of superoxide anion, may contribute to the development of massive hepatic necrosis induced by C. parvum and endotoxin in rats.
TI  - Regulation of insulin and interleukin-1 release after Propionibacterium acnes-induced macrophage activation in mice.
AB  - The administration of a potent activator of macrophages (M phi), Propionibacterium acnes, in nondiabetic mice was associated with the release of significant amounts of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the peritoneal cavity and plasma within 4 hours after treatment. Shortly before IL-1 peaks were observed, the levels of pancreatic insulin, [3H]leucine-proinsulin, and insulin/total protein ratio were elevated, and followed by a transient but marked hyperinsulinemia at 4 hours after treatment. A single dose of recombinant murine IL-1 in mice was also associated with a 2- to 9-fold increase in the levels of insulin in the pancreas and plasma at 4 hours after treatment. During the period of observation after the administration of P. acnes, plasma glucose levels in treated mice were significantly less than in parallel controls. Mild hypoglycemia was observed at 7 to 10 days posttreatment. Although circulating IL-1-like activity could not be detected in plasma 1 to 10 days after P. acnes treatment, this activity was measured in activated peritoneal and liver M phi. IL-1-like activity (specific activity: 276 units/mg protein) was detected in plasma, after it was chromatographed on a Sephadex G-150 column to remove proteins with higher molecular weight. Peritoneal and liver M phi from P. acnes mice were also able to elaborate significant amounts of IL-1-like activity in their supernatants with or without Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. At the same time, total protein synthesis and insulin content in the pancreas in P. acnes mice were significantly lower than the parallel control (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that P. acnes-induced M phi activation in mice was associated with the modulation of insulin release and glucose homeostasis which may be attributed to the accumulation and release of IL-1 by activated M phi.
TI  - Characteristics of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1-induced lectin-like activity and  inhibitor(s) in rabbit serum.
AB  - In adult rabbits intravenously injected with toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) or staphylococcal enterotoxin B, serum lectin-like activity (detectable by cation-dependent agglutination of bacteria) developed. This activity was sensitive to heat, trypsin, and formaldehyde but resistant to neuraminidase or galactose oxidase. Formaldehyde-fixed Propionibacterium acnes or Escherichia coli cells reactive with plant lectins provided sensitive targets for titration of serum agglutination activity that was competitively blocked with D-galactose, D-glucose, D-mannose, and alpha-L-fucose. The lectin-like activity, partially purified by affinity chromatography, was a protein of approximately 76,000 Da with an isoelectric point of 5.4. Both lectin-positive and normal serum contained agglutination inhibitors that were absorbed by protein A-producing staphylococci. S protein may be the origin of this lectin-like activity. In vitro exposure of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells to TSST-1 (1.0 micrograms/mL) and to lectin-positive serum induced rapid cell clumping and subsequent "activation" to a larger blast form expressing receptors for buccal epithelial cells. The interaction of toxin/lymphokine-activated mononuclear cells with glycoproteins and/or other antigens selectively expressed by tissues in various organ systems may play a role in target cell pathology in rabbits dying with toxic shock syndrome.
TI  - Changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  - Concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. In particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. Likewise structural components such as fimbriae in Escherichia coli, M protein in Streptococcus pyogenes, protein A in Staphylococcus aureus and capsule in Bacteroides fragilis and Haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. These products, through their importance as impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. By their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid killing of the pathogen. The immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.
TI  - Requirement of a properly acylated beta(1-6)-D-glucosamine disaccharide bisphosphate structure for efficient manifestation of full endotoxic and associated bioactivities of lipid A.
AB  - Several synthetic acylated glucosamine monophosphates, with structures corresponding to the nonreducing or reducing moiety of the lipid A of the Escherichia coli or Salmonella minnesota type, and a synthetic compound corresponding to a biosynthetic disaccharide lipid A precursor (designated Ia or IVA) were examined for their endotoxic and related bioactivities in comparison with those of the synthetic and bacterial parent molecules, i.e., acylated beta(1-6)-D-glucosamine disaccharide bisphosphates. Some of the test monosaccharide compounds were definitely active in most of the in vitro assays. Their activities, except for complement activation, however, were weaker than those of the reference compounds, synthetic and bacterial acylated disaccharide bisphosphates. The differences between the test monosaccharide and disaccharide compounds were much more apparent in in vivo assays, in which the test acylated glucosamine monophosphates were scarcely active, though some test compounds exhibited weak lethal toxicity in galactosamine-loaded mice and were weakly active in pyrogenicity, immunoadjuvant activity, and possible tumor necrosis factor and alpha and beta interferon-inducing ability in Mycobacterium bovis BCG- and Propionibacterium acnes-primed mice, respectively. Mixture at an equimolar ratio of acyl glucosamine monophosphates, each of which has the structure of the reducing or nonreducing moiety of the reference disaccharide compound, did not restore the endotoxic or associated bioactivities of the corresponding parent molecules. No essential differences in bioactivity were noted between synthetic and bacterial monosaccharide compounds, i.e., lipid X, whose structure corresponds to the reducing moiety of E. coli-type lipid A.
TI  - The immunological activities of components isolated from Corynebacterium parvum in mice injected with polyoma tumor cells.
AB  - The inhibition of polyoma tumor in CBA mice after immunization with different fractions of Corynebacterium parvum was investigated. Treatment with 200 micrograms of polysaccharide from culture filtrate before s.c. inoculation 2 X 10(6) of tumor cells induced antitumor effect in mice. Treatment with lower doses (1 microgram or 20 micrograms) after transplantation of tumor cells was not effective. Injection of lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli abolished a positive response on inhibition of polyoma tumor growth after immunization with Corynebacterium parvum fractions. Additionally, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to protein fractions contain tumor antigenic components of membrane vesicles from polyoma tumor cells in the mice immunized with different compounds of Corynebacterium parvum was very strong. These findings suggest that the Corynebacterium parvum preparations are capable to inhibit tumor growth and could be used in special circumstances in immunoprophylaxis.
TI  - Immunobiological activities of synthetic lipid A analogs with low endotoxicity.
AB  - Synthetic lipid A analogs, beta(1-6)glucosamine disaccharide 1,4'-bisphosphates,  which possesses four tetradecanoyl groups at the 2- and 2'-amino, and 3- and 3'-hydroxyl groups (LA-17-PP), and each two of the (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl and tetradecanoyl groups at the 2- and 2'-amino and 3- and 3'-hydroxyl groups, respectively (LA-18-PP), were far less endotoxic than synthetic (506, LA-15-PP) and bacterial Escherichia coli type lipid A's; neither compound showed any detectable lethal toxicity in chicken embryos or preparatory activity for the local Shwartzman reaction in rabbits. Also both compounds were only weakly pyrogenic and comparably less lethally toxic in galactosamine-loaded mice than the reference synthetic and bacterial lipid A's and a synthetic counterpart to biosynthetic lipid A precursor Ia (406, LA-14-PP). Nevertheless, LA-17-PP and LA-18-PP exhibited definite in vivo immunoadjuvant activity in mice, and the ability to induce a possible tumor necrosis factor and alpha/beta interferon in Mycobacterium bovis BCG and Propionibacterium acnes-primed mice, respectively, although these activities were weaker than those of the reference lipid A's. 4'-Monophosphate analogs of the above two test compounds exhibited neither endotoxic nor beneficial activities, but they showed remarkable in vitro bioactivities comparable to those of the corresponding bisphosphate compounds; the ability to activate the human complement system and the clotting enzyme cascade of horseshoe crab amoebocyte lysate, stimulatory effects on guinea pig and murine peritoneal macrophages, and murine splenocytes.
TI  - Role of reactive oxygen intermediates in the hepatotoxicity of endotoxin.
AB  - Administration of endotoxin (2.5 micrograms/mouse, iv) to Corynebacterium parvum-pretreated (14 days earlier, 1 mg/mouse, i.v.) mice caused a rapid (90 min) decrease in liver cytochrome P450-dependent drug metabolism and an elevation of serum transaminase. The time course of the priming effect of C. parvum suggested that macrophages might be responsible for this sensitization to endotoxin. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (500 mg/kg) effectively protected against this depression of liver drug metabolism, thus supporting the hypothesis that liver macrophage-generated free radicals might mediate this hepatotoxic effect of endotoxin.
TI  - Adjuvant and antitumour activities of synthetic lipid A analogues.
AB  - The biological activities of synthetic glycolipids, which were chemically synthesized and based on the structure of lipid A of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli, were examined with special reference to their adjuvant activity on the induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity, activity on the induction of tumour necrotic factor (TNF) and tumour regressive activity on line 10 hepatoma in strain 2 guinea pigs. Among them, a compound structurally corresponding to free E. coli lipid A (compound 506) as well as LPS exhibited potent adjuvant activity in the induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity in guinea pigs and TNF inducing activity in the sera of mice which were presensitized with Propionibacterium acnes. Compound 506 showed potent lethal toxicity in the intravenous administration of BALB/c mice presensitized with P. acnes. The regressive activity on line 10 hepatoma was observed by the multiple intralesional injection of squalane-treated compounds 504 and 505 in strain 2 guinea pigs.
TI  - Head-space gas-liquid chromatographic analysis for presumptive identification of  bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - A total of 445 strains of common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for their volatile microbial metabolites by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. The bacteria were incubated for 24 or 48 h in blood-containing Trypticase soy or Lombard-Dowell glucose broth before being analyzed by automatic head-space injection. From the chromatographic pattern obtained, the majority of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes could be characterized. The head-space technique developed provides a rapid, direct and easily-performed means for presumptive identification of bacteria found in blood culture.
TI  - Increased sensitivity of Corynebacterium parvum-treated mice to toxic effects of  indomethacin and lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Female BALB/c and C3H/HeJ mice develop increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of indomethacin after injection of nonviable Corynebacterium parvum. The increased sensitivity developed within 4 days of intraperitoneal injection of the organisms and started to resolve 14 days after injection. The development of increased sensitivity was dependent on the quantity of organisms injected and the concentration of indomethacin utilized. The effect was not observed when C. parvum-treated animals were injected with aspirin. C. parvum-treated BALB/c mice also developed increased sensitivity to E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Although increased sensitivity to LPS and indomethacin paralleled each other in BALB/c mice, the experiments with the LPS-resistant C3H/HeJ mice indicated that the two phenomena could be separated. The pyridine extract residue of C. parvum was as effective as C. parvum whole cells in inducing indomethacin and LPS sensitivity. Therefore, activation of the reticuloendothelial system is probably a critical element in the induction of sensitivity to these agents.
TI  - Production of tumor necrosis factor in germfree mice.
AB  
TI  - In vitro generation of procoagulant activity by Corynebacterium parvum-stimulated mononuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Thromboembolic complications are known in cancer patients after i.v. administration of Corynebacterium parvum. We examined the ability of this organism to induce production of procoagulant activity by human blood mononuclear leukocytes in vitro. After 4 hours incubation Corynebacterium parvum was an effective stimulant for mononuclear leukocytes, behaving in the same way as the typical gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, whereas mononuclear cells incubated with Staphylococcus aureus were not affected. Corynebacterium parvum used was found devoid of endotoxin by the Limulus assay and was not affected by Polymyxin B, which, on the contrary, inhibited Escherichia coli-induced production of procoagulant activity. Intact Corynebacterium parvum may be required for the production of procoagulant activity and, although this specific aspect of the research will require further study, from the exposed data it is concluded that such a production could be a factor contributing to the pathogenesis of the coagulopathy following Corynebacterium parvum therapy.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract by nonspecific immunostimulation.
AB  
TI  - Reverse effect of gram-positive bacteria vs. gram-negative bacteria on adjuvant-induced arthritis in germfree rats.
AB  - Germfree (GF) F344 rats developed severe adjuvant-induced arthritis with a 100% incidence after a single intradermal injection of heat-killed Mycobacterium bovis (BCG). Specific pathogene-free (SPF) rats developed less severe arthritis with a lower incidence. The rats colonized with Escherichia coli or Bacteroides developed mild disease comparable to that in SPF rats. The rats colonized with Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus casei, L. fermentum, L. murini, and L. acidophilus developed more severe disease than that in GF rats. Furthermore, the rats colonized with a mixture of E. coli and the above lactobacilli developed very mild disease similar to that in SPF rats. These results suggest that gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli and Bacteroides, may suppress the disease, possibly through their lipopolysaccharides, and may be responsible for the lower susceptibility of SPF rats; gram-positive bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium, P. acnes, and lactobacilli, may enhance the disease, possibly through their peptidoglycans; and E. coli may play a dominant role in modulating the development of adjuvant-induced arthritis.
TI  - An electrophoretic analysis of superoxide dismutase in Campylobacter spp.
AB  - Superoxide dismutase (SOD, superoxide:superoxide reductase, EC 1.15.1.1) activity was studied in 23 strains of Campylobacter spp. using disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Different enzyme patterns were observed with extracts of different species of Campylobacter; three migration bands were found in all strains of C. sputorum subsp. sputorum and C. sputorum subsp. bubulus (relative mobilities, Rm, 0.57, 0.76 and 0.85), and C. fetus subsp. fetus (Rm 0.60, 0.72 and 0.81), while four migration bands (Rm 0.52, 0.57, 0.73 and 0.82) were found in C. fetus subsp. venerealis. One band (Rm 0.73) was found in C. coli CIP 7080 and two bands (Rm 0.59, 0.73) in C. jejuni CIP 702. Superoxide dismutase activities were very high in the Campylobacter strains, especially in C. fetus subsp. fetus [specific activity 7.8-55.7 U (mg protein)-1] compared with those in Escherichia coli (1.5 U mg-1), Propionibacterium acnes (1.6 U mg-1) and Veillonella alcalescens (0.2 U mg-1).
TI  - Intradermal injection of Propionibacterium acnes: a model of inflammation relevant to acne.
AB  - The intradermal injection of 140 micrograms of Propionibacterium acnes (CN 6134)  into the ears of female Sprague-Dawley rats produced a chronic inflammation with formation of acneiform lesions. Inflammation was characterized by more than a doubling of ear thickness at 24 h and a peak of 3-4 times control levels at day 21. At 42 days post injection ears were still 3 times normal thickness. Histologically there was early polymorph accumulation giving way to macrophages and lymphocytes by day 7. Pilosebaceous follicles overlying the inflamed area lost their sebaceous glands and became hyperplastic cords of cells that grew down and encapsulated inflammatory loci. By day 9 many of these follicles had become secondary comedones. Three isolates of P. acnes from inflammatory acne lesions and 4 of 5 isolates from non-acne patients produced results similar to that of the strain CN 6134. In these cases the number of histologically evident secondary comedones was correlated with ear thickness. In contrast, samples of Streptococcus lactis, Escherichia coli B, and Staphylococcus epidermidis failed to produce this combination of chronic inflammation and high lesion count. Benzoyl peroxide, tetracycline, erythromycin, phenidone, naproxen, and cis and trans retinoic acid were inactive as inhibitors of P. acnes CN 6134-induced ear thickening. The corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide produced dramatic suppression of inflammation, but upon cessation of treatment the ears returned to inflamed levels. The specificity for P. acnes, the formation of acneiform lesions, and the recalcitrance of the inflammation suggest our model is indeed relevant to acne.
TI  - Differences in tumour necrosis factor productive ability among rodents.
AB  - Large differences in tumour necrosis factor (TNF) productive ability 05337257erved among various strains of mice. DDY, CD-1, ICR and DBA/2 mice could produce a high titre of TNF activity, whereas Balb/c, C3H/HeJms and A/J mice produced a low titre of TNF activity. Administration of 200 micrograms/mouse of LPS to some strains of mice, i.e. DDD and C57B1/6J resulted in good production of TNF. ICR nu/nu mice produced the highest TNF activity among the nude mice. Balb/c nu/nu and DDD nu/nu mice exhibited very low titres of TNF activity. Nude mice required a rather higher dose of the priming agent, Propionibacterium acnes, than heterozygote littermates. Although it is commonly accepted that dual stimulation is necessary for TNF production, TNF activity was detected without the priming agent in SD rats and Golden hamsters by single injection of LPS. In these animals, much higher TNF production was observed after Propionibacterium acnes treatment than after a single injection of LPS. Large differences in TNF productive ability also existed among strains of rats. Although all animals receiving priming agents revealed hyperplasia of reticuloendothelial system, the sensitivity of the animals to LPS is considered to be the most important factor in their TNF productive ability.
TI  - Immunomodulators in the treatment of peritonitis in burned and malnourished animals.
AB  - Deficiencies in the immune system that lead to increased morbidity and mortality  from infectious complications have been well documented in patients suffering from trauma, malnutrition, sepsis, and thermal injuries. We investigated the potential benefit of immune stimulation for preventing infection in such conditions in an animal model by evaluating three drugs: Corynebacterium parvum, thymopentin (TP-5), and CP-46,665. One-hundred eighty female guinea pigs were rendered immunodeficient by first inflicting a 30% total body surface burn and then placing the animals on diets with calories inadequate to maintain body weight. One half of the animals were then given one of the three immunomodulators on the first, third, and fifth days after burn injury, to try to reverse immunodeficiency. The remaining animals received saline solution injections. Animal responses were evaluated by inserting a clot containing Escherichia coli and Bacillus fragilis into their peritoneal cavity 6 days after burn injury. The animals were followed for 21 days after burn injury. Autopsies on those that died revealed peritonitis and/or pneumonia; autopsies on these that survived showed no pneumonia and there was consistent resolution of peritonitis. TP-5 and CP-46,665, but not C. parvum, significantly improved survival rates and mean survival time in those animals receiving 100 kcal/kg/day. TP-5 and CP-46,665 may be of benefit to the severely stressed, malnourished surgical patient who is at risk of bacterial infection.
TI  - [Mechanisms of production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)--reconstitution experiment white nude mice].
AB  - In order to investigate the role of T cells in the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a reconstitution experiment was performed with nude mice (Balb/c, nu/nu). The results obtained were as follows: The cytotoxic activity of tumor necrosis serum (TNS) from Balb/c, nu/nu mice treated with P. acnes-LPS was 1/22 against that from Balb/c, nu/+ mice. TNF activity increased 14 times in reconstituted nude mice against Balb/c, nu/nu mice. Investigation of the production of the cytotoxic activity per cell was carried out using T cell and macrophage fractions separated from the spleens of both Balb/c, nu/nu and Balb/c, nu/+ mice treated with P. acnes as a priming agent. Elicitation employing LPS was done in vitro. Cytotoxic activity released into culture medium was observed in the macrophage fraction, but not in the T cell fraction. However, no significant difference was shown in species. With P. acnes treatment, the population of macrophages in the spleens from Balb/c, nu/+ mice increased 25.5 times, whereas that from Balb/c, nu/nu mice only increased 6.8 times. The above results suggest that the mechanism of the incremental effect of T cells on TNF production was due to the promotion of macrophage proliferation during the priming period after injection of P. acnes.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of wet cerumen.
AB  - The viable populations of seven species of bacteria were reduced 17% to 99% by treatment with a 3% suspension of human cerumen of the soft or "wet" type. Species tested for susceptibility to cerumen were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphlylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. The reduction depended upon the species of bacterium and the age of the culture. Pathogenic species appeared to be more susceptible than others, while cultures in logarithmic growth were more susceptible than stationary phase cultures to the bactericidal activity of wet cerumen. There appeared to be little difference in the bactericidal activity between the two lots of cerumen used. The bactericidal activity of wet cerumen was found to be quite similar to that of dry cerumen as reported earlier in the literature.
TI  - A longitudinal study of Actinomyces israelii in the female genital tract.
AB  - A prospective longitudinal investigation was performed to study variations in the occurrence of Actinomyces israelii with reference to four microorganisms, staphylococci, E. coli, P. acnes and C. albicans, in the female genital tract. Fifteen healthy women were studied during all phases of the menstrual cycle. Sampling was made from the cervix, vagina and perineal area three times a week during two consecutive menstrual periods and during menstruation from napkins and tampons. Altogether 1108 samples were taken on 349 sampling occasions for different cultural procedures. A. israelii was identified in all women, in varying frequencies (range 4 to 74% of sampling occasions). As a mean, A. israelii was recovered in 24% of the perineal samples, 13% of the vaginal and 6% of the cervical samples. The occurrence of A. israelii was related neither to the recovery of reference microorganisms nor to the phase of the menstrual cycle, the amount of bleeding or discharge, the pH of the vaginal specimens, the contraceptive method used, or to the use of different sanitary products. It is our conclusion that A. israelii appears to be a part of the indigenous genital flora of healthy women.

TI  - Production of lymphocyte activating factor in vivo.
AB  - Mice injected with Propionibacterium acnes, when challenged with lipopolysaccharide release a range of soluble mediators into their serum. Included among these is lymphocyte activating factor (LAF, interleukin-1). The release of LAF in vivo was detected only when serum samples were assayed at high dilution because inhibitors of its activity in vitro were also present. The kinetics of release of LAF in vivo after injection of P. acnes was dependent on the mouse strain used. LAF was also detected in serum collected from nude mice, implying that the LAF activity measured in vitro was not due to contamination with T cell products, such as interleukin 2.
TI  - Membrane changes in murine macrophages after in-vivo stimulation and activation.
AB  - The expression of various receptors and other surface determinants on resident, glycogen-and Corynebacterium parvum- elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages has been described. Macrophage Fc (IgG2b) receptors and I-A antigens were slightly increased after stimulation and a more marked increase was shown after activation with C. parvum. Complement receptor expression was enhanced after stimulation but was markedly reduced after activation. C. parvum-elicited macrophages, and to a lesser extent glycogen-elicited macrophages, showed a reduction in lectin-like receptors which recognize bacterial cell-wall sugars. Surface mannosyl determinants of the macrophage membrane were apparently increased after activation. The environment thus can be seen to influence the expression of macrophage surface receptors and antigens. These alterations are likely to influence the role of the macrophage in the immune response.
TI  - Increased susceptibility to Escherichia coli infection in mice pretreated with Corynebacterium parvum.
AB  - The contribution of activated macrophages to protection against Escherichia coli  was studied in mice treated intravenously with Corynebacterium parvum 7 days before infection. C. parvum-treated mice showed increased phagocytic activity and enhanced resistance to Listeria infection. In contrast, these mice showed increased susceptibility to a subsequent challenge with E. coli that correlated closely with a reduction in the LD50 of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in these mice. The peritoneal macrophages obtained from C. parvum-treated mice had a strong ability to phagocytize and kill E. coli in in vitro experiments. A rapid decline in the number of bacteria in the liver of C. parvum-treated mice was observed in the early period of infection. However, the number of bacteria in liver and spleen increased progressively to a lethal dose from 6 hr after infection. At this time, a significant increase in beta-glucuronidase, a lysosomal acid hydrolase, was found in the serum of these mice. In vitro experiments revealed that the peritoneal macrophages from C. parvum-treated mice were highly susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of LPS after 6 hr of incubation with LPS. It is suggested that the hypersensitivity of activated macrophages to the cytotoxic effect of endotoxin derived from E. coli may be partly responsible for the increased susceptibility of C. parvum-treated mice to E. coli infection.
TI  - Effects of Corynebacterium parvum on Escherichia coli infection in mice.
AB  - The contribution of activated macrophages to protection against Escherichia coli  was studied in mice. Mice treated intraperitoneally with killed Corynebacterium parvum organisms 1 d prior to challenge showed an increased resistance to intraperitoneal infection with E. coli; the predominant leucocytes in the peritoneal cavity of these animals were polymorphonuclear cells. However, treatment with C. parvum 4 d prior to challenge induced mainly activated macrophages in the peritoneal cavity and host resistance to the infection was not increased. Activated macrophages from such mice showed both enhanced phagocytic activity in vivo and a high degree of intracellular killing of E. coli in vitro. At the same time these cells became more susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of endotoxin. After challenge with E. coli there was a marked decrease in the number of peritoneal macrophages in mice that were treated with C. parvum 4 d prior to challenge. Increased susceptibility of activated macrophages to the cytotoxic effect of endotoxin could explain the absence of enhanced resistance to E. coli infection in such animals.

TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Tuberculin hypersensitivity hepatitis in mice infected with Mycobacterium bovis (BCG).
AB  - A systemic BCG infection in mice induced multiple small granulomas located mainly in the periportal areas of the liver. Following systemic challenge of such mice with purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD), a rapidly developing hepatitis with diffuse intralobular mononuclear cell infiltration was precipitated, accompanied by high levels of aspartate transaminase in peripheral blood, hypoglycemia, focal hepatocyte necrosis, and accumulation of fibrinogen in liver. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also provoked acute hepatic damage both in BCG-infected mice and in mice pretreated with Corynebacterium parvum. PPD was not active in the latter. There were also lymphoid cell destruction and fibrinogen accumulation in the spleen of BCG-PPD-treated mice. Possible involvement of inflammatory and hepatotoxic mediators is suggested, and a T-lymphocyte-macrophage regulatory role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis is discussed.
TI  - Phagocytic and chemiluminescent responses of mouse peritoneal macrophages to living and killed Salmonella typhimurium and other bacteria.
AB  - In the presence of luminol, resident as well as thioglycolate-induced and immunized macrophages emitted chemiluminescence more efficiently when the cells were exposed to living Salmonella typhimurium than when they were exposed to the same bacterium killed by ultraviolet light or heat. This phenomenon was observed whether or not the bacterium was opsonized. The different response to living and killed bacteria was also found with Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus morganii, and Enterobacter aerogenes, but not with Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Propionibacterium acnes. The results suggest that macrophages respond better to living, motile bacteria than to nonmotile or killed bacteria. The experimental results obtained with motility mutants of S. typhimurium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa confirm that macrophages exposed to the motile bacteria emit chemiluminescence more efficiently and ingest the motile bacteria at a much faster rate than the nonmotile bacteria.
TI  - Immunotherapy of the guinea pig line 10 hepatocarcinoma with a variety of nonviable bacteria.
AB  - A variety of heat-killed bacteria were tested for their capacity to induce regressions of established line 10 hepatocarcinomas in syngeneic guinea pigs. Multiple intralesional injections of heat-killed Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Listeria monocytogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes resulted in complete regression of the tumor in a majority of guinea pigs. Repeated injections of heat-killed Mycobacterium bovis strain Bacillus Calmette-Guerin caused no regressions. Surviving animals were immune to subsequent challenge with line 10 cells but not L2C cells, another syngeneic tumor.
TI  - Tumor-immunotherapeutic efficacy of Serratia marcescens polyribosomes.
AB  - The ability of polyribosomes, obtained from several bacterial species, to suppress the development of cutaneous SaD2 fibrosarcomas in DBA/2 mice were evaluated. Suppression of tumor appearance depended upon the tumor load at the time of treatment, dose of polyribosomes, and species source of polyribosomes, with Serratia marcescens being superior to Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium bovis (Pasteur), Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Propionibacterium acnes (formerly Corynebacterium parvum). A single injection of 5 or 50 microgram of Serratia polyribosomes at the tumor site 72 hr after the intradermal administration of 1.5 X 10(3) SaD2 cells resulted in 66 to 95% survival. All untreated animals expired within 50 days. Tumor suppression occurred at both flank and footpad sites. Presensitization with polyribosomes and incorporation of polyribosomes into adjuvant were not required for the tumor-suppressive effect. Treatment of Serratia polyribosomes with RNase or pronase reduced the number of survivors. Endotoxin was not detectable with the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay.

TI  - Bacterial colonization in intubated newborns.
AB  - The bacteriology of tracheal aspirates from 127 newborns was studied. Specimens were obtained twice a week as long as the newborns were intubated. Each newborn had between one and eight specimens taken (average 1.7). 127 babies had one specimen taken, 38 had two, 25 had three, 12 had four, and 10 had more than four specimens taken, which made a total of 212 specimens. No bacterial or fungal growth was obtained from 65 specimens, whereas the remaining specimens (147) yielded 209 bacterial and fungal isolates accounting for 1.4 isolates per specimen. The total isolates recovered were 168 aerobes, 36 anaerobes, and 5 Candida albicans. Of this total, 70 specimens yielded one isolate, 48 two isolates, 6 three isolates, 5 four isolates, and one aspirate yielded five isolates. 78 newborns (61%) received antimicrobial therapy. A higher incidence of positive cultures and the presence of more than one organism per culture were found in those infants not receiving antibiotics. More isolates per specimen were noted with increasing time of incubation. The rate of isolation Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae remained constant with increased length of intubation, the rate of recovery of Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans group streptococci, and Propionibacterium acnes increased, and the rate of isolation of Escherichia coli and anaerobic organisms decreased.
TI  - Corynebacterium parvum: immunomodulation in local bacterial infections.
AB  - Inoculation with Corynebacterium parvum 14 days before bacterial challenge produced protection against murine-simulated surgical wound infection with Escherichia coli to the same degree as had been provided by Bacillus Calmette-Guerin pretreatment. Simulated surgical wound infection induced by Staphylococcus aureus in mice followed a much more variable course; bacterial growth was depressed 7 days after C. parvum inoculation and was equivocal at a 14 day interval. Unlike E. coli infection modified by C. parvum or BCG, bacterial growth was significantly enhanced when the interval between C. parvum inoculation and S. aureus challenge was 20 or 28 days. Explanations for these differences and their possible clinical relevance are discussed.

TI  - [The bacterial flora of preputial space].
AB  - The bacterial flora of the preputial space of 210 healthy males (43 children aged between 2 and 11 years, 137 males between 12 and 60 years and 30 men over 60 years) was determined by smears and cultueres from glans penis, sulcus coronarius and the adjacent prepuce. The results were grouped according to various criteria, e.g. glans covered or uncovered and age of males. Differences in the distribution of germs could be found in relationship to age. In the case of an uncovered glans penis the presence of microbial flora corresponds to the grampositive saprophytic bacteria in areas rich in sebaceous glands. In the case of a covered glans the density of microorganisms increases. Prevalent are gramnegative anaerobes, especially Bacterioides melaninogenicus, also enterococci, enterobacteria and coagulase-positive staphylococci.
TI  - Low trimethoprim susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria due to insensitive dihydrofolate reductases.
AB  - All the 28 Bacteroides fragilis strains investigated were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole (minimal inhibitory concentration < 16 mug/ml) and resistant to trimethoprim (TMP; minimal inhibitory concentration > 4 mug/ml). Synergism between sulfamethoxazole and TMP was present in all strains at a ratio of 1:1. The few clostridia investigated proved more resistant to both compounds. Dihydrofolate reductases from B. fragilis, C. perfringens, and some other anaerobic species were isolated. Inhibition profiles with six structurally different inhibitors revealed major differences in all enzymes. For 50% inhibition, the enzyme from B. fragilis and all clostridia required concentrations of TMP which were between several hundredfold and 1,000-fold higher than those required for the enzyme of Escherichia coli, whereas the enzyme from Propionibacterium acnes only needed a threefold higher concentration. In vitro activities of TMP were seen to correspond to the activity at the enzymatic level in B. fragilis and P. acnes, but correspond to a much lesser extent to the activity at the enzymatic level in clostridia, where a poor penetration is assumed to be involved. Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors other than TMP were found to be as active as TMP both at the enzyme and in vitro. In B. fragilis, higher concentrations of exogenous thymidine were required for increasing the minimal inhibitory concentration of TMP than in E. coli and probably also in C. perfringens.
TI  - Role of mononuclear infiltrating cells in pathogenesis of hepatitis.
AB  - Mice that have been injected with Corynebacterium parvum have mononuclear-cell infiltrates in the liver lobules. In such mice a small dose of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin produced a lethal hepatitis, with high serum-transaminase concentrations, glycogen depletion, and hypoglycaemia. It is suggested that lipopolysaccharide triggers the release from the infiltrating mononuclear cells of factors toxic for hepatocytes. Similarly certain parasitic and virus infections and graft-versus-host reactions can sensitise mice to the induction of hepatitis by exposure to small doses of lipopolysaccharide. This model may be applicable to human hepatitis.

AB  - Antibodies that react with radiolabeled antigens derived from guinea pig line-10  tumor cells and Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) were detected in sera from normal tumor-free strain-2 guinea pigs (NGPS). Binding by NGPS to the two antigens was inhibited by extracts of either line-10 cells or BCG. Binding by NGPS to the line-10 antigen was inhibited by a number of other bacterial extracts. NGPS was tested after absorption with a variety of cells including line-10, line-1, normal guinea pig spleen, normal adult and fetal liver cells. Results indicated that some of the antibodies in NGPS were directed to line-10-specific determinants. The specific stimulating antigen for these antibodies was not identified but because of the antigenic relationship between BCG, line-10 cells and other bacteria, antibodies to line-10-associated antigens might have been induced by exposure to environmental microorganisms.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase in anaerobic bacteria of clinical significance.
AB  - Twenty-two anaerobic bacteria isolated from infected sites and normal fecal flora were assayed for superoxide dismutase (SOD). The organisms were also classified according to their oxygen tolerance into aerotolerant, intermediate, and extremely oxygen-sensitive groups. There was a correlation between the enzyme level and the oxygen tolerance, in that the aerotolerant and intermediate organisms had SOD, whereas the extremely oxygen-sensitive isolates had low or undetectable enzyme. Among the oxygen-tolerant organisms, gram-negative bacteria had higher levels of SOD than gram-positive organisms. Oxygen was shown to induce SOD production in a strain of Bacteriodes fragilis grown in minimal medium under continuous-culture conditions. Enzyme levels in this isolate grown under static conditions were lower in minimal medium than in complex medium, indicating that other components in the complex medium were stimulating the production of SOD. Our data suggest that the variation in oxygen tolerance of anaerobes is usually related to their level of SOD. It is postulated that SOD may be a virulence factor that allows pathogenic anaerobes to survive in oxygenated tissues until the proper reduced conditions are established for their growth.
TI  - [Growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy of the commercially available Vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). The media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. Analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. From the results obtained with strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides splanchnicus, Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the Vacutainer culture tubes, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.
TI  - Isolation and identification of fecal bacteria from adult swine.
AB  - An examination of the fecal microflora of adult swine was made with regard to the efficiency of several roll tube media in enumeration and recovery of anaerobes, the effects of medium constituents on recovery, and the isolation and identification of the predominant kinds of bacteria. Total number of organisms by microscopic bacterial counts varied among fecal samples from 4.48 X 10(10) to 7.40 X 10(10) bacteria/g (wet weight). Comparison of different nonselective roll tube media indicated that about 30% of the fecal bacteria could be recovered with a rumen fluid (40%, vol/vol) medium (M98-5). Recoveries of 21 and 15%, respectively, were obtained with M10 and rumen fluid-glucose-cellobiose agar (RGCA) media. Rumen fluid, Trypticase, sugars, and CO2 gas phase were important components required for maximum recovery with this medium. Similar high recoveries of anaerobes were also obtained with M98-5 containing swine cecal extract of place in rumen fluid or M10 plus swine cecal extract. Significantly lower recoveries were observed with RCGA, media supplemented with swine fecal extracts, reinforced clostridial medium, brain heart infusion agar, and prereduced blood agar. Ninety percent of the bacteria isolated from roll tube media were gram positive and consisted of facultatively anaerobic streptococci, Eubacterium sp., Clostridium sp., and Propionibacterium acnes. The remainder of the flora (8%) included several other species of anaerobes and Escherichia coli. Rumen fluid (or volatile fatty acids), Trypticase, and yeast extract additions to basal media stimulated the growth of anaerobic strains. Variation in the relative proportions of the predominant fecal microflora was observed. This work indicates that satisfactory enumeration, isolation and cultivation of the predominant microflora in swine feces can be obtained when strict anaerobic culture methods and a rumen fluid medium are used.

AB  - The diminution of immune response against SRBC induced in mice, by a prior injection of HRBC was counteracted by addition of certain immunostimulants to SRBC. The intensity of inhibition of antigenic competition was related to the quantity of immunostimulant added to SRBC. Some immunostimulants (B. abortus, lipopolysaccharide) were more active than others (C. parvum, Poly I : C). To inhibit antigenic competition immunostimulant had to be injected after or in mixture with SRBC never before.
TI  - The localization and distribution of gram-positive cocci in normal skin and in lesions of acne vulgaris.
AB  - The localization of gram-positive cocci in the normal skin and in the lesions of  acne vulgaris was investigated using fluorescein-labeled antiserum raised to gram-positive, coagulase-negative cocci. The cocci were found in 10 of 19 specimens from normal facial skin and in 3 of 11 specimens from the normal skin of the rest of the body. The bacteria were found mostly in the openings of follicles, but in 6 of 10 facial skin specimens, they were also present deeply in the lumina of the dilated sebaceous follicles near the sebaceous glands. Cocci were found in 5 of 6 noninflammatory acne comedones. In inflammatory acne they were demonstrated not only in the follicular canals but also sparsely in the infiltrate surrounding the follicles.
TI  - Studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  - A study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. Three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on a rumen fluid roll tube medium (M98-5). Seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), Peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as Propionibacterium acnes and Eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as Bacteroides clostridiiformis, B. hypermegas and B. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as Clostridium sp.). Two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and Escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. The distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. Data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy source, minerals, reducing agent, Trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). The growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by CO(2) and rumen fluid. These preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen anaerobes.

TI  - Immunostimulation with bacterial phospholipid extracts.
AB  - Injection of bacterial phospholipid extracts (EBP) into mice increased their resistance towards a Listeria monocytogenes infection. The blood clearance of virulent Salmonella typhimurium was enhanced and the degree of clearance correlated with the dose of extract injected. The multiplication of Listeria monocytogenes in spleen and liver of mice was inhibited and this inhibition was also correlated with the amount of extract injected. The absence of apparent toxicity in mice, of splenoand hepatomegaly, and of lymphoid hyperplasia, distinguish this immunostimulant from other known bacterial stimulants of host resistance to infection.
TI  - Effect of Corynebacterium acnes on interferon production in mice.
AB  - Exposure to Corynebacterium acnes, the most prominent member of our normal skin flora, produces stimulation of lymphoid tissue and certain reticuloendothelial system functions, as well as the immune response. Alteration of the host response is extended by these studies to include changes in the pattern of interferon production in response to a representative group of inducing agents. Serum interferon levels induced by the injection of endotoxin in mice are enhanced, whereas interferon production after injection of Newcastle disease virus, Chikungunya virus, and polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid is depressed in animals inoculated with viable or nonviable C. acnes organisms.
TI  - The intestinal flora of colonization-resistant mice.
AB  - To facilitate the isolation of anaerobes from cultures in which swarming organisms were present Roux flasks were adapted to provide anaerobic conditions. Using these flasks, five species of anaerobes were isolated from the caecum of mice resistant to colonization with Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative organisms. These species accounted for the majority of organisms seen in films of caecal material. No aerobes were isolated and the flora of these mice apparently consisted of a limited number of anaerobes representing part of the intestinal flora of conventional mice. Three of the species were clostridia and another was identified as Propionibacterium acnes. One species resembled Catenabacterium but was not identified. One of the Clostridium species could only be isolated when the medium was supplemented with yeast extract and vitamins. This species sporulated on media with ammonium phosphate as the source of nitrogen; tryptone completely suppressed sporulation.
