TI  == consumption of partially hydrolysed guar gum stimulates bifidobacteria and butyrate-producing bacteria in the human large intestine.
AB  == partially hydrolysed guar gum (phgg) is a water-soluble dietary fibre that is non-digestible in the upper gastrointestinal tract. it is believed that phgg benefits the health of hosts by altering the colonic microbiota and stimulating short-chain fatty acid (scfa) production. however, it remains unclear which bacteria ferment phgg in the human large intestine. in this study, the effect of  phgg on faecal bacteria was analysed to specify the bacteria that contribute to the fermentation of phgg in the human large intestine. ten healthy volunteers consumed phgg (6 g/day) for 2 weeks. faeces were collected at 2 weeks prior to consumption, at the end of 2 weeks of consumption, and 2 weeks after consumption  of phgg. bacterial dna was extracted from these collected faeces and subjected to real-time pcr using bacterial group- or species-specific primers. the copy number of the butyryl-coa coa-transferase gene and the 16s rrna gene copy numbers of bifidobacterium, the clostridium coccoides group, the roseburia/ eubacterium rectale group, eubacterium hallii, and butyrate-producing bacterium strain ss2/1  were significantly increased by the intake of phgg. other bacteria and bacterial  groups were not significantly influenced by the intake of phgg. it was believed that the roseburia/e. rectale group bacteria, bifidobacterium, the lactate-utilising, butyrate-producing bacteria, e. hallii and bacterium strain ss2/1, would contribute to the fermentation of phgg in the human large intestine. phgg may benefit health by stimulating bifidobacterium and butyrate-producing bacteria in the human large intestine.

TI  == butyrate-producing clostridium cluster xiva species specifically colonize mucins  in an in vitro gut model.
AB  == the human gut is colonized by a complex microbiota with multiple benefits. although the surface-attached, mucosal microbiota has a unique composition and potential to influence human health, it remains difficult to study in vivo. therefore, we performed an in-depth microbial characterization (human intestinal  tract chip (hitchip)) of a recently developed dynamic in vitro gut model, which simulates both luminal and mucosal gut microbes (mucosal-simulator of human intestinal microbial ecosystem (m-shime)). inter-individual differences among human subjects were confirmed and microbial patterns unique for each individual were preserved in vitro. furthermore, in correspondence with in vivo studies, bacteroidetes and proteobacteria were enriched in the luminal content while firmicutes rather colonized the mucin layer, with clostridium cluster xiva accounting for almost 60% of the mucin-adhered microbiota. of the many acetate and/or lactate-converting butyrate producers within this cluster, roseburia intestinalis and eubacterium rectale most specifically colonized mucins. these 16s rrna gene-based results were confirmed at a functional level as butyryl-coa:acetate-coa transferase gene sequences belonged to different species  in the luminal as opposed to the mucin-adhered microbiota, with roseburia species governing the mucosal butyrate production. correspondingly, the simulated mucosal environment induced a shift from acetate towards butyrate. as not only inter-individual differences were preserved but also because compared with conventional models, washout of relevant mucin-adhered microbes was avoided, simulating the mucosal gut microbiota represents a breakthrough in modeling and mechanistically studying the human intestinal microbiome in health and disease. finally, as mucosal butyrate producers produce butyrate close to the epithelium,  they may enhance butyrate bioavailability, which could be useful in treating diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  == decreased colonization of fecal clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale species from ulcerative colitis patients in an in vitro dynamic gut model with mucin environment.
AB  == the mucus layer in the colon, acting as a barrier to prevent invasion of pathogens, is thinner and discontinuous in patients with ulcerative colitis (uc). a recent developed in vitro dynamic gut model, the m-shime, was used to compare long-term colonization of the mucin layer by the microbiota from six healthy volunteers (hv) and six uc patients and thus distinguish the mucin adhered from the luminal microbiota. although under the same nutritional conditions, short-chain fatty acid production by the luminal communities from uc patients showed a tendency toward a lower butyrate production. a more in-depth community analysis of those microbial groups known to produce butyrate revealed that the diversity of the clostridium coccoides/eubacterium rectale and clostridium leptum group, and counts of faecalibacterium prausnitzii were lower in the luminal fractions of the uc samples. counts of roseburia spp. were lower in the mucosal fractions of the uc samples. qpcr analysis for butyryl-coa:acetate coa transferase, responsible for butyrate production, displayed a lower abundance in  both the luminal and mucosal fractions of the uc samples. the m-shime model revealed depletion in butyrate producing microbial communities not restricted to  the luminal but also in the mucosal samples from uc patients compared to hv.

TI  == fermentation rs3 derived from sago and rice starch with clostridium butyricum bcc b2571 or eubacterium rectale dsm 17629.
AB  == resistant starch type 3 (rs3) is retrograded starch which is not digested by human starch degrading enzyme, and will thus undergo bacterial degradation in the colon. the main fermentation products are the short chain fatty acid (scfa): acetate, propionate and butyrate. scfa has significant benefit impact on the metabolism of the host. the objectives of this research were to study the scfa profile produced by colonic butyrate producing bacteria grown in medium containing rs3. rs3 was made from sago or rice starch treated with amylase, pullulanase and the combination of amylase and pullulanase. fermentation study was performed by using clostridium butyricum bcc b2571 or eubacterium rectale dsm 17629, which has been identified as capable of degradation of starch residue and  also regarded as beneficial bacteria. experimental result revealed that enzyme hydrolysis of retrograded sago or rice starch was beneficial to rs formation. rs3 derived from sago contained higher rs (31-38%) than those derived from rice starch (21-26%). this study indicated that c. butyricum bcc b2571 produced acetate, propionate and butyrate at molar ratio of 1.8 : 1 : 1, when the medium was supplemented with rssa at concentration 1%. in the medium containing similar  substrate, e. rectale dsm 17629 produced acetate, propionate and butyrate at molar ratio of 1.7 : 1 : 1.2. high levels of acetate, propionate and butyrate at  molar ratio of 1.8 : 1 : 1.1 was also produced by e. rectale dsm 17629 in medium  supplemented with rssp at concentration 1%. the results showed that both bacteria responded differently to the rs3 supplementation. such result provided insight into the possibility of designing rs3 as prebiotic with featured regarding scfa released in the human colon with potential health implication.

TI  == diversity of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria revealed by analysis of the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria play an important role in the human colon, supplying  energy to the gut epithelium and regulating host cell responses. in order to explore the diversity and culturability of this functional group, we designed degenerate primers to amplify butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase sequences from  faecal samples provided by 10 healthy volunteers. eighty-eight per cent of amplified sequences showed >98% dna sequence identity to coa-transferases from cultured butyrate-producing bacteria, and these fell into 12 operational taxonomic units (otus). the four most prevalent otus corresponded to eubacterium  rectale, roseburia faecis, eubacterium hallii and an unnamed cultured species ss2/1. the remaining 12% of sequences, however, belonged to 20 otus that are assumed to come from uncultured butyrate-producing strains. samples taken after ingestion of inulin showed significant (p=0.019) increases in faecalibacterium prausnitzii. because several of the dominant butyrate producers differ in their dna % g+c content, analysis of thermal melt curves obtained for pcr amplicons of  the butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase gene provides a convenient and rapid qualitative assessment of the major butyrate producing groups present in a given  sample. this type of analysis therefore provides an excellent source of information on functionally important groups within the colonic microbial community.

TI  == the role of ph in determining the species composition of the human colonic microbiota.
AB  == the ph of the colonic lumen varies with anatomical site and microbial fermentation of dietary residue. we have investigated the impact of mildly acidic ph, which occurs in the proximal colon, on the growth of different species of human colonic bacteria in pure culture and in the complete microbial community. growth was determined for 33 representative human colonic bacteria at three initial ph values (approximately 5.5, 6.2 and 6.7) in anaerobic ycfa medium, which includes a mixture of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) with 0.2% glucose as energy source. representatives of all eight bacteroides species tested grew poorly at ph 5.5, as did escherichia coli, whereas 19 of the 23 gram-positive anaerobes tested gave growth rates at ph 5.5 that were at least 50% of those at ph 6.7. growth inhibition of b. thetaiotaomicron at ph 5.5 was increased by the presence of the scfa mix (33 mm acetate, 9 mm propionate and 1 mm each of iso-valerate, valerate and iso-butyrate). analysis of amplified 16s rrna sequences demonstrated a major ph-driven shift within a human faecal bacterial community in a continuous flow fermentor. bacteroides spp. accounted for 27% of 16s rrna sequences detected at ph 5.5, but 86% of sequences at ph 6.7. conversely, butyrate-producing gram-positive bacteria related to eubacterium rectale represented 50% of all 16s rrna sequences at ph 5.5, but were not detected at ph 6.7. inhibition of the growth of a major group of gram-negative bacteria at mildly acidic ph apparently creates niches that can be exploited by more low ph-tolerant microorganisms.

TI  == diversity, metabolism and microbial ecology of butyrate-producing bacteria from the human large intestine.
AB  == butyrate-producing bacteria play a key role in colonic health in humans. this review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the diversity, metabolism and microbial ecology of this functionally important group of bacteria. human colonic butyrate producers are gram-positive firmicutes, but are phylogenetically diverse, with the two most abundant groups related to eubacterium rectale/roseburia spp. and to faecalibacterium prausnitzii. five different arrangements have been identified for the genes of the central pathway involved in butyrate synthesis, while in most cases butyryl-coa : acetate coa-transferase, rather than butyrate kinase, appears to perform the final step in butyrate synthesis. mechanisms have been proposed recently in non-gut clostridium spp. whereby butyrate synthesis can result in energy generation via both substrate-level phosphorylation and proton gradients. here we suggest that these  mechanisms also apply to the majority of butyrate producers from the human colon. the roles of these bacteria in the gut community and their influence on health are now being uncovered, taking advantage of the availability of cultured isolates and molecular methodologies. populations of f. prausnitzii are reported  to be decreased in crohn's disease, for example, while populations of roseburia relatives appear to be particularly sensitive to the diet composition in human volunteer studies.

TI  == real-time polymerase chain reaction quantification of specific butyrate-producing bacteria, desulfovibrio and enterococcus faecalis in the feces of patients with colorectal cancer.
AB  == background and aim: bacterial metabolites produced in the bowel are potentially related to the genesis of colorectal cancer. butyrate is protective against cancer, whereas hydrogen sulfide and oxygen free radicals can be toxic to the epithelium. the present study was designed to quantitate eubacterium rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii (both butyrate-producing bacteria), desulfovibrio (sulfate-reducing bacteria), and enterococcus faecalis (that produces extracellular superoxide) in the feces of patients with colorectal cancer. methods: dna was extracted from feces of 20 patients with colorectal cancer, nine patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and 17 healthy volunteers. real-time  polymerase chain reaction using primers aimed at 16s rdna was used to quantitate  the above bacterial species or genus, and this was expressed relative to amplification of universal sequences conserved among all bacteria. results: levels of e. rectale and f. prausnitzii were decreased approximately fourfold (p  = 0.0088 and 0.0028, respectively) in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy control volunteers. levels of desulfovibrio were not significantly different between the three groups. e. faecalis populations were significantly higher in colorectal cancer patients compared to healthy volunteers (p = 0.0294). conclusions: butyrate producers were decreased and e. faecalis increased in the feces of colon cancer patients. these shifts in the colonic bacterial population  could potentially lead to epithelial cell damage and increased turnover and may be a factor leading to colon cancer.

TI  == understanding the effects of diet on bacterial metabolism in the large intestine.
AB  == recent analyses of ribosomal rna sequence diversity have demonstrated the extent  of bacterial diversity in the human colon, and have provided new tools for monitoring changes in the composition of the gut microbial community. there is now an excellent opportunity to correlate ecological niches and metabolic activities with particular phylogenetic groups among the microbiota of the human  gut. bacteria that associate closely with particulate material and surfaces in the gut include specialized primary degraders of insoluble substrates, including  resistant starch, plant structural polysaccharides and mucin. butyrate-producing  bacteria found in human faeces belong mainly to the clostridial clusters iv and xiva. in vitro and in vivo evidence indicates that a group related to roseburia and eubacterium rectale plays a major role in mediating the butyrogenic effect of fermentable dietary carbohydrates. additional cluster xiva species can convert lactate to butyrate, while some members of the clostridial cluster ix convert lactate to propionate. the metabolic outputs of the gut microbial community depend not only on available substrate, but also on the gut environment, with ph  playing a major role. better understanding of the colonic microbial ecosystem will help to explain and predict the effects of dietary additives, including nondigestible carbohydrates, probiotics and prebiotics.

TI  == reduced dietary intake of carbohydrates by obese subjects results in decreased concentrations of butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria in feces.
AB  == weight loss diets for humans that are based on a high intake of protein but low intake of fermentable carbohydrate may alter microbial activity and bacterial populations in the large intestine and thus impact on gut health. in this study,  19 healthy, obese (body mass index range, 30 to 42) volunteers were given in succession three different diets: maintenance (m) for 3 days (399 g carbohydrate/day) and then high protein/medium (164 g/day) carbohydrate (hpmc) and high protein/low (24 g/day) carbohydrate (hplc) each for 4 weeks. stool samples were collected at the end of each dietary regimen. total fecal short-chain fatty acids were 114 mm, 74 mm, and 56 mm (p < 0.001) for m, hpmc, and hplc diets, respectively, and there was a disproportionate reduction in fecal butyrate (18 mm, 9 mm, and 4 mm, respectively; p < 0.001) with decreasing carbohydrate. major groups of fecal bacteria were monitored using nine 16s rrna-targeted fluorescence in situ hybridization probes, relative to counts obtained with the broad probe eub338. no significant change was seen in the relative counts of the bacteroides (bac303) (mean, 29.6%) or the clostridial cluster xiva (erec482, 23.3%), cluster ix (prop853, 9.3%), or cluster iv (fprau645, 11.6%; rbro730 plus rfla729, 9.3%) groups. in contrast, the roseburia  spp. and eubacterium rectale subgroup of cluster xiva (11%, 8%, and 3% for m, hpmc, and hplc, respectively; p < 0.001) and bifidobacteria (4%, 2.1%, and 1.9%,  respectively; p = 0.026) decreased as carbohydrate intake decreased. the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria related to roseburia spp. and e. rectale correlated well with the decline in fecal butyrate.

TI  == molecular diversity, cultivation, and improved detection by fluorescent in situ hybridization of a dominant group of human gut bacteria related to roseburia spp. or eubacterium rectale.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis was used to compare 16s rrna sequences from 19 cultured human gut strains of roseburia and eubacterium rectale with 356 related sequences derived from clone libraries. the cultured strains were found to represent five of the six phylotypes identified. a new oligonucleotide probe, rrec584, and the previous group probe rint623, when used in conjunction with a new helper oligonucleotide, each recognized an average of 7% of bacteria detected by the eubacterial probe eub338 in feces from 10 healthy volunteers. most of the diversity within this important group of butyrate-producing gut bacteria can apparently be retrieved through cultivation.

TI  == studies on the effect of system retention time on bacterial populations colonizing a three-stage continuous culture model of the human large gut using fish techniques.
AB  == fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantitate bacteria growing in a three-stage continuous culture system inoculated with human faeces, operated at two system retention times (60 and 20 h). twenty-three different 16s rrna gene oligonucleotide probes of varying specificities were used to detect bacteria. organisms belonging to genera bacteroides and bifidobacterium, together with the  eubacterium rectale/clostridium coccoides group, the atopobium, faecalibacterium  prausnitzii and eubacterium cylindroides groups, as well as the segmented filamentous bacteria, the roseburia intestinalis group and lactic acid bacteria,  were all present in high numbers in the continuous culture system. other groups and species such as ruminococci and enterobacteria also persisted in the model, though not always at levels that allowed reliable quantitation. some organisms such as streptococci and corynebacteria, present in the faecal inoculum, did not  colonize the system. other probes specific for eubacterium lentum and for members of the genus desulfovibrio did not detect these organisms at any time. short chain fatty acid production was always highest in vessel i of the continuous culture system, however, a marked increase in acetate formation and a reduction in butyrate production occurred when system retention time was reduced to 20 h, which correlated with reductions in the numbers of butyrate-producing roseburia.

TI  == genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.

TI  == lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.

TI  == butyrivibrio hungatei sp. nov. and pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans sp. nov., butyrate-producing bacteria from the rumen.
AB  == two novel gram-negative, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, butyrate-producing bacterial species, strains mz 5t and jk 615t, were isolated from the rumen fluid  of cow and sheep. both strains were curved rods that were motile by means of single polar or subpolar flagellum and common in the rumen microbial ecosystem. strain mz 5t produced high xylanase, proteinase, pectin hydrolase and dnase activities; 1,4-beta-endoglucanase was also detected in the culture medium. the bacterium utilized a wide range of carbohydrates. glucose was fermented to formate, butyrate, lactate, succinate and ethanol. the dna g + c content was 42.1 mol%. the complete 16s rdna sequence was obtained and phylogenetic relationships  were determined. strain mz 5t and related isolates were located in clostridial cluster xiva and were closely related to pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, butyrivibrio crossotus, roseburia cecicola and eubacterium rectale. the name proposed for this novel bacterium is pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans; the type strain is mz 5t (=dsm 14809t =atcc baa-455t). strain jk 615t produced no fibrolytic activity, but utilized a wide range of carbohydrates. glucose was fermented to formate, acetate, butyrate and ethanol. the dna g + c content was 44-8 mol%. the complete  16s rdna sequence was obtained and phylogenetic relationships were determined. strain jk 615t was located in clostridial cluster xiva and was closely related to clostridium proteoclasticum, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and eubacterium halii. the name proposed for this novel bacterium is butyrivibrio hungatei; the type strain  is jk 615t (=dsm 14810t =atcc baa-456t).

TI  == roseburia intestinalis sp. nov., a novel saccharolytic, butyrate-producing bacterium from human faeces.
AB  == five strains of butyrate-producing, anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria were isolated from human faecal material. these strains were slightly curved rods that showed motility by means of multiple subterminal flagella. the dna g + c content  of the strains was 29-31 mol%. a detailed investigation of the phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics of the strains revealed that they represent a novel  species of anaerobic, low-g+c-content, butyrate-producing bacterium that shows net acetate utilization during growth on media containing carbohydrates and short-chain fatty acids. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the five isolates were determined and they confirmed that these strains were closely related to each other. phylogenetic analysis indicated that the most closely related species are  eubacterium rectale, eubacterium oxidoreducens and roseburia cecicola, members of cluster xiva of the clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria, although they share less than 95% sequence identity with the novel strains. it is proposed that a novel species, roseburia intestinalis sp. nov., be created, with strain l1-82t (= dsm 14610t = ncimb 13810t) as the type strain.

TI  == phylogenetic relationships of butyrate-producing bacteria from the human gut.
AB  == butyrate is a preferred energy source for colonic epithelial cells and is thought to play an important role in maintaining colonic health in humans. in order to investigate the diversity and stability of butyrate-producing organisms of the colonic flora, anaerobic butyrate-producing bacteria were isolated from freshly voided human fecal samples from three healthy individuals: an infant, an adult omnivore, and an adult vegetarian. a second isolation was performed on the same three individuals 1 year later. of a total of 313 bacterial isolates, 74 produced more than 2 mm butyrate in vitro. butyrate-producing isolates were grouped by 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. the results indicate very little overlap between the predominant ribotypes of the three subjects; furthermore, the flora of each individual changed significantly between the two isolations. complete sequences of 16s rdnas were determined for 24 representative strains and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. eighty percent  of the butyrate-producing isolates fell within the xiva cluster of gram-positive  bacteria as defined by m. d. collins et al. (int. j. syst. bacteriol. 44:812-826, 1994) and a. willems et al. (int. j. syst. bacteriol. 46:195-199, 1996), with the most abundant group (10 of 24 or 42%) clustering with eubacterium rectale, eubacterium ramulus, and roseburia cecicola. fifty percent of the butyrate-producing isolates were net acetate consumers during growth, suggesting  that they employ the butyryl coenzyme a-acetyl coenzyme a transferase pathway for butyrate production. in contrast, only 1% of the 239 non-butyrate-producing isolates consumed acetate.

TI  == 16s rdna analysis of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens: phylogenetic position and relation to butyrate-producing anaerobic bacteria from the rumen of white-tailed  deer.
AB  == complete 16s rdna sequences of six strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, including the type strain (atcc 19171), were determined. the type strain was found to have less than 89% sequence similarity to the other isolates that were examined. the five plasmid-bearing strains formed a closely related cluster and three of these strains (ob156, ob157 and ob192) were very highly related (> 99%), indicating that they are isolates of the same genomic species. the phylogenetic position of butyrivibrio was found to be within the subphylum clostridium, of gram-positive bacteria. the closest relatives to the type strain were eubacterium cellulosolvens and cl. xylanolyticum and the closest relatives to the separately  clustered strains were roseburia ceciola, lachnospira pectinoschiza and eubacterium rectale.
