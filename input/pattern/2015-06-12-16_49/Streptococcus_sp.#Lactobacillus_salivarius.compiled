TI  - Comparison of the gut microbiota profile in breast-fed and formula-fed Korean infants using pyrosequencing.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Feeding in infancy is the most significant determinant of  the intestinal microbiota in early life. The aim of this study was to determine the gut microbiota of Korean infants and compare the microbiota obtained between breast-fed and formula-fed Korean infants. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We analyzed the microbial communities in fecal samples collected from twenty 4-week old Korean (ten samples in each breast-fed or formula-fed) infants using pyrosequencing. RESULTS: The fecal microbiota of the 4-week-old Korean infants consisted of the three phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. In addition, five species, including Bifidocbacterium longum, Streptococcus salivarius, Strepotococcus lactarius, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and Lactobacillus gasseri were common commensal intestinal microbiota in all infants. The predominant intestinal microbiota in the breast-fed infants (BFI) included the phylum Actinobacteria (average 70.55%), family Bifidobacteriacea (70.12%), genus Bifidobacterium (70.03%) and species Bifidobacterium longum (69.96%). In the microbiota from the formula-fed infants (FFI), the proportion of the phylum Actinobacteria (40.68%) was less, whereas the proportions of Firmicutes (45.38%) and Proteobacteria (13.85%) as well as the diversity of each taxonomic level were greater, compared to those of the BFI. The probiotic species found in the 4-week-old Korean infants were Bifidobacterium longum, Streptococcus salivarius, and Lactobacillus gasseri. These probiotic species accounted for 93.81% of the microbiota from the BFI, while only 63.80% of the microbiota from the FFI. In particular, B. longum was more abundant in BFI (69.96%) than in FFI (34.17%). CONCLUSIONS: Breast milk supports the growth of B. longum and inhibits others. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first attempt to analyze the gut microbiota of healthy Korean infants according to the feeding type using pyrosequencing. Our data can be used as a basis for further studies to investigate the development of intestinal microbiota with aging and disease status.
TI  - Microbial inhibition of oral epithelial wound recovery: potential role for quorum sensing molecules?
AB  - Awareness of the impact of microbiota in both health and disease is growing. Using a new in vitro oral mucosa co-culture model, we recently showed a clear inhibition of epithelial wound healing in the presence of an oral microbial community. In this paper, we have used the same model in combination with specific oral microbial species to obtain a better insight into the role of the oral microbiota in wound healing. Monocultures of Klebsiella oxytoca and Lactobacillus salivarius significantly inhibited wound healing with ~20%, whereas Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis enhanced the healing process with ~15% in 24 h. Yet, neither S. oralis or S. mitis were able to counteract the inhibitory effects from K. oxytoca on wound healing. Other tested microbial species had no effect on wound healing. Apart from this species-dependency, the inhibitory effect on wound healing depended on a microbial threshold concentration. Further mechanistic experiments with K. oxytoca excluded different microbial factors and hypothesized that quorum sensing molecules might play a role in the inter-kingdom signalling during wound healing. These results are important for the development of new strategies for the management of (infected) wounds and ulcerations.
TI  - Oral lactic acid bacteria related to the occurrence and/or progression of dental  caries in Japanese preschool children.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), especially those classified into the genus Lactobacillus, is associated with the progression of dental caries in preschool children. Nevertheless, the kinds of species of LAB and the characteristics that are important for dental caries have been unclear. The aims of this study were: (1) to investigate the distribution of oral LAB among Japanese preschool children with various prevalence levels of caries; and (2) to reveal the characteristics of these isolated LAB species. Seventy-four Japanese preschool children were examined for caries scores and caries progression, and their dental cavity samples were collected for LAB isolation and identification. The saliva-induced agglutination rate and the resistance to acidic environments of the identified strains were measured. Statistical analysis showed that preschool children carrying Lactobacillus (L.) salivarius or Streptococcus mutans have a significantly higher prevalence of dental caries, the growth ability in acidic environments correlates with the caries scores of individuals with L. salivarius, and the caries scores exhibit positive correlation with saliva-induced agglutination in L. salivarius. These results show that specific Lactobacillus species are associated with dental caries based on the level of carious lesion severity. The present study suggests that these specific Lactobacillus species, especially those with easily agglutinated properties and acid resistance, affect the dental caries scores of preschool children, and that these properties may provide useful information for research into the prevention of dental caries.
TI  - Effect of Probiotic Containing Ice-cream on Salivary Mutans Streptococci (SMS) Levels in Children of 6-12 Years of Age: A Randomized Controlled Double Blind Study with Six-months Follow Up.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the caries risk based on the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans in children of 6-12 years of age group before and after consuming probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out in 60 children aged between 6 to 12 years with zero decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT). They were randomly divided into two equal groups. Saliva sample were collected before the consumption of ice-cream and Streptococcus mutans count was calculated and recorded as baseline data. For the next seven days both the groups were given ice creams marked as A and B. Saliva samples were collected after ice-cream consumption at the end of study period and also after a washout period of 30 days and again after six months. Samples were inoculated and colonies were counted. RESULTS: On statistical evaluation by students paired t-test, probiotic ice-cream brought significant reduction in the Streptococcus mutans count after seven days of ice-cream ingestion (p<0.001) and also after 30 d of washout period (p<0.001). There was no significant reduction (p=0.076) by normal ice-cream consumption. After six months of the study period in both the groups the salivary levels of Streptococcus mutans was similar to the baseline. CONCLUSION: Probiotic ice-cream containing Bifidobacterium lactis Bb-12 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 can cause reduction in caries causative organism. The dosage of the probiotic organisms for the long term or synergetic effect on the oral health are still needed to be explored.
TI  - Comparison of the Antibacterial Properties of Three Mouthwashes Containing Chlorhexidine Against Oral Microbial Plaques: An in vitro Study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mouth provides an environment that allows the colonization and growth of a wide variety of microorganisms, especially bacteria. One of the most effective ways to reduce oral microorganisms is using mouthwashes. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effects of chlorhexidine mouthwashes (manufacture by Livar, Behsa, Boht) on common oral microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, isolated colonies of four bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguinis, S. salivarius and Lactobacillus casei, were prepared for an antimicrobial mouth rinse test. The tube dilution method was used for determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC). RESULTS: The MICs for Kin gingival, Behsa and Boht mouthwashes were 0.14, 0.48 and 1000 micrograms/mL using the tube method for S. mutans, respectively. The MBCs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.23, 1.9 and 2000 micrograms/mL for S. mutans, respectively. The MICs for Kin gingival, Behsa and Boht mouthwashes were 0.073, 0.48 and 250 micrograms/mL using the tube method for S. sanguinis, respectively. The MBCs for the mentioned mouthwashes were 0.14, 1.9 and 1000 micrograms/mL for S. sanguinis, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Kin Gingival chlorhexidine mouthwash has a greater effect than Behsa and Boht mouthwashes on oral microorganisms and is recommended to be used for plaque chemical inhibition.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase A(2) of honey bee  (Apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  - In this work, we used the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by Apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. Apitoxin was assayed in natura and in the commercially available form. The antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase A2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. The following bacteria were tested: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, Lactobacillus casei, and Enterococcus faecalis. The MIC results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / mL, which indicated good antibacterial activity. Melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising MIC values, from 4 to 40 microg / mL. Phospholipase A2 presented MIC values higher than 400 microg / mL. Association of mellitin with phospholipase A2 yielded MIC values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / mL. Considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.
TI  - Antifouling coatings for dental implants: Polyethylene glycol-like coatings on titanium by plasma polymerization.
AB  - Titanium dental implants are commonly used for the replacement of lost teeth, but they present a considerable number of failures due to the infection on surrounding tissues. The aim of this paper is the development of a polyethylene glycol-like (PEG-like) coating on the titanium surface by plasma polymerization to obtain a novel improved surface with suitable low bacterial adhesion and adequate cell response. Surface analysis data of these coatings are presented, in particular, water contact angle, surface roughness, and film chemistry, demonstrating the presence of a PEG-like coating. Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus salivarius bacterial adhesion assays showed a decreased adhesion on the plasma polymerized samples, while cell adhesion of fibroblasts and osteoblasts on the treated surfaces was similar to control surfaces. Thus, the PEG-like antifouling coating obtained by plasma polymerization on Ti confers this biomaterial's highly suitable properties for dental applications, as they reduce the possibility of infection while allowing the tissue integration around the implant.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of hLf1-11 peptide onto titanium surfaces: a comparison  study between silanization and surface initiated polymerization.
AB  - Dental implant failure can be associated with infections that develop into peri-implantitis. In order to reduce biofilm formation, several strategies focusing on the use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been studied. To covalently immobilize these molecules onto metallic substrates, several techniques have been developed, including silanization and polymer brush prepared by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), with varied peptide binding yield and antibacterial performance. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficiency of these methods to immobilize the lactoferrin-derived hLf1-11 antibacterial peptide onto titanium, and evaluate their antibacterial activity in vitro. Smooth titanium samples were coated with hLf1-11 peptide under three different conditions: silanization with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), and polymer brush based coatings with two different silanes. Peptide presence was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the mechanical stability of the coatings was studied under ultrasonication. The LDH assays confirmed that HFFs viability and proliferation were no affected by the treatments. The in vitro antibacterial properties of the modified surfaces were tested with two oral strains (Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus salivarius) showing an outstanding reduction. A higher decrease in bacterial attachment was noticed when samples were modified by ATRP methods compared to silanization. This effect is likely due to the capacity to immobilize more peptide on the surfaces using polymer brushes and the nonfouling nature of polymer PDMA segment.
TI  - Immunomodulatory properties of Streptococcus and Veillonella isolates from the human small intestine microbiota.
AB  - The human small intestine is a key site for interactions between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system. Here we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative species of commonly dominant small-intestinal microbial communities, including six streptococcal strains (four Streptococcus salivarius, one S. equinus, one S. parasanguinis) one Veillonella parvula strain, one Enterococcus gallinarum strain, and Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 as a bench mark strain on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. The different streptococci induced varying levels of the cytokines IL-8, TNF-alpha, and IL-12p70, while the V. parvula strain showed a strong capacity to induce IL-6. E. gallinarum strain was a potent inducer of cytokines and TLR2/6 signalling. As Streptococcus and Veillonella can potentially interact metabolically and frequently co-occur in ecosystems, immunomodulation by pair-wise combinations of strains were also tested for their combined immunomodulatory properties. Strain combinations induced cytokine responses in dendritic cells that differed from what might be expected on the basis of the results obtained with the individual strains. A combination of (some) streptococci with Veillonella appeared to negate IL-12p70 production, while augmenting IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha responses. This suggests that immunomodulation data obtained in vitro with individual strains are unlikely to adequately represent immune responses to mixtures of gut microbiota communities in vivo. Nevertheless, analysing the immune responses of strains representing the dominant species in the intestine may help to identify immunomodulatory mechanisms that influence immune homeostasis.
TI  - The probiotic VSL#3 has anti-inflammatory effects and could reduce endoscopic recurrence after surgery for Crohn's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not  been effective in preventing the recurrence of Crohn's disease after surgery. We investigated the ability of VSL#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic species, to prevent Crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Within 30 days of ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of VSL#3 (900 billion viable bacteria, comprising 4 strains of Lactobacillus, 3 strains of Bifidobacterium, and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo (n = 60). Colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine analysis. Patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence at day 90 received VSL#3 until day 365. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. RESULTS: At day 90, the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ significantly between VSL#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, P = .19). The proportions of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 for the entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late VSL#3 group (given VSL#3 from days 90 through 365) (P = .09). Aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365) were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early VSL#3 group and 42.1% in the late VSL#3 group. Patients receiving VSL#3 had reduced mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (P < .05). Crohn's disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistical differences in endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received VSL#3 and patients who received placebo. Lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early VSL#3 (for the entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for prevention of Crohn's disease recurrence. Clinical trials.gov number: NCT00175292.
TI  - Cariogenic bacteria and dental health status in adolescents: the role of oral health behaviours.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the association between dental health status and levels of cariogenic bacteria in teenagers and the influence of behaviours and socio-demographic background on levels of bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study design: A cross-sectional population-based sample of 13-year-old adolescents (112 females and 78 males, total 190) was examined. The number of decayed, missing and filled surfaces (DMFS), plaque and hygiene index were recorded according to the WHO criteria. The saliva samples were collected in a sterile container and then analysed by culture on Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin (MSB) agar for mutans Streptococci and on Man Rogosa Sharp (MRS) agar for Lactobacilli. The levels of bacteria were expressed as the number of colonies forming units per millilitre of saliva (CFU/ml). Associations between levels of mutans Streptococci and Lactobacilli and dental health were estimated by odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: No mutans Streptococci were detected in 53.2% of the adolescents but 22.6% presented >/= 10(3) CFU/ml. For Lactobacilli, these values were, respectively 43.7% and 34.7%. After adjustment for gender and social class, the OR (95% CI) for DMFS >5 was 8.66 (3.57-21.02) if mutans Streptococci >/= 10(3) CFU and 2.11 (0.96-4.64) if Lactobacilli >/= 10(3) CFU. CONCLUSION: This data allow us to conclude that hygiene habits and dental visits are not associated with high levels of cariogenic bacteria, but high scores of DMFS were found in adolescents with high levels of mutans Streptococci and lower parents' education.
TI  - Treatment of atopic dermatitis eczema with a high concentration of Lactobacillus  salivarius LS01 associated with an innovative gelling complex: a pilot study on adults.
AB  - GOALS: To evaluate the efficacy of a highly concentrated Lactobacillus salivarius preparation containing a gelling complex formed by Streptococcus thermophilus ST10 and tara gum in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated an improvement in AD symptoms after administration of the probiotic strain L. salivarius LS01. S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum create a gelling complex that adheres to intestinal mucus and improves barrier function. STUDY: A prospective, controlled pilot trial was carried out to evaluate how the association of S. thermophilus ST10 and tara gum could improve the activity of L. salivarius LS01 administered at high doses to adults with AD. Twenty-five patients were included into the study: 13 were treated for 1 month with the active formulation, whereas 12 represented the placebo group. Scoring Atopic Dermatitis index was determined before and at the end of probiotic administration. Fecal samples were also collected to evaluate changes in bacterial counts of Staphylococcus aureus and clostridia. RESULTS: A significant improvement in SCORAD index was observed in the probiotic group after 1 month of treatment, whereas no significant changes occurred in placebo patients. A slight decrease in fecal S. aureus count was observed in probiotic-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained in this study suggest a potential role for L. salivarius LS01 in the treatment of AD. The addition of tara gum and S. thermophilus ST10 seems to improve the overall efficacy of the probiotic strain, in particular shortening the time required for the onset of the positive effects. Further studies to investigate the activity of this preparation are advisable.
TI  - Functional screening of antibiotic resistance genes from a representative metagenomic library of food fermenting microbiota.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) represent the predominant microbiota in fermented foods. Foodborne LAB have received increasing attention as potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance (AR) determinants, which may be horizontally transferred to opportunistic pathogens. We have previously reported isolation of AR LAB from the raw ingredients of a fermented cheese, while AR genes could be detected in the final, marketed product only by PCR amplification, thus pointing at the need for more sensitive microbial isolation techniques. We turned therefore to construction of a metagenomic library containing microbial DNA extracted directly from the food matrix. To maximize yield and purity and to ensure that genomic complexity of the library was representative of the original bacterial population, we defined a suitable protocol for total DNA extraction from cheese which can also be applied to other lipid-rich foods. Functional library screening on different antibiotics allowed recovery of ampicillin and kanamycin resistant clones originating from Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus genomes. We report molecular characterization of the cloned inserts, which were fully sequenced and shown to confer AR phenotype to recipient bacteria. We also show that metagenomics can be applied to food microbiota to identify underrepresented species carrying specific genes of interest.
TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus salivarius-containing tablets on caries risk factors: a  randomized open-label clinical trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effects of the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius on caries risk factors. METHODS: The study was performed in 64 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of L. salivarius-containing tablets on caries risk factors. The participants were divided randomly into four groups, and took tablets containing L. salivarius WB21, L. salivarius TI 2711, Ovalgen(R) DC (antibody against glucosyltransferase from Streptococcus mutans), or xylitol. Levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, amount of salivary flow, salivary pH, and salivary buffering capacity were assessed before and after taking the tablets. Subsequently, a short-term administration trial using L. salivarius WB21-containing tablets was performed in eight healthy volunteers. The participants took L. salivarius WB21-containing tablets (2.0 x 10(9) colony forming units/day) for 2 weeks, and the numbers of mutans streptococci in saliva were counted. RESULTS: The levels of mutans streptococci seemed to decrease in the L. salivarius WB21, TI 2711, and Ovalgen(R) DC groups compared to the xylitol group, with no significant differences between the groups. Lactobacilli levels significantly increased in the L. salivarius WB21 and TI 2711 groups compared to the other groups. Concerning salivary flow and salivary pH, no significant differences were observed between the groups. The salivary buffering capacity significantly increased in the L. salivarius TI 2711 group (P = 0.003) and Ovalgen(R) DC group (P = 0.002) compared to the xylitol group. The short-term administration trial showed that the L. salivarius WB21-containing tablets significantly decreased the number of mutans streptococci (P = 0.039). CONCLUSION: L. salivarius-containing tablets were suggested to increase resistance to caries risk factors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000013160 (registration date: February 14, 2014).
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 during manufacture and storage of white brined cheese.
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a major foodborne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. Survival of E. coli O157:H7 during processing and storage of white brined cheese was investigated. Cheeses were prepared using pasteurized milk inoculated with a 4 strain E. coli O157:H7 cocktail (7 log(10) CFU/g) with or without yogurt starter culture (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) and stored in 10% or 15% NaCl brine at 10 and 21 masculineC for 28 d. NaCl concentration, water activity (a(w)), pH, and numbers of E. coli O157:H7 and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were determined in cheese and brine. E. coli O157:H7 was able to survive in cheese stored in both brines at 10 and 21 masculineC regardless of the presence of starter LAB, although the latter significantly enhanced E. coli O157:H7 reduction in cheese or its brine at 10 masculineC. E. coli O157:H7 numbers were reduced by 2.6 and 3.4 log(10) CFU/g in cheese stored in 10% and 15% NaCl brine, respectively, in the presence of starter LAB and by 1.4 and 2.3 log(10) CFU/g, respectively, in the absence of starter LAB at 10 masculineC. The pathogen survived, but at lower numbers in the brines. The salt concentration of cheese stored in 10% brine remained about 5% during ripening, but in 15% brine, the NaCl level increased 1.6% to 8.1% (w/w) by 28 d. Values of pH and a(w) slightly decreased 1 d after exposure to brine and reached 5.5 to 6.6 and 0.88 to 0.94, respectively, in all treatments.
TI  - The yogurt amino acid profile's variation during the shelf-life.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the yogurt amino acid profile starting from marketing through the whole shelf-life. The evaluation of the proteolytic activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, allows to deduce their vitality during the shelf-life period and within 45 days. METHODS: Three types of full fats yogurts have been analyzed (a) natural white (b) sweet white and (c) whole fruit - in two stages: t0 (first day of shelf-life) and t1 (end of shelf-life). The proteins have been analyzed by the Kjeldahl method and the amino acid profile by HPLC. RESULTS: In natural yogurt a significant increase of the amount of free amino acids has been observed during the period of shelf-life (97%). In the sweetened full fats and fruit yogurt, instead, there is a lower increase of respectively 33% and 39% CONCLUSIONS: In whole milk natural yogurt, based on our data, the proteolytic activity seems to persist during the entire period of the shelf-life and this can be considered an index of bacterial survival, especially of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during the marketing process.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus salivarius on Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  - Dental caries arises from an imbalance of metabolic activities in dental biofilms developed primarily by Streptococcus mutans. This study was conducted to isolate potential oral probiotics with antagonistic activities against S. mutans biofilm formation from Lactobacillus salivarius, frequently found in human saliva. We analysed 64 L. salivarius strains and found that two, K35 and K43, significantly inhibited S. mutans biofilm formation with inhibitory activities more pronounced than those of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), a prototypical probiotic that shows anti-caries activity. Scanning electron microscopy showed that co-culture of S. mutans with K35 or K43 resulted in significantly reduced amounts of attached bacteria and network-like structures, typically comprising exopolysaccharides. Spot assay for S. mutans indicated that K35 and K43 strains possessed a stronger bactericidal activity against S. mutans than LGG. Moreover, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression of genes encoding glucosyltransferases, gtfB, gtfC, and gtfD was reduced when S. mutans were co-cultured with K35 or K43. However, LGG activated the expression of gtfB and gtfC, but did not influence the expression of gtfD in the co-culture. A transwell-based biofilm assay indicated that these lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans biofilm formation in a contact-independent manner. In conclusion, we identified two L. salivarius strains with inhibitory activities on the growth and expression of S. mutans virulence genes to reduce its biofilm formation. This is not a general characteristic of the species, so presents a potential strategy for in vivo alteration of plaque biofilm and caries.
TI  - Propolis varnish: antimicrobial properties against cariogenic bacteria, cytotoxicity, and sustained-release profile.
AB  - Varnishes are preparations that differ in the polymeric matrix and therapeutical  agents. In dentistry they are used to prevent caries. In this study we developed a propolis varnish, considering propolis properties against cariogenic bacteria. To a chitosan polymeric base (CHV) was added ethanolic propolis extract in different concentrations: PV1 (5%), PV2 (10%), and PV3 (15%). Antimicrobial activity was carried out against Streptococcus mutans (SM), Streptococcus sanguinis (SG), Streptococcus salivarius (SS), and Lactobacillus casei (LC) through agar diffusion method. The three propolis concentrations incorporated were effective in inhibiting the growth of all microorganisms, but without significant difference between the zones of inhibition observed. Cytotoxicity assay was done by MTT method. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni test. None of the varnishes were cytotoxic, keeping 80% of viable cells, while CHV allowed cellular proliferation (120%). Sustained-release test was carried out by applying 40 mu L of each varnish in the buccal surface of bovine teeth and kept in an ethanol/water solution removed in regular times. According to the "independent model approach," the release profiles were distinct from each varnish and the most prolonged was PV3 (8 weeks). Varnish formulations had satisfactory antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria and have a low cytotoxicity (<50%).
TI  - Silver deposition on titanium surface by electrochemical anodizing process reduces bacterial adhesion of Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial properties of silver-doped titanium surfaces prepared with a novel electrochemical anodizing process. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Titanium samples were anodized with a pulsed process in a solution of silver nitrate and sodium thiosulphate at room temperature with stirring. Samples were processed with different electrolyte concentrations and treatment cycles to improve silver deposition. Physicochemical properties were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, white-light interferometry, and scanning electron microscopy. Cellular cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts was studied with lactate dehydrogenase assays. The in vitro effect of treated surfaces on two oral bacteria strains (Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus salivarius) was studied with viable bacterial adhesion measurements and growth curve assays. Nonparametric statistical Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used for multiple and paired comparisons, respectively. Post hoc Spearman's correlation tests were calculated to check the dependence between bacteria adhesion and surface properties. RESULTS: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed the presence of silver on treated samples and showed that treatments with higher silver nitrate concentration and more cycles increased the silver deposition on titanium surface. No negative effects in fibroblast cell viability were detected and a significant reduction on bacterial adhesion in vitro was achieved in silver-treated samples compared with control titanium. CONCLUSIONS: Silver deposition on titanium with a novel electrochemical anodizing process produced surfaces with significant antibacterial properties in vitro without negative effects on cell viability.
TI  - Molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old Tunisian children.
AB  - The occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old Tunisian children was investigated. Samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. All samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. Streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic DNA collected from carious lesions. Other prevalent species were Candida spp (63%), Streptococcus salivarius (59%) and Streptococcus oralis (42%). The frequency of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. Frequency of Porphyromonas endodontali, Actinomyces radicidentis and Treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. PCR analysis of genomic DNA detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. In addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (S. mutans, S. salivarius, L. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.
TI  - Poultry farm hygiene: microbiological quality assessment of drinking water used in layer chickens managed under the battery cage and deep litter systems at three poultry farms in southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Water troughs from deep litter and caged chicken water troughs (drinkers) fixed to each of the different 3-tier cages containing layer chickens in Farms A, B and C were subjected to a 7-day study which involved the monitoring of poultry farm hygiene. Drinkers were washed before filling with water on Day 1. For Days 3, 5 and 7 water was served without prior washing. The occurrence and characterization of the bacteria isolates were investigated and data obtained were analyzed and compared. For the bacterial count on Day 1, for layer chickens on cage system, no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the farms and between the farms tier interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. On Day 5, there was significant difference (p<0.05) among the farms and on Day 7, there was high significant difference (p < 0.01) among the farms. On Days 5 and 7, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) among the tiers nor between the interactions of the farms and tiers. The bacterial count in water troughs of layer chickens in deep litter system, on Day 1, had no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. On Day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. On Days 5 and 7, there were significant difference (p<0.05) and a high significant difference (p < 0.01) between the farms respectively. On Days 5 and 7, no significant differences between the water troughs and between the interaction of the farms and the water troughs. Farm A isolates contained Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermis, Klebsiella sp., Salmonella sp., Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus salivarius and Corynebacterium sp. Farm B had Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium sp., Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Klebsiella sp. while for Farm C, apart from the prevalent bacteria isolates obtained in Farms A and B, additional 2 bacterial isolates, Lactobacillus salivarius and Pseudomonas aeuriginosa were found. In conclusion, water troughs when cleaned on daily basis carry minimum bacterial load. Those left for 3, 5 and 7 days uncleaned had progressively high bacterial loads, suggesting that the flock of birds and the consumers of the eggs and meat from the chickens are at risk of bacterial infection unless strict farm hygiene is ensured through regular monitoring.
TI  - Covalent immobilization of hLf1-11 peptide on a titanium surface reduces bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation.
AB  - Bacterial infection represents a major cause of implant failure in dentistry. A common approach to overcoming this issue and treating peri-implant infection consists in the use of antibiotics. However, the rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria poses serious concerns to this strategy. A promising alternative is the use of antimicrobial peptides due to their broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and reduced bacterial resistance responses. The aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro antibacterial activity of the human lactoferrin-derived peptide hLf1-11 anchored to titanium surfaces. To this end, titanium samples were functionalized with the hLf1-11 peptide either by silanization methods or physical adsorption. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed the successful covalent attachment of the hLf1-11 peptide onto titanium surfaces. Lactate dehydrogenase assay determined that hLf1-11 peptide did not affect fibroblast viability. An outstanding reduction in the adhesion and early stages of biofilm formation of Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus salivarius was observed on the biofunctionalized surfaces compared to control non-treated samples. Furthermore, samples coated with the hLf1-11 peptide inhibited the early stages of bacterial growth. Thus, this strategy holds great potential to develop antimicrobial biomaterials for dental applications.
TI  - Biodegradable nanofibrous drug delivery systems: effects of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin on periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to fabricate biodegradable polydioxanone (PDS II(R)) electrospun periodontal drug delivery systems (hereafter referred to as matrices) containing either metronidazole (MET) or ciprofloxacin (CIP) and to investigate the effects of antibiotic incorporation on both periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fibrous matrices were processed from PDS polymer solution by electrospinning. Antibiotic-containing PDS solutions were prepared to obtain four distinct groups: 5 wt.% MET, 25 wt.% MET, 5 wt.% CIP, and 25 wt.% CIP. Pure PDS was used as a control. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was done to evaluate MET and CIP release. Dual-species biofilms formed by Lactobacillus casei (Lc) and Streptococcus salivarius (Ss) were grown on the surface of all electrospun matrices. After 4 days of biofilm growth, the viability of bacteria on biofilms was assessed. Additionally, antimicrobial properties were evaluated against periodontopathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) using agar diffusion assay. RESULTS: A three-dimensional interconnected porous network was observed in the different fabricated matrices. Pure PDS showed the highest fiber diameter mean (1,158 +/- 402 nm) followed in a descending order by groups 5 wt.% MET (1,108 +/- 383 nm), 25 wt.% MET (944 +/- 392 nm), 5 wt.% CIP (871 +/- 309 nm), and 25 wt.% CIP (765 +/- 288 nm). HPLC demonstrated that groups containing higher amounts (25 wt.%) of incorporated drugs released more over time, while those with lower levels (5 wt.%) the least. No inhibitory effect of the tested antibiotics was detected on biofilm formation by the tested commensal oral bacteria. Meanwhile, CIP-containing matrices inhibited growth of Fn and Aa. CONCLUSION: CIP-containing matrices led to a significant inhibition of periodontopathogens without negatively impairing the growth of periodontal beneficial bacteria. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Based on the proven in vitro inhibition of periodontitis-related bacteria, future in vivo research using relevant animal models is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these drug delivery systems.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (Lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal Lb strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans strains) were assayed. Also, associative cultures of Lb strains and S. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, pH, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were determined at different times. Based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed in mice with Lactobacillus gasseri CRL 1509 or Lactobacillus salivarius CRL 1328 inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with S. agalactiae. Results were analysed by ANOVA (repeated measures and general linear models). Most of the Lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of S. agalactiae strains. Only one strain (Lactobacillus reuteri CRL 1324) positively affected the aggregation of S. aureus and none increased the aggregation of C. albicans. The inhibition of the growth of S. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids by lactobacilli was evidenced. The Lb-S. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. Parallel increases in lactic acid and H2O2 levels were observed. However, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with Lb. In conclusion, vaginal Lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on S. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against S. agalactiae challenge. However, as these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of Lb against challenge with S. agalactiae.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of selected glass ionomer cements.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the paper was to determine the antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements against bacteria of the genera Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four capsulated glass ionomer cements were applied in the study: Fuji Triage (GC), Fuji IX (GC), Ketac Molar (3M Espe) and Ketac Silver (3M Espe). Four standard bacterial strains were used to assess the antibacterial activity of the studied cements: Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius and Lactobacillus casei. The antibacterial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method. The bacterial suspension was spread with a cotton swab on TSA plates. For each material six wells (7 mm diameter, 5 mm deep) were made with a cork borer. Each well was then filled with freshly prepared cements. The results were obtained by measuring the bacterial growth inhibition zone after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days. RESULTS: Fuji Triage cement inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains. Fuji IX cement demonstrated the most potent antibacterial activity against S. sanguis. Ketac Molar showed antibacterial activity against S. sanguis and S. salivarius, whereas Ketac Silver was efficient against S. mutans as well. Neither of the Ketac cements inhibited growth of the standard L. casei strain. DISCUSSION: Antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements has attracted the interest of scientists in recent years. Most authors, including us, carried out experiments using the agar diffusion method and demonstrated antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements. Different antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements, observed in our study and studies of other authors, depended on the evaluated cement, bacterial strain and period of evaluation.
TI  - Effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  - Bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) were prepared from growth of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, Escherichia coli 08, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Bacillus subtilis 168, Bacillus coagulans 185A, B. coagulans 7050, Clostridium sporogenes PA3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. The inhibitory effects of CFS on the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and Tulane virus in RAW 264.7 and LLCMK2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of CFS or after exposure of host cells to CFS. Slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and Tulane virus in the continuous presence of CFS of B. subtilis 168 and E. faecalis 19433, respectively. CFS cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. Virus persisted in the CFS that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of CFS on virions. The viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of a human beta-defensin-3 peptide on multispecies biofilms.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aggregation of mixed bacterial flora into sessile biofilms on root canal surfaces can be one of the causes of persistent apical periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3) peptide on multispecies biofilms by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. METHODS: Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis were cultured in a peptone-yeast-glucose broth, and their culture suspensions were combined in equal proportions. The mixed bacteria were inoculated on sterile coverslips placed into the wells of tissue culture plates to permit the formation of mixed species biofilm. After incubation for 3 weeks, the samples were treated for 24 hours with saline (control), saturated calcium hydroxide solution (CH), 2% chlorhexidine solution (CHX), and 50 mug/mL HBD3 solution. A commercial biofilm/viability assay kit was used to assess cell viability and analyze the 3-dimensional architecture of biofilms. The percentage of dead cells was determined from the ratio of biovolumes for the red subpopulation and the total biofilm. RESULTS: Three medication groups showed a significant reduction of biovolume within the biofilms compared with the control group (P < .001). The HBD3-treated biofilms had a higher percentage of dead cells than the other medication groups (P < .05). The CH and CHX groups showed higher levels of bactericidal activity than saline (P < .05), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: HBD3 peptide exhibited more antibacterial activity against mature multispecies biofilms in vitro than either CH or CHX.
TI  - Viability of probiotic Lactobacillus casei in yoghurt: defining the best processing step to its addition.
AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms capable of producing beneficial effects on its host when consumed in adequate amounts. To exert these effects, foods must contain probiotic microorganisms in populations above 10(6) CFU/g or mL throughout its shelf life. One of the strategies to ensure high population of probiotics in fermented milk is to add them during or after the fermentation process separately from the starter cultures. The objective of this study was to investigate the behavior of the probiotic microorganism Lactobacillus casei added to yoghurt in different stages of production. Yoghurts with L. casei were produced at different stages: before addition of starter (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), added together with this culture and at the end of fermentation. Yoghurt without probiotic added was produced as a control. The products were stored at 4 degrees C and analyzed after 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of storage. In these periods, the populations ofprobiotic and starter cultures were enumerated and the parameters pH and acidity were analyzed. The results were evaluated using analysis of variance and Tukey's test, both at 5% significance level. L. casei remained viable in populations of more than 10(8) CFU / g during 21 days of storage, which is suitable to define the formulations as probiotics. When the different stages of the addition of probiotics in yoghurts were evaluated there was no statistical difference between the formulations (p < 0.05) for populations of L. casei except for the first day of storage.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antibacterial effects of four dentine bonding systems: An in vitro study.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate and the compare antibacterial efficacy of four dentin bonding system against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus acidophilus over a period of three months using agar disk diffusion test. METHODOLOGY: All the three standard bacterial strains were inoculated into BHI broth and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. A 100 mul of broth suspension containing aliquots of S. mutans, S. salivarius and L. acidophilus were spread onto M-H agar medium using sterile cotton swabs. The experimental groups were as follows: GROUP A: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against S. mutans MTCC 497, GROUP B: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against S. salivarius MTCC 1938, and GROUP C: Test conducted for evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy against L. acidophilus MTCC 447. For sample preparation, 20 mul bonding agent was dropped with micropipettes on paper disks, and blown dry for 10 seconds. Then it was light-cured at 2 mm for 20 sec using a QTH visible light curing unit. For first reading, the sample disks were placed over the freshly inoculated agar plates and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. The rest of the paper disks were stored in dark, submerged in distilled water at 37 degrees C. They were placed on freshly inoculated spread plates after specific time intervals- 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after ageing in PBS. After incubation, the diameters of zones of inhibition around the plates were measured. The experiment was performed twice in triplicate. The data was then statistically analysed using Two way ANOVA test and post hoc. RESULTS: Results showed that Xeno III had the maximum antibacterial efficacy over a period of three months, followed by XP bond. This antibacterial activity was maximum against Streptococcus mutans, followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus and least against Streptococcus salivarius. Adper Easy One and G bond had minimal effect against the test bacteria during the test period. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effect decreased over a period of three months for all the dentin bonding systems.
TI  - Body fluid identification by integrated analysis of DNA methylation and body fluid-specific microbial DNA.
AB  - Identification of body fluids found at crime scenes provides important information that can support a link between sample donors and actual criminal acts. Previous studies have reported that DNA methylation analysis at several tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tDMRs) enables successful identification of semen, and the detection of certain bacterial DNA can allow for identification of saliva and vaginal fluid. In the present study, a method for detecting bacterial DNA was integrated into a previously reported multiplex methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-polymerase chain reaction. The developed multiplex PCR was modified by the addition of a new semen-specific marker and by including amplicons for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of saliva- and vaginal fluid-specific bacteria to improve the efficacy to detect a specific type of body fluid. Using the developed multiplex system, semen was distinguishable by unmethylation at the USP49, DACT1, and PFN3 tDMRs and by hypermethylation at L81528, and saliva could be identified by detection of saliva-specific bacteria, Veillonella atypica and/or Streptococcus salivarius. Additionally, vaginal fluid and menstrual blood were differentiated from other body fluids by hypomethylation at the PFN3 tDMR and the presence of vaginal fluid-specific bacteria, Lactobacillus crispatus and/or Lactobacillus gasseri. Because the developed multiplex system uses the same biological source of DNA for individual identification profiling and simultaneously analyses various types of body fluid in one PCR reaction, this method will facilitate more efficient body fluid identification in forensic casework.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic growth effects of Lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  - As lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. However, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. The antagonistic growth effects of Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. Both Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. The higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. The inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. Moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, Lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than Lactobacillus salivarius. However, the fermentative broth of Lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of Lactobacillus salivarius. These data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.
TI  - Analysis of cariogenic bacteria in saliva of cancer patients.
AB  - This study examined salivary flow and salivary pH and the prevalence and levels of cariogenic bacteria in the saliva of oncological patients and healthy controls. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the levels of microbes including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus acidophilus in the saliva of 41 patients with a solid tumor (SO), 30 patients with a hematologic malignancy (HE), and 40 healthy controls. Salivary flow and pH were lower in oncological patients than in controls. The frequencies of all four cariogenic bacteria were highest in the SO group. S. mutans and L. salivarius were the most commonly detected in all three study groups. Mean numbers of S. sobrinus and L. salivarius in the SO group were significantly higher than in controls (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between patients and controls with respect to mean numbers of S. mutans and L. acidophilus in saliva. However, the proportions of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and L. salivarius versus total bacteria in the SO group were significantly higher than in controls. Within patients, both mean numbers and the proportions of S. mutans and S. sobrinus were significantly different (p<0.05). In summary, significant differences were found in salivary pH values and the levels of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, and L. salivarius between SO patients and healthy controls.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic (Allium sativum) extract on dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allium sativum, commonly known as garlic, exhibits antibacterial effects against a wide range of bacteria. AIM: The objective of this in vitro study was to assess the antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic extract against human dental plaque microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial activities of four different concentrations of garlic extract (5%, 10%, 20%, and 100%) were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lactobacillus spp. using the disk diffusion method. Papers soaked in 0.2% concentration chlorhexidine gluconate and saline were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The data were subjected to one-way ANOVA and the Tukey multiple comparisons test at a 5% significance level. RESULTS: All bacterial strains were inhibited by all test materials. The inhibition zones of the different concentrations of garlic extract were not significantly different for S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius. For P. aeruginosa and lactobacillus spp. the inhibition zones of 5%, 10% and 20% concentrations were not significantly different from one another, but they were significantly more than that of the 100% extract. CONCLUSION: The 5%, 10%, 20%, and 100% concentrations of garlic extract had similar effects, so further studies seem to be indicated on the usefulness of the 5% extract.
TI  - Effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. Bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy agar (TSA) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. The autofluorescence was then assessed at 405 nm excitation. On the TSA without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. On the TSA containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from Parvimonas micra. When the TSA was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin K, red autofluorescence was observed from Actinomyces naeslundii, Bifidobacterium dentium, and Streptococcus mutans. Finally, on the TSA supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, A. naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus salivarius, S. mutans, and Veillonella parvula. We conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. The autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.
TI  - Effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: A bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients may be modulated by probiotics. We assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic IBS symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating IBS symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), where appropriate. The random-effects model was employed in cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. RESULTS: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. Probiotics improved pain scores if they contained Bifidobacterium breve (SMD, - 0.34; 95% CI, - 0.66; -0.02), Bifidobacterium longum (SMD, -0.48; 95% CI, - 0.91; -0.06), or Lactobacillus acidophilus (SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.61; -0.01) species. Distension scores were improved by probiotics containing B. breve (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.77; -0.13), Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.00; -0.06) species. All probiotic species tested improved flatulence: B. breve (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.75;- 0.10), B. infantis, L. casei, L. plantarum (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -1.07; -0.13), B. longum, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.01; -0.21). There was not a clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for IBS patients, and the effects on each IBS symptom are likely species-specific. Future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.
TI  - Assessment of the susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria to biocides.
AB  - Biocides are antimicrobial compounds that are widely used in the food industry and medical environments. In this study, we determined the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) by the microdilution method of four different biocides for a large collection of LAB of different origins. The tested isolates belong to 11 species of the Lactobacillus genus and to Streptococcus thermophilus, Streptococcus salivarius and Lactococcus garvieae. The results obtained in this study indicate that low susceptibilities to benzalkonium chloride (BC), triclosan (Tr), chlorhexidine (Ch), and sodium hypochlorite (SH) are not frequent among LAB. Moreover, no systematic co-tolerance between two or more tested biocides was found; that is, strains displaying high MIC values and thus low sensitivity to one of the biocides did not show higher MIC values for the other biocides.
TI  - Influence of the probiotic Streptococcus salivarius strain M18 on indices of dental health in children: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - The prevalence of dental caries continues to increase, and novel strategies to reverse this trend appear necessary. The probiotic Streptococcus salivarius strain M18 offers the potential to confer oral health benefits as it produces bacteriocins targeting the important cariogenic species Streptococcus mutans, as well as the enzymes dextranase and urease, which could help reduce dental plaque accumulation and acidification, respectively. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 100 dental caries-active children, treatment with M18 was administered for 3 months and the participants were assessed for changes to their plaque score and gingival and soft-tissue health and to their salivary levels of S. salivarius, S. mutans, lactobacilli, beta-haemolytic streptococci and Candida species. At treatment end, the plaque scores were significantly (P = 0.05) lower for children in the M18-treated group, especially in subjects having high initial plaque scores. The absence of any significant adverse events supported the safety of the probiotic treatment. Cell-culture analyses of sequential saliva samples showed no differences between the probiotic and placebo groups in counts of the specifically enumerated oral micro-organisms, with the exception of the subgroup of the M18-treated children who appeared to have been colonized most effectively with M18. This subgroup exhibited reduced S. mutans counts, indicating that the anti-caries activity of M18 probiotic treatments may be enhanced if the efficiency of colonization is increased. It was concluded that S. salivarius M18 can provide oral health benefits when taken regularly.
TI  - A defined-multispecies microbial model for studying enamel caries development.
AB  - The aims of this study were to describe and validate an in vitro multispecies microbial biofilm model for caries development by evaluating the effects of varying medium concentration of sucrose (0.5 and 1.0%) and fluoride (0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 ppm F) in study 1, and calcium (1.0 and 2.0 mM Ca) in study 2. Defined-multispecies biofilms, formed by Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, were grown on the surface of salivary-pellicle-coated enamel slabs, with known baseline surface hardness; growth medium was changed daily. Counts of viable cells on biofilms and the percentage of surface microhardness change (%SMC), lesion depth (LD) and integrated mineral loss (IML) on enamel slabs were assessed after 4 days of biofilm formation under the tested conditions. Counts of viable cells on biofilms were significantly affected by sucrose, fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.05). There was a decrease in %SMC in response to increased fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.001). Lower IML (p < 0.001) and LD (p < 0.05) were found in the presence of 0.8 and 1.0 ppm F. A negative correlation was found between the response variables (%SMC, LD and IML) and fluoride and calcium concentrations. The results suggest that the microbial caries model developed was able to show distinct levels of caries inhibition in response to fluoride and calcium concentrations, corroborating clinical observations. An effect of sucrose concentration on caries development was found only in the presence of the lowest fluoride concentration.
TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics in preventing episodes of acute otitis media in high-risk children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested that probiotics (proB) and/or prebiotics (preB) could reduce the burden of infection in infants and toddlers. We aimed to determine whether follow-up formula supplemented with proB and preB could reduce the risk of acute otitis media (AOM). METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from November 2007 to April 2009, 37 pediatricians in France enrolled children 7 to 13 months of age with high risk of AOM who were randomly assigned to receive follow-up formula supplemented with proB (Streptococcus thermophilus NCC 2496, Streptococcus salivarius DSM 13084, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LPR CGMCC 1.3724) and preB (Raftilose/Raftiline) or follow-up formula alone (placebo). During 12 months, the 2 groups were compared for number of AOM episodes diagnosed (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes by the Poisson model (incidence rate ratio [IRR]) or logistic regression (odds ratio; and 95% confidence interval [95% CI]) after adjustment on covariates of interest. RESULTS: We enrolled 224 children (112 in each group). All children were vaccinated (4 doses) with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; demographic characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. In total, 486 AOM episodes were reported, 249 and 237 in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The treatment and control groups did not differ in incidence of AOM (IRR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.2), lower respiratory tract infections (IRR 0.9, 0.7-1.2) or number of antibiotic treatment courses (IRR = 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.2). Treatment was not associated with recurrent AOM (odds ratio 1.0, 95% CI: 0.5-1.7). With regard to gastrointestinal disorders, both formulas were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The proB and preB included in follow-up formula given to children at 7 to 13 months of age did not reduce the risk of AOM, recurrent AOM, antibiotic use or lower respiratory tract infections at 1 year.
TI  - In-vitro activity of saponins of bauhinia purpurea, madhuca longifolia, celastrus paniculatus and semecarpus anacardium on selected oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dental caries, periodontitis and other mucosal diseases are caused by  a complex community of microorganisms. This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial properties of saponins of four important oil yielding medicinal plant extracts on selected oral pathogens that are involved in such diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Saponins were extracted from Bauhinia purpurea, Madhuca longifolia, Celastrus paniculatus and Semecarpus anacardium and purified. Antimicrobial properties of these saponins against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus were determined using well diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration of saponins inhibiting bacterial growth after 14 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The bactericidal activity was evaluated using the viable cell count method. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of Madhuca longifolia saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Streptococcus mitis and Staphylococcus aureus was 18.3 +/- 0.15/34.4 +/- 0.24 mug/ml, 19.0 +/- 0.05/32.2 +/- 0.0 mug/ml and 21.2 +/- 0.35/39.0 +/- 0.30 mug/ml, respectively and Bauhinia purpurea saponin on Streptococcus mutans MTCC 890, Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus acidophilus was 26.4 +/- 0.20/43.0 +/- 0.40 mug/ml, 29.0 +/- 0.30/39.6 +/- 0.12 mug/ml and 20.2 +/- 0.05/36.8 +/- 0.23 mug/ml, respectively. CONCLUSION: The strong antimicrobial activity of Madhuca longifolia and Bauhinia purpurea may be due to the presence of complex triterpenoid saponins, oleanane type triterpenoid glycosides or atypical pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin. Hence, these extracted saponins may be used in food and oral products to prevent and control oral diseases.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of mouth washes and herbal products against dental biofilm-forming bacteria.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate in vitro, the antimicrobial effect of Cymbopogon citrates (lemon grass), Plectranthusamboinicus (Mexican mint) and Conyzabonariensis (hairy fleabane) tinctures as well as pure and diluted commercial mouth washes (Malvatricin((R)), Periogard((R)) and Listerine((R))) on wild isolates of Streptococcusmutans and reference strains of S. mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis and Lactobacillus casei by determination of minimum inhibitory dilution (MID). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 0.12% chlorhexidine and 70% corn alcohol were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Saliva samples were collected from 3 volunteers and seeded in MSB broth to obtain Streptococcus isolates after 72-hour incubation. Using the agar diffusion method, susceptibility tests were performed with overnight incubation in microaerophilia at 37 degrees C. All tests were performed in duplicate. RESULTS: The bacterial species were resistant to the tinctures and Listerine((R)), but were susceptible to 0.12% chlorhexidine, Malvatricin((R)) and Periogard((R)), with MIDs ranging from 12.5% to 1.56%. CONCLUSIONS: Plectrantusamboinicus, Conyzabonariensis and Cymbopongoncitratus tinctures and Listerine((R)) did not show inhibitory action against the tested biofilm-forming bacteria.
TI  - Bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy Ethiopian infants.
AB  - The objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from faecal samples of healthy Ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. One hundred fifty LAB were obtained from 28 healthy Ethiopian infants. The isolates belonged to Lactobacillus (81/150), Enterococcus (54/150) and Streptococcus (15/150) genera. Lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while Enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. Bacteriocin-producing LAB species were isolated from eight of the infants. Many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from Streptococcus salivarius, avicin A (class IIa) from Enterococcus avium, one class IIa bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from E. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from Lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin T from Lactobacillus gasseri isolate. Susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. The streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. All enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. Only one E. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. Tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to E. faecalis (47 %) and Enterococcus faecium (33 %). Screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. The structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being E. faecalis and Enterococcus raffinosus. This study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal LAB of Ethiopian infants while virulence factors occur at low levels.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly Irish subjects.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms Lactobacillus bulgaricus LMG 6901 and Listeria innocua DPC 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. Genomic fingerprinting following ApaI digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. The antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. The predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus and Enterococcus spp. A number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including ABP-118 and salivaricin B (from Lact. salivarius), enterocin B (Enterococcus faecium), lactacin B (Lact. acidophilus), gassericin T and a variant of gassericin A (Lact. gasseri), were identified. Interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: Lactococcus lactis producing nisin Z and Streptococcus mutans producing mutacin II. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
TI  - Reduced salivary flow and colonization by mutans streptococci in children with Down syndrome.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although individuals with Down syndrome have considerable oral disease, the prevalence of dental caries in this group is low. The present study aimed to compare known risk factors for dental caries development in children with Down syndrome and a matched population (siblings). In both populations, the number of acidogenic microorganisms, such as mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and Candida species, and the paraffin-stimulated pH, flow rate and IgA concentration in whole saliva were evaluated and compared. METHOD: Saliva was collected, and the caries index was evaluated in 45 sibling pairs aged between 6 and 18 years old. The salivary IgA concentration was determined by immunoturbidimetry. Salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and Candida species were quantified on mitis salivarius agar containing bacitracin and 20% sucrose, rogosa agar supplemented with glacial acetic acid and sabouraud agar supplemented with chloramphenicol, respectively. RESULTS: Down syndrome children had a higher caries-free rate (p<0.05) and lower salivary mutans streptococci counts (p<0.03) compared to their siblings. Similar numbers of lactobacilli and Candida species were found in both groups. Salivary flow rates were 36% lower in Down syndrome children compared to their siblings (p<0.05). The salivary pH did not differ between Down syndrome children and controls. The Down syndrome children had an IgA secretion rate 29% lower than that of their siblings, but this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the lower number of mutans streptococci in the saliva may be one of the factors contributing to the lower caries rate observed in Down syndrome children, despite evidence of hyposalivation.
TI  - Purification and genetic characterisation of the novel bacteriocin LS2 produced by the human oral strain Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, a human oral strain with probiotic characteristics and a broad inhibitory spectrum both against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Here we present the bacteriocin LS2, an extremely pH- and heat-stable peptide with antilisterial activity. LS2 is a novel member of the class IId bacteriocins, unique among all currently characterised bacteriocins. It is somewhat similar to putative bacteriocins from several oral streptococci, including the cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. LS2 is a 41-amino-acid, highly hydrophobic cationic peptide of 4115.1Da that is sensitive to proteolytic enzymes. LS2 was purified from cells of strain BGHO1 by solvent extraction and reverse-phase chromatography. Mass spectrometry was used to determine the molecular mass of the purified peptide. N-terminal amino acid sequencing enabled identification of the LS2 structural gene bacls2 by a reverse genetics approach. Downstream of the bacls2 gene, two bacteriocin-like genes were found, named blp1a and blp1b, and one putative bacteriocin immunity gene named bimlp. We also present the identification of the 242-kb megaplasmid pMPHO1 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which harbours the genes bacls2, blp1a, blp1b and bimlp. Two peptides with antimicrobial activity, whose approximate sizes corresponded to those of blp1a and blp1b, were identified only after culturing strain BGHO1 in a chemically defined medium. This study demonstrated the capacity of Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1 to produce multiple bacteriocins and further established this strain as a promising probiotic candidate.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of Thai oral streptococci, lactobacilli and pediococci.
AB  - This work was to assess the isolation and identification of Thai oral bacteria. Seventeen viridans group streptococci (VGS) and seventeen lactic acid bacteria from saliva were characterization based on their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics and the 16S RNA gene sequences analysis. The Gram-positive cocci in chains of viridans group comprised of six isolates (Group I) were identified as Streptococcus gordonii, 6 isolates (Group II) were Streptococcus salivarius, 4 isolates (Group III) were Streptococcus sanguis and one isolate (Group IV) was Streptococcus mutans. Seventeen lactic acid bacterial isolates were Gram-positive and catalase negative. They did not contained diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan. They were divided into four groups, the rod-shaped in Group A (11 isolates) and Group B (2 isolates) which were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus salivarius, respectively. The tetrad-forming cocci in Group C (3 isolates) and Group D (1 isolate) were identified as Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus, respectively.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial comparison of chlorhexidine, persica mouthwash and miswak  extract.
AB  - AIM: Herbal mouthwashes, such as persica (Salvadora persica, mint and yarrow extracts) and miswak extract have been shown to decrease gingival inflammation and plaque accumulation. The aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activities of persica and miswak extract with the conventional mouthwash chlorhexidine against Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus vulgaris and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, blood-agar culture (Merk, Germany) was used to grow the streptococcus strains, saburd-dextrose culture (Merk, Germany) was used to grow C. albicans and MRS-agar was used to grow L. vulgaris. Various concentrations of these substances (0.1, 0.05 and 0.025% of miswak extract, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025 and 0.0125% of persica, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.025% of chlorhexidine) were added to paper disks, separately, inserted into culture plates and transferred into the incubator. The inhibition zone around each disk was measured after 24 hours and the data was analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: Chlorhexidine possessed antibacterial activity at all concentrations tested. It was more effective than persica and miswak at all concentrations on S. salivarius (p = 0.022 for 0.1%, 0.009 for 0.05 and 0.025%). It had greater effect than the other two tested material on S.sanguis only at concentration 0.01%. Chlorhexidine was the most effective against S.salivarius; persica was the most effective against Lactobacillus (p = 0.005) and the least effective against S. salivarius; and miswak extract was the most effective against S. salivarius and S. sanguis at concentrations 0.1 and 0.05% (p = 0.005) and ineffective against L. vulgaris. None of these mouthwashes were effective against C. albicans. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that chlorhexidine remains the gold standard as an antimicrobial agent, although herbal based mouthwashes do have marginal antimicrobial activities. It is necessary to conduct more clinical and microbiological studies focusing on periodontal pathogens and anaerobic microorganisms. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Mechanical plaque control is the main way for periodontal disease prevention and mouthrinses are used to improve its efficacy. Based on the results of this study, chlorhexidine has the most antibacterial effect and although persica mouthwash and miswak are routinely used in some Asian countries their antibacterial efficacies are suspected.
TI  - In vitro functional and immunomodulatory properties of the Lactobacillus helveticus MIMLh5-Streptococcus salivarius ST3 association that are relevant to the development of a pharyngeal probiotic product.
AB  - The use of proper bacterial strains as probiotics for the pharyngeal mucosa is a  potential prophylactic strategy for upper respiratory tract infections. In this context, we characterized in vitro the functional and immunomodulatory properties of the strains Lactobacillus helveticus MIMLh5 and Streptococcus salivarius ST3 that were selected during previous investigations as promising pharyngeal probiotics. In this study, we demonstrated in vitro that strains MIMLh5 and ST3, alone and in combination, can efficiently adhere to pharyngeal epithelial cells, antagonize Streptococcus pyogenes, and modulate host innate immunity by inducing potentially protective effects. In particular, we found that the strains MIMLh5 and ST3 activate U937 human macrophages by significantly inducing the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Nonetheless, the induction of the anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) by MIMLh5 or ST3 was never lower than that of TNF-alpha, suggesting that these bacteria can potentially exert a regulatory rather than a proinflammatory effect. We also found that the strains MIMLh5 and ST3 induce cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression and demonstrated that toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) participates in the recognition of the strains MIMLh5 and ST3 by U937 cells. Finally, we observed that these microorganisms grow efficiently when cocultured in milk, suggesting that the preparation of a milk-based fermented product containing both MIMLh5 and ST3 can be a practical solution for the administration of these bacteria. In conclusion, we propose the combined use of L. helveticus MIMLh5 and S. salivarius ST3 for the preparation of novel products that display probiotic properties for the pharyngeal mucosa.
TI  - The influence of probiotic treatment on sulfasalazine metabolism in rat.
AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms claimed to exert beneficial effects on the host. This study investigated their effect on the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of sulfasalazine (SSZ), a drug whose efficacy depends on metabolism by azoreductase (AR) in the gut microbiota to sulfapyridine (SP) and 5-acetylsalicylic acid (5-ASA). The probiotic strains Lactobacillus acidophilus L10, Bifidobacterium lactis B94 and Streptococcus salivarius K12 possessed AR activity and a corresponding ability to metabolize SSZ. Treatment of male Wistar rats (n = 5) with oral 2 g doses of a mixture of the three probiotics (total dose 1.8 x 10(9) cfu) every 12 h for 3 days resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in AR activity in ex vivo colon contents with a corresponding increase in SSZ metabolism. Similar probiotic treatment of male Wistar rats (n = 8) followed by an oral 100 mg/kg dose of SSZ produced high plasma levels of SP, but pharmacokinetic parameters of SSZ and SP were not significantly different from control rats given SSZ. These results indicate that probiotic strains possess AR activity and can metabolize SSZ. Treatment with probiotics increases AR activity in the gut microbiota but has no effect on plasma levels of SSZ and SP following a subsequent oral dose of SSZ.
TI  - Development of a multispecies biofilm community by four root canal bacteria.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The development of multispecies biofilm models are needed to explain the interactions that take place in root canal biofilms during apical periodontitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to establish a multispecies biofilm community and to characterize the main structural, compositional, and physiological features of this community. METHODS: Four clinical isolates isolated from infected root canals, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus gordonii, and Enterococcus faecalis, were grown together in a miniflow cell system. Simultaneous detection of the 4 species in the biofilm communities was achieved by fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with confocal microscopy at different time points. The LIVE/DEAD BacLight technique (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) was used to assess cell viability and to calculate 3-dimensional architectural parameters such as biovolume (mum(3)). Redox fluorescence dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride was used to assess the metabolic activity of biofilm bacteria. RESULTS: The 4 species tested were able to form stable and reproducible biofilm communities. The biofilms formed in rich medium generally showed continuous growth over time, however, in the absence of glucose biofilms showed significantly smaller biovolumes. A high proportion of viable cells (>90%) were generally observed, and biofilm growth was correlated with high metabolic activity of cells. The community structure of biofilms formed in rich medium did not change considerably over the 120-hour period, during which E. faecalis, L. salivarius, and S. gordonii were most abundant. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of 4 root canal bacteria to form multispecies biofilm communities shown in this study give insights into assessing the community lifestyle of these microorganisms in vivo. This multispecies model could be useful for further research simulating stresses representative of in vivo conditions.
TI  - Effect of oral bacteria on the mechanical behavior of titanium dental implants.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study sought to determine whether the mechanical properties of titanium dental implants changed after exposure to bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two strains of bacteria (Streptococcus sanguinis and Lactobacillus salivarius) were used in the study. The adhesive properties of the two strains were investigated as follows. Titanium implants were placed in bacteria broth, seeded with the two bacteria strains, and left in the broth for 1 or 3 months. Another group of titanium implants was immersed in artificial saliva at 37 degrees C for 3 months. Ten implants in each group were tested in 37 degrees C artificial saliva to evaluate their mechanical flexural strength and fatigue life. RESULTS: The bacterial cultures grew quickly on titanium surfaces. After 1 month of bacteria culture in vitro, the bacteria had produced corrosion pits on the titanium surfaces. After 3 months of bacterial culture, a 7% decrease in the flexural strength of the implant samples and a decrease of 15% in the number of cycles to failure by fatigue were seen versus implants not exposed to bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that, in physiologic conditions in vitro, bacteria have the capacity to produce a pitting corrosion phenomenon on exposed titanium surfaces, leading to a significant deterioration in the mechanical properties of the implant. It is therefore logical to conclude that bacteria may produce corrosion that reduces the useful life of dental implants.
TI  - Streptococci-human papilloma virus interaction with ethanol exposure leads to keratinocyte damage.
AB  - PURPOSE: Ethanol, human papilloma virus (HPV), and poor oral hygiene are risk factors that have been attributed to oral carcinogenesis. Streptococci sp and HPV infections are common in the head and neck, often associated with sexual activity. Although HPV is linked to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, it is unclear whether there is a similar role for Streptococci sp. This cell study examines whether Streptococci sp and HPV-16 with exposure to ethyl alcohol (ETOH) can act as cofactors in the malignant transformation of oral keratinocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ETOH (0.1%-20% vol/vol) was used to investigate Streptococci sp attachment with immortalized E6-expressing HPV/HOK-16B cells, human oral buccal keratinocytes, and foreskin keratinocytes. Streptococci sp (Streptococci mutans [LT11]) and various strains of acetaldehyde (AA) producer and nonproducer Streptococcus salivarius (110-1, 109-2, 101-7, and 107-1) and a lactic acid producer bacterium, Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24-1 and 25-2), were examined for interactions with keratinocytes by use of a green dye (percent of cells with colonies after 24 hours). Carcinogens, AA, malondialdehyde, DNA damage, and proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine) among keratinocytes were also quantified. RESULTS: AA and malondialdehyde production from permissible Streptococci sp significantly increased with attachment to keratinocytes, whereas L rhamnosus did not significantly attach to keratinocytes. This attachment was associated with enhanced levels of AA adduct formation, proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation), and enhanced migration through integrin-coated basement membrane by HPV oral keratinocytes, which are characteristics of a malignant phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: These cell studies suggest that oral Streptococci sp and HPV (HPV-16) cooperate to transform oral keratinocytes after low-level ETOH (1%) exposure. These results appear to suggest a significant clinical interaction, but further validation is warranted.
TI  - Identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against Campylobacter.
AB  - Bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control Campylobacter and Salmonella in live poultry. This finding is of relevance since Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. In the present work, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the cecum of twenty Tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against Campylobacter were further characterized. Following their preliminary confirmation as LAB, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16S- 23S PCR, specific lactobacilli PCR, and a biphasic approach. Most of the LAB isolated belonged to the genus Lactobacillus, among them Lb. sakei (33.3%), Lb. salivarius (19.4%), Lb. reuteri (8.6%), and Lb. curvatus (8.6%). The other LAB strains included those of the genus Weissella (16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), Lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and Streptococcus sp. (2.7%). The Lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against C. jejuni and C. coli. The activity of three of them, Lb. salivarius SMXD51, Lb. salivarius MMS122, and Lb. salivarius MMS151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of punica granatum peel extracts against  oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Punica granatum has been used for many years in folk medicine due to several purposes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of methanolic extract of Punica granatum peel (MEPGP) against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Actynomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Candida albicans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, the mentioned oral organisms were cultured in blood agar and mueller-hinton media and then paper disks containing MEPGP at concentrations of 4 mg/ml, 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml were inserted on medias. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar disk diffusion method. The effects of three different concentrations of MEPGP against microorganisms were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. RESULTS: All concentrations of MEPGP had antibacterial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Only at concentration of 8 mg/ml and 12 mg/ml MEPGP was effective against L. acidophilus, S. mutans and S. salivarius. Furthermore; no concentrations of MEPGP inhibited A. viscosus and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that MEPGP might be used as an antibacterial agent in controlling oral infections.
TI  - Lactic Acid bacteria enriched from human gastric biopsies.
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to check if viable bacteria, in particular lactic acid bacteria (LAB), could be enriched from biopsies obtained from healthy gastroscopy patients. Gastric biopsies were obtained from 13 gastroscopy patients and subjected to an anaerobic or microaerophilic enrichment procedure utilizing the Portable Microbe Enrichment Unit (PMEU). Profuse microbial growth was observed in most cases. Samples plated on MRS showed high numbers of LAB. The most common species characterized were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lact. salivarius, and Streptococcus salivarius. The results demonstrate a continuous presence of viable LAB in healthy stomach. The species are similar to those traditionally used in food applications. The gastric LAB strains could have a potential in developing probiotic foods aimed specially on the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Production of multiple bacteriocins from a single locus by gastrointestinal strains of Lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  - Bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus salivarius isolates derived from a gastrointestinal origin have previously demonstrated efficacy for in vivo protection against Listeria monocytogenes infection. In this study, comparative genomic analysis was employed to investigate the intraspecies diversity of seven L. salivarius isolates of human and porcine intestinal origin, based on the genome of the well-characterized bacteriocin-producing strain L. salivarius UCC118. This revealed a highly conserved megaplasmid-borne gene cluster in these strains involved in the regulation and secretion of two-component class IIb bacteriocins. However, considerable intraspecific variation was observed in the structural genes encoding the bacteriocin peptides. They ranged from close relatives of abp118, such as salivaricin P, which differs by 2 amino acids, to completely novel bacteriocins, such as salivaricin T, which is characterized in this study. Salivaricin T inhibits closely related lactobacilli and bears little homology to previously characterized salivaricins. Interestingly, the two peptides responsible for salivaricin T activity, SalTalpha and SalTbeta, share considerable identity with the component peptides of thermophilin 13, a bacteriocin produced by Streptococcus thermophilus. Furthermore, the salivaricin locus of strain DPC6488 also encodes an additional novel one-component class IId anti-listerial bacteriocin, salivaricin L. These findings suggest a high level of redundancy in the bacteriocins that can be produced by intestinal L. salivarius isolates using the same enzymatic production and export machinery. Such diversity may contribute to their ability to dominate and compete within the complex microbiota of the mammalian gut.
TI  - Clinical use of photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy for the treatment of deep carious lesions.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) via irradiation, using a low power laser associated with a photosensitization dye, as an alternative to remove cariogenic microorganisms by drilling. Remaining dentinal samples in deep carious lesions on permanent molars (n = 26) were treated with 0.01% methylene blue dye and irradiated with a low power laser (InGaAIP - indium gallium aluminum phosphide; lambda = 660 nm; 100 mW; 320 Jcm(-2); 90 s; 9J). Samples of dentin from the pulpal wall region were collected with a micropunch before and immediately after PACT and kept in a transport medium for microbiological analysis. Samples were cultured in plates of Brucella blood agar, Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin agar and Rogosa SL agar to determine the total viable bacteria, mutans streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. counts, respectively. After incubation, colony-forming units were counted and microbial reduction was calculated for each group of bacteria. PACT led to statistically significant reductions in mutans streptococci (1.38 log), Lactobacillus spp. (0.93 log), and total viable bacteria (0.91 log). This therapy may be an appropriate approach for the treatment of deep carious lesions using minimally invasive procedures.
TI  - A comparative evaluation of probiotics on salivary mutans streptococci counts in  Indian children.
AB  - AIM: Probiotics and their effect on oral health have been a focus of numerous trials in recent times. No documented trials have been reported from developing countries such as India with its focus on probiotic use, especially in the paediatric population. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of probiotics on salivary mutans streptococci (MS) counts of children using the two commercially and widely available preparations and to explore their anti-caries potential. STUDY DESIGN: A placebo controlled study was undertaken with 3 parallel arms comprising a total of 150 healthy children (7-14 years). The subjects were randomly divided into the groups (each comprising 50 children): group A - placebo powder, Group B - a freeze dried powdered combination of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium species, Group C - a freeze dried powdered preparation of Bacillus coagulans. The subjects were instructed to mix the preparation in 20 ml of water and to follow a swish and swallow method for 14 days. Mutans streptococci colony counts per ml of saliva were performed on Mitis-Salivarius Bacitracin agar collected on the first day and 14 days post-intervention. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction (p<0.001) in salivary mutans streptococci counts was recorded in both groups B and C after 14 days of probiotic ingestion. CONCLUSION: A cost-effective probiotic such as Bacillus coagulans might be a subject for further research for prevention of caries in children.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus fermentum (195), Lactobacillus salivarius (53), Lactobacillus casei (20), Lactobacillus gasseri (18), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), Lactobacillus paracasei (12), Lactobacillus mucosae (12), Lactobacillus oris (12), Lactobacillus plantarum (11) and Lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. Inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. Most oral Lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. The strongest inhibitory activity was associated with Lact. paracasei, Lact. plantarum, Lact. rhamnosus, Lact. casei and Lact. salivarius. Lactobacillus SD1-SD6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 in the biofilm model. Also, it was demonstrated that growth of Strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with Lact. paracasei SD1. The inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. CONCLUSIONS: The results have shown that oral Lactobacillus SD1-SD6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against Strep. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, Gram-negative periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results indicated that Lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.
TI  - Some low homogenization pressures improve certain probiotic characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-K.
AB  - Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus are dairy cultures widely used in the manufacture of cultured dairy products. Commonly used homogenization pressures in the dairy industry are 13.80 MPa or less. It is not known whether low homogenization pressures can stimulate bacteria to improve their probiotic characteristics. Objectives were to determine the effect of homogenization at 0, 3.45, 6.90, 10.34, and 13.80 MPa on acid tolerance, bile tolerance, protease activity, and growth of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12, S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus ST-M5, and L. acidophilus LA-K. The cultures were individually inoculated in cool autoclaved skim milk (4 degrees C) and homogenized for 5 continuous passes. Growth and bile tolerance of samples were determined hourly for 10h of incubation. Acid tolerance was determined every 20 min for 120 min of incubation. Protease activity was determined at 0, 12, and 24h of incubation. All homogenization pressures studied improved acid tolerance of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LB-12 but had no beneficial effect on protease activity and had negative effects on growth and bile tolerance. A pressure of 6.90 MPa improved acid tolerance, bile tolerance, and protease activity of S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus ST-M5, but none of the homogenization pressures studied had an effect on its growth. Homogenization pressures of 13.80 and 6.90 MPa improved acid tolerance and bile tolerance, respectively, of L. acidophilus LA-K but had no effect on protease activity and its growth. Some low homogenization pressures positively influenced some characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and L. acidophilus LA-K. Culture pretreatment with some low homogenization pressures can be recommended for improvement of certain probiotic characteristics.
TI  - In situ analysis of multispecies biofilm formation on customized titanium surfaces.
AB  - Many studies to identify surfaces that enhance the incorporation of dental implants into bone and soft-tissue have been undertaken previously. However, to succeed in the clinical situation, an implant surface must not support development of microbial biofilms with a pathogenic potential. As a first step in investigating this, we used two-species and three-species biofilm models with 16S ribosomal RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the effect of surface characteristics on biofilm formation by species that can colonize titanium implants in vivo: Streptococcus sanguinis, Actinomyces naeslundii and Lactobacillus salivarius. Surfaces blasted with Al(2) O(3) (S(a) = 1.0-2.0 mum) showed a seven-fold higher bacterial adhesion after 2 h than turned surfaces (S(a) = 0.18 mum) whereas porous surfaces, generated by anodic oxidation (S(a) = 0.4 mum), showed four-fold greater adhesion than turned surfaces. Hence, increased roughness promoted adhesion, most likely through protection of bacteria from shear forces. Chemical modification of the blasted and oxidized surfaces by incorporation of Ca(2+) ions reduced adhesion compared with the corresponding non-modified surfaces. After 14 h, biofilm growth occurred in the three-species model but not in the two-species consortium (containing S. sanguinis and A. naeslundii only). The biofilm biovolume on all surfaces was similar, suggesting that the influence of surface characteristics on adhesion was compensated for by biofilm development.
TI  - Oral microflora in infants delivered vaginally and by caesarean section.
AB  - BACKGROUND. Early in life, vaginally delivered infants exhibit a different composition of the gut flora compared with infants delivered by caesarean section (C-section); however, it is unclear whether this also applies to the oral cavity. AIM. To investigate and compare the oral microbial profile between infants delivered vaginally and by C-section. DESIGN. This is a cross-sectional case-control study. Eighty-four infants delivered either vaginally (n = 42) or by C-section (n = 42) were randomly selected from the 2009 birth cohort at the County Hospital in Halmstad, Sweden. Medically compromised and premature children (<32 weeks) were excluded. The mean age was 8.25 months (range 6-10 months), and parents were asked to complete a questionnaire on socioeconomic factors, lifestyle, and hygiene habits. Saliva was collected and analysed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS. A higher prevalence of salivary Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus curvata, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacuillus casei was detected in infants delivered vaginally (P < 0.05). The caries-associated bacteria Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were detected in 63% and 59% of all children, respectively. CONCLUSION. A significantly higher prevalence of certain strains of health-related streptococci and lactobacilli was found in vaginally delivered infants compared with infants delivered by C-section. The possible long-term effects on oral health need to be further investigated.
TI  - Metabolism of L-selenomethionine and selenite by probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - Since selenium supplements have been shown to undergo biotransformation in the gut, probiotic treatment in combination with selenium supplements may change selenium disposition. We investigated the metabolism of L-selenomethionine (SeMet) and selenite by probiotic bacteria in vitro and the disposition of selenium after probiotic treatment followed by oral dosing with SeMet and selenite in rats. When SeMet was incubated anaerobically with individual antibiotic-resistant probiotic strains (Streptococcus salivarius K12, Lactobacillus rhamnosus 67B, Lactobacillus acidophilus L10, and Bifidobacterium lactis LAFTI(R) B94) at 37 degrees C for 24 h, 11-18% was metabolized with 44-80% of SeMet lost being converted to dimethyldiselenide (DMDSe) and dimethylselenide (DMSe). In similar incubations with selenite, metabolism was more extensive (26-100%) particularly by the lactobacilli with 0-4.8% of selenite lost being converted to DMSe and DMDSe accompanied by the formation of elemental selenium. Four groups of rats (n = 5/group) received a single oral dose of either SeMet or selenite (2 mg selenium/kg) at the time of the last dose of a probiotic mixture or its vehicle (lyoprotectant mixture used to maintain cell viability) administered every 12 h for 3 days. Another three groups of rats (n = 3/group) received a single oral dose of saline or SeMet or selenite at the same dose (untreated rats). Serum selenium concentrations over the subsequent 24 h were not significantly different between probiotic and vehicle treated rats but appeared to be more sustained (SeMet) or higher (selenite) than in the corresponding groups of untreated rats. Probiotic treated rats given SeMet also had selenium concentrations at 24 h that were significantly higher in liver and lower in kidney than untreated rats given SeMet. Thus, treatment with probiotics followed by SeMet significantly affects tissue levels of selenium.
TI  - Evaluating the In-vitro Antibacterial Effect of Iranian Propolis on Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - Propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. Current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. There have been few studies on the effects of Iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. In this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the Iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of Tehran was evaluated. Susceptibility of the oral strains tested (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 9222; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 9854 and Lactobacillus casei ATCC 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/mL of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. Antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) at different concentrations of propolis. The ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with MIC and MBC ranges of 250-500 microg/mL. The MIC concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/mL against S. mutans and E. faecalis. The water extract showed bactericidal activity only against S. mutans (20 mg/mL). These results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. However, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of Iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.
TI  - Identification of the bacterial community responsible for traditional fermentation during sour cassava starch, cachaca and minas cheese production using culture-independent 16s rRNA gene sequence analysis.
AB  - We used a cultivation-independent, clone library-based 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis to identify bacterial communities present during traditional fermentation in sour cassava starch, cachaca and cheese production in Brazil. Partial 16S rRNA gene clone sequences from sour cassava starch samples collected on day five of the fermentation process indicated that Leuconostoc citreum was the most prevalent species, representing 47.6% of the clones. After 27 days of fermentation, clones (GenBank accession numbers GQ999786 and GQ999788) related to unculturable bacteria were the most prevalent, representing 43.8% of the clones from the bacterial community analyzed. The clone represented by the sequence GQ999786 was the most prevalent at the end of the fermentation period. The majority of clones obtained from cachaca samples during the fermentation of sugar cane juice were from the genus Lactobacillus. Lactobacillus nagelli was the most prevalent at the beginning of the fermentation process, representing 76.9% of the clones analyzed. After 21 days, Lactobacillus harbinensis was the most prevalent species, representing 75% of the total clones. At the end of the fermentation period, Lactobacillus buchneri was the most prevalent species, representing 57.9% of the total clones. In the Minas cheese samples, Lactococcus lactis was the most prevalent species after seven days of ripening. After 60 days of ripening, Streptococcus salivarius was the most prevalent species. Our data show that these three fermentation processes are conducted by a succession of bacterial species, of which lactic acid bacteria are the most prevalent.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 15-deoxygoyazensolide isolated from the stems of Minasia alpestris (Asteraceae) against oral pathogens.
AB  - This work reports the isolation of the sesquiterpene lactone 15-deoxygoyazensolide from the stems of Minasia alpestris and the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity against the following oral pathogens: Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Lactobacillus casei. Despite the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of other sesquiterpene lactones of the furanoheliangolide-type, our results revealed that this compound exhibits low antibacterial activity against the evaluated oral pathogens; however, an interesting selectivity against E. faecalis (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]=40 microg mL(-1)) and S. sobrinus (MIC=60 microg mL(-1)) was observed.
TI  - The effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. METHODS: Twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (MS) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. The experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. The polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. Stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. The samples were cultured for MS, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. A part of the samples were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: Actinomyces naeslundii, A. viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. paracasei, L. rhamnose, L. plantarum, Streptococcus gordonii, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, Veillonella parvula. RESULTS: The MS counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (P<.01) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. Also the plaque MS percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (P<.01). The salivary MS counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. Nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. The DNA-DNA hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced MS counts in plaque but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.
TI  - Characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  - The study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from fermented foods in Xi'an, China. LAB strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of Lactobacillus (n = 73), and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and S. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). Some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. Minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of Lactobacillus. The erm(B) gene was detected from two strains of each of L. fermentum and L. vaginalis, and one strain of each of L. plantarum, L. salivarius, L. acidophilus, L. animalis, and S. thermophilus. The tet genes were identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. This is the first time, the authors identified tet(S) gene from L. brevis and L. kefiri. The erm(B) gene from L. fermentum NWL24 and L. salivarius NWL33, and tet(M) gene from L. plantarum NWL22 and L. brevis NWL59 were successfully transferred to Enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. It was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in Xi'an, China and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.
TI  - Anticariogenic properties of ent-pimarane diterpenes obtained by microbial transformation.
AB  - In the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. Among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising MIC values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug mL(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, and Lactobacillus casei. Time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent S. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). However, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). The curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a significant reduction in the time necessary for killing S. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. However, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. In conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of yogurt on aberrant crypt foci formation in the rat colon and colorectal tumorigenesis in RasH2 mice.
AB  - The inhibitory effects of yogurt consisting of milk fermented by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus strain 2038 and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain 1131 on formation of colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in rats and also on development of colorectal tumors in transgenic mice harboring human prototype c-Ha-ras genes (rasH2 mice) were examined. F344 rats and rasH2 mice were fed commercial diet containing freeze-dried yogurt or starter medium (non-fermented milk). Rats were inoculated orally with heterocyclic amine 2-amino-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine hydrochloride (PhIP) for two weeks. The rats were necropsied 14 days after the PhIP treatment, and ACF in the colon and rectum were counted. RasH2 mice were injected with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH) for 20 weeks. Three weeks after the last injection of DMH, rasH2 mice were necropsied to determine the number and the size of colorectal tumors. Yogurt supplementation in diet significantly reduced the number of ACF and aberrant crypts (ACs) in rats fed control diet (P<0.01), but not in rats fed non-fermented milk diet. On the other hand, rasH2 mice receiving the yogurt-supplemented diet had significantly reduced numbers of tumors induced by DMH compared with those fed the non-fermented milk-supplemented diet (P<0.05). These results demonstrate that the yogurt used in this study appears to have tumor-suppressing properties, and rasH2 mice are a useful model for the evaluation of antitumor activities of foods.
TI  - Effects of probiotic Lactobacillus salivarius WB21 on halitosis and oral health:  an open-label pilot trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether oral administration of lactobacilli alters the degree of halitosis and clinical conditions associated with halitosis. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty patients with genuine halitosis were given 2.0 x 10(9)Lactobacillus salivarius WB21 and xylitol in tablet form daily. Oral malodor and clinical parameters were evaluated at the same time of day for each patient after 2 and 4 weeks. RESULTS: All 20 patients were positive for L. salivarius DNA in their saliva at 2 weeks, although 12 patients were negative for this organism at baseline. Oral malodor parameters significantly decreased at 2 weeks in the subjects with physiologic halitosis. The scores of an organoleptic test and bleeding on probing significantly decreased at 4 weeks in the subjects with oral pathologic halitosis. CONCLUSIONS: Oral administration of probiotic lactobacilli primarily improved physiologic halitosis and also showed beneficial effects on bleeding on probing from the periodontal pocket.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of terpenoids from Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - In the present work, the anticariogenic activities of nine labdane type-diterpenes and four sesquiterpenes were investigated. Among these metabolites, (-)-copalic acid (CA) was the most active compound displaying MIC values very promising (ranging from 2.0 to 6.0 microg/mL) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis and Lactobacillus casei. Time kill assays performed with CA against the primary causative agent (S. mutans) revealed that, in the first 12 h, this compound only inhibits the growth of the inoculum (bacteriostatic effect). However, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). Also, CA did not show a synergistic effect when combined with the anticariogenic gold standard (chlorhexidine, CHD) in the checkerboard assays against S. mutans. In conclusion, the results points out CA as an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of root canal sealers and calcium hydroxide paste.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of different root canal sealers and calcium hydroxide (CH) paste. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample was composed of two sealers (Fill Canal((R)) and Sealer 26((R))), one CH cement (Hydro C((R))), and a CH paste. The agar diffusion test was performed in Petri dishes inoculated with the following microorganisms: Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and Candida tropicalis. The diameters of the zones of microbial growth inhibition were measured after 24 h. The tests were performed in triplicate. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test at 5% significance level. RESULTS: Fill Canal((R)) exhibited the largest mean zone of microbial growth inhibition against the Candida species and differed significantly from the other groups (P < 0.001). When inhibition was observed against S. mitis and S. oralis, the CH paste presented a larger mean zone of microbial growth inhibition than those of the other materials (P < 0.05). Regarding the inhibition of S. mutans, a statistically significant difference was observed only between the CH paste and Hydro C((R)) (P < 0.05); the paste produced the largest mean zone of microbial growth inhibition against this microorganism. Regarding the inhibition of S. salivarius, Fill Canal((R)) presented smaller mean zone of microbial growth inhibition than Sealer 26((R)) and CH paste (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: All the materials presented zones of microbial growth inhibition against all the test bacteria. Fill Canal((R)) presented the largest mean zone of inhibition against the Candida species. For the Streptococcus cultures, none of the sealers presented inhibition superior to that of the CH paste.
TI  - Degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity of etch-and-rinse versus self-etching adhesives.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to compare the self-etching with the etch-and-rinse adhesives regarding the degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The materials used were AdheSE (two-step self-etching), Adper Prompt L-Pop (self-etching, single-step) and Excite (etch-and-rinse) adhesives. The degree of conversion was measured using Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy. The absorbance peaks of infrared rays by the aliphatic C=C was detected at 1632 to 1637cm-1 and the aromatic C=C peak at 1610 to 1500 cm-1.The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces odontolyticus, with a disk diffusion method. Chlorhexidine digluconate solution 0.2% was used as a positive control. Zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed and measured. RESULTS: AdheSE showed the highest degree of conversion, followed by Excite, while Adper Prompt L-Pop had the lowest values. A significant difference in the degree of conversion was found between Excite and Adper Prompt L-Pop as well as AdheSE and Adper Prompt L-Pop. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between Excite and AdheSE. Adper Prompt L-Pop showed an antimicrobial effect against Streptococcus mutans and Actinomyces odontolyticus while it was unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus salivarius. AdheSE could inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans only. Excite did not produce inhibition zones to the tested microorganisms. CONCLUSION: Adper Prompt L-Pop showed the worst degree of conversion. AdheSE and Excite had the highest degree of conversion. Appreciable antimicrobial activity was noted with self-etching adhesives, while the etch-and-rinse demonstrated no antimicrobial action.
TI  - DIAGNOdent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. This difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. This study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with DIAGNOdent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect DIAGNOdent readings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. From these, mixed anaerobic flora, Lactobacilli and mutans Streptococci were cultured in up to three different kinds of culture medium. Colonies of Lactobacilli and mutans Streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. Laboratory teaching strains of Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. Sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. RESULTS: DIAGNOdent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of Prevotella and from colonies of mutans Streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. Higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. Lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. Demineralization of enamel did not affect the DIAGNOdent measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The change in fluorescence measured with DIAGNOdent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. The measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.
TI  - Screening of Quercus infectoria gall extracts as anti-bacterial agents against dental pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A number of bacteria have now become antibiotic-resistant. This increases the importance of ayurvedic drugs. We report, here, the activity of different extracts (petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water) of Quercus infectoria galls against dental pathogens -- Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus acidophilus (designated) and Streptococcus sanguis (isolated). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cup-plate method was used in anti-bacterial activity of the extracts at concentration of 200 mg/ml against dental pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of most effective extracts against the most susceptible bacteria were determined using a two-fold serial micro dilution method. RESULTS: Methanolic extract showed maximum anti-bacterial activity against all the bacteria. The most susceptible bacteria were S. sanguis followed by S. aureus, S. mutans, S. salivarius and L. acidophilus. The MIC values showed that methanolic extract was more effective than water extract. CONCLUSION: The plant has the potential to generate herbal metabolites. The crude extracts demonstrating anti-dental caries activity could result in the discovery of new chemical classes of antibiotics. These chemical classes of antibiotics could serve as selective agents for the maintenance of human health and provide bio-chemical tools for the study of infectious diseases.
TI  - Main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of Ugandan ghee.
AB  - Ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western Uganda. However, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. The aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. The most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. L. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. Two of the four most commonly isolated LAB species (L. helveticus and L. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (PCR-DGGE). Other main LAB species identified in mashita by PCR-DGGE were Bifidobacterium sp., Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Lactobacillus sp., Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Streptococcus salivarius. The main species of acetic acid bacteria (AAB) identified in the mashita using PCR-DGGE method were Acetobacter aceti, Acetobacter lovaniensis, Acetobacter orientalis and Acetobacter pasteurianus. PCR-DGGE identification of yeasts showed that Brettanomyces custersianus, Candida silvae, Geotrichum sp., Issatchenkia occidentalis, Issatchenkia orientalis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. A. lovaniensis, A. aceti, and I. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using PCR-DGGE method. Other microbial species were only found in some samples. These results indicate that LAB and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also AAB are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.
TI  - Culture-based PCR analysis of plaque samples of Japanese school children to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria and its association with caries risk.
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria from Cariostat-inoculated plaque samples of Japanese elementary school children through PCR analysis and check its associations with caries risk testing the validity of Cariostat as a caries risk assessment tool. This epidemiological school-based study investigated plaque samples of 399 Japanese elementary school children. Assessed using the Cariostat, 48.2% of the children had high caries risk. DNA detection of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum and both S. mutans and S. sobrinus was seen in 65.2%, 24.1%, 69.7%, 17.5%, 7.8%, 19.3%, and 17.3% of the participants, respectively. Except for S. salivarius, the presence of all other investigated bacteria resulted in a statistically significant increase among the proportion of subjects with high caries risk. Caries risk assessed using Cariostat was significantly influenced by the presence of cariogenic bacteria. Being a selective medium for cariogenic bacteria, the Cariostat can be a useful and direct source of cariogenic bacterial DNA for PCR analysis while effectively assessing caries risk.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Caesalpinia ferrea Martius fruits against oral pathogens.
AB  - AIM: In the Amazon region of Brazil, the fruits of Caesalpinia ferrea Martius (Brazilian ironwood) are widely used as an antimicrobial and healing medicine in many situations including oral infections. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Caesalpinia ferrea Martius fruit extract against oral pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polyphenols estimation and spectral analysis ((1)H NMR) of the methanol extract were carried out. The microorganisms Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis and Lactobacillus casei were tested using the microdilution method for planktonic cells (MIC) and a multispecies biofilm model. Chlorhexidine was used as positive control. RESULTS: Polyphenols in the extract were estimated at 7.3% and (1)H NMR analysis revealed hydroxy phenols and methoxilated compounds. MIC values for Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus oralis and Lactobacillus casei were 25.0, 40.0, 66.0, 100.0, 66.0 microg/mL, respectively. For the biofilm assay, chlorhexidine and plant extract showed no growth at 10(-4) and 10(-5) microbial dilution, respectively. At 10(-4) and 10(-5) the growth values (mean+/-SD) of the negative controls (DMSO and saline solution) for Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sp. and Candida albicans were 8.1+/-0.7, 7.0+/-0.6 and 5.9+/-0.9 x 10(6)CFU, respectively. CONCLUSION: Caesalpinia ferrea fruit extract can inhibit in vitro growth of oral pathogens in planktonic and biofilm models supporting its use for oral infections.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  - The genus Streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only Streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, Streptococcus gallinaceus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. During investigations of the aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. Phenotypic characterization using the API20 STREP kit identified the isolates as Aerococcus viridans (10), Aerococcus urinae (2), Leuconostoc species (4), Streptococcus salivarius (2), Streptococcus bovis II 3 (1), Enterococcus avium (3), Enterococcus faecium (1) or Gemella morbillorum (1). However, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as Streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were E. avium (3), E. faecium (1) or Lactobacillus species (1). Misidentification by API20 STREP was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as S. pluranimalium. The isolates of S. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested genomic DNA. The capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. Demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.
TI  - Enumeration of starter cultures during yogurt production using Petrifilm AC plates associated with acidified MRS and M17 broths.
AB  - The efficiency of Petrifilm AC (3M Microbiology, St. Paul, MN, USA) associated with the broths M17 and de Mann-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS) at pH 5.4 was evaluated to enumerate Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus during the yogurt production. Commercial and reference strains of these microorganisms were experimentally inoculated in nonfat milk and incubated at 42 degrees C for 4 h for yogurt production. At the moment of inoculation and after incubation, aliquots were collected, submitted to dilution using the broths M17 and MRS at pH 5.4, and plated for Strep. salivarius and Lb. bulgaricus enumeration according ISO 9232 and at Petrifilm AC plates, respectively. M17 plates were incubated at 42 degrees C, and MRS plates were incubated at 35 degrees C under anaerobiosis. After 48 h, the formed colonies were enumerated and the counts were compared by correlation and analysis of variance (P<0.05). In addition, colonies were randomly selected from all plates and characterized according to Gram staining and morphology. The obtained results indicated that Petrifilm AC plates associated to M17 and MRS at pH 5.4 can be considered as a suitable alternative for Strep. salivarius and Lb. bulgaricus enumeration during yogurt production, with slight interferences due to the acidity of MRS at the moment of inoculation, and due to the acidity of yogurt at the end of fermentation process. It was also observed that the MRS at pH 5.4 was not sufficiently selective for Lb. delbrueckii enumeration, despite it is indicated by the official protocol from ISO 9232.
TI  - Pimarane-type diterpenes: antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens.
AB  - Seven pimarane type-diterpenes re-isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic pimarane derivatives were evaluated in vitro against the following main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: Streptococcus salivarius, S. sobrinus, S. mutans, S. mitis, S. sanguinis and Lactobacillus casei. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid (PA); ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol; ent-15-pimarene-8beta,19-diol; ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-acetoxy and the sodium salt derivative of PA were the most active compounds, displaying MIC values ranging from 2 to 8 microg mL(-1). Thus, this class of compounds seems promising as a class of new effective anticariogenic agents. Furthermore, our results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new natural compounds that could be employed in the development of oral care products.
TI  - Reduction in bacterial contamination of toothbrushes using the Violight ultraviolet light activated toothbrush sanitizer.
AB  - PURPOSE: This two armed, self-controlled, investigator blinded, clinical study tested the efficacy of an ultraviolet (UV) light toothbrush holder (Violight) to decrease toothbrush bacterial contamination. METHODS: 25 subjects were randomly assigned to control or experimental groups and received two toothbrushes for home use on either even or odd days. The control group rinsed both toothbrushes after use in cold tap water with no mechanical manipulation. The experimental group rinsed one toothbrush in cold running water while storing the other toothbrush in the Violight toothbrush holder after use. The toothbrushes were returned after 2 weeks use in sealed plastic bags and were analyzed for the number of colony forming units (CFU) of S. mutans, S. salivarius, lactobacilli, E. coli, and other coliforms, and total bacterial counts by culture. An additional analysis of the total bacterial profile was performed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). RESULTS: The Violight toothbrush holder reduced total CFU by an average of 86% (ANCOVA, P = 0.037). In addition, a tendency was noted for a reduction in total bacterial population as detected by DGGE.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  - Two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (KA) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (KA-Ival), isolated from Aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of KA (KA-Me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. KA was the most active compound, with MIC values of 10 microg mL(-1) against the following microorganisms: Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Lactobacillus casei. However, KA did not show significant activity against Streptococcus salivarius and Enterococcus faecalis, with MIC values equal to 100 and 200 microg mL(-1), respectively. Our results show that KA has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. Moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.
TI  - Oral bacteria in biofilms exhibit slow reactivation from nutrient deprivation.
AB  - The ability of oral bacteria to enter a non-growing state is believed to be an important mechanism for survival in the starved micro-environments of the oral cavity. In this study, we examined the reactivation of nutrient-deprived cells of two oral bacteria in biofilms, Streptococcus anginosus and Lactobacillus salivarius. Non-growing cells were generated by incubation in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer for 24 h and the results were compared to those of planktonic cultures. When both types of cells were shifted from a rich, peptone-yeast extract-glucose (PYG) medium to buffer for 24 h, dehydrogenase and esterase activity measured by the fluorescent dyes 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl-tetrazolium chloride (CTC) and fluorescein diacetate (FDA), respectively, was absent in both species. However, the membranes of the vast majority of nutrient-deprived cells remained intact as assessed by LIVE/DEAD staining. Metabolic reactivation of the nutrient-deprived biofilm cells was not observed for at least 48 h following addition of fresh PYG medium, whereas the non-growing planktonic cultures of the same two strains were in rapid growth in less than 2 h. At 72 h, the S. anginosus biofilm cells had recovered 78 % of the dehydrogenase activity and 61 % of the esterase activity and the biomass mm(-2) had increased by 30-35 %. With L. salivarius at 72 h, the biofilms had recovered 56 % and 75 % of dehydrogenase and esterase activity, respectively. Reactivation of both species in biofilms was enhanced by removal of glucose from PYG, and S. anginosus cells were particularly responsive to yeast extract (YE) medium. The data suggest that the low reactivity of non-growing biofilm cells to the introduction of fresh nutrients may be a survival strategy employed by micro-organisms in the oral cavity.
TI  - Short-term relative antibacterial effect of octenidine dihydrochloride on the oral microflora in orthodontically treated patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of common antiseptic mouth rinses and octenidine dihydrochloride (OCT). METHODS: The antibacterial activities of antiseptics against total and cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species) in saliva were studied in vitro and in vivo. After unstimulated saliva was collected, one of the mouth rinse solutions was applied for 30seconds. Saliva samples were collected 15, 30, 60, and 120min later and evaluated for their bacterial count. RESULTS: OCT had a significantly greater inhibitory effect on the studied bacteria than 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and 7.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complex (PVP-I) from 15min to 120min following the application (p<0.01). The antiseptic efficacy of 0.2% CHX on total bacteria and Lactobacillus species was very similar to the efficacy observed with 7.5% PVP-I mouth solution from 15min up to 120min. Streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by 0.15mg/ml PVP-I, 0.5mg/ml CHX, and 0.1mg/ml OCT concentrations, while Streptococcus salivarius was inhibited by 0.15mg/ml PVP-I, 2mg/ml CHX, and 0.8mg/ml OCT concentrations. Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis was inhibited with 0.00313mg/ml OCT, 30mg/ml PVP-I, and 0.0063mg/ml CHX concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: OCT compared favorably with CHX and PVP-I in its antibacterial effects, both in vitro and in vivo (p<0.01).
TI  - Fluoride release and antibacterial activity of selected dental materials.
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the fluoride ion release and antibacterial activities of the glassionomer cement Fuji IX and the compomer (composite modified polyacid) Dyract AP. Fluoride ion release was measured using direct potentiometry with an Orion fluoride ion selective electrode. The measurement was carried out after 1, 4, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days of storage in phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. The antibacterial activity of the materials was evaluated against the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668, Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, and Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei ATCC 393. The agar diffusion test was applied. The material specimens were assessed twice: after setting and seven days later. Zones of bacterial growth inhibition were measured in millimeters after 24 hours. The results of the study showed that both materials released ion fluoride, with a higher emission of Fuji IX than Dyract AP. The highest level of emission was observed on the seventh day of the study in both materials. After 24 hours of bonding there was inhibition of bacterial growth by Fuji IX, whereas Dyract AP did not show similar activity. On the eighth day after polymerization, Dyract AP was significantly more active towards Streptococcus sanguis and salivarius.
TI  - Purification of bacteriocin LS1 produced by human oral isolate Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, and Salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. The objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named LS1, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1. METHODS: A simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. RESULTS: The supernatant of L. salivarius BGHO1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. Its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees C in an autoclave. Bacteriocin LS1 was purified to homogeneity. The molecular mass of bacteriocin LS1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. During purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1, was detected. The molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. CONCLUSION: Our results imply that LS1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by L. salivarius strains. The purification of bacteriocin LS1 enabled the further characterization of LS1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.
TI  - Characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. We aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. METHODS: The study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. All strains were identified using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of low pH and bile content. Thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. RESULTS: The majority of strains suppressed the growth of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited Candida albicans. The lowest pH tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was pH 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this pH. All strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (V/V)]. Four Lactobacillus plantarum and two Lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. CONCLUSIONS: Strains of L. plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. The absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in L. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. These results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics for oral health.
TI  - New culture media for the isolation of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus in  the saliva of head- and neck-irradiated patients.
AB  - The reduction in salivary flow in patients subjected to head and neck irradiation induces changes in the oral microflora and increases the risk of oral mucosal infections. The frequent presence of fungi, particularly Candida, in the oral environment of these patients complicates identification of the most important cariogenic bacteria with the commercial CRT Bacteria (Ivoclar Vivadent) culture media. Such identification is important for the application of chemical measures to control cariogenic bacteria in these patients, since it has been shown that simple fluoride application is unable to control caries in this population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to obtain a simple medium that inhibits Candida spp. growth and allows the specific growth of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. Thus, reliable counts of cariogenic species can be achieved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stimulated saliva samples from 30 head- and neck-radiotherapy patients were seeded in commercial CRT Bacteria culture medium and in two different media designed by our group: mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (MSBA), containing 5% potassium tellurite and fluconazole 64 microg/ml (MSBTPF) for the isolation of Streptococcus; and Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar, containing bacitracin 0.2 U/ml and fluconazole 32 microg/ml (MRSBF) for the isolation of Lactobacillus spp. RESULTS: Candida growth was inhibited 100% in the media developed in this study. In all the samples seeded, growing of colonies in MRSBF was identified as Lactobacillus, while in CRT Bacteria for Lactobacillus spp. this species was only isolated in 48.1% of the samples. S. mutans was identified in 71.4% of the colonies that grown in MSBTPF medium, while in CRT Bacteria for S. mutans, this species was only identified in 35% of the colonies obtained. CONCLUSION: The culture medium developed in the present study was able to inhibit the 100% of Candida spp. growth. These new media permit reliable counts of cariogenic bacteria in irradiated patients.
TI  - Conversion of isoflavone glucosides to aglycones in soymilk by fermentation with  lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Four lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus paraplantarum KM, Enterococcus durans KH, Streptococcus salivarius HM and Weissella confusa JY, were isolated from humans and tested for their capabilities of converting isoflavone glucosides to aglycones in soymilk. Changes in growth, pH, and titratable acidity (TA) were investigated during fermentation at 37 degrees C for 12 h. After 6 to 9 h of fermentation, each population of 4 LAB reached 10(8) to 10(9) CFU/mL. The initial pH of 6.3 +/- 0.1 decreased while the TA of 0.13%+/- 0.01% increased as fermentation proceeded, resulting in the final range between 4.1 +/- 0.2 and 4.6 +/- 0.1 for pH and between 0.51%+/- 0.02% and 0.67%+/- 0.06% for TA after the 12 h of fermentation. The glucoside concentrations were significantly decreased in soymilks fermented with either L. paraplantarum KM, S. salivarius HM, or W. confusa JY with fermentation time (P < 0.05). L. paraplantarum KM was the best in percent conversion of glucosides to corresponding aglycones, resulting in 100%, 90%, and 61% hydrolysis of genistin, daidzin, and glycitin, respectively, in 6 h. Consequently, the aglycone concentrations in soymilk fermented with L. paraplantarum KM were 6 and 7-fold higher than the initial levels of daidzein and genistein, respectively, after 6 h of fermentation. Changes in the daidzin and genistin levels were not significant in soymilk fermented with E. durans KH. The rates of hydrolysis of glucosides varied depending on the species of LAB. Especially, L. paraplantarum KM seems to be a promising starter for bioactive-fermented soymilk based on its growth, acid production, and isoflavone conversion within a short time.
TI  - Molecular profiling of Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Bifidobacterium species  in feces of active racehorses.
AB  - Diversity and compositions of the Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Bifidobacterium group in the feces of six healthy, actively racing horses (Thoroughbreds) were analyzed by using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR with primer sets specific for each group. PCR-DGGE analysis of the feces showed that Lactobacillus equi, Lactobacillus johnsonii, a phylogenetic relative of Lactobacillus salivarius, a phylogenetic relative of Lactobacillus gastricus, and Weissella confusa were predominant in almost all of the feces tested, and Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus was predominant in the Streptococcus group. The Bifidobacterium group was not detected by single-PCR but atypical species of the group were found in three of the six Thoroughbreds tested by nested-PCR. Calculation and estimation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria revealed that lactic acid bacteria were predominant in the feces and bifidobacteria were minor. These results indicate that the community of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in horse feces are unique because of the presence of specific species for horse feces and a minority of the Bifidobacterium group. Repeated tests of the feces from the same horse over 3 months showed that the diversity and composition of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the feces was basically stable throughout the test period.
TI  - In vitro inhibition activity of nisin A, nisin Z, pediocin PA-1 and antibiotics against common intestinal bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the sensitivity of 21 common intestinal bacteria to six antibiotics and three broad-spectrum bacteriocins (nisins Z and A and pediocin PA-1). METHODS AND RESULTS: Neutralized cell-free culture supernatants containing active bacteriocins, and antibiotics were tested with the agar diffusion test and the disc-diffusion method, respectively. The tested intestinal strains showed high sensitivity to most antibiotics except for streptomycin and oxacillin. Nisins A and Z (8 mug per well) had similar activity spectra and inhibited all Gram-positive intestinal bacteria at different levels (except Streptococcus salivarius), with bifidobacteria (except Bifidobacterium breve and Bif. catenulatum), Collinsella aerofaciens and Eubacterium biforme being the most sensitive strains, but they were not active against Gram-negative bacteria. Surprisingly, none of the tested strains were inhibited by pediocin PA-1 (16 mug per well). CONCLUSION: Pediocin PA-1 which is very active against Listeria spp. and other food pathogens did not inhibit major intestinal species in the human intestine in contrast to both nisins A and Z. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our data suggest that pediocin PA-1 has potential to inhibit Listeria within the intestinal microbiota without altering commensal bacteria.
TI  - The effect of antibacterial monomer MDPB on the growth of organisms associated with root caries.
AB  - MDPB, 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide, was tested for its ability to  inhibit the growth of organisms associated with active root caries lesions and to modify the growth characteristics of these organisms at sub-MICs. MICs and MBCs of MDPB for independent isolates (n=5) of the following taxa: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces gerensceriae, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Lactobacillus spp., and Candida albicans were determined, and the effects at sub-MIC on microbial growth kinetics were assessed. All isolates were sensitive to inhibition by MDPB. The median MICs and MBCs of MDPB for these organisms were in the range of 3.13 to 25.0 microg/ml and 6.25 to 50.0 microg/ml, respectively. As for the influence of pH, inhibition was sensitive to acidic pH. Even at sub-MICs, the growth of all strains, measured as cell yield and doubling time, was significantly reduced. Based on the results of this study, MDPB exhibited the potential to inhibit the growth of microbiota associated with active root caries lesions.
TI  - [Effect of probiotic lactic acid bacteria strains on virus infection].
AB  - The effect of probiotic lactic acid bacteria strains on viral infection was studied in experiments in vivo. It was shown that in investigations microbial substance based on living cells of L. plantarum and S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains manifested antiinfluenzal activity under administration of 0.3 ml of cultural medium per os at a dose of 3 x 10(8)/CFU mouse and antiherpetic activity at a dose of 0.3 x 10(9)/CFU mouse. The probiotic effectiveness was shown on the model of genital herpes of guinea-pigs at concentration of 1 x 10(9) cells/g.p. It was statistically established, that the lactic acid bacteria inhibited reproduction of HIV at a dose of cells of 0.1 x 10(9)/CFU ml.
TI  - Salmonellae reduction in poultry by competitive exclusion bacteria Lactobacillus  salivarius and Streptococcus cristatus.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a defined competitive exclusion bacteria (CE) culture that will prevent or substantially reduce Salmonella colonization of poultry. The efficacy of 56 potential CE isolates in preventing or reducing Salmonella colonization in chickens was determined. These potential CE were perorally administered to day-of-hatch chicks at 10(6) to 10(8) CFU per chick, and salmonellae were subsequently administered by gavage 2 days later at 5.5 x 10(3) to 5.0 x 10(4) CFU per chick. Feeding chickens an overnight CE culture of Lactobacillus salivarius strains Salm-9, List40-1,8, or List40-41 reduced Salmonella carriage in cecal contents by 2.10, 2.52, and 2.20 log CFU/g (average of three trials), respectively. The percentages of Salmonella-positive chickens after receiving these treatments were 35, 31, and 35% respectively, compared with 84% for the untreated control. A mixture of these three isolates had a similar effect when compared with the results of the individual isolates. A mixture of Streptococcus cristatus List40-13 and L. salivarius List40-41 reduced Salmonella carriage from 90 to 65% and 88 to 31% in two feeding trials, and by 2.2 and 4 log CFU/g of cecal contents of chickens. In conclusion, CE isolates L. salivarius Salm-9, List40-18, and List40-41 and S. cristatus List40-13 either individually or in combination were effective in significantly preventing Salmonella colonization of chickens.
TI  - [Adhesion of various species of lactic acid bacteria depending on the AB0 system  blood group].
AB  - The influence of the AB0 blood groups on adhesion of different lactic acid bacteria species was studied. From twelve investigated strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus species, difference between adhesion average index on erythrocytes of various blood groups was found in two strains. The average adhesion index of the strain E. faecium K-50 in A (II) blood group erythrocytes was higher (AAI = 4.91 +/- 0.26) than in B (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.17 +/- 0.33). The strain L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 4n has displayed a higher adhesive activity in A (II) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.36 +/- 0.13) in comparison with AB (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 3.61 +/- 0.75).
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Spotlight on VSL#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, and B. infantis), and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - [Reversion of antibiotic-sensitivity of lactic acid bacteria in grafted cultures  of lymphoblastoid human cells].
AB  - The reversion of the antibiotic sensitivity of lactic acid bacteria: Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum have been studied. The phenomenon of the reversion has been fists studied in lactic acid bacteria of different taxonomic groups at their interactions with lymphoblastoid human cells. It is shown that resistance of lactobacteria to antibiotics can change depending on the terms of cultivation, genus and strain specificity. Most often the reversion of antibiotic sensitivity was observed with respect to fuzidin (26%) and cefepim (23%), most rarely--with respect to cephazolin, erithromicin, cefamandol, tobramicin and oxacillin.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological effect of calcium hydroxide protection in indirect pulp capping in primary teeth.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate clinically and microbiologically the effect of calcium hydroxide (CH) on carious dentin on primary teeth submitted to indirect pulp capping (IPC). METHODS: Twenty 4-7 year-old subjects with 42 treated teeth participated in the study. The treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of a CH or gutta-percha (GP) layer and sealing with a resin-based composite for 4-7 months. After cavity preparation and sealing, the dentin was evaluated clinically (color and consistency) and microbiologically. Dentin samples were cultured on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in Mitis Salivarius agar and Rogosa SL agar. RESULTS: 39 teeth (20 in the CH Group and 19 in the GP Group) were reopened 4-7 months post-treatment for clinical and microbiological evaluation. In all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was wet and soft or leathery. In the CH Group, 10% of the lesions were yellow, 80% light brown and 10% dark brown and in the GP Group, 94.7% were light brown and 5.3% dark brown. After treatment, the dentin was dry, 90% (Group CH) and 84.2% (Group GP) were dark brown. The final consistency was either leathery or hard. Three samples in the CH Group and five in Group GP changed from soft to leathery; only one sample (GP) remained leathery. 85% in the CH Group and 68.4% in GP Group turned hard after treatment. All bacterial counts decreased significantly by the end of treatment. In the CH Group, the bacterial (Log10 CFU + 1) anaerobic growth decreased from 4.84 +/- 1.31 to 1.35 +/- 1.54, aerobic from 4.09 +/- 1.04 to 0.92 +/- 1.30 and lactobacilli from 3.24 +/- 1.22 to 0.36 +/- 0.89, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 2.05 +/- 1.84 to 0.14 +/- 0.60. In GP Group, anaerobic growth decreased from 5.22 +/- 0.96 to 2.02 +/- 1.65 and aerobic from 4.23 +/- 1.37 to 1.08 +/- 1.29 and lactobacilli from 2.06 +/- 1.81 to 0.00 +/- 0.00, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 3.16 +/- 1.59 to 0.28 +/- 0.84.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the one humped camel milk  produced in Morocco.
AB  - One hundred and twenty (120) strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were enumerated and isolated from raw dromedary milk in Morocco using various cultured media. Strains isolated were characterized by phenotypic, physiological and biochemical properties. Results showed that high counts of LAB were found. Presumptive lactobacilli counts ranged from 2.5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive lactococci levels varied from 5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive streptococci counts varied from 4.2x10(2) to 8x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive leuconostoc levels ranged from 5.4x10(2) to 5.4x10(7)cfu/ml. Results showed also that Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were the predominant genera with 37.5% and 25.8%, respectively. The dominated species found were Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (17.5%), Lactobacillus helveticus (10%), Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (9.20%), Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (5.80%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (5%). This is the first report on the characterization of LAB strains isolated from the one humped camel milk produced in Morocco.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria and other gut bacteria in pigs by a macroarraying method.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) consist of many genera, Gram-positive, and nonspore-forming micro-organisms; some members being used as probiotics while some others have negative effects on pig health. Bacterial species in the gastrointestinal tract can produce antibacterial substances, reduce serum cholesterol in their host, or can be responsible for growth reduction, diarrhea, and intestinal epithelial damage. It is therefore important for the pig industry to evaluate the impact of food and farm management on the presence of "good" or "bad" bacteria and the risk for consumers. This articles focuses on the molecular identification of gut microflora species following different diets given to pigs in UK and correlating the data on growth, health, and welfare. First of all, pig feces were individually collected from sows before and after farrowing and also from piglets before and after weaning over several months. Bacteria colonies were grown on MRS agar plates from feces and DNA was extracted (QIAamp DNA stool kit) and amplified using 16S rDNA (27f and 519r) primers. DNA sequencing and sequence alignment allowed us to identify species-specific zones, which were used as probes in a macroarray system also known as reverse line blot hybridization. Some probes were found to be species specific for the following species: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. animalis, L. gallinarum, L. kitasanotis, L salivarius, Streptococcus alactolyticus, S. hyointestinalis, and Sarcina ventriculi. Actual studies are now focusing on the impact of diets of the microflora in different gut parts and at different stages of the animal's life.
TI  - A modified dip-slide test for microbiological risk in caries assessment.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the validity of a new modified dip-slide test kit for the estimation of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and Candida levels by comparison with the results obtained from conventional agar plate counts. Five milliliters of paraffin-stimulated saliva sample was collected from 118 6-12-year old children attending 4 primary schools in Thailand. Saliva was poured over a 3-compartment slide containing Mitis-Salivarius Bacitracin agar, Rogosa agar and Sabouraud dextrose agar. A slide was incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator for 48 hours. The results of the modified test kit were compared with those from the conventional saliva sampling with dilution method. The salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and Candida counts obtained from the conventional methods were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) with the modified dip-slide estimates of these organisms. (Kendall Tau = 0.71, 0.58 and 0.76, respectively). The correlation between a modified dip-slide test kit and the conventional method indicates that this new test kit is suitable for the screening of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and Candida levels in patients. The test is simple and would be useful for the early selection of patients for dental examination. In addition, it would be a valuable educational aid for the motivation and dietary counseling among children.
TI  - Antibiotic resistances of starter and probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The antibiotic resistances of 45 lactic acid bacteria strains belonging to the genera Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus, Pediococcus, and Leuconostoc were investigated. The objective was to determine antibiotic resistances and to verify these at the genetic level, as is currently suggested by the European "qualified presumption of safety" safety evaluation system for industrial starter strains. In addition, we sought to pinpoint possible problems in resistance determinations. Primers were used to PCR amplify genes involved in beta-lactam antibiotic, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and erythromycin resistance. The presence of ribosomal protection protein genes and the ermB gene was also determined by using a gene probe. Generally, the incidences of erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, or beta-lactam resistances in this study were low (<7%). In contrast, aminoglycoside (gentamicin and streptomycin) and ciprofloxacin resistances were higher than 70%, indicating that these may constitute intrinsic resistances. The genetic basis for ciprofloxacin resistance could not be verified, since no mutations typical of quinolone resistances were detected in the quinolone determining regions of the parC and gyrA genes. Some starter strains showed low-level ampicillin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline resistances, but no known resistance genes could be detected. Although some strains possessed the cat gene, none of these were phenotypically resistant to chloramphenicol. Using reverse transcription-PCR, these cat genes were shown to be silent under both inducing and noninducing conditions. Only Lactobacillus salivarius BFE 7441 possessed an ermB gene, which was encoded on the chromosome and which could not be transferred in filter-mating experiments. This study clearly demonstrates problems encountered with resistance testing, in that the breakpoint values are often inadequately identified, resistance genes may be present but silent, and the genetic basis and associated resistance mechanisms toward some antibiotics are still unknown.
TI  - Calcium modulates interactions between bacteria and hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion onto hydroxyapatite is known to depend on the surface properties of both the biomaterial and the bacterial strain, but less is known about the influence of the composition of the aqueous medium. Here, the adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and 3 different Lactobacilli on powdered hydroxyapatite was shown to change with Ca2+ concentration. The effect depends on the surface properties of each strain. Adhesion of Lactobacillus fermentum and salivarius (and of Streptococcus mutans at low Ca2+) was enhanced with increasing Ca2+ concentration. Lactobacillus casei was efficiently removed by adhesion on hydroxyapatite, even without Ca2+ addition, and the effect of this ion was only marginal. The results are interpreted in terms of Ca2+-mediated adhesion, and relative to the hydrophobic properties of each strain and the electrical properties of the bacterial and solid surfaces (electrophoretic mobility).
TI  - VSL#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve and B. infantis) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - [Study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  - A comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. At physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) CFU/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) CFU/1 g in the intestine content. The spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. Quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. Quantity of E. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) CFU/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) CFU/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) CFU/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. Lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--L. plantarum and L. fermentum. All the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. Twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. The degree of adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. The highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in Enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. The screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. The strain of Lactobacillus plantarum 200D proved to be the most active one. A complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. The biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.
TI  - Effects of extracts of miswak and derum on proliferation of Balb/C 3T3 fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effects of extracts of two chewing sticks on  proliferation of fibroblasts and viability of cariogenic bacteria. METHODS: Aqueous extracts of miswak (Salvadora persica; Arak tree) and derum (Juglans regia; walnut tree) were prepared and their effects investigated on growth of Balb/C 3T3 mouse fibroblasts by measuring the mitochondrial succinic dehydrogenase activity. Furthermore, the effects on the viability of various cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces viscosus) was also determined. RESULTS: The data revealed that Balb/C 3T3 fibroblasts exposed to aqueous extracts of miswak or derum showed an increase in cell proliferation by 156% and 255%, respectively, in comparison with controls (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, extracts from both miswak and derum had adverse effects on the growth of the cariogenic microorganisms, with derum having significantly greater antimicrobial effects than miswak and at much lower concentrations against all the bacteria tested. The most sensitive organisms were A. viscosus, followed by S. mutans, S. salivarius, with L. casei being the most resistant. CONCLUSION: The results show that aqueous extracts of miswak and derum enhance the growth of fibroblasts and inhibit the growth of cariogenic bacteria, with the derum extract showing greater activity than miswak.
TI  - Effects of sonic energy on monospecific biofilms of cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro differential effect of sonic energy, delivered  by Sonicare Advance, on cariogenic and non-cariogenic bacteria biofilms. METHODS: A wild strain of Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella alcalescens was isolated from human dental plaque. For each of the four microorganisms a biofilm adherent to bovine enamel disks, coated with artificial saliva, was obtained. Biofilms were divided into four groups and were exposed to acoustic energy delivered by Sonicare for 0 (control group), 5, 15 and 30 seconds. The distance between the end of the bristles and the disk surface was set to 7 mm, to ensure that the biofilm removal was simply due to fluid forces and not to the contact with the bristle tips during the brushing cycle. A colorimetric technique (MTT assay), based on the reduction of a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan, was used to evaluate the reduction of the adherent biomass after the exposure to the sonic energy. RESULTS: ANOVA results showed that sonic energy exposure significantly reduced the biomass of S. mutans and S. salivarius adherent to the disks, while L. acidophilus and V. alcalescens seemed to remain basically unaffected. In the two streptococcal groups, the increase of the exposure time led to different reduction trends; while S. salivarius exhibited a progressive decrease over time, S. mutans showed a rapid reduction of the adherent biomass after a 15-second exposure to Sonicare.
TI  - Preparation and antimicrobial activity of gelatin microparticles containing propolis against oral pathogens.
AB  - Gelatin microparticles containing propolis ethanolic extractive solution were prepared by spray-drying technique. Particles with regular morphology, mean diameter ranging of 2.27 microm to 2.48 microm, and good entrapment efficiency for propolis were obtained. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of oral importance (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Candida albicans, and Lactobacillus casei). The utilized techniques were diffusion in agar and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration. The choice of the method to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of microparticles showed be very important. The microparticles displayed activity against all tested strains of similar way to the propolis, showing greater activity against the strains of E. salivarius, S. sanguinis, S. mitis, and C. albicans.
TI  - Anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from Myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic Streptococcus mutans. Preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of Myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against S. mutans. The anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of M. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1D-NMR, 2D-NMR and EI-MS. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of macelignan against S. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. Macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei in the MIC range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. In particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated S. mutans in 1 min. The specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.
TI  - The ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  - Some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. Streptococcus mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus fermentans, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, A. israelii, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto Columbia agar with haemin and vitamin K and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. The resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. The red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. All colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. The green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, F. nucleatum and S. sobrinus. The red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) P. intermedia, A. naeslundi, A. israelii, L. fermentans, L. rhamnosus and L. casei. With all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. We conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - Conjugated linoleic acid content and organoleptic attributes of fermented milk products produced with probiotic bacteria.
AB  - The effect of probiotic bacteria on the formation of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), microbial growth, and organoleptic attributes (acidity, texture, and flavor) of fermented milk products was determined. Four probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 56, P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 51, and P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii 23, were evaluated individually or in coculture with traditional yogurt cultures (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). The lipid source was hydrolyzed soy oil. L. rhamnosus, in coculture with yogurt culture, resulted in the highest content of CLA. Growth and CLA formation of propionibacteria were enhanced in the presence of yogurt cultures. Texture and flavor attributes of fermented milks produced with propionibacteria were significantly different than the fermented milks processed with yogurt cultures. The fermented milks processed with probiotic bacteria in coculture with yogurt cultures demonstrated similar acidity, texture, and flavor as the fermented milk produced with yogurt cultures.
TI  - Cariogenicity of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius in rats.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are considered to be non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic on the basis of long years of safe usage. However, some species of lactobacilli are thought to be associated with the development of dental caries. The purpose of the present study was to examine the cariogenicity of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius in rats. Rats were divided into six groups, and infected with L. salivarius LS1952R and/or Streptococcus mutans MT8148R. L. salivarius LS1952R became established in the oral cavity of rats and induced significant level of dental caries even when infected for only 5 days from 18 to 22 days of age. In addition, the caries scores of rats superinfected with both Streptococcus mutans MT8148R and L. salivarius LS1952R from 18 days of age were significantly higher than those infected with either L. salivarius LS1952R or S. mutans MT8148R alone. Since strain LS1952R can adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatites, it is concluded that L. salivarius strain LS1952R possesses an inherent cariogenic activity following adherence to the tooth surface.
TI  - Oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. However, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. We aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative oral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 238 Lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. In all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia was assessed. RESULTS: Lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. The most prevalent strains in healthy persons were Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, Lactobacillus plantarum. Obligately homofermentatives, particularly L. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for L. gasseri, P < 0.01). Sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans, 88% A. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% P. gingivalis and 65% P. intermedia. The strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with Lactobacillus paracasei, L. plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against S. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: The composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly L. gasseri, in the latter group. Both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different generation dentin-bonding systems.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antibacterial activities of different generation dentin-bonding systems. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The antibacterial activities of dentin-bonding systems Optibond FL Primer, Single Bond, Clearfil SE Bond Primer, and Prompt-L-Pop were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Cervitec (1% chlorhexidine varnish) was also examined as a positive control material. Disk diffusion tests with filter paper disks (n = 10) containing a drop of each material (20 microL) were used. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 hours, the growth inhibition zones were measured in millimeters. RESULTS: Of all the materials tested, Optibond FL Primer, Clearfil SE Bond Primer, and Prompt-LPop showed larger growth inhibition zones than the control material for all bacterial strains. No antibacterial effect was noted for Single Bond. The results indicated that Optibond FL Primer had the strongest effect against the S mutans and L casei, and Clearfil SE Bond Primer produced the largest inhibition zone for S salivarius and L acidophilus among the test materials. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial effects observed for the tested different generation dentin-bonding systems may be related to the acidic nature of the materials.
TI  - Susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and LL37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. The susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. METHODS: Synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hBD1), hBD2, hBD3 and LL37 (CAP18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. They included Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6), Prevotella intermedia (7), Fusobacterium nucleatum (7), Streptococcus mutans (5), Streptococcus sobrinus (5), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus sanguis (4), Streptococcus mitis (2) and Lactobacillus casei (1). RESULTS: Although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. The antibacterial activity of hBD1 was lower than that of the other peptides. Among the bacteria tested in this study, F. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hBD3 and LL37, and S. mutans was highly susceptible to hBD3. We measured the Zeta-potential, representing the net charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. Although we found some correlation in A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that beta-defensins and LL37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.
TI  - [The effect of galla chinensis on the growth of cariogenic bacteria in vitro].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purples of this study was to investigate the role of different components of Galla Chinensis extract on the growth of 6 kinds of cariogenic bacteria, and to find out the most effective components of Galla Chinensis extract. METHODS: Four different components (GCE1, GCE2, GCE3 and GCE4) were separated from Galla Chinensis and there antibacterial activities to Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556, Streptococcus salivarius SS 196, Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627, Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 19246 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus AC 413 were checked. There effects on the growth curve of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 were also investigated. RESULTS: The most effective part of Galla Chinensis was found to be GCE2 and GCE4, which were found to be a mixture of polyphenol-rich fractions. All of the different components had an inhibitory effect to the growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175. CONCLUSION: All of the 4 different components of Galla Chinensis extract could inhibit the growth of the tested bacteria. These results suggest that the antibacterial activity of Galla Chinensis extract is caused by a synergistic effect of monomeric polyphenols, which can easily bind to proteins.
TI  - Probiotic therapy of intestinal inflammation and infections.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The author presents evidence published during the past year regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and infections by probiotic agents. RECENT FINDINGS: Normal commensal bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal inflammation, particularly Crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Combinations of Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria, and Streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation, whereas Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis. Several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. Use of probiotics in Crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. Animal models demonstrate marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. Probiotics have multiple mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth, binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). Although multiple probiotic species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro, their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. SUMMARY: Probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger, controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses; combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic conditions.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Low pH-induced membrane fatty acid alterations in oral bacteria.
AB  - Four oral bacterial strains, of which two are considered aciduric and two are considered acid-sensitive, were grown under glucose-limiting conditions in chemostats to determine whether their membrane fatty acid profiles were altered in response to environmental acidification. Streptococcus gordonii DL1, as well as the aciduric strains S. salivarius 57.I, and Lactobacillus casei 4646 increased the levels of mono-unsaturated membrane fatty acids. The non-aciduric strain S. sanguis 10904 did not alter its membrane composition in response to pH values examined here. Thus, in response to low pH, aciduric oral bacteria alter their membrane composition to contain increased levels of long-chained, mono-unsaturated fatty acids. This suggests that membrane fatty acid adaptation is a common mechanism utilized by bacteria to withstand environmental stress.
TI  - Survey of bacterial proteins released in cheese: a proteomic approach.
AB  - During the ripening of Emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. In Emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters like Lactobacillus helveticus, Lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as Propionibacterium freudenreichii. The aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a reference map. A methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of cheese matrix prior to 2D-PAGE analysis. The aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. Five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) DNA and RNA repair and (v) oxidoreduction. The results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria and Propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. Information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening. Different peptidases arose from St thermophilus and Lb helveticus, suggesting that streptococci are involved in peptide degradation in addition to the proteolytic activity of lactobacilli.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from AOC Salers cheese.
AB  - The objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk Salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. The characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: Rep-PCR, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA for strain typing and taxonomic identification. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garviae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus millieri, Streptococcus macedonicus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. A wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. The natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined to identify and characterize natural microflora. This study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the Facultatively Heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and SB medium selective for Enterococcus. The study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of Salers cheese and its diversity. A better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.
TI  - [Oral cavity microbial coenobia in healthy children and children with chronic recurrent aphthous stomatitis].
AB  - Peculiarities of quantitative and qualitative composition of microbiocenosis of the oral cavity in healthy children and children with chronic aphthous recurrent stomatitis have been studied. Strains of microorganisms (n = 259) have been isolated and identified. The results obtained showed that the studied biotope is characterised by a wide spectrum of isolated microflora. The growth of microorganism association is observed in all the studied samples. The analysis of genus and species composition of microbiocenosis of the mucous membrane indicated that streptococci, neiserii, corynebacteria, enterococci, lactobacilli, epidermal staphylococci and candidas were distinguished as to isolation frequency among the isolated strains. These bacteria were isolated from oral cavity of healthy and sick children, but their quantity in 1 mm2 of sick children mucosa prevailed, except for Streptococcus salivarius, S. mitis and Lactobacillus sp.: their quantity was far less. Golden staphylococci, escherichia, klebsiella, clostridia, hemophilic rods and campylobacteria were isolated from sick children only.
TI  - Biochemical and molecular characterization of a levansucrase from Lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  - Lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 employs a fructosyltransferase (FTF) to synthesize a fructose polymer [a fructan of the levan type, with beta(2-->6) linkages] from sucrose or raffinose. Purification of this FTF (a levansucrase), and identification of peptide amino acid sequences, allowed isolation of the first Lactobacillus levansucrase gene (lev), encoding a protein (Lev) consisting of 804 amino acids. Lev showed highest similarity with an inulosucrase of L. reuteri 121 [Inu; producing an inulin polymer with beta(2-->1)-linked fructosyl units] and with FTFs from streptococci. Expression of lev in Escherichia coli resulted in an active FTF (Lev Delta 773His) that produced the same levan polymer [with only 2-3 % beta(2-->1-->6) branching points] as L. reuteri 121 cells grown on raffinose. The low degree of branching of the L. reuteri levan is very different from bacterial levans known up to now, such as that of Streptococcus salivarius, having up to 30 % branches. Although Lev is unusual in showing a higher hydrolysis than transferase activity, significant amounts of levan polymer are produced both in vivo and in vitro. Lev is strongly dependent on Ca(2+) ions for activity. Unique properties of L. reuteri Lev together with Inu are: (i) the presence of a C-terminal cell-wall-anchoring motif causing similar expression problems in Escherichia coli, (ii) a relatively high optimum temperature for activity for FTF enzymes, and (iii) at 50 degrees C, kinetics that are best described by the Hill equation.
TI  - Changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  - Whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. During this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. This study surveyed industry samples of Cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees C) and abuse (37.8 degrees C) temperatures. Samples stored at 4 degrees C did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. Mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees C. Whey samples derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. Starter cultures evaluated included Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. Whey derived from L. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees C as compared with the other cultures. Galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from L. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees C in comparison with the other cultures. Results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees C) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees C varies depending on the culture(s) used in cheese production.
TI  - Two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy FA from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy FA. Two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. Two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of Pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(S)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(S)-OH 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10,13-OH 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including L. casei subsp. casei, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-OH 18:1). Seven strains of L. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-OH 18:0) through 10-OH 18:1. Linoleic acid at 2 g/L was converted by L. acidophilus IFO13951T to 1.3 g of 13(S)-OH 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-OH 18:0 in 7 d. Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei JCM 1111 produced 10-OH 18:1 in 91% yield, and L. plantarum JCM 8341, 10-OH 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/L) under optimal conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of 13(S)-OH 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria, and of 10,13-OH 18:0 by any bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of urease genes cluster of Streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  - AIMS: The milk acidification rate of Streptococcus thermophilus strains can be affected by several factors, one of which is the hydrolysis of urea by the urease complex. To evaluate the technological suitability of S. thermophilus strains deprived of urease activity in milk fermentation, the genetic cluster related to urease enzymatic activity has been characterized in the type strain DSM 20167T. METHODS AND RESULTS: Amplification of the urease genes of S. thermophilus DSM 20167T was developed on the basis of the urease gene cluster of the phylogenetically related S. salivarius. Nucleotide sequencing revealed the presence of eight open reading frames, which were most homologous to ureABC (structural genes) and ureI, ureEFGD (accessory genes) of S. salivarius and other ureolytic bacteria. Reverse transcriptase PCR experiments were in agreement with an operon organization for the eight genes (ureIABCEFGD). A food grade mutant A16 (DeltaureC3) with a 693 bp in-frame deletion in ureC gene exhibited a urease negative (Ure-) phenotype. Unlike the wild-type strain, the acidification rate of the mutant in reconstituted skimmed milk was not affected by the presence of urea or nickel ions. A small-scale yoghurt fermentation trials were carried out using the wild-type or the Ure- mutant A16 (DeltaureC3) in co-culture with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 in presence of urea. The result obtained underlines that when the Ure- mutant was used as a co-starter the acidification rate was higher than that obtained using the wild-type strain. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides the first genetic characterization and the technological implication of S. thermophilus DSM 20617T urease activity. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The detrimental effect of ureolytic activity on the rate of milk acidification was evaluated and superseded using a food-grade Ure- recombinant strain. Small-scale yoghurt production trials highlighted the positive role of a Ure-S. thermophilus mutant as a co-starter in milk fermentations. Moreover, the vector pMI108 developed for the construction of the Ure- strain, should be considered as a potential tool for the generation of Ure- dairy S. thermophilus strains selected for other relevant technological properties but characterized by the undesirable ureolytic phenotype.
TI  - Multiple competitive PCR-DGGE as a tool for quantifying and profiling defined mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria during production of probiotics from complex polysaccharides.
AB  - AIMS: To apply a denaturing gradient gel electrophoretic (DGGE) method to quantify and profile individual strains during a mixed culture fermentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: DNA was extracted during the culture of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and amplified in a multiple competitive PCR (cPCR) using general primers targeting 16S rDNA and DNA from Streptococcus salivarius as competitive DNA. Subsequently the 200-kb amplified fragments were separated by DGGE. The method was validated in pure cultures and used to profile a mixture of three LAB grown on glucose, soluble starch and glycogen from mussel processing waste. The inclusion of a starch- and glycogen-degrading strain (Lactobacillus plantarum) and a weakly amylotic nisin-resistant strain (Lact. paracasei) allowed proliferation of the nisin producing Lactococcus lactis which in itself is unable to grow on complex carbohydrates. cPCR-DGGE permitted the monitoring of a different strain succession on the different carbohydrates, related to amylolytic activity and substrate consumption, acid production and nisin production. CONCLUSIONS: cPCR-DGGE is a useful tool for profiling defined mixed cultures of bacteria and hence allows their interaction to be studied. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Provided validation of the method for each specific case, it may be appropriate to monitor and control the reproducibility of any defined mixed culture of bacteria, with the advantage that an increase in the strain numbers to be monitored does not yield an increase in the labour of the procedure.
TI  - Susceptibility of oral bacteria to an antimicrobial decapeptide.
AB  - Naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides have emerged as alternative classes of antimicrobials. In general, these antimicrobial peptides exhibit selectivity for prokaryotes and minimize the problems of engendering microbial resistance. As an alternative method to search for more effective broad-spectrum peptide antimicrobials, investigators have developed peptide libraries by using synthetic combinatorial technology. A novel decapeptide, KKVVFKVKFK (KSL), has been identified that shows a broad range of antibacterial activity. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of this antimicrobial peptide in killing selected strains of oral pathogens and resident saliva bacteria collected from human subjects. Cytotoxic activity of KSL against mammalian cells and the structural features of this decapeptide were also investigated, the latter by using two-dimensional NMR in aqueous and DMSO solutions. MICs of KSL for the majority of oral bacteria tested in vitro ranged from 3 to 100 microg ml(-1). Minimal bactericidal concentrations of KSL were, in general, within one to two dilutions of the MICs. KSL exhibited an ED(99) (the dose at which 99 % killing was observed after 15 min at 37 degrees C) of 6.25 microg ml(-1) against selected strains of Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. In addition, KSL damaged bacterial cell membranes and caused 1.05 log units reduction of viability counts of saliva bacteria. In vitro toxicity studies showed that KSL, at concentrations up to 1 mg ml(-1), did not induce cell death or compromise the membrane integrity of human gingival fibroblasts. NMR studies suggest that KSL adopts an alpha-helical structure in DMSO solution, which mimics the polar aprotic membrane environment, whereas it remains unstructured in aqueous medium. This study shows that KSL may be a useful antimicrobial agent for inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria that are associated with caries development and early plaque formation.
TI  - The acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  - The intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. Plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. In addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to pH 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. The results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at pH 5.5 and 1% at pH 5.0, pH values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. At pH 5.0, members of the genus Streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. The other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, Streptococcus gordinii, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus salivarius and SStreptococcus sanguis. Analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.
TI  - [Design of primers to DNA of lactic acid bacteria].
AB  - Primers LP1-LP2 to the gene 16S rRNA have been developed, which permit to differentiate lactic acid bacteria: Lactobacillus plantarum, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. The strain-specific and species-specific differentiations are possible under different annealing temperature. Additional fragments, which are synthesized outside the framework of gene 16S rRNA reading, provide for the strain-specific type of differentiation, and the fragment F864 read in the gene 16S rRNA permits identifying L. plantarum.
TI  - The effect of temperature and pH on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a pH-auxostat study.
AB  - The growth of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a pH-auxostat. The computer-controlled smooth change of pH or temperature was used to study the effect of pH and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield Y(ATP) and specific lactate production rate Q(ATP)). The behaviour of mu and Q(ATP) with an increase of temperature suggested that ATP production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The decrease of Y(ATP) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while Q(ATP) remained constant or even increased. With the decrease of pH, decrease of both Y(ATP) and Q(ATP) was observed. S. thermophilus St20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees C was the most acid sensitive strain. The L. paracasei E1H3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to pH change. The behaviour of mixed culture of L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus in milk in a pH-auxostat with pH-decrease was in agreement with the pure culture experiments of the same species. The study showed that pH-auxostat with smooth controlled change of pH and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of LAB.
TI  - Influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  - Intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. The stimulus of the mucosal immunity is not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. In previous works we have demonstrated that some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. Taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis on the IgA secreting cells associated to bronchus. As shown before, oral immunostimulation with LAB induced an increase of the IgA* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. In this study it is also showed that the LAB assayed, with exception of L. acidophilus, were able to enhance IgA+ cells at bronchial level, being also this effect dose dependent. The increment induced by some LAB in the number of IgA+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be very important to prevent bronchus diseases.
TI  - Non-mutans streptococci in patients receiving radiotherapy in the head and neck area.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study mutans and non-mutans streptococci in patients after radiotherapy of the head and neck. METHODS: Oral rinse samples collected from nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before and after radiotherapy were diluted and cultured on nonselective and selective media for enumeration of total cultivable plaque flora, mutans and non-mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. Non-mutans streptococci were identified biochemically and by 16S rDNA sequence homology analysis. RESULTS: After irradiation, mutans streptococci were not isolated; the levels of Streptococcus mitis and lactobacilli increased significantly. The level of Streptococcus salivarius increased, but the significance was the borderline. The level of Streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly after irradiation. The abundance of other oral streptococci species showed no significant changes. CONCLUSIONS: S. mitis and S. salivarius are the predominant non-mutans streptococci in the high-caries-risk oral flora following radiotherapy.
TI  - Evaluation of clinical and microbiological features of deep carious lesions in primary molars.
AB  - PURPOSE: Concern about the survival of microorganisms in deep carious lesions may often lead to unnecessary exposure of the pulp during excavation. This study evaluated the relationship between microbiological and clinical results of deep carious lesions in primary molars. METHODS: Clinical evaluation was performed on 72 deep carious lesions considered to have pulp perforation after traditional excavation. The dentin color and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales using the technique of Bjorndal et al before restoration. For microbiological examination, dentin samples were taken by a sterile bur and transferred to transport fluid, then plated on tryptic soy agar for growth of total colony forming units. Samples werethen transferred on Rogosa SL agar for growth of oral lactobacilli and on mitis salivarius agar for growth of mutans streptococci. RESULTS: The proportion of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, and total colony forming units increased when the dentin color and consistency increased. However, the proportion of lactobacilli was smaller than that of mutans streptococci in carious dentin samples. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to expectations, the findings showed that the number of bacteria in carious dentin of primary molars was not significantly excessive.
TI  - Identification and screening for antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species isolated from healthy infant faeces.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile of 109 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from 32 healthy Korean infants was measured. The ability to show similar activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus was also looked for. Twelve of the 109 LAB showed activity against C. difficile and 19 strains were active against E. coli O157:H7, but none against S. aureus. Four strains had antimicrobial activity against both C. difficile and E. coli O157:H7. Of the 12 strains that had activity against C. difficile, four strains were excluded as Streptococcus species, while the other eight were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays using group-specific primers designed from the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. Based on the sequencing results, the eight strains screened were identified as Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus salivarius.
TI  - Correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult Sudanese.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult Sudanese. Whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 Sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). Levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. There were significantly ( P< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( P< or =0.01) lower percentages with Treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. The detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for Selenomonas sputigena, S. anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. salivarius and significantly lower for Porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( P< or =0.01). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( P< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. This study indicates that the levels of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and S. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and subgingival plaque.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in traditional African yoghurt fermentation.
AB  - Growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ATCC 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. Preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (NCIMB 11778) and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (NCIMB 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees C for 24 h. E. coli O157:H7 (10(5) CFU/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. Fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees C (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees C (to mimic African ambient temperature) for 5 days. After 24 h of fermentation, the pH of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees C decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees C, the pH decreased to pH 5.0 +/- 0.1. During this period, viable counts for E. coli O157:H7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) CFU/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees C wherein viability declined to 10(4) CFU/ml. In fermented (25-30 degrees C) milk stored at 4 degrees C for 5 days, E. coli O157:H7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) CFU/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees C resulted in loss of detectable cells. In contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees C for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. Stationary phase E. coli O157:H7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees C) survived during 4 degrees C storage, but not 25 degrees C storage. Fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of E. coli O157:H7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.
TI  - [Searching for restriction endonucleases, finding out the heterogeneity of the 16S rRNA in some species of lactic acid bacteria].
AB  - The preliminary test of carbohydrates fermentation has been carried out to confirm a regular position for some lactic acid bacteria strains. Restriction cards have been compiled for Lactobacillus plantarum, L. delbrueckii and Streptococcus salivarius using Vector NTI program. A comparative analysis of the restriction cards has shown presence of unique sites of restriction endonucleases, which can be used for differentiation of the above-stated species.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - Expression of a streptococcal glucosyltransferase as a fusion to a solute-binding protein in Lactobacillus fermentum BR11.
AB  - BspA is a non-covalently anchored cystine-binding protein from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11. It has previously been used to present antigens derived from infectious organisms on the L. fermentum BR11 cell surface. In this study, the capacity of BspA to present a very large polypeptide was tested. A temperature sensitive plasmid was constructed that encodes a 175-kDa chimeric protein consisting of a fusion between BspA and an N-terminally truncated derivative of the Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 25975 glucosyltransferase GtfJ. This plasmid was introduced into the L. fermentum genome. Integrants were able to incorporate 20-40 nmol sucrose derived glucose into glucan per ml culture per optical density unit. The glucosyltransferase activity was external to the cytoplasmic membrane and bound to the cell. Unlike native BspA, the BspA-GtfJ fusion could not be removed from the cell by 5 M LiCl wash.
TI  - Behavior of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in yogurt fermented  with a bacteriocin-producing thermophilic starter.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus B producing a bacteriocin active against Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644 and Staphylococcus aureus SAD 30 was isolated from bakery yeast. The bacteriocin was partially purified by an adsorption/desorption technique, and its spectrum of action was compared to that of a neutralized cell-free supernatant (CFS). Although the CFS inhibited a number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria of health and spoilage significance, the spectrum of action of the partially purified bacteriocin was limited to gram-positive bacteria. L. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to both preparations. The bacteriocin-producing streptococcal strain was used in combination with a Bac- Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CY strain isolated from commercial yogurt to assess the effectiveness of the resulting thermophilic starter in controlling L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in yogurt during fermentation and storage at refrigeration (ca. 7 degrees C) or abuse (ca. 22 degrees C) temperature. Yogurt samples were contaminated with L. monocytogenes or S. aureus to the approximate levels of 10(3) and 10(6) CFU/ml of milk, respectively. The results showed that in situ bacteriocin production was more active against L. monocytogenes than against S. aureus in vitro and in contaminated samples. While L. monocytogenes leveled off below the detectable limit in a 1-ml sample of yogurt within 24 h of processing, S. aureus survived in Bac+ and Bac- samples during 10 days of storage at room temperature (ca. 22 degrees C). Use of a Bac+ starter resulted in a 5-day extension of the shelf life.
TI  - Simulation modelling of bacterial growth in yoghurt.
AB  - INDISIM, an individual-based simulator, was used to specifically study the influence of the shape and size of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt processing. To this effect, two different sets of simulations were carried out. In the first set of simulations, it was assumed that the initial acidity of the medium has the same value as the acidity of the cytoplasm of the microorganisms. Hence, the differences in bacterial growth by the two species are only attributable to differences in their geometry. It was found that, in an optimum culture, the growth in biomass of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus is larger than that of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. An important factor for understanding this difference might be the larger mass-to-surface ratio of the former. In the second set of simulations, a simplified model of yoghurt, the parametrisation differs both in the geometry and the metabolism of the two species. The results of these simulations are in very good qualitative agreement with the experimental data of [Lait 69 (1989) 519]. Finally, by inhibiting the uptake of amino acids by S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, the large relative importance of lactic acid in yoghurt processing was highlighted.
TI  - A clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic study of deep caries lesions after incomplete caries removal.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic changes in deep caries lesions were assessed after incomplete carious dentin removal and tooth sealing. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Thirty-two teeth with deep caries lesions were studied. Treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of calcium hydroxide, and sealing for a 6- to 7-month period. The color and consistency of the dentin were clinically assessed. Differences in radiographic density were assessed by digital image subtraction. Microbiologic samples were obtained from the demineralized dentin before the temporary sealing and after the experimental period. The samples were cultivated on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in Mitis Salivarius agar, and Rogosa selective Lactobacillus agar. RESULTS: Two cases were lost during the study; one presented pulpal necrosis. In the other case, there was pulpal exposure during removal of provisional sealing. In all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was soft and wet; one lesion was yellow, 21 were light brown, and eight were dark brown. After treatment, the dentin was dry, and 80.00% of specimens were hard, 16.67% were leathery, and 3.33% remained soft. The dentin was light brown in five teeth and dark brown in 25. There was a statistically significant mean difference in radiographic density (pixel intensity), 88.77 +/- 7.02 in the control areas and 94.66 +/- 6.75 in the test areas. The counts of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, lactobacilli, and Streptococci mutans had decreased significantly by the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: Incomplete removal of carious dentin and subsequent tooth sealing resulted in the arrest of the lesions, suggesting that complete dentinal caries lesion removal is not essential to the control of caries lesions.
TI  - Molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  - Although substantial epidemiologic evidence links Streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. Molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. The purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ECC) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. Cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal DNAs from a healthy subject and a subject with ECC were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. Ten novel phylotypes were identified. A number of species or phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant further investigation. In addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. Significant differences were observed for nine species: S. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, Actinomyces gerencseriae, Bifidobacterium, S. mutans, Veillonella, S. salivarius, S. constellatus, S. parasanguinis, and Lactobacillus fermentum were associated with caries. These data suggest that A. gerencseriae and other Actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel Bifidobacterium may be a major pathogen in deep caries. Further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of ZnCl(2) on glycolysis in human oral microbes.
AB  - Although the inhibition of bacterial glycolysis by zinc ions might be expected to moderate dental caries, there has not been a comparison of the effect of Zn on different organisms under both fixed pH and free-fall conditions. Here, the effect of ZnCl(2) on Streptococcus salivarius, Strep. mutans, Strep. sobrinus, Actinomyces naeslundii and Lactobacillus casei, as well as on mixtures of oral organisms outgrown from human dental plaque and saliva, was surveyed. pH-stat experiments were performed at pH 7, 6 or 5 in a solution containing 5% glucose and a suspension of the test organism; pH-fall experiments started at pH 7. In both cases, acid production was monitored for 60 min, when samples were taken for Zn and lactate determinations. Under pH-stat conditions, acid production was inhibited by Zn most strongly in Strep. sobrinus and Strep. salivarius. In terms of total acid production averted, however, the effect of Zn under both pH-stat and pH-fall conditions was clearly greatest with Strep. salivarius. A. naeslundii was inhibited the least strongly under pH-stat conditions. Cultured oral organism mixtures were more sensitive to moderate concentrations of zinc (0.2-0.3mM initial concentration) than were the single species to higher concentrations (1mM). Packed cell layers responded to Zn quite differently from suspensions, the pH often falling in the presence of 1mM Zn at a rate similar to the no Zn control. As streptococci had the highest acidogenesis rates in both pH-stat and pH-fall experiments, it seems likely that inhibition of acid production with these organisms would be of more value in moderating caries than the inhibition of less acidogenic organisms such as A. naeslundii.
TI  - Prediction of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus populations in yoghurt by Curie point pyrolysis-mass spectrometry.
AB  - We evaluated the potential of pyrolysis-mass spectrometry (PyMS) for quantifying  the binary mixed population of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt. For this purpose, a new analytical approach was developed. The yoghurt was transparised and its total bacterial population was recovered by centrifugation and estimated by turbidimetric measurement. The quantity of each population (L. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus) was then estimated in the pellet by PyMS, and the data were analysed by artificial neural networks (ANNs). In parallel, streptococci and lactobacilli were numerated on SYL agar and these data were used as reference values to predict the bacterial counts of each population by PyMS. A close correlation was established between the streptococci and the lactobacilli counts on SYL agar and PyMS measurements (r(2)=0.98 for S. thermophilus and r(2)=0.96 for L. bulgaricus). Combined turbidimetric measurement and PyMS/ANNs seemed to be a powerful method for obtaining rapid counts of binary mixtures of bacteria in yoghurt.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. METHODS AND RESULTS: The crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. The isolates were identified using tDNA-PCR. Lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. A Lactobacillus species related to L. fermentum and L. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. Three pigeons carried Enterococcus cecorum. Minor species found were E. columbae, E. faecalis, E. hirae, L. johnsonii, L. salivarius, and Streptococcus gallolyticus. A description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the L. agilis pigeon strains. CONCLUSIONS, SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: L. agilis is found to be the main component of the LAB flora in the pigeon crop.
TI  - Alteration of the coadherence of Candida albicans with oral bacteria by dietary sugars.
AB  - Interactions between bacterial oral flora and Candida albicans are important in denture plaque formation. This study therefore first aimed to quantify the coadherence of C. albicans and bacteria by the use of a bioluminescent adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay based on the firefly luciferase-luciferin system. The second aim was to examine the effect of i) dietary sugars (used for preculture) and ii) enzymatic digestion of fungi on the coadherence. When yeast was preincubated in yeast nitrogen base medium (YNB) supplemented with 250 mM glucose, the yeast coadhered with all isolates of Streptoccus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, and no significant coadhesion was observed with the isolates of Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus and Actinomyces. However, when the yeast was precultured in YNB supplemented with 500 mM galactose, the yeast coadhered with S. salivarius and Actinomyces, which was not observed when the yeast was grown in YNB with glucose. In addition, the coadherence of the yeast with the isolates of S. sanguis was significantly reduced. Enzymatic digestion of yeast and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that expression of at least two types of proteinaceous adhesins are involved in these phenomena.
TI  - [Viability and activity of the lactic bacteria (Streptococcus salivarius ssp thermophilus y Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus) del yogurt en Venezuela].
AB  - National and international legislations have agreed that the population of lactic bacteria in yogurt must be viable and not less than 10(6) ufc/g. In Venezuela, during last years, observations indicate that the number of viable cells in some commercial samples show high variations, as low levels. This research attempted to find the origin of this problem in the local industry. For this purpose 105 commercial samples were analyzed during their shelf life and 32 samples of yogurt prepared in the laboratory following the flow diagram of the local industry. The different conditions of freeze dried lactic culture, were also analyzed. These samples were evaluated for viable cell count of lactic bacteria and possible variations of pH and acidity. The absence or low number of lactic bacteria detected in some commercial samples is due to the use of inadequate working cultures that show imbalanced proportions of the two microorganisms, besides a low count below 106 ufc/g. The succesive propagation and storage time of mother culture, and the overacidification of the product, produce subletal injury to the microbial cells of the yogurt starter culture. The data indicate that manufacturing practices significantly affect the survival of the lactic flora.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of MoAbs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A surface protein antigen (PAc) of Streptococcus mutans, particularly the A-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components on the tooth surface. It might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of antibodies against the adherence of S. mutans to the tooth surface. We investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) obtained by immunization of synthetic PAc peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the A-region. These MoAbs recognize several core B-cell epitopes in the sequence. Two (KH5 and SH2) of these antibodies reacted with both S. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, but not with Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Porphyromonas gingivalis or Lactobacillus casei. They clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of S. mutans to salivary components in a biosensor. KH5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of S. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. These results suggested that the core B-cell epitope (-Y---L--Y----) recognized by KH5 was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of PAc protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. Therefore, the amino acid residues were found to be important in the initial attachment of S. mutans to the tooth surface. These results provide for the mechanism of PAc molecule in the initial attachment of S. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of S. mutans and S. sobrinus from the oral cavity.
TI  - The effect of oral bacteria on Candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  - A total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral Candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. Briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a C. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees C for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive Candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. In general, out of eight bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis SK21A, Streptococcus salivarius SK56, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and S. salivarius OBU3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different C albicans isolates. Porphyromonas gingivalis Pg 50, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 7469 and Prevotella intermedia OBU4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas S. sanguis OBU 2 had no effect. E. coli ATCC 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). A significant increase in the germ tube production of C. albicans isolated from HIV-infected compared with HIV-free individuals was also noted. The current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of C. albicans isolates.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of dentin bonding systems, polyacid-modified composite resins and composite resins.
AB  - This study examined the antibacterial activities of the bonding systems Syntac, EBS and Scotchbond 1, the polyacid-modified composite resins Hytac and Compoglass, and the composite resins Tetric, Z100 and Scalp-it. They were evaluated using the cariogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus sorbinus and Actinomyces viscosus in vitro with a modified cylinder drop plate agar diffusion assay. All adhesives of the dentin bonding systems and the polyacid-modified composite resins exhibited various degrees of antibacterial activity against all of the test bacteria. On the contrary, composite resins did not affect bacterial growth. The data suggest that the use of these adhesives and polyacid-modified composite resins may reduce the consequences of microleakage owing to their antibacterial properties.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of Thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of Thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. Among 3790 isolates (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans DTMU 1, Strep. salivarius DTMU 1, Strep. sanguis DTMU 1, Candida albicans ATCC 13803 and C. albicans DTMU 2, as well as the oral pathogens. These antimicrobial isolates included L17 and N14 which showed the antibacterial activity, D14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and D6 and N8 which showed both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. The isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. They could utilize casein but could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. Their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by pH, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. The activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at pH > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees C. However, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. When the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. The final identification revealed that D6, D14 and N14 were Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and L17 and N8 were Lact. rhamnosus.
TI  - Production and monomer composition of exopolysaccharides by yogurt starter cultures.
AB  - As components of starter cultures for Bulgarian yogurt, Streptococcus salivarius  subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus revealed extensive exopolysaccharide (EPS) production activity when cultivated in whole cow's milk. The polymer-forming activity of thermophilic streptococci was lower (230-270 mg EPS/L) than that of the lactobacilli (400-540 mg EPS/L). Mixed cultures stimulated EPS production in yogurt manufacture, and a maximum concentration of 720-860 mg EPS/L was recorded after full coagulation of milk. The monomer structure of the exopolysaccharides formed by the yogurt starter cultures principally consists of galactose and glucose (1:1), with small amounts of xylose, arabinose, and/or mannose.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
TI  - Behavior of enterotoxigenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus in milk fermented with a yogurt starter culture.
AB  - The ability of a yogurt starter culture formed by Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus to inhibit the growth of four enterotoxin type A and B producers Staphylococcus aureus strains (ATCC 6538, S6, FRI-100 and a strain isolated from milk) during fermentation of milk and subsequent storage was investigated. Sterile skim milk was inoculated with about 10(6) CFU/ml of S. aureus and with about 10(6) CFU of starter culture, and incubated at 42 degrees C during 8 h, followed by refrigeration at 4 degrees C. Samples were taken every 2 h during fermentation and every 2 days during storage. Viable count of lactic acid bacteria and S. aureus as well as pH, acidity, thermostable deoxyribonuclease (TNase) and staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) production were evaluated. Behavior of four strains was similar; S. aureus survived the 8 h fermentation with LAB, and its population began to decrease from the first day of storage, being completely inhibited at 9-10 days. TNase and SEA production were positive in all samples taken along the study. It was demonstrated that enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus were able to survive the fermentation of milk with a yogurt starter culture and they were inhibited after several days during storage of the fermented product, contrary to the general belief which considered it very difficult due to the low pH. Even though S. aureus was inhibited, TNase and SEA were demonstrable along the storage. Therefore, fermented milks may play an important role in the transmission of this organism.
TI  - Oral bacteriotherapy as maintenance treatment in patients with chronic pouchitis: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. Most patients have relapsing disease, and no maintenance treatment study has been performed. We evaluated the efficacy of a probiotic preparation (VSL#3) containing 5 x 10(11) per gram of viable lyophilized bacteria of 4 strains of lactobacilli, 3 strains of bifidobacteria, and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus compared with placebo in maintenance of remission of chronic pouchitis. METHODS: Forty patients in clinical and endoscopic remission were randomized to receive either VSL#3, 6 g/day, or an identical placebo for 9 months. Patients were assessed clinically every month and endoscopically and histologically every 2 months or in the case of a relapse. Fecal samples were collected for stool culture before and after antibiotic treatment and each month during maintenance treatment. RESULTS: Three patients (15%) in the VSL#3 group had relapses within the 9-month follow-up period, compared with 20 (100%) in the placebo group (P < 0.001). Fecal concentration of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and S. thermophilus increased significantly from baseline levels only in the VSL#3-treated group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that oral administration of this new probiotic preparation is effective in preventing flare-ups of chronic pouchitis.
TI  - Probiotic culture survival and implications in fermented frozen yogurt characteristics.
AB  - Low-fat ice cream mix was fermented with probiotic-supplemented and traditional starter culture systems and evaluated for culture survival, composition, and sensory characteristics of frozen product. Fermentations were stopped when the titratable acidity reached 0.15% greater than the initial titratable acidity (end point 1) or when the pH reached 5.6 (end point 2). Mix was frozen and stored for 11 wk at -20 degrees C. The traditional yogurt culture system contained the strains Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. The probiotic-supplemented system contained the traditional cultures as well as Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus. We compared recovery of Bifodobacterium by three methods, a repair-detection system with roll-tubes and plates on modified bifid glucose medium and plates with maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial medium. Culture bacteria in both systems did not decrease in the yogurt during frozen storage. The roll-tube method with modified bifid glucose agar and repair detection system provided at least one-half log10 cfu/ml higher recovery of B. longum compared with recoveries using modified bifid glucose agar or maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial agar on petri plates. No change in concentrations of lactose or protein for products fermented with either culture system occurred during storage. Acid flavor was more intense when product was fermented to pH 5.6, but yogurt flavor was not intensified. The presence of probiotic bacteria in the supplemented system seemed to cause no differences in protein and lactose concentration and sensory characteristics.
TI  - Quantification of micro-organisms in binary mixed populations by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy.
AB  - Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used for the first time to determine the ratios of different microorganisms in mixtures. Exemplarily, systems composed of two food-associated yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae/Hanseniaspora uvarum) and two yoghurt lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus/Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) were investigated. Determination of the cell number ratio in the lactic acid bacteria system was possible with a minimal prediction accuracy of +/- 16 ratio percentage points while the minimum accuracy of prediction in the yeast two-component system was +/- 4% (both at a 95% confidence level). These results show that FT-IR spectroscopy is potentially a rapid method for the quantification of cell ratios in mixtures of two different microorganisms, provided that the cell ratio does not drop below a certain, system-specific threshold.
TI  - Impact on the composition of the faecal flora by a new probiotic preparation: preliminary data on maintenance treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) oral compounds are the standard maintenance treatment for ulcerative colitis in remission, some patients cannot use them because of side-effects. Clinical and experimental observations have suggested the potential role of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease therapy. AIM: To evaluate the effects on intestinal microflora and the clinical efficacy of a new probiotic preparation in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with ulcerative colitis, intolerant or allergic to 5-ASA, have been treated with a new probiotic preparation (VSL#3, CSL, Milan, Italy) containing 5x10(11) cells/g of 3 strains of bifidobacteria, 4 strains of lactobacilli and 1 strain of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Two doses of 3 g were administered o.d. for 12 months. Faecal samples for stool culture were obtained from the patients at the beginning of the trial and after 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, 90 days, 12 months and at 15 days after the end of the treatment. The following bacterial groups have been evaluated in the faeces: total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, enterococci, Streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms. Patients were assessed clinically every two months, and assessed endoscopically at 6 and 12 months or in relapse. RESULTS: Faecal concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased significantly in all patients, compared to their basal level, from the 20th day of treatment (P<0.05) and remained stable throughout the study. Concentrations of Bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms, total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria did not change significantly during treatment (P = N.S.). Fifteen of 20 treated patients remained in remission during the study, one patient was lost to follow up, while the remaining relapsed. No significant side-effects have been reported. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that this probiotic preparation is able to colonize the intestine, and suggest that it may be useful in maintaining the remission in ulcerative colitis patients intolerant or allergic to 5-ASA. Controlled trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.
TI  - Starter culture activity in refrigerated fermented soymilk.
AB  - The refrigerated shelf life of soymilk fermented with single cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum, L. casei, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum was evaluated. During storage at 4 degrees C for 28 days, the stability of the microflora differed markedly among the starter cultures. After 28 days, the average numbers of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus decreased by two log cycles to 6.0 x 10(7) CFU/ml, whereas those of L. casei increased gradually by more than two log cycles to 4.6 x 10(9) CFU/ml. Numbers of B. longum and L. fermentum remained moderately high (8.7 x 10(8) CFU/ml and 3.7 x 10(8) CFU/ml, respectively) even after 28 days of storage. S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and L. casei continued to metabolize sucrose during the storage period, but the pattern of consumption was different among the strains. The other starter cultures did not seem to have significant activity (P > 0.05) on the residual sugars. In most cases, L(+)-lactate predominated.
TI  - Study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. Antigens administered orally can interact with M cells of Peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. We have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance the gut inflammatory immune response. The aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. We studied IgA+ and IgM+ B cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and CD4+ T cells and IgA anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by oral administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. plantarum, Lb. rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. The increase in the IgA+ B cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the IgA cycle by interaction with M cells from Peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. The IgM+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from IgM+ to IgA+. The increase in the CD4+ cells suggests interaction of Peyer's patches and enhancement of the B- and T-cell migration. The anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. We demonstrated that Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were able to interact with Peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in IgA-, CD4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. Although Lb. rhamnosus and Strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. Lactococcus lactis and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of IgA+ cells entering the IgA cycle but not CD4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated B lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. We did not determine specific antibodies against Lc. lactis or Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - Note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of Bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  - Pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis and Bif. bifidum), Lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. The appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. Of the selective media, AMC, RMS, NPNL and BL-OG performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lact. acidophilus. However, of these four media, AMC was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. The AMC agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with ducks.
AB  - The diversity of lactic acid bacteria occurring in the crop and intestinal content of ducks of different ages (5 to 34 days) was evaluated using the RAPD-PCR technique and comparative sequence analysis of 16S rRNA. Cluster analysis derived from isolates grown on Rogosa agar used for the enrichment of lactic acid bacteria, revealed at least twenty six different groups of organisms representing species, subspecies and strains belonging to Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Pediococcus, Weissella and Lactobacillus. Homofermentative and heterofermentative lactobacilli were identified, belonging to the phylogenetically defined Lb. acidophilus, Lb. salivarius and Lb. reuteri groups.
TI  - Bacteria used for the production of yogurt inactivate carcinogens and prevent DNA damage in the colon of rats.
AB  - Lactic acid-producing bacteria prevent carcinogen-induced preneoplastic lesions and tumors in rat colon. Because the mechanisms responsible for these protective effects are unknown, two strains of lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CH3, that are used to produce yogurt, were investigated in vitro and in vivo to elucidate their potential to deactivate carcinogens. Using the "Comet assay" to detect genetic damage, we found that L. bulgaricus 191R applied orally to rats could prevent 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced DNA breaks in the colon in vivo, whereas St. thermophilus CH3 were not effective. However, in vitro, both strains prevented DNA damage induced by N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) in isolated primary rat colon cells. Extracts prepared from milk fermented with St. thermophilus CH3 were as efficient in deactivating MNNG as was L-cysteine. Isolated metabolites arising from bacteria during fermentation in the colon or in milk [L(+) lactate, D(-) lactate, palmitic acid and isopalmitic acid] were not effective. We postulate that thiol-containing breakdown products of proteins, via catalysis by bacterial proteases, could be one mechanism by which MNNG or other carcinogens are deactivated in the gut lumen resulting in reduced damage to colonic mucosal cells.
TI  - Acid-regulated proteins induced by Streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  - Our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal pH values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low pH (pH 3.0-4.0) that kills unadapted control cells maintained at pH 7.5 (Oral Microbiol Immunol 1997: 12: 266-273). In this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low pH. For this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from pH 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14C]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. The cells were extracted for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. Of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in pH homeostasis. Streptococcus mutans LT11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. The enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kDa. Within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane H+/ATPase. By comparison, the strong responder, Lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. Streptococcus salivarius AT2 and Streptococcus gordonii TH12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10,556 and Streptococcus oralis ATCC 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. Even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low pH, such as Streptococcus sobrinus CH125/43, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 12,261 and Actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. Clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low pH is related, not to the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal pH homeostasis.
TI  - Acid production from lactulose by dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Representative strains of oral streptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were incubated overnight with lactulose or other carbohydrates and the final pH recorded. Most bacteria tested were able to metabolize lactulose with the exception of strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lact. fermentum. Streptococcus mutans produced most acid overnight but the initial rate of acid production from lactulose by uninduced cultures was very low. Plaque pH was monitored in 12 volunteers following rinsing the mouth with lactulose, sucrose or sorbitol or Lactulose BP. These studies in vivo showed both lactulose and Lactulose BP to exhibit low acidogenic potential. Thus, although plaque bacteria are capable of fermenting lactulose, the results suggest that lactulose is likely to pose a small acidogenic challenge to teeth under normal conditions of use.
TI  - Cell wall anchoring of the Streptococcus pyogenes M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The M6 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. Based on the observation that the C-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the M6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several Lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing Lactobacillus fermentum strain, Lactobacillus sake, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. The M6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. In lactobacilli, essentially all detectable M6 protein was cell wall associated. These results suggest the feasibility of using the C-terminal anchor moiety of M6 for protein surface display in LAB.
TI  - Inhibition of purified enolases from oral bacteria by fluoride.
AB  - Enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (Ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microM or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mM inorganic phosphate ions. In this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. The molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kDa. The Vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 IU/mg and K(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mM. Enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with Ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microM in the presence of 5 mM inorganic phosphate ions. Ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mM. The enolase from Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (Ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 10575 (Ki = 19 +/- 2) or Streptococcus mutans NCTC 10449 (Ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either Actinomyces naeslundii WVU 627 (Ki = 46 +/- 6) or Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 (Ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. The levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.
TI  - Rapid procedure for acid adaptation of oral lactic-acid bacteria and further characterization of the response.
AB  - Acid-adaptive responses could be induced readily in oral lactic-acid bacteria by  growing them in batch cultures with excess sugar or more conveniently and rapidly by transferring cells to acidified growth media for the time required for biomass doubling. The response of Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was induced in a progressive rather than all-or-nothing way, and the extent of acid tolerance was inversely related to the pH of the inducing medium over a range from 8.5 to 5. The weak acids fluoride, acetate, or lactate did not measurably enhance acid adaptation, and so the response did not appear to depend primarily on changes in delta pH or the proton motive force across the cell membrane. Transcription and translation to form new proteins did appear to be necessary, as indicated by inhibition of adaptation by rifampin or chloramphenicol and by lack of adaptation by cells suspended in phosphate buffer at pH 5. Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus casei were acid adapted by the rapid method, and the method appeared to be generally useful for oral lactic-acid bacteria. The rapid induction of the response in multiple oral lactic-acid bacteria suggests that it is of general importance for maintaining a diversity of organisms in the oral microbiota, which is regularly subjected to acid stresses.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dentin bonding systems, resin-modified glass ionomers,  and polyacid-modified composite resins.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems Syntac, ProBOND, Gluma 3-Step, the resin-modified glass ionomers Photac-Fil, Fuji Lining LC, Fuji II LC, and the polyacid-modified composite resins VariGlass, Geristore, and Infinity were evaluated using the cariogenic bacteria S mutans, L salivarius, S sobrinus, and A viscosus in vitro with a modified cylinder drop plate agar diffusion assay. All glass ionomers, the polyacid-modified composites, and the primers and adhesives of the dentin bonding systems exhibited various degrees of antibacterial activity against most of the test bacteria. The antibacterial activity of the adhesives of dentin bonding systems was anticipated because of the glutaraldehyde used in their formulations. However, the antibacterial activity of the various primers was unexpected and indicates a dual antibacterial action of these systems.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings in tonsillitis and pericoronitis.
AB  - Bacteriologic samples from 31 young men were cultured quantitatively for aerobes  and anaerobes; these samples included 31 specimens of tonsils (16 infected and 15 healthy), 16 specimens from pericoronal pockets of lower third molars (11 infected and 5 symptom-free), and 6 postoperative specimens from lower-third-molar extraction sockets. Anaerobes were isolated more often from infected third molars than from infected tonsils (14.5 isolates vs. 8.4 isolates, respectively; P < .001). Infected tonsil samples contained significantly more anaerobic species if an adjacent partly erupted lower third molar was present rather than absent (10.3 isolates vs. 6.9 isolates, respectively; P < .05). Eubacterium aerofaciens, Clostridium species, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Prevotella oris were frequently isolated. Streptococcus salivarius was found more frequently in tonsillar specimens, whereas Corynebacterium species, Prevotella denticola, Capnocytophaga species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Lactobacillus species were more common in pericoronal pocket samples. Thus, partial eruption of lower third molars increases the number of anaerobic bacterial species on tonsils and many species can be isolated simultaneously from both tonsils and lower third molars.
TI  - Salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius T140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and/or Propionibacterium acnes. Strain T140, isolated from the surface of Japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. Since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by T140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. Strain T140 required a high initial pH (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.
TI  - Inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-P), has been documented for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Lactococcus lactis, but not for other Gram-positive bacteria. Using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that Enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase that phosphorylates Ser-46 in HPr of the phosphotransferase system. A small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, HPr(Ser-P)-activated sugar-P phosphatase (Pase II), previously identified only in Lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, or Bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. Further, Lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks Pase II. The results reveal that Pase II is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-P hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. They provide correlative evidence that Pase II initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of yogurt.
AB  - Yogurt is milk fermented by a mixture of two bacteria: Lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. Epidemiological studies have correlated a reduced risk of colon cancer with yogurt consumption. Independent studies have established that yogurt and extracts thereof are antimutagenic. Although multiple explanations can account for yogurt's putative anticarcinogenicity, we are interested in testing the hypothesis that antimutagenic compounds produced during fermentation are responsible. We recently reported on the antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt against the experimental carcinogens N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and 3.2'dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) (Mutation Res. (1995) 334, 213-224). We are now aware that palmitic acid is an active ingredient against MNNG.
TI  - Lowering of ochratoxin A level in milk by yoghurt bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  - A decrease in the content of ochratoxin A (OA) was observed in milk samples fermented by yoghurt bacteria and bifidobacteria. OA was added to the milk before fermentation at a rate of 0.05-1.5 mg/L. No residues of OA were found in samples containing 0.05 and 0.1 mg/L of OA, fermented by S. Salivarius subsp. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and B. bifidum. Yoghurt bacteria (S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) were the most effective since no residues were detected even in fermented samples containing originally 0.5 mg/L OA.
TI  - Microbial induction of dentinal caries in human teeth in vitro.
AB  - The ability of Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus sobrinus, Actinomyces viscosus, and Streptococcus salivarius to induce dental caries was determined in vitro. A class I cavity (depth: 2mm) was prepared in extracted human caries-free premolars to make dentin blocks. The blocks were inoculated with these four bacterial strains in a monoinfective fashion and were incubated under anaerobic conditions. In addition to the monoinfection groups, mixed-infection groups of L. Casei with S. sobrinus or A. viscosus were also prepared. Half of the culture medium was renewed every 3 days, and the pH of the medium was measured. After 4 or 12 wk, these dentin blocks were prepared by Brown-Brenn staining and by contact microradiography for light microscopic observation and for immunohistochemical staining. The final pH of the S. salivarius group was the highest among the experimental groups, at approximately 5.1; that of the others was approximately 4.3. Bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules was observed in all but the S. salivarius group. Among the monoinfection groups, the S. sobrinus group showed the highest invasion rate, followed by the A. Viscosus group and the L. casei group. The invasion rate was also high in the mixed-infection groups. Immunohistochemical staining revealed invasion only by L. casei, and not by S. sobrinus and A. viscosus. The invasion rate by L. casei was higher in the mixed-infection group with either S. sobrinus or A. viscosus than in the monoinfection groups. These findings suggest that lactobacillus might play an important role in the initiation and progress of dentinal caries, and that this bacterial species might exhibit a cooperative cariogenicity when it coexists with other bacterial species that surpasses its individual cariogenicity.
TI  - [Comparison of methods for the detection and enumeration of lactic acid bacteria  in yogurt].
AB  - It is generally agreed that the population of lactic acid bacteria in yogurt must be not less than 10(6) ufc/g. Viability of the lactic flora until the end of shelf-life is affected for many factors, which has incidence in the recuperability of this microflora. MRS and LEE agar were selected for the total count of lactic bacteria, the M17 was used for the S salivarius ssp thermophilus and the RCA for L. delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus. Different methodologies were used for detection and enumeration of this bacteria: direct plate count; thermal treatment and recuperation of the injured cells in Soy Tripticase broth. The enumeration was done at time zero and 3 hours after the start of the fermentative process and during storage at 4, 12 and 21 days. The results shown an excellent recuperability of the lactic flora in the selected media and methods that were used: however the enumeration was significatively lower in the RCA agar. The counts in the LEE agar shown a better recuperability. The thermal treatment affected negatively the counts of lactic flora and the repair method shown better results in the yogurt sample during storage. pH and acidity were determined at the beginning and during the storage period. It was observed a pH decrease because of the lactic acid production at the end of shelf-life.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Distribution of proteins similar to IIIManH and IIIManL of the Streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  - In Streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins EI and HPr, the specific membrane-bound IIIMan, and two forms of a protein called IIIMan, with molecular weights of 38,900 (IIIManH) and 35,200 (IIIManL), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the membrane. Several lines of evidence suggest that IIIManH and/or IIIManL are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. To determine whether other bacteria possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Three approaches were used to determine whether the IIIMan proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-IIIManH and anti-IIIManH rabbit polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of PEP-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-IIIMan antibodies of the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. Only the species S. salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of IIIMan. Fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. In the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of PEP. No such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. A III(Man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in Lactobacillus casei by Western blot experiments as well as by PEP-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-III(Man) antibodies was detected in Lactococcus lactis. In several cases, the involvement of these putative III(Man) proteins in the PEP-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-III(Man) antibodies. No proteins cross-reacting with anti-III(Man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and E. coli. In S. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. This protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of PEP.
TI  - Influence of bile on beta-galactosidase activity of component species of yogurt starter cultures.
AB  - The influence of bile on beta-galactosidase activity and the cellular integrity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus were tested. Two strains (OS 1 and OS 2) of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and three strains (HC 15, 17, and 18) of S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus were studied. In the presence of .15% oxgall, beta-galactosidase activity of whole cells of both species was significantly increased. However, at a higher concentration (.3% oxgall), the beta-galactosidase activity was significantly less than in the presence of .15% oxgall. The presence of oxgall did not promote the cell lysis of any of the strains of either species. Additionally, the presence of oxgall did not cause the leakage of the enzyme from the cells. Thus, the presence of oxgall increased the cellular permeability to allow more substrate to enter the cells, thereby increasing beta-galactosidase activity, and, at higher concentrations, was inhibitory to beta-galactosidase activity of both species.
TI  - On-line estimation of biological variables during pH controlled lactic acid fermentations.
AB  - Indirect measurement of lactose, galactose, lactic acid, and biomass concentration from on-line sodium hydroxide weight measurements have been obtained for pure and mixed batch cultures of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus 404 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 398 conducted at controlled pH and temperature. Linear correlations were established between the equivalent sodium hydroxide concentration and the lactose (substrate), galactose and lactic acid (products) concentrations while nonlinear relationships were developed between biomass and lactic acid concentrations. These nonlinear relationships took into account the inhibitory effect of lactic acid on growth and acidification. The indirect measurements of biomass concentration were introduced into a nonlinear estimator of the state variables and of the specific growth and lactic acid production rates. Good agreement was found between estimated and measured biomass concentrations (error index ranging from 10.8% to 12.6%). The results showed the feasibility of on-line estimation of biomass concentration and of the specific kinetics from NaOH addition weight measurements and its applicability for monitoring lactic acid fermentations. Using off-line measurements of L(+) and D(-) lactic acid concentrations, the evolution of the concentration of each strain in mixed cultures was obtained from the relationships proposed for the mixed cultures.

TI  - Antimutagenicity of fermented milk.
AB  - Reconstituted nonfat dry milk was fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus CH65, Lactobacillus acidophilus BG2FO4, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus CH3, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R, and by a mixture of the latter two organisms. The fermented milks were then freeze-dried, extracted in acetone, dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and assayed for antimutagenicity in the Ames test (Salmonella typhimurium TA 100) against N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl. Dose-dependent activity was significant against both mutagens in all extracts. Maximal inhibitory activity against 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl and N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitroso-guanidine was 2- and 2.7-fold greater, respectively, than that exhibited by extracts of unfermented milk. Extracts of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R were examined further. Compounds that were responsible for activity against both mutagens were less soluble in aqueous solutions than in dimethylsulfoxide. Adjustment of milk fermented by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191R to pH 3, 7.6, or 13 prior to freeze-drying and acetone extraction did not significantly alter the activity specific for 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl. In contrast, compounds with activity specific for N-methyl, N'-nitro, N-nitrosoguanidine were less extractable at pH 7.6. The weak antimutagenicity of unfermented milk was not increased by addition of 2% L-lactic acid.
TI  - Absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - To investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. The production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by HPLC analysis in growing cultures. Resting whole cells from a positive control strain, Eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mM cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at pH 7.3. However, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. In growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by E. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. None of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
TI  - Antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of Taleggio, an Italian soft cheese.
AB  - Enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes. Inhibition of L. innocua in milk by different starter cultures was evaluated. Milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (Enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). Tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h of Taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. Results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of L. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of pH decrease and bacteriocin production. Overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of Taleggio cheese during ripening, when L. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.
TI  - Low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Neisseria sp., diphtheroid, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis and Candida albicans. The saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. The calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). No statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (P > 0.01). However, the low surface tension (46.5 x 10(-3) Nm-1) and high pH (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.
TI  - Microbiological quality of French yogurts commercialized in Spain.
AB  - The microbiological quality has been evaluated in 6 batches of yogurt (plain, flavoured and fruit-added) produced commercially in France and purchased in Spain. The essential microflora: Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and contaminants (coliform bacteria, yeasts and molds) were checked. The pH was also measured. The totality of the samples tested fulfilled French and Spanish regulation with respect to the presence of viable yogurt organisms. Likewise, in 100% of the yogurts, counts of contaminants were under 10 cfu/g. The pH ranged between 3.92 and 4.19.
TI  - Coaggregation of oral lactobacilli with streptococci from the oral cavity.
AB  - The ability of oral lactobacilli to coaggregate with streptococci and actinomycetes was investigated. Of the 7 species of lactobacilli studied, only two were capable of coaggregation and the coaggregation was restricted to streptococci. Lactobacillus salivarius strains (2/4) coaggregated with Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus crista and tufted Streptococcus sanguis II strains. Lactobacillus fermentum (2/3) coaggregated with S. gordonii and S. sanguis. The coaggregation between L. salivarius and S. salivarius, S. gordonii or tufted S. sanguis II strains was mediated by a protein on the surface of the lactobacilli and was not inhibited by lactose. The coaggregation between L. fermentum and the streptococci was mediated by protein on the surface of the streptococci and was inhibited by lactose.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of dentinal bonding agents.
AB  - The susceptibility of five bacterial species to seven dentinal bonding agents was examined in vitro. Agar diffusion tests using filterpaper disks containing 10 microL each of conditioner, primer, or resin were performed on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. Chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. Of all the compounds tested, Gluma cleanser and Gluma etchant showed the strongest growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. No antibacterial effect was noted for Prisma Universal Bond 2 and Superlux Universal Bond 2 systems. The primers of Gluma, Denthesive, and Scotchbond 2 displayed antibacterial activity that, in some cases, was comparable to that of 0.2% chlorhexidine. Zones of inhibition were seen for the resin materials of Scotchbond 2 and Tripton with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Actinomyces viscosus. No inhibition was seen after these resins were cured, whereas the antibacterial effect of XR-Bond on S sanguis and A viscosus was not affected by light curing.
TI  - Intra- and inter-individual variation in salivary flow rate, buffer effect, lactobacilli, and mutans streptococci among 11- to 12-year-old schoolchildren.
AB  - Both intra- and inter-individual variation in salivary flow rate, buffer effect,  and the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were analyzed in 128 11-year-old children. The follow-up period was 9 months, with six saliva samplings done at regular intervals. Inter-individual variation was relatively large in paraffin-stimulated salivary flow rate: low (< 1.0 ml/min) and high (> or = 2.0 ml/min) flow rates were measured in 18% and 13% of the children, respectively. Intraindividual variation during the follow-up period was found in 63% of the boys and in 73% of the girls. The buffer effect stayed stable in all samplings in 59% of the boys and in 42% of the girls. Buffer effect was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in girls than in boys. Mutans streptococci were analyzed by a chair-side method (Strip mutans test) and by cultivation on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin (MSB) agar plates. The results of the two methods correlated highly significantly (r = 0.79, p < 0.001). With the Strip mutans test no variation in test scores occurred in 49% of all subjects in all six samplings, whereas the respective percentage for MSB scores was only 19%. No variation in salivary lactobacilli occurred in only 18% of the subjects, and in 13% the intraindividual variation was as high as > or = 3 logs. These results show that in young teenagers with a developing dentition, simultaneous changes in behavioral, hormonal, and dietary factors make single-point measurements of salivary factors too unreliable for caries-diagnostic or predictive purposes.
TI  - Prevalence of dental caries in 4- to 5-year-old children partly explained by presence of salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  - The correlation between dental caries and the number of oral mutans group streptococci (ms) present has been shown to be weak. The aim of this investigation was to study associations between caries experience (decayed, missing, and filled surfaces [dmfs]) and the number of ms in stimulated saliva, with emphasis on the level of disease and the confounding effect of regular intake of sweets, the presence of salivary lactobacilli, and oral hygiene. In some 2,700 4- to 5-year-old South African children of different ethnic origins, caries was diagnosed on the basis of World Health Organization criteria and saliva samples were analyzed for ms after cultivation on mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and for lactobacilli by using the Dentocult kit. Oral hygiene was scored on the basis of the Greene and Vermillion simplified debris index, while data on intake of sweets were derived from extensive interviews. Pearson's coefficient of correlation was computed, and multiple regression analysis was performed to correct for confounding factors. The distribution of the children in the eight caries classes was strongly associated with the ms class (P < 0.001), with those in the lower ms classes generally having low dmfs scores and those in the higher ms classes having dmfs scores distributed over the whole range. The r value for the two variables was 0.25 for the total material; this was reduced to 0.18 by correction for confounding factors. The corresponding values for children with caries were 0.21 and 0.17, for those in the 1 to 6 dmfs interval they were 0.07 and 0.03, and for those in the 7 to 81 dmfs interval they were 0.16 and 0.14. The data imply that the explanatory values for ms, those for the lower caries interval not counted, ranged from 6 to 2%. The unexpected results for children with caries might be due to their distribution pattern. It is concluded that there is a need for reevaluation of ms as a risk factor in dental caries.
TI  - Dental caries and its determinants among recent immigrants from rural Ethiopia.
AB  - Adults (35-45 yr old) and children (5 and 12 yr old) recently arrived in Israel from rural areas in Ethiopia were examined. Caries levels were low: e.g. DMFT = 0.31 among 12-yr-olds, and 1.27 amongst adults. The 5-yr-olds were 86.8% caries-free, while 12-yr-olds were 81.8% and adults 54% caries-free respectively. According to interview data, the diet in Ethiopia had been based on local agricultural products and was almost sugar-free. The mean total count of salivary bacteria, as determined on blood agar, was 3.4 x 10(8); mean count of Streptococcus viridans, on mitis salivarius, was 6.7 x 10(7); and mean count of S. mutans, as determined on mitis salivarius with bacitracin, was 1.7 x 10(7). These levels were all high and were not significantly different from a control group of 20 Israelis. The mean number of lactobacilli, on Rogosa agar, was 2.75 x 10(4), which was significantly higher than among the controls (3.6 x 10(3). Salivary pH levels were generally similar between the Ethiopian group and the controls. Salivary flow was significantly higher for the Ethiopians (1.93 ml/min) than for controls (1.16 ml/min). Low levels of caries in this population can be attributed to an almost sugar-free diet and high salivary flow, but not to the composition of oral microflora.
TI  - A comparison between commercial kits and conventional methods for enumeration of  salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  - Mutans streptococci (ms) and lactobacilli levels were determined by conventional  and commercial dip-slide methods in three groups of young subjects, aged 5-6 years (93 subjects), 12-13 years (78 subjects) and 18-20 years (81 subjects). Using the same paraffin-stimulated saliva samples, ms and lactobacilli were estimated by conventional viable counts on modified mitis-salivarius agar (MSB) and Rogosa agar plates, and by inoculation of Dentocult SM and Dentocult LB dip-slides (Orion Diagnostica, Finland). The salivary ms and lactobacilli counts obtained from conventional agar plates were significantly correlated (P < 0.0001) with the dip-slide estimates of these organisms (Kendal Tau = 0.56, 0.71 respectively). Subjects in Group 2 showed the highest proportion (77 per cent) of individuals with salivary ms levels above 2.5 x 10(5) cfu/ml saliva; 99 per cent of that group had detectable levels of lactobacilli. Significantly different median salivary ms and lactobacilli levels were demonstrated between all groups except for lactobacilli levels between Groups 2 and 3. These dip-slide tests provided suitable and simple methods for screening salivary lactobacilli and ms levels which may have a useful role in the assessment of caries risk.
TI  - Detection of propionic acid bacteria in cheese.
AB  - Mesophilic lactic starters and thermophilic lactobacilli but not Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus grew on the sodium lactate agar (SLA) used for estimating the numbers of propionic acid bacteria (PAB) in cheese. The addition of cloxacillin (4 micrograms/ml) to SLA inhibited the starter bacteria but had no effect on the PAB. It was possible to count low numbers of PAB in the presence of high numbers of starter bacteria. A correlation coefficient of 0.9 was obtained between the level of propionic acid and the counts of PAB in cheese (n = 40). A disadvantage of the medium is that other bacteria found in cheese (mesophilic lactobacilli, enterococci, Clostridium tyrobutyricum) also grow on it; however, these bacteria are easily distinguishable from PAB on the basis of size, colour and absence of catalase.
TI  - Multibacterial artificial plaque. A model for studying carious process.
AB  - A multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans (serotype c), Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus casei and Actinomyces viscosus. Typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. The caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. The lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. The acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. It is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in the media. Moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.
TI  - Strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB  - Lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. To evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of S thermophilus, L bulgaricus, L acidophilus, or Bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. Selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. All yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. The response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with B bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with L bulgaricus milk. The results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.
TI  - Purification and characterization of an endopeptidase from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2.
AB  - An endopeptidase has been purified to homogeneity from a crude cell extract of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2 by a procedure that includes diethyl-aminoethane-Sephacel chromatography, phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography over an anion-exchange column and a hydrophobic-interaction column. Gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a molecular mass of the purified enzyme of 70,000 Da. The endopeptidase can degrade several oligopeptides into various tetra-, tri-, and dipeptides. The endopeptidase has no aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidase, dipeptidase, or tripeptidase activity. It is optimally active at pH 6.0 to 6.5 and in the temperature range of 30 to 38 degrees C. The enzyme is inactivated by the chemical agents 1,10-phenanthroline, ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate, beta-mercaptoethanol, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and is inhibited by Cu2+ and Zn2+. The ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate- or 1,10-phenanthroline-treated enzyme can be reactivated by Co2+. Immunoblotting with specific antibodies raised against the purified endopeptidase indicated that the enzyme is also present in other Lactococcus spp., as well as in Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
TI  - Diffusion of lactose in kappa-carrageenan/locust bean gum gel beads with or without entrapped growing lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Effective diffusion coefficients (De) of lactose in kappa-carrageenan (2.75% wt/wt)/locust bean gum (0.25% wt/wt) (LBG) gel beads (1.5-2.0-mm diameter)with or without entrapped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were determined at 40 degrees C. The effects of lactose concentration, bacteria strain (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei) and cell content at various steps of the fermentation process (after immobilization, pre-incubation of the beads and successive fermentations) were measured on De as a first step for process modelling. Results were obtained from transiend concentration changes n well-stirred lactose solutions in which the beads were suspended. A mathematical model of unsteady-state diffusion in a sphere was used, and De was obtained from the best fit of the experimental data. Diffusivity of lactose in cell-tree beads was significantly lower than in pure water mainly because of the obstruction effect of the polymer chains and the hydration region. Furthermore, effective diffusivity and equilibrium partition factor were independent of lactose concentration in the range from 12.5 to 50 g/L. No significant difference was found for De (effective diffusivity) and Kp (partition) coefficients between beads entrapping S. thermophilus (approximately 5 x 10(9) CFU/mL) and cell-free beads. On the other hand higher cell counts obtained with L. casei (close to 1.8 x 10(11) CFU/mL) increased mass transfer resistance resulting in lower effective diffusivities and Kp. Finally, the effects of the type of bacteria and their distribution in the beads on the diffusivity were also discussed.
TI  - Comparative antibacterial effects of chlorhexidine and stannous fluoride-amine fluoride containing dental gels against salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  - Forty-five young adults were divided into three groups of equal size and given a  professional toothcleaning (3 times during 1 wk) with dental gels containing either chlorhexidine (CHX, 1%), or a SnF2-amine fluoride (AmF) combination (F- content 1.20%). The control group received toothcleaning with a placebo gel. The study was done double blind. The number of salivary mutans streptococci was monitored for 11 wk after the gel treatment using both mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar plates and the chairside method based on the adhesion of mutans streptococci on plastic strips (Dentocult-SM Strip mutans). Professional toothcleaning with a CHX gel was clearly most effective (P less than 0.001) but the baseline levels of streptococci returned in 11 wk. SnF2-AmF gel also reduced significantly (P less than 0.001) mutans streptococci but recolonization occurred already in 7 wk. Placebo gel, i.e. professional toothcleaning as such, did not show any statistically significant effect on the numbers of salivary mutans streptococci. None of the treatments affected the levels of lactobacilli or the total aerobic flora in saliva samples. Professional toothcleaning with a CHX gel, or with a SnF2-AmF gel, can be regarded as an alternative to the commonly used, but more patience demanding, application of gel in mouth trays at home for individuals with high caries activity.
TI  - Changes in chemical composition and sensory qualities of peanut milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The effects of fermentation of aqueous extracts of peanuts (peanut milk) with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, separately and in combination, on selected chemical and sensory qualities were investigated. Changes in pH, titratable acidity and viable cell populations indicated that there was a synergistic interaction between L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus during fermentation. Analysis of headspace volatiles revealed that hexanal, which is one of the compounds responsible for undesirable green/beany flavor in peanut milk, completely disappeared as a result of fermentation. S. salivarius ssp. thermophilus was more effective than L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus in reducing the hexanal content. The acetaldehyde content of peanut milk increased during fermentation. Changes in concentrations of these volatile compounds were correlated with sensory evaluation scores which showed that a significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) decrease in green/beany flavor and a significant increase in creamy flavor occurred as a result of fermentation.
TI  - A IIIman protein is involved in the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by oral streptococci.
AB  - We show in this article that the transport of glucose, mannose and fructose by the phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci requires the participation of a protein component that we have called IIIman. This protein was purified from Streptococcus salivarius by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, DEAE-TSK, hydroxyapatite, and Dyematrex Green A. The purified protein migrated as a 38,900 molecular weight protein on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. However, electrophoretic analysis of phosphoproteins and Western blot experiments indicated the presence in membrane-free cellular extracts of S. salivarius of 2 different forms of IIIman having molecular weights of 38,900 and 35,200. The presence of the high-molecular-weight form of IIIman was observed by immunodiffusion, Western blot and phosphorylation by [32]PEP in S. salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Streptococcus lactis but not in Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei. Antibodies directed against the IIIman of S. salivarius did not react with the IIIman of Escherichia coli.
TI  - The influence of sucralose on bacterial metabolism.
AB  - Sucralose (1',4',6' trideoxy-trichloro-galactosucrose) is a nontoxic, intensely sweet sucrose derivative that has been shown to be non-cariogenic in experimental animals. The purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral bacteria could utilize sucralose. Sucralose, as a sole carbon source, was unable to support growth of ten strains of oral bacteria and dental plaque. When sucrolose was incorporated into a liquid medium containing glucose or sucrose, all organisms tested displayed similar pH falls, compared with controls. The incorporation of 126 mmol/L sucralose into glucose agar medium caused total inhibition of growth of Streptococcus sobrinus 6715-17, Streptococcus sanguis 10904, Streptococcus sanguis Challis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus WVU627. Sucralose had no effect on IPS production. Sucralose was not bound to, nor taken up by, cells. Sucralose inhibited the formation of glucan and fructan polymers in proportion to the sucralose-to-enzyme ratio, but independent of the sucrose concentration in the assay mixture. No radioactive polymer was formed from 14C-U-sucralose added to mixtures containing glucosyltransferase (GTF) or fructosyl-transferase (FTF). Inhibition of GTF and FTF by sucralose was removed following dialysis of the enzyme/sucralose mixture. These results show that sucralose was not utilized by the oral bacteria tested and that the inhibitory effect of sucralose on GTF and FTF was non-competitive and reversible. The results further support the concept that sucralose is non-cariogenic.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride gel applied by tray or by toothbrush on salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  - A chlorhexidine (1%)-sodium fluoride (0.2%) gel applied using a dental tray six times during two consecutive days significantly decreased salivary levels of mutans streptococci but had only a slight effect on salivary levels of lactobacilli. The same gel used as a dentifrice for one week (twice a day) also significantly reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci. However, this treatment was somewhat less effective than that using trays, on the basis of the ratio of mutans streptococci to total aerobes. With both treatments baseline salivary levels of mutans streptococci were re-attained after 70 days. One day after the gel treatment, mutans streptococci were unable to adhere to plastic strips (Dentocult SM Strip mutans) but detectable growth was found on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. This suggests that not only are numbers of mutans streptococci reduced after chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride gel treatment but also mutans streptococci adherence.
TI  - Genome comparison of Lactococcus strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The two restriction enzymes SmaI and ApaI were found to produce distributions of  DNA fragments useful for genome analysis of some lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus) by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The genome size was estimated to be 1750 to 2500 kb depending on the species. Each strain displayed unique restriction patterns; nevertheless, the percentage of the comigrating fragments of two isogenic or closely related strains was about 80% and fell to 20-40% when the patterns of two non-related strains of the same species or two strains belonging to different species were compared.
TI  - Sugar Utilization and Acid Production by Free and Entrapped Cells of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in a Whey Permeate Medium.
AB  - Cells of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis entrapped in k-carrageenan-locust bean gum gel performed similarly to free cells in the conversion of lactose to lactic acid. Bead diameter influenced the fermentation rate. Cells entrapped in smaller beads (0.5 to 1.0 mm) showed higher release rates, higher lactose, glucose, and formic acid utilization, higher galactose accumulation, and higher lactic acid production than did cells entrapped in larger beads (1.0 to 2.0 mm). Values for smaller beads were comparable with those for free cells. Immobilization affected the fermentation rate of lactic acid bacteria, especially Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. Entrapped cells of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus demonstrated a lower lactic acid production than did free cells in batch fermentation. The kinetics of the production of formic and pyruvic acids by L. lactis subsp. lactis and S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus are presented.
TI  - Invasion of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus salivarius in early caries lesions of gnotobiotic rats.

TI  - [Lactic bacteria in the digestive tract of poultry].
AB  - Lactic bacteria predominate in the microflora of the digestive tract of chicken and turkey. They are represented mainly by Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. salivarius, L. fermentum and L. buchneri. Streptococcus faecium is always isolated. L. ruminis, L. vitulinus, L. delbrueckii, L. coryniformis and L. viridescens were found in this ecological niche for the first time. S. faecium and S. faecalis prevail in the digestive tract of geese and ducks, while lactobacilli are detected in a lesser amount and are represented mainly by L. plantarum. L. salivarius cells isolated from the digestive tract of poultry are highly polymorphous. Most of the lactic acid bacteria found in the digestive tract of poultry can grow at 45-50 degrees C whatever is the species they belong to.
TI  - Bacterial involvement in denture-induced stomatitis.
AB  - Denture and mucosal plaque samples were collected from eight full-denture wearers of whom four suffered from denture-induced stomatitis (DIS). Cultures were made, and a proportional identification to species level was carried out of bacteria and yeasts. An inventory was made of the predominant flora. Results showed that the predominant microflora of both groups, both on dentures and the denture-bearing mucosa, consisted mainly of Gram-positive bacteria. Differences in the proportions of cocci were found between the predominant bacterial flora on the dentures. In the control group, 69% of the denture flora consisted of cocci, while on the dentures of the DIS group a mean of 33% cocci was found. Neither group of palates revealed any differences in the proportions of cocci. On these locations a mean of 69% was found. The plaque of dentures and the palates of the healthy group showed means of 35% and 31%, respectively, of obligate anaerobic bacteria, while in the DIS group these percentages were 56% and 43%, respectively. No obligately aerobic bacteria were found. Candida species was detected in both groups, both on dentures and palates in very low numbers (DIS group, median palates 0.02%, median dentures 0.25%). The predominant organisms were Streptococcus species, of which S. salivarius was mostly present on the palates of both groups. Other species which were regularly found at different locations were Veillonella parvula and species of Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Actinomyces.
TI  - Association of viridans group streptococci from pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis and upper genital tract infection.
AB  - The prevalence and role of viridans group streptococci in the female genital tract have not been well described. In this study of 482 pregnant women, 147 (30%) were culture positive for viridans group streptococci. Of 392 women with predominant Lactobacillus morphotypes by Gram stain (normal), 110 (28%) were colonized with viridans group streptococci, compared with 37 (41%) of 90 women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) (P = 0.02). To determine whether any species were associated with BV, 177 consecutively isolated viridans group streptococci from the vagina were identified to the species level by using the Facklam scheme. The most frequently isolated species from the vagina was Streptococcus intermedius (13%), followed by Streptococcus acidominimus (6%), Streptococcus constellatus (5%), Streptococcus sanguis II (4%), Streptococcus mitis (2%), Streptococcus salivarius (2%), Streptococcus morbillorum (2%), Streptococcus sanguis I (1%), Streptococcus mutans (0.2%), and Streptococcus uberis (0.2%) with an average of 1.2 species per woman. The distribution of the species among women with BV compared with normal women was not significantly different, with the exception of two species which were associated with BV: S. acidominimus (18% versus 3%, P less than 0.001) and S. morbillorum (6% versus 0.7%, P = 0.005). Amniotic fluid and placenta cultures yielded 54 isolates: S. sanguis II (13 isolates), S. acidominimus (9 isolates), S. intermedius (10 isolates), S. constellatus (3 isolates), S. mitis (4 isolates), S. sanguis I (4 isolates), S. morbillorum (5 isolates), S. mutans (2 isolates), S. uberis (1 isolate), mannitol-positive S. intermedius (1 isolate), and 2 isolates which were not classified. The distribution of species isolated from the upper genital tract was not a reflection of the distribution in the lower genital tract. Dextran-producing species of viridans group streptococci may have a greater pathogenic potential in the placenta than the non-dextran-producing species.
TI  - Degradation of starch and its hydrolytic products by oral bacteria.
AB  - Selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. S. sanguis IUOM-11M and JC804, S. mutans 6715, S. salivarius IUOM-8, A. viscosus IUOM-62, and A. naeslundii ATCC 12104 degraded all four substrates. S. mutans NCTC 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while A. viscosus ATCC 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and S. sanguis SS34 degraded only maltose. L. casei IUOM-14 did not degrade any of the substrates. Analysis of starch degradation products from S. sanguis IUOM-11M and A. viscosus IUOM-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose, and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. S. sanguis IUOM-11M alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a pH optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. The presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. Maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of S. sanguis IUOM-11M insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. Maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. Several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. These products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of the acidogenic substrate fructose. The results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of psychrotrophic lactic acid bacteria from prepacked meat and meat products.
AB  - Ninety-four strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from refrigerated, prepacked meat and meat products were together with 59 reference strains of Brochothrix, Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Streptococcus phenotypically classified, using 96 unit characters. Data were examined using Simple Matching (SSM) or Jaccard coefficient (SJ), and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. Twenty-three clusters with two or more members were defined at the 84% SSM-similarity level which corresponded to the SJ-similarity level of 61%. Based on SSM, most field strains were included in nine clusters, and with three unsignificant exceptions these contained no reference strains. The field clusters were designated Carnobacterium piscicola (cluster 1; 5% of field isolates), Carnobacterium divergens (cluster 2; 9% of field isolates), Leuconostoc (cluster 9; 18% of field isolates) and Lactobacillus (cluster 4, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14; together 60% of field isolates). The Lactobacillus clusters had many features in common with cluster II of Shaw & Harding (1984). Phenotypical characteristics of major clusters are given. The SSM and SJ based classifications basically coincided for the field strains; the exception was cluster 4 which now were split in two parts. Fourteen clusters were made up of mainly reference strains (SSM). Most of them included more than one type strain on species level; exceptions were Brochothrix thermosphacta (cluster 3), Lactobacillus salivarius (cluster 17) and Leuconostoc mesenteroides (cluster 18). Several rearrangements were seen amongst the clusters of the reference strains when SJ, instead of SSM, was used for clustering.
TI  - [Bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  - Considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. Currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. The present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth pattern and acid production of S. mutans, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. faecalis, S. viridans, L. casei and L. acidophilus in vitro by using Photo Electrical Colorimeter and pH meter. In conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.
TI  - Acid tolerance, proton permeabilities, and membrane ATPases of oral streptococci.
AB  - Differences in acid tolerance among representative oral streptococci were found to be related more closely to the dynamic permeabilities of the bacteria to protons than to differences in the sensitivities of cell membranes to gross damage caused by environmental acidification. For Streptococcus mutans GS-5, Streptococcus sanguis NCTC 10904, and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419, gross membrane damage, indicated by the release of magnesium from whole cells, occurred at pH values below about 4 and was rapid and extensive at pH values of about 3 or less. A more aciduric, lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus casei ATCC 4646, was more resistant to environmental acidification, and gross membrane damage was evident only at pH values below 3. Assessments of the movements of protons into S. mutans cells after an acid pulse at various pH values indicated that permeability to protons was minimal at a pH value of about 5, at which the average half time for pH equilibration across the cell membrane was about 12 min. The corresponding values for the less aciduric organism S. sanguis were pH 7 and 8.2 min, and the values for the intermediate organism S. salivarius were pH 6 and 6.6 min. The ATPase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide acted to increase markedly the permeability of each organism to protons, and this action indicated that permeability involved not only the passive inflow of protons but also active outflow through the proton-translocating membrane ATPase. Membranes were isolated from each of the bacteria, and pH profiles for ATPase activities indicated pH optima of about 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 for S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, and L. casei, respectively. Thus, the pH profiles for the enzymes reflected the acid tolerances of the bacteria and the permeabilities of whole cells to protons.
TI  - Effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  - Five monoclonal antibodies directed against Streptococcus mutans strain JBP lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were characterized. They were all similarly reactive with the immunizing LTA-containing extract, with intact Strep. mutans JBP cells and with LTA purified from Lactobacillus casei. Immobilized anti-LTA antibodies removes LTA from LTA-containing extracts. The binding of antibodies to LTA was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated LTA, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. Antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of Strep. mutans, as well as with strains of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis and L. casei, but not with LTA-negative species Streptococcus mitis or Actinomyces viscosus. Anti-LTA antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of Strep. mutans JBP to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. There was no effect of anti-LTA antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by Strep. mutans. The results argue against a major role for LTA in Strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.
TI  - [The capacity of anaerobically grown bacteria to exchange the 2H+ of the cell for the K+ of the medium and to maintain a high K+ distribution between cell and medium].
AB  - The N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitive exchange of 2H+ of a cell for K+ of medium stable to pH, K+ activity and temperature changes has been discovered in anaerobically grown gram-negative Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium. S. enteritidis, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus salivarius, L. lactis in the presence of exogenic energy source. This exchange in gram-negative bacteria is operating only at increase of medium osmolarity. The high K+ distribution between cell and medium has been reached during the exchange of 2H+ for one K+ and the corresponding potassium equilibrium potential is much more than the measured delta psi. In aerobically grown E. coli, S. typhimurium, Brevibacterium flavum and aerobic Micrococcus luteus exchange of 2H+ for K+ does not take place, the K+ distribution is lower and in good conformity with the measured delta psi. It is assumed that exchange of 2H+ for K+ in anaerobic bacteria is carried out by the H+-ATPase complex and the Trk (or Trk-like) system of K+ absorption united into the same membrane supercomplex which functions as the H+-K+-pump and supports the high K+ distribution between cell and medium.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase transport system of Streptococcus mutans: purification of HPr and enzyme I and determination of their intracellular concentrations by rocket immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - Enzyme I and HPr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. To determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in Streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme I and HPr from S. mutans ATCC 27352. Using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme I and HPr in cells of S. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of S. mutans. HPr was purified by the procedure reported by Gauthier et al. (L. Gauthier, D. Mayrand, and C. Vadeboncoeur, J. Bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. Enzyme I was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-Streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. The protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. The subunit molecular weight of enzyme I determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. In gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees C, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme I is a dimer. In double immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against HPr reacted with several oral streptococci, Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus faecium, and Lactobacillus casei, but not with Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Antibodies against enzyme I of S. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme I from all the other oral streptococci tested. No cross-reaction was observed with other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The levels of enzyme I and HPr determined by rocket electrophoresis in S. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. Glucose-grown cells of other S. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme I and HPr which were similar to those found in S. mutans 27352.
TI  - The influence of the host on expression of intestinal microbial enzyme activities involved in metabolism of foreign compounds.
AB  - The activities of four enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, nitrate reductase and nitroreductase) in selected intestinal bacteria (Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp., Streptococcus sp., Bacteroides sp. and Lactobacillus salivarius) were measured after growth in vitro and in vivo. The five strains differed in their activities with Clostridium sp. being the most active for beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and nitroreductase, and E. coli the most active producer of nitrate reductase. Enzyme activity in vivo tended to be higher than in vitro but there were instances where the comparative activities were reversed.
TI  - Longitudinal microbiological investigation of a hospitalized population of older  adults with a high root surface caries risk.
AB  - Intact root surfaces of chronically hospitalized subjects were sampled periodically to enumerate bacterial species believed to be associated with root caries. Bacteria were cultivated and enumerated using a series of selective and enriched media. Microbial counts, isolation frequencies, and percent cultivable flora data were analyzed for caries-active and caries-free surfaces and subjects. S. mutans, S. sanguis, A. viscosus, A. naeslundii, total lactobacilli, and Veillonella accounted for a mean of less than 20% of the cultivated flora, with mitis salivarius agar cultivable streptococci averaging less than 5%. The microbial count data were highly variable, precluding the finding of significant differences in caries association for either subjects or sites. Streptococci, especially S. mutans, correlated highly with lactobacilli in the samples.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus detection in the assessment of dental root surface caries risk.
AB  - Forty-five subjects contributing 150 root surfaces with gingival recession were sampled seven times over a 32-month period. We calculated isolation frequencies of lactobacilli on selective Rogosa SL agar and S. mutans in a sensitive enrichment broth and on mitis salivarius agar. Both S. mutans and lactobacilli were isolated more frequently from surfaces which became carious than from those remaining caries-free. Isolation frequencies were also higher for caries-free surfaces in caries-active subjects than for caries-free surfaces in caries-inactive subjects. The presence or absence of S. mutans and lactobacilli in samples taken at baseline could discriminate between subjects who were to be root-caries-active and those who were to remain root-caries-inactive during the subsequent observation period. Moreover, if both bacteria were detected or only S. mutans was detected on a root surface at its entry into the study, that surface had a greater risk for developing a root lesion. However, the tests could not predict which root surfaces within the mouths of caries-active subjects were to become carious. Analysis of the data suggests that simple microbiological detection tests may be useful in identifying patients at high risk of root caries.
TI  - Growth inhibition of Streptococcus mutans by cellular extracts of human intestinal lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro growth of Streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by water-soluble extracts from cells of various intestinal lactic acid bacteria identified as Streptococcus faecium, Streptococcus equinus, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The growth inhibition was dependent on the concentrations of the extracts. In contrast, the extracts did not inhibit the growth of the major indigenous intestinal lactic acid bacteria isolated from humans. These lactic acid bacteria were not acutely toxic in mice.
TI  - Microbial ecology of plaque in rats with naturally occurring gingivitis.
AB  - The microbial ecology of adherent plaque was investigated in relation to the pathological findings of gingivitis in plaque-susceptible rats. Plaque developed in the gingiva of the lower incisor in plaque-susceptible rats, but not in plaque-resistant rats, after they were fed a commercial powder diet. With increase in plaque volume, the total counts of bacteria increased 10(9) to 10(11)/g. In the first 3 months, Bacteroides species increased and became the predominant population. Streptococcus species also increased at the same time. After 9 months, Fusobacterium species and oral Treponema species were recognized in increasing numbers. The anaerobic bacteria increased in proportion with the progression of plaque development. Bacteroides intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus salivarius, and other species were isolated. Acute gingivitis was observed within 3 months, and subacute-chronic gingivitis was observed between 2 and 12 months. These findings suggest that proportional changes in the gingival plaque flora may uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in this experimental model.
TI  - pH change in artificial dental plaque formed by glucosyltransferase and some oral bacteria during batch and continuous culture.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (G-Tase)-together with either Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces viscosus, or Lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. The pH in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. In the absence of GTase, the bacteria other than S. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. The pH of the plaque formed with GTase alone did not show the pH decrease seen when the plaque contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.
TI  - The association between dietary sucrose consumption and microbial population shifts at six oral sites in man.
AB  - Sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. Culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. Over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. Analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured higher levels of Neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high Streptococcus sanguis levels and total Gram-positive cocci and fewer Gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella sp. Sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and Streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; Actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; Strep. mutans, Veillonella sp. and Lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and Strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. Sucrose intake was negatively related to concentrations of Neisseria sp. on the tongue and total Gram-positive bacilli in saliva. A definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. The high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.
TI  - Isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Fructose transport in Streptococcus mutans LG-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. One system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme II as well as enzyme I and heat-stable protein. The other system is inducible and requires, in addition to enzyme I and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. This protein factor, designated IIIfru, was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving on Sephadex G-75, and preparative electrophoresis. The purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer Tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pI congruent to 3.7). The molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees C was 51,000. Immunodiffusion experiments performed with immunoglobulins prepared against the purified IIIfru from S. mutans LG-1 suggested that other S. mutans strains possessed a IIIfru. No precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. lactis, S. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus casei, and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Lactose transport in Streptococcus mutans: isolation and characterization of factor IIIlac, a specific protein component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - The transport of lactose in Streptococcus mutans is mediated via an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate-lactose phosphotransferase system. This system requires for catalytic activity a membrane fraction (enzyme II), two general proteins called enzyme I and HPr, and a soluble specific protein termed factor IIIlac. This protein factor was purified from S. mutans ATCC 27352 by chromatographies on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, Ultrogel AcA 34, and phosphocellulose. The purified protein migrated as a single band with a molecular weight of 10,000 on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea. The molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition was 10,541. Gel filtration of the native protein gave a molecular weight of 41,500. Its isoelectric point was ca. 4.70. A specific antiserum was prepared against purified factor IIIlac. Immunodiffusion experiments revealed that only cellular extracts from lactose-grown cells contained factor IIIlac. A cross-reaction was observed with all of the S. mutans strains tested as well as with Streptococcus sanguis 10556, Streptococcus lactis 11454, and Staphylococcus aureus 6538. No precipitin band was observed with extracts of Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, and Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - The effect of yoghurt on some components of the gut microflora and on the metabolism of lactose in the rat.
AB  - Feeding yoghurt or base milk (from which the yoghurt was prepared by fermentation) to rats increased the counts of coliforms in the gut whereas the counts of lactobacilli were reduced by yoghurt but not by the base milk. Lactobacillus bulgaricus survived in the guts of gnotobiotic and conventional rats when yoghurt was fed continuously. Streptococcus thermophilus also survived in gnotobiotic rats but its ability to survive in conventional rats could not be examined. Both organisms failed to colonise the gut when a small inoculum of yoghurt was administered orally to germfree rats maintained on the stock diet. Streptococcus thermophilus but not Lact. bulgaricus grew in the rat diet when tested in vitro. Two enzyme systems (beta-galactosidase and lactase) were studied using, respectively, o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) and lactose as the test substrates. Enzyme levels estimated with both substrates increased in the gut contents when rats were fed yoghurt but an increase was only found with ONPG in the intestinal mucosa fraction. The bacterial origin of all this increased activity is discussed. The other lactose-containing diets did not affect enzyme activity to the same degree. Feeding yoghurt changed the lactobacillus flora from one which was predominantly heterofermentative (Lact. reuteri ) to one which was predominantly homofermentative (Lact. salivarius).
TI  - Sucrase and maltase activities in supragingival dental plaque in humans of streptococcal, actinomyces and lactobacilli species.
AB  - 20 reference strains and 72 isolated strains from dental plaque of streptococci,  actinomyces, and lactobacilli species were examined for sucrase and maltase activities. The type of sucrase in the different strains was determined by use of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. The enzyme activities were determined as formation of monosaccharide, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. Although variations occurred in enzyme activities between reference and isolated strains, the same general pattern was noticed. Strains of Streptococcus mutans and S. salivarius showed regularly the highest sucrase activities, followed by strains of Actinomyces viscosus and A. naeslundii. Most lactobacilli belonged to the bacteria with low sucrase activity like S. sanguis and S. mitior. In some lactobacilli strains, however, a high sucrase activity was observed. The level of sucrase activity in S. mutans strains was dependent on biotype/serotype, as strains of biotype V/serotype e showed high activities, biotypes I and IV corresponding to serotypes c, f, and d showed intermediate activity, and biotype III/serotype a always showed low activity. In most of the strains the sucrases were composed of enzymes with specificity against both alpha-glucosidic linkage and beta-fructosidic linkage of the sucrose molecule, but in varying ratios. In all species, exept S. sanguis and S. mitior, lower maltase than sucrase activity was observed, but even in the two species mentioned the maltase activities were relatively low. On the basis of observations of selected reference strains in every species examined both sucrases and maltases are to some extent inducible.
TI  - Growth and acid tolerance of human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial pH levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at pH 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0. Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus faecalis showed greater acid tolerance than strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Actinomyces viscosus. For all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. These data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.
TI  - Predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  - Plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. To characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. Streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of Streptococcus milleri, Streptoccus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitior and Streptococcus sanguis. Staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). Gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). Among these, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus and Actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. Among Gram-negative bacteria, only Veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). Gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. Forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. Cultures for yeasts on Sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. The microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.
TI  - Common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: isolation and biochemical characterization of the extracellular protein antigen.
AB  - An extracellular soluble common protein (ECP) has been purified from extracellular soluble fractions of exponential phase cultures of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ9, of a representative strain of each of Bratthall's seven serological groups of Streptococcus mutans, and of one strain each of Lactobacillus salivarius and Actinomyces viscosus. The ECP antigens from the different strains were prepared from SDS-dissociated immunoprecipitates by affinity chromatography on an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin column. The identity of such purified ECP antigens was demonstrated by their behaviour in immunodiffusion analysis, in SDS-PAGE, in which an identical molecular weight (60000) was found, and by virtue of their similar amino acid and sugar compositions. This common antigen (ECP) consisted of 90% protein and 10% sugar.
TI  - Influence of dietary lactose on the gut flora of chicks.
AB  - 1. The gut microflora of chicks fed on a purified diet containing 300 g lactose plus 300 g starch/kg was compared with that of control birds receiving a diet containing 600 g starch/kg. 2. In 14-d-old conventional chicks, lactose in the diet decreased the incidence of lactobacilli and clostridia in the caecal contents, although when presenting lactose-fed chicks the counts of lactobacilli exceeded those of control chicks. 3. High counts of Proteus sp. were present in the caeca of control birds but they were completely suppressed in conventional birds fed on the lactose diet. In vitro tests showed that this inhibition was partially due to Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. 4. The growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus was inhibited by lactose when gnotobiotic chicks were monoassociated but not when polyassociated. The protective effect was shown in vitro to be due to L. salivarius. 5. The pH was markedly lowered in the caecum of conventional and polyassociated chicks receiving dietary lactose. Of the strains used in gnotobiotic experiments E. coli, S. faecalis and L. salivarius produced the lowest pH values in the caeca.
TI  - Production of lipoteichoic acid by lactobacilli and streptococci grown in different environments.
AB  - Representative strains of Streptococcus sanguis serotype 2 and of four Lactobacillus species were examined for the production of cellular and extracellular lipoteichoic acid (LTA) when grown at pH 6.0 in batch culture to the stationary phase with either glucose or fructose. Extracellular LTA was a minor component in all cases except for L. fermentum and L. casei NIRD R094 grown in fructose. The total amount of LTA (cellular and extracellular) produced by fructose-grown cultures was also considerably greater for these two strains, for L. salivarius, and also two of the S. sanguis strains. Growth of L. fermentum and L. casei in continuous culture in a chemostat showed that generation time and pH of growth can influence the total amount of LTA and the proportion of extracellular material. The results for glucose-limited cultures were quite disparate, with L. fermentum forming considerably more extracellular LTA than L. casei. However, in fructose-limited cultures L. fermentum formed less total LTA and L. casei more so that the differences were only minor. A difference in the utilization of glucose and fructose by the heterofermentative L. fermentum and the homofermentative L. casei strains is also indicated by differences in the yield of organisms at different dilution rates in continuous culture.
TI  - Effect of mechanical and chemical plaque control measures on oral microflora in schoolchildren.
AB  - The incidence of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, total streptococci and lactobacilli was examined in highly caries active 13-14-year-old schoolchildren participating in a prophylactic program. After 1 year of trial, professional toothcleaning once every second week markedly reduced the frequency of gingivitis and the caries increment. Bimonthly topical applications of a 0.5% chlorhexidine gel with or without subsequent rinsing with 2% NFP had no effect on plaque score and gingivitis but tended to reduce the caries activity. No significant changes were found in the groups with regard to the salivary number of total streptococci and S. sanguis. A reduction of the population of S. salivarius, S. mutans and lactobacilli was observed in the chlorhexidine group. In the group where chlorhexidine was combined with MFP, only S. mutans was reduced.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Oral flora of children with "nursing bottle caries".
AB  - S. mutans averaged about 60% of the total cultivable flora of dental plaque obtained from caries lesions, white spot margins of these lesions, or clinically-sound areas of upper anterior teeth, and averaged about 27% in plaque from mostly clinically-sound areas of posterior teeth of six children with nursing bottle caries; its concentrations in saliva averaged about 10% of the total cultivable flora. Nearly all of 107 isolated S. mutans strains belonged to the serotype group c/e/f. The proportion of S. sanguis, in contrast to those of S. mutans, were very low in plaque from upper anterior teeth and higher in plaque from posterior teeth. The proportions of S. salivarius in saliva were unusually low, and this organism was not detected in the saliva of most subjects. Lactobacilli were found in nearly all plaque samples; plaque and carious material from cavities contained higher levels than plaque associated with white spots or clinically-sound tooth surfaces. The findings provide further support for the role of S. mutans in the initiation of human dental caries. In the case of lactobacilli, they support other evidence suggesting only the limited involvement of these organisms in the initiation of caries lesions, but a more extensive role in their progression. In addition, they clearly illustrate the marked effect of diet on the dental plaque flora.
TI  - Sucrose-induced ecological response of experimental dental plaques from caries-free and caries-susceptible Human volunteers.
AB  - Microbial succession, experimental cariogenicity, and sucrose metabolism were examined in dental plaques which developed on sterile bovine enamel inserts in acrylic palatal appliances. The appliances were worn for a period of 14 days by 10 caries-free and 10 caries-susceptible human volunteers. Three of six enamel inserts on each appliance were exposed extraorally to 10% sucrose in 0.85% saline six times a day, and three were exposed simultaneously to 0.85% saline as a control environment. The responses of the plaques to the high-sucrose environment in both caries status populations were compared. In all plaques, exposure to 10% sucrose stimulated the succession of Veillonella spp., Lactobacillus spp., Streptococcus salivarius, and, to a lesser extent, Streptococcus mutans and a decline in levels of Streptococcus sanguis, Neisseria spp., and gram-negative anaerobic rods. Plaques from caries-free mouths, in contrast to those from caries-susceptible mouths, harbored higher levels of Veillonella spp., gram-negative anaerobic rods, and Neisseria spp. and lower levels of Lactobacillus spp. Sucrose-exposed plaques from caries-free mouths also induced less enamel microhardness changes and formed less lactic acid from [14C]sucrose during a 60-min incubation at 37 degrees C than did comparable plaques from caries-susceptible mouths. The experiments revealed consistent differences in the ecological response to a cariogenic substrate environment in plaques from the two populations, with plaques from caries-free subjects exhibiting less cariogenic potential than those from caries-susceptible subjects.
TI  - A phylogenetic analysis of staphylococci, Peptococcus saccharolyticus and Micrococcus mucilaginosus.
AB  - The intra- and intergeneric relationships of the genus Staphylococcus, and the phylogenetic position of Peptococcus saccharolyticus and Micrococcus (Staphylococcus salivarius), were investigated by comparative oligonucleotide cataloguing of 16S rRNA. All the staphylococci investigated form a phylogenetically coherent group at the genus level that, in addition, contains the anaerobic species Peptococcus saccharolyticus. The genus Staphylococcus belongs to the broad Bacillus-Lactobacillus-Streptococcus cluster that is defined by Gram-positive bacteria with a low DNA G+C content. Micrococcus mucilaginosus is not a genuine member of the genus Micrococcus. The binary matching coefficients between the 16S rRNA of Micrococcus mucilaginosus and those representatives of the Arthrobacter/Micrococcus group and related genera indicate that Micrococcus mucilaginosus should be regarded as a member of a new genus.
TI  - Common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: immunochemical studies of extracellular and cell-wall-associated antigens from Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - Soluble extracellular antigens (ESA) were prepared from the culture supernatant of exponential growing cells of Streptococcus sanguis OMZ 9 by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on a Bio-Gel P6 column. Soluble cell wall antigens (WEA) were obtained from the bacterial pellet by extraction with 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6). Antisera against whole cells of S. sanguis and S. mutans of different serotypes, 10% trichloroacetic extracts of bacterial cell walls, dextran, ESA, and WEA were prepared by injecting the different antigens several times in rabbits. ESA and WEA were prepared from a representative strain of Bratthall's seven serological groups, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Actinomyces viscosus. All sera showed various agglutinin titers against heat-killed cells, and titers were generally higher with homologous cells. The comparison of the different antigens using agar gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis showed the presence of extracellular common antigens in both ESA and WEA between the different strains. Absorption of anti-ESA sera with WEA, and anti-WEA sera with ESA, showed the existence of a specific antigen common to all bacteria in each fraction. Enzymatic treatment of the antigen before immunodiffusion demonstrated the protein nature of the two antigens present in ESA and WEA.
TI  - Role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of Actinomyces viscosus.
AB  - The effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of Actinomyces viscosus T14V to tooth surfaces were assessed by using the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sHA) in vitro system. Attachment to sHA by A. viscosus T14V was not inhibited in the presence of Streptococcus mutans GS5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. Precoating sHA beads with S. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain T14V attachment. However, the presence of Streptococcus sanguis M5 during strain T14V attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of A. viscosus T14V with sHA, whereas another S. sanguis strain, strain G9B, produced relatively weak inhibition. The inhibitory effect of S. sanguis M5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with A. viscosus T14V. Conversely, the presence of strain T14V markedly increased the attachment of S. sanguis M5 to sHA while partially inhibiting the attachment of S. sanguis G9B. Moreover, sHA beads precoated with A. viscosus T14V bound much higher levels of S. sanguis M5 relative to uncoated sHA, whereas S. sanguis G9B attachment was only weakly inhibited. It was also observed that sHA beads precoated with either S. sanguis M5 or G9B inhibited subsequent attachment by strain T14V. These results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both S. sanguis strains partially overlap those for A. viscosus T14V. Streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain T14V to sHA, and both Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. In addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of A. viscosus T14V to human epithelial cells.
TI  - Cariogenicity of human oral lactobacilli in hamsters.
AB  - Of 50 strains of lactobacilli isolated from dental plaque of school children, two strains, provisionally identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, and one strain, provisionally identified as Lactobacillus fermentum, induced significant caries activity in conventional hamsters. Sucrose was a required dietary cariogenic substrate and could not be replaced with glucose or starch. In contrast to cariogenic strains of Streptococcus mutans the active lactobacilli did not form adherent sucrose-mediated plaques in vitro, did not form intracellular iodophilic polysaccharides and did not form detectable insoluble extracellular polyglucans.
TI  - Binding of streptococcal antigens to muscle tissue in vitro.
AB  - Antigens extracted from cells of Streptococcus pyogenes T6 and Streptococcus mutans strains AHT, BHT, 10449, OMZ175, and K1R adsorbed to the sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac muscle cells in vitro. Similar preparations from S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus casei had weak or negligible tissue-binding activity. Tissue-bound bacterial antigens were detected with homologous rabbit antisera with both indirect immunofluorescence tests and an indirect radioimmunoassay. Serological cross-reactivity was observed between the tissue-binding factors of S. pyogenes and S. mutans cells but not between the bacteria and muscle tissue. In a comparative study of extraction procedures, the greatest yield of tissue-binding factors was obtained from group A streptococci by cell disruption in buffer at 4 degrees C. Hot aqueous phenol and hot water extracts were inactive. Antibodies specific for the tissue-binding factor(s) were readily adsorbed from rabbit anti-S. pyogenes serum by a preparation of isolated cytoplasmic membranes but not by a suspension of cell wall fragments. The heart-binding component of S. pyogenes cell extracts was inactivated by protease digestion and heat treatment and to a lesser extent by periodic acid oxidation. The capacity of heart cell components to adsorb streptococcal antigens was reduced by protease treatment but not by the action of neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, organic solvents, or detergents.
TI  - Bacterial and strain specificities in opsonization, phagocytosis and killing of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Opsonization of Streptococcus mutans, followed by phagocytosis and killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes has been postulated as an effector mechanism in protection against dental caries. Opsonization was studied by using sera from monkeys immunized with killed Strep. mutans (sero-type c) and compared with sera from sham-immunized monkeys. Antibodies to Strep. mutans (sero-type c) induced maximal phagocytosis and killing of serotypes c and e, and this was significantly greater than with serotypes a and d; there was no significant phagocytosis or killing of serotype b. There was little or no opsonization with Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus casei, Strep, sanguis and Strep. salivarius. The exception was Strep. CHT which showed significant phagocytosis and killing. The results suggest that immunization with the serotype c strain of Strep. mutans might offer protection against four of the five common serotypes of this organism.
TI  - Extractability of cell wall polysaccharide from lactobacilli and streptococci by  autoclaving and by dilue acid.
AB  - Autoclaving cell wall of Streptococcus mutans Ingbritt for 15 min under the Rantz and Randall conditions released one-tenth of the total cell wall carbohydrate, whereas two-thirds was extracted after autoclaving for 180 min. The extract contained the serotype c-specific antigen but lacked the lipoteichoic acid component extracted when whole cells were autoclaved. Autoclaving cell wall preparations from other strains of S. mutans and also Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis in 0.85% NaCl for 180 min released the major proportion of the wall polysaccharide fraction. Approximately 50 to 90% of wall carbohydrate of Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus casei was released when cell wall preparations were autoclaved in 0.85% NaCl for 180 min. For wall preparations from several strains of S. mutans, autoclaving for 60 min at pH 3.75 released only 39 to 62% of wall carbohydrate, whereas almost total release could be achieved with the lactobacilli. Heating S. mutans Ingbritt cell wall for 24 h at 60 degrees C in 0.1 N H(2)SO(4) released only two-thirds of the wall carbohydrate; by comparison nearly all of the wall carbohydrate was released in 3 h from L. casei and L. fermentum. Autoclaving L. casei cell wall and purified soluble wall fractions hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. This was shown by the release of reactive N-acetylhexosamine in both cases and the presence of a phosphomonoester in the autoclaved soluble wall fractions. The results indicate that autoclaving can hydrolyze covalent linkages, and this must be considered when the Rantz and Randall procedure is used to obtain antigen preparations.
TI  - Bacteria associated with the gastric epithelium of neonatal pigs.
AB  - Light and electron microscopy showed lactobacilli and, to a lesser degree, streptococci to be closely associated with the squamous area of the pig stomach known as the pars esophagea. Several different types of extracellular layers were seen on bacteria attached to the epithelial surface. The total number of bacteria per square centimeter did not change with age up to 10 days, and there was no effect of weaning at 2 days. Lactobacillus fermentum, L. salivarius, and Streptococcus salivarius were isolated more frequently from sucking pigs than from those that were early weaned, whereas the reverse was true of L. acidophilus and S. bovis. All isolates recovered from washed macerated pars esophagea adhered to pig esophageal epithelial cells when tested in vitro.
TI  - Dental caries induction in experimental animals by clinical strains of Streptococcus mutans isolated from Japanese children.
AB  - Oral implantation and the cariogenic activity of clinical strains of Streptococcus mutans which had been isolated from Japanese children and labeled with streptomycin-resistance were examined in specific pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats. All the seven strains tested were easily implanted and persisted during the experimental period. Extensive carious lesions were produced in rats inoculated with clinical strains of S. mutans belonging to serotypes c, d, e, and f, and maintained on caries-inducing diet no. 2000. Noninfected rats did not develop dental caries when fed diet no. 2000. Type d S. mutans preferentially induced smooth surface caries in the rats. Strains of other serotypes primarily developed caries of pit and fissure origin. Caries also developed in rats inoculated with reference S. mutans strains BHTR and FAIR (type b) that had been maintained in the laboratories for many years. However, the cariogenicity of the laboratory strains was found to have decreased markedly. All three S. sanguis strains could be implanted, but only one strain induced definite fissure caries. Two S. salivarius strains could not be implanted well in the rats and therefore they were not cariogenic. Four different species of lactobacilli also failed to induce dental caries in rats subjected to similar caries test regimen on diet no. 200. S. mutans strain MT6R (type c) also induce caries in golden hamsters and ICR mice, but of variable degrees.
TI  - Binding of lectins to Streptococcus mutans cells and type-specific polysaccharides, and effect on adherence.
AB  - The lectin concanavalin A (Con A) agglutinated the cells of 13 of 15 strains of the seven serotypes of Streptococcus mutans in an 18-h incubation period. Strains of types a, d, f, and g agglutinated within 2 h. Strains of a, d, and f were also agglutinated in 2 h by the castor bean lectin RCA. S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, and Lactobacillus plantarum were agglutinated within 2 h. The S. mutans type f polysaccharide was precipitated by Con A. The a, b, c, d, and e polysaccharides were not precipitated. Glucan from d and e strains of S. mutans and dextran T2000 were also precipitated by Con A. D-glucose inhibited the agglutination of type f cells by Con A and the agglutination of type d cells by D-galactose. The quantity of [acetyl-3H]Con A bound was not proportional to the degree of agglutination. Cells grown in sucrose medium bound more Con A than those grown in glucose medium. After treatment with dextranase, the sucrose-grown cells bound two- to fourfold more Con A. The binding of Con A to the type-specific polysaccharide or to teichoic acid could not be determined by the use of specific antibody due to the binding of Con A to the antibody globulin on the cell surface. Con A bound to S. mutans cells did not inhibit the activity of cell-bound glucosyltransferase, glucan synthesis, and in vitro adherence. Bound Con A also did not inhibit the ability of heat-treated cells to bind glucosyltransferase, synthesize glucan, and produce in vitro adherence.
TI  - Changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
AB  - The gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. Although there was a significantly higher count of Escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. There were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. Lactobacillus fermentum, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus salivarius, S. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. L. fermentum and S. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. The weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there may be gastric stasis. The gastric pH was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. In weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between pH and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and also a positive correlation between pH and number of E. coli. These correlations suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in the regulation of gastric pH in weaned pigs. Three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting HCl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, pH < 3.5). In sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. In weaned scouring pigs there was a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. There was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.
TI  - Survival of bacteria from human dental plaque under various transport conditions.
AB  - The effects of transport media, temperature, and anaerobiosis on the survival of  bacteria from human supragingival dental plaque were studied. Individual samples were obtained by passing sterile, unwaxed dental floss through the interproximal spaces. The plaque-bearing portion of floss was immediately placed in vials containing reduced transport fluid, viability-preserving microbistatic medium, or reduced salt solution transport fluid. Plaque samples were dispersed by ultrasonic oscillation, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate on MM10-sucrose-blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar, and Rogosa tomato juice agar. Initial viable counts (time 0) were compared with viable count determinations after 48- and 72-h storage. Quantitative recovery (>30%) of various groups of oral bacteria was accomplished from both reduced transport fluid and viability-preserving microbistatic medium after 48- and 72-h storage. Storage of dental plaque in reduced salt solution proved unsatisfactory for most bacteria (less than 10% survival). Since growth of some bacteria may occur in viability-preserving microbistatic medium and the charcoal present interferes with colonly enumeration on low-dilution plates, we found reduced transport fluid to be the most suitable medium for transport and recovery of bacteria from supragingival dental plaque. Subzero storage (-196 and -40 degrees C) did not enhance the survival of bacteria from dental plaque; storage at moderate (5 and 20 degrees C) temperatures gave better recovery of viable bacteria. Survival after anaerobic or aerobic storage was comparable for total colony-forming units; however, anaerobic storage enhanced survival of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus. Since these organisms are specifically associated with dental caries, anaerobic techniques are preferred for caries activity testing of plaque.
TI  - Microbial characterization of an experimental cariogenic plaque in man.
AB  - Experimentally induced plaque seemed to originate by direct contact inoculation from the vestibular mucosa and saliva. During the next seven days, this plaque developed its own characteristics. Populations of Streptococcus mutans usually less than 2% of total streptococci population in plaques that were less than three days old, increased between days 3 and 7. Proportions of S sanguis, high in early samples, decreased after day 3. Populations of S salivarius, which usually outnumbered other streptococci, fluctuated widely through day 3, and then increased in proportion in subjects who were more productive of experimental caries, but decreased in subjects who were less productive. Proportions of plaque flora comprising lactobacilli paralleled those of S salivarius.
TI  - Acid production from Lycasin, maltitol, sorbitol and xylitol by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  - The acid production from maltitol was compared with the acid production from hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (Lycasin), sorbitol and xylitol by a number of oral strains and reference strains of Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mitior, S. milleri, S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. avium, Lactobacillus casei and L. salivarius. The polyols were added to a final concentration of 1.0% to two different basal media. Incubation was performed at 37 degrees C for 7 days after which the pH was recorded. Maltitol was fermented only by the lactobacilli (about two thirds of the strains). Lycasin was fermented by all strains of S. faecalis, more than 90% of the lactobacilli, about half of the S. sanguis strains, about one third of the S. mutans strains, and by a few other streptococcal strains. Acid production from sorbitol was observed among more than 80% of the S. mutans strains and the S. faecalis strains and most of the lactobacilli strains. Sorbitol-fermenting strains of S. sanguis and of S. mitior, all isolated from sorbitol-consumers, were observed. No other sorbitol-fermenting streptococci were found. Only the reference strains L. salivarius subsp. salivarius ATCC 11741 and S. avium ATCC 14025 fermented xylitol.
TI  - [Difference between dental plaque formation by Lactobacillus Sp. and Strep. mutans].
AB  - Human teeth were suspended in a basal medium with sucrose 10%; they were incudated for formation of dental plaques "in vitro". The microorganisms used were: Strep. mutans, Lactobacillus salivarius var. salivarius and a mixture of them. The following aspects were stablishad by scanning electron microscopy: 1) The teeth inoculated with Strep. mutans had coccoid forms, lying on an organic film with spheric spaces in some sectors, and irreguar forms in others (Fig. 1). 2) The teeth inoculated with Lactobacillus salivarius had rod forms attached to the adamantine surface (Fig. 2, 3). 3) Teeth incubated with the mixutre had rod forms over a granular film (Fig. 4). 4) The control teath did not have plaque (Fig. 5). This experience shows that the extracellular polisacharide, reticulated or granular (mutano) appeared only in teeth incubated with Strep. mutans alone (Fig. 1) or mixed with Lactobacillus (Fig. 4). On the other hand Lactobacillus appeared attached on the enamel surfaces, perhaps due to cohesive adhesive forces (Fig. 2). Two different interpretation or the formation of dental plaques that take place on the enamel free surfaces of teeth are presented.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible Micrococcus lysodeikticus (NCTC 2665) and lysozyme-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. Using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of Staphylococcus aureus (Copenhagen), Streptococcus pyogens (group A, type 6; S43/100), Streptococcus salivarius (IFO 3350), Streptococcus faecalis (IFO 12580), Streptococcus mutans (BHT), Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 8014), Bacillus megaterium (IFO 12068), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (Park-Williams No. 8), Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Actinomyces viscous (ATCC 15987). Evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.
TI  - Evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic Streptococcus for production of IgA protease.
AB  - IgA protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma IgA of human origin to yield intact Fabalpha and Fcalpha fragments. To determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known Lancefield group serotype. Streptococci of groups A, B, C, D, F, G, H, M, and N, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitior, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus faecalis, Veillonella, Lactobacillus, Actinomyces, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for IgA protease activity. Only S. sanguis and clinically isolated group H streptococci elaborated IgA protease under the culture conditions used. Negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory IgA. Among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce IgA protease is restricted to certain species of Streptococcus, notably those of the group H serotype. Since secretory immunity is mediated by the IgA class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.
TI  - Mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic Streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  - Mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near pH 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. Mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 C in the pH range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 C in the acid range. N-bromosuccinimide caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mM, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. Mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against S. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. The lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. Digestion of the cell walls of S. mutans BHT by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. Mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.
TI  - Ecology of human oral lactobacilli.
AB  - Lactobacilli were found in saliva, on teeth, and on the dorsum of the tongue, the vestibular mucosa, and the hard palate in humans. Their proportions in saliva, expressed as percentage of the anaerobically cultivable flora, were 10- to 100-fold higher than those on the tooth surface, but were comparable to those on the epithelial surfaces. The adherence of Lactobacillus casei and L. fermenti to oral surfaces was compared with that of streptomycin-labeled Streptococcus sanguis and S. salivarius by using in vitro-cultivated cells. The affinity of both Lactobacillus species for the tooth surface was very low compared with that of S. sanguis but was somewhat higher than that of S. salivarius. The lactobacilli and both Streptococcus species adhered to a similar extent to the dorsum of the tongue, whereas the affinity of the lactobacilli and S. salivarius for the vestibular mucosa was about one-half of that of S. sanguis. The results suggest that the affinity of lactobacilli for oral surfaces significantly influences their proportional distribution in the mouth. The relatively low affinity of lactobacilli for the tooth surface suggests that their recognized association with carious lesions and mechanical appliances under certain conditions may be due primarily to mechanical retention rather than unique growth conditions.
