TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from milkmen and cows with clinical mastitis in and around kampala, uganda.
AB  == background: identification of pathogens associated with bovine mastitis is helpful in treatment and management decisions. however, such data from sub-saharan africa is scarce. here we describe the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from cows with clinical mastitis in kampala,  uganda. due to high concern of zoonotic infections, isolates from milkmen are also described. methodology/principal findings: ninety seven milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis and 31 nasal swabs from milkmen were collected (one sample per cow/human). fifty eight (60%) gram-positive isolates namely staphylococci (21), enterococci (16), streptococci (13), lactococci (5), micrococci (2) and arcanobacteria (1) were detected in cows; only one grew staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, 24 (25%) coliforms namely escherichia coli (12), klebsiella oxytoca (5), proteus vulgaris (2), serratia (2), citrobacter (1), cedecea (1) and leclercia (1) were identified. from humans, 24 gram-positive bacteria grew, of which 11 were staphylococci (35%) including four staphylococcus aureus. upon susceptibility testing, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) were prevalent; 57%, 12/21 in cows and 64%, 7/11 in humans.  however, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was not detected. furthermore, methicillin and vancomycin resistant cons were detected in cows (staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus lugdunensis) and humans (staphylococcus scuiri). also, vancomycin and daptomycin resistant enterococci (enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively) were detected in cows. coliforms were less resistant with three pan-susceptible isolates. however, multidrug resistant klebsiella, proteus, serratia, cedecea, and citrobacter were detected.  lastly, similar species grew from human and bovine samples but on genotyping, the isolates were found to be different. interestingly, human and bovine staphylococcus aureus were genetically similar (spa-cc435, spa-type t645 corresponding to st121) but with different susceptibility patterns. conclusions/significance: cons, enterococci, streptococci, and escherichia coli are the predominant pathogens associated with clinical bovine-mastitis in kampala, uganda. multidrug resistant bacteria are also prevalent. while similar species occurred in humans and cows, transmission was not detected.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == impact of ph on activity of trimethoprim, fosfomycin, amikacin, colistin and ertapenem in human urine.
AB  == objective: although major impairment of activity at lower ph values has been reported for fluoroquinolones, acidification is a widely recommended practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis). until now, there is little evidence for the influence of ph on the activity on other antimicrobial classes in urine. methods: bacterial growth curves of staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), klebsiella oxytoca (atcc 700324), proteus mirabilis (atcc 14153), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) were performed in mueller-hinton broth and in pooled human urine with a ph of between 5.0 and 8.0. bacterial killing of trimethoprim, fosfomycin,  amikacin, colistin and ertapenem against the five strains (where appropriate) was determined consecutively at concentrations equal to the mic. results: while no difference in the bacterial growth of e. coli, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca was observed at different ph values, bacterial growth of e. faecalis was  significantly reduced at low ph. acidification to ph 5 impaired the antimicrobial activity of all investigated antibiotics, i.e. the net effect of bacterial growth and killing resulted in increased colony-forming units/ml at the end of the experiment. conclusion: the present in vitro findings indicate that acidification of urine during the treatment of utis should be carefully considered. while growth curves of one strain supports the concept of therapeutic or prophylactic acidification during utis, the most common pathogen, e. coli, was not affected by low ph. independent of the investigated strain or antibiotic, ph values below 6 lead to a reduction of antimicrobial activity.

TI  == impact of gram-negative bacteria in interaction with a complex microbial consortium on biogenic amine content and sensory characteristics of an uncooked pressed cheese.
AB  == the impact of gram-negative bacteria on sensory characteristics and production of volatile compounds as well as biogenic amines (ba) in the core of an uncooked pressed type model cheese was investigated in the presence of a defined complex microbial consortium. eleven strains of gram-negative bacteria, selected on the basis of their biodiversity and in vitro ba-production ability, were individually tested in a model cheese. four out of 6 strains of enterobacteriaceae (citrobacter freundii ucma 4217, klebsiella oxytoca 927, hafnia alvei b16 and proteus vulgaris ucma 3780) reached counts close to 6 log cfu g(-)(1) in the model cheese. in core of cheeses inoculated with gram-negative bacteria, only slight differences were observed for microbial counts (enterococcus faecalis or lactobacillus plantarum count differences below 1 log cfu g(-)(1)), acetate concentration (differences below 200 mg kg(-)(1)) and texture (greater firmness)  in comparison to control cheeses. cheese core colour, odour and volatile compound composition were not modified. although ornithine, the precursor of putrescine, was present in all cheeses, putrescine was only detected in cheeses inoculated with h. alvei b16 and never exceeded 2.18 mmol kg(-)(1) cheese dry matter. cadaverine was only detected in cheeses inoculated with h. alvei b16, k. oxytoca  927, halomonas venusta 4c1a or morganella morganii 3a2a but at lower concentrations (<1.05 mmol kg(-)(1) cheese dry matter), although lysine was available. only insignificant amounts of the detrimental ba histamine and tyramine, as well as isopentylamine, tryptamine or phenylethylamine, were produced in the cheese model by any of the gram-negative strains, including those which produced these ba at high levels in vitro.

TI  == the age-related risk of co-existing meningitis in children with urinary tract infection.
AB  == objective: the primary aim of this study was to determine age-stratified rates of co-existing bacterial meningitis in children with urinary tract infection (uti).  the secondary aims of this study were to determine the causative pathogens of uti, and the clinical features and outcome of children with co-existing meningitis. methods: analysis of data collected over a nine-year period at a tertiary pediatric hospital in australia. study population: children below 16 years of age with culture-confirmed uti and a paired csf sample. results: a total of 748 episodes in 735 cases were included in the final analysis. the commonest pathogens causing uti were escherichia coli (67.4%), enterococcus faecalis (8.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (3.5%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). only two (1.2%; 95% ci: 0.15-4.36%) of 163 neonates (between 0 and 28 days of age) with uti had co-existing meningitis. both presented with pyrexia, irritability and lethargy, and recovered uneventfully with antibiotic treatment. there were no cases of co-existing meningitis among 499 infants (between 29 days and 12 months  of age) with uti (95% ci: 0.00-0.74%), or any of the 86 children aged 12 months or over (95% ci: 0.00-4.20%). conclusions: these findings indicate that clinicians should have a low threshold to perform a lumbar puncture in neonates with uti, as the risk of co-existing meningitis is not insignificant in this age  group. in contrast, beyond the neonatal period, the risk is small and a more selective approach is warranted.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == pharmacokinetics of free ertapenem in critically ill septic patients: intermittent versus continuous infusion.
AB  == background: the aim of this paper was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) parameters of continuous (ci) and intermittent infusion (iti) of ertapenem into critically ill patients with severe abdominal infections. methods: twenty septic patients hospitalized in a university hospital intensive care unit were enrolled in the study. half of the patients received ertapenem as  an iti 1 g bolus once daily, and the other half of the patients received the same dose via ci over 24 h following a 1-g loading dose. blood was drawn 1, 12 and 24  h after terminating iti or on days 2, 3 and 5 after starting ci for each patient. after centrifugation, the drawn blood was frozen at -80 degrees c until being examined by high-performance liquid-chromatography analysis. results: median serum-free ertapenem concentrations were as follows: fcmax = 98.9 mg/l and fcmin  = 2.5 mg/l for iti, and fcss=15.9 mg/l for ci. the iti and ci median total clearance and volumes of distribution were 2.2 l/h vs. 2.5 l/h and 15.4 l vs. 21.0 l, respectively. the ertapenem mic ranges were as follows: escherichia coli  (0.006 to 0.5 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (0.023 to 0.5 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.023 to 0.5 mg/l), staphylococcus aureus (0.38 to 3 mg/l), streptococcus viridians (0.38 to 3 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (0.38 to 3 mg/l). iti and ci provided steady-state serum-free ertapenem concentrations constantly above the mic for all bacteria. conclusion: ertapenem exhibited satisfactory pk/pd parameters and achieved serum-free concentrations 100% of the time, above even the high mic of extracellular pathogens normally encountered during severe abdominal infections. ci administration resulted in equally effective pk/pd parameters as iti in normal weight, good renal-function patients.

TI  == evaluation of the epinecidin-1 peptide as an active ingredient in cleaning solutions against pathogens.
AB  == we tested the activity of epinecidin-1, a novel antimicrobial peptide structurally related to pleurocidin, in commercial cleaning solutions stored at 4 and 25 degrees c for 7 and 14 days. the peptide's activities against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, propionibacterium acnes, and candida albicans were measured in a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determination, minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) determination, disk diffusion test, and a count  of the bacterial numbers. exposure to epinecidn-1 in a cleaning solution following mic value comparisons in the disk diffusion test and counts of bacterial numbers after 16, 24, 48, and 72 h suggested that bacterial numbers were much lower than those treated with only commercial cleaning solutions for all bacteria. the efficacy of the antimicrobial activities of inhibiting bacterial numbers by epinecidin-1 in cleaning solutions at a low ph and a low temperature was not affected. given its simple structure and antimicrobial activity, epinecidin-1 may be a useful component of microbicides designed to prevent pathogen infections and/or remediate abnormal vaginal or skin flora.

TI  == maggot excretions inhibit biofilm formation on biomaterials.
AB  == background: biofilm-associated infections in trauma surgery are difficult to treat with conventional therapies. therefore, it is important to develop new treatment modalities. maggots in captured bags, which are permeable for larval excretions/secretions, aid in healing severe, infected wounds, suspect for biofilm formation. therefore we presumed maggot excretions/secretions would reduce biofilm formation. questions/purposes: we studied biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, and enterobacter cloacae on polyethylene, titanium, and stainless steel. we compared the quantities of biofilm formation between the bacterial species on the various biomaterials and the quantity of biofilm formation after various incubation times. maggot excretions/secretions were added to existing biofilms to examine their effect. methods: comb-like models of the biomaterials, made to fit in a 96-well microtiter plate, were incubated with bacterial suspension. the formed biofilms were stained in crystal violet, which was eluted in ethanol. the optical density (at 595 nm) of the eluate was determined to quantify biofilm formation. maggot excretions/secretions were pipetted in different concentrations to (nonstained) 7-day-old biofilms, incubated 24 hours, and finally measured. results: the strongest biofilms were formed by s. aureus and s. epidermidis on polyethylene and the weakest on titanium. the highest quantity of biofilm formation was reached within 7 days for both bacteria. the presence of excretions/secretions reduced biofilm formation on all biomaterials. a maximum of 92% of biofilm reduction was measured. conclusions: our observations suggest maggot excretions/secretions decrease biofilm formation and could provide a new treatment for biofilm formation on infected biomaterials.

AB  == introduction: distigmine, a long-acting anti-cholinesterase, is associated with side effects such as parkinsonism, cholinergic crisis, and rhabdomyolysis. we report a spinal cord injury patient, who developed marked hydronephrosis and hydroureter after distigmine therapy, which led to a series of complications over subsequent years. case presentation: a 38-year-old male developed t-9 paraplegia  in 1989. intravenous urography, performed in 1989, showed normal kidneys, ureters and bladder. he was prescribed distigmine bromide orally and was allowed to pass  urine spontaneously. in 1992, intravenous urography showed bilateral marked hydronephrosis and hydroureter. distigmine was discontinued. he continued to pass urine spontaneously. in 2006, intravenous urography showed moderate dilatation of both pelvicalyceal systems and ureters down to the level of urinary bladder. this patient was performing self-catheterisation only once a day. he was advised to do catheterisations at least three times a day. in december 2008, this patient developed haematuriawhich lasted for nearly four months.. he received trimethoprim, then cephalexin, followed by macrodantin, amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin. in february 2009, intravenous urography showed calculus at the lower pole of left kidney. both kidneys were moderately hydronephrotic. ureters were dilated down to the bladder. dilute contrast was seen in the bladder due to  residual urine. this patient was advised to perform six catheterisations a day, and take propiverine hydrochloride 15 mg, three times a day. microbiology of urine showed klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis. cystoscopy revealed papillary lesions in bladder neck and trigone. transurethral resection was performed. histology showed marked chronic cystitis including follicular cystitis and papillary/polypoid cystitis. there was no evidence of malignancy. conclusion: distigmine therapy resulted in marked bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter. persistence of hydronephrosis after omitting distigmine, and presence of residual urine in bladder over many years probably predisposed to formation of polypoid cystitis and follicular cystitis, and contributed to prolonged haematuria, which occurred after an episode of urine infection. this case illustrates the dangers of prescribing distigmine to promote spontaneous voiding in spinal cord injury patients. instead of using distigmine,  spinal cord injury patients should be advised to consider intermittent catheterisation together with oxybutynin or propiverine to achieve complete, low-pressure emptying of urinary bladder.

TI  == microbiological and toxicological effects of perla black bean (phaseolus vulgaris l.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == we investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. three different solvents were used to obtain perla black bean extracts. all three perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and  further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (ic(50)). methanol perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. all perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes did not. acidified water and acetic acid perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. the best ic(50) was observed for giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against entamoeba histolytica and trichomonas vaginalis. the vero cells toxicity levels (ic(50)) for methanol, acidified water  and acetic acid perla black bean extract were [mean +/- s.d. (95% ci)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. in vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. the acetic acid and methanol perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against giardia lamblia, entamoeba hystolitica and trichomonas vaginalis. the three perla black bean extracts assayed over vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == antimicrobial spectrum and target site of d-3-phenyllactic acid.
AB  == geotrichum candidum excretes d-3-phenyllactic acid, which inhibits the growth of  listeria monocytogenes. it was found to inhibit a range of gram-positive bacteria found in humans and foodstuffs, such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative bacteria from humans, such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella oxytoca. scanning electron microscope studies on the effect of d-3-phenyllactic acid on l. monocytogenes showed that it caused changes in bacterial behavior and structure. the bacteria formed aggregates and secreted polysaccharides; their cell walls lost their rigidity, causing the cells to swell. finally the bacteria broke down completely and the cells disintegrate.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml  was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of apalcillin alone and combined with ro 48-1220, a novel penam beta-lactamase inhibitor.
AB  == objective: the in vitro activity of apalcillin plus ro 48-1220, a novel penam sulfone beta-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with apalcillin alone, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, ceftazidime and cefepime. methods: agar dilution and broth microdilution testing of 854 bacterial strains, subcultured from frozen stocks incubated for 24 h in 5% carbon dioxide, was carried out to determine the minimum bactericidal (mbc) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of each of the study drugs in accordance with the nccls m26-t method. results: apalcillin/ro 48-1220 was active against all gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates except klebsiella oxytoca (mic90 32 microg/ml). among the enterobacteriaceae, synergy for apalcillin/ro 48-1220 (4 microg/ml fixed concentration) vs apalcillin alone was demonstrated for nearly all species when comparing mic90 results. apalcillin/ro 48-1220 was highly potent against beta-lactamase-producing moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics less-than-or-equal 1 microg/ml). however, much of this activity was due to the direct antimicrobial action of ro 48-1220 alone (mics less-than-or-equal 4 microg/ml). all pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia and acinetobacter species were inhibited by apalcillin/ro 48-1220 (mic90 0.25 to 4 microg/ml). for the aerobic gram-positive organisms, none of the drugs tested were consistently effective against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, corynebacterium jeikeium and enterococcus species other than e. faecalis. apalcillin/ro 48-1220 was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam against escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum tem enzymes, but less active against isolates producing shv-type beta-lactamases. when tested against 204 ceftazidime-, gentamicin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, 78%, 91% and 66% of strains, respectively, were susceptible to apalcillin/ro 48-1220 (less-than-or-equal 16 microg/ml). conclusions: apalcillin/ro 48-1220 is bactericidal with a modest inoculum effect; its wide spectrum of activity favors  continued studies of spectrum, pharmacokinetics and in vivo efficacy.

TI  == in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefdinir (fk482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent  clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90 0.015-2 mg/l). cefixime was the most active agent against hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris (mic90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). the activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against s. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (mic90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to  cefixime against s. pyogenes (mic90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, klebsiella spp. and proteus spp. (mic90 <  0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). the activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against enterococcus faecalis (mic90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). none of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 >  64 mg/l). overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. at 24 h at 1 x mic, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x mic, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.

TI  == residual bacterial contamination on reusable pulse oximetry sensors.
AB  == background: an early study demonstrated that standard cleaning techniques did not adequately disinfect reusable pulse oximetry sensors that had been intentionally  contaminated with high titers of pathogenic microorganisms. this current study evaluated patient-ready sensors being used in hospitals, by testing them for bacterial contamination. methods: reusable pulse oximetry sensors from 15 hospitals throughout the united states were tested. each sensor was deemed by the hospital to be ready for patient use, and it had been prepared for use according  to hospital procedures. patient-contact areas of each sensor were swabbed, and the swabs were analyzed for bacterial contamination using standard testing procedures. this study had two stages, and different sensors were tested in each  stage. in the "bacterial-growth stage," swabs were evaluated for bacterial contamination but organisms were not identified; in the "identification stage," bacterial species were identified. results: forty-four sensors were evaluated, 16 in the bacterial-growth stage and 28 in the identification stage. bacteria were cultured from 29 of the 44 sensors (66%), including 20 that had been cleaned with alcohol or an antibacterial/antiviral agent. among the isolated organisms were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, and klebsiella oxytoca. bacterial contamination was found on sensors from 12 of the 15 participating hospitals. conclusions: these data demonstrate the need to define effective cleaning methods for reusable sensors, and we are currently conducting such studies. the data also suggest that disposable patient-dedicated  sensors may be the most appropriate choice when infection control is of particular concern.
