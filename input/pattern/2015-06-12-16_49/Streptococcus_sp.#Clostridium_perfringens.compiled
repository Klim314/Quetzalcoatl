TI  - Convergent weaponry in a biological arms race.
AB  - Bacterial surface proteins covalently attach to host cells via a mechanism that is also used by immune system proteins that help eliminate invading pathogens.
TI  - An internal thioester in a pathogen surface protein mediates covalent host binding.
AB  - To cause disease and persist in a host, pathogenic and commensal microbes must adhere to tissues. Colonization and infection depend on specific molecular interactions at the host-microbe interface that involve microbial surface proteins, or adhesins. To date, adhesins are only known to bind to host receptors non-covalently. Here we show that the streptococcal surface protein SfbI mediates covalent interaction with the host protein fibrinogen using an unusual internal thioester bond as a 'chemical harpoon'. This cross-linking reaction allows bacterial attachment to fibrin and SfbI binding to human cells in a model of inflammation. Thioester-containing domains are unexpectedly prevalent in Gram-positive bacteria, including many clinically relevant pathogens. Our findings support bacterial-encoded covalent binding as a new molecular principle in host-microbe interactions. This represents an as yet unexploited target to treat bacterial infection and may also offer novel opportunities for engineering beneficial interactions.
TI  - C-Terminal Clostridium perfringens Enterotoxin-Mediated Antigen Delivery for Nasal Pneumococcal Vaccine.
AB  - Efficient vaccine delivery to mucosal tissues including mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues is essential for the development of mucosal vaccine. We previously reported that claudin-4 was highly expressed on the epithelium of nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and thus claudin-4-targeting using C-terminal fragment of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (C-CPE) effectively delivered fused antigen to NALT and consequently induced antigen-specific immune responses. In this study, we applied the C-CPE-based vaccine delivery system to develop a nasal pneumococcal vaccine. We fused C-CPE with pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), an important antigen for the induction of protective immunity against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, (PspA-C-CPE). PspA-C-CPE binds to claudin-4 and thus efficiently attaches to NALT epithelium, including antigen-sampling M cells. Nasal immunization with PspA-C-CPE induced PspA-specific IgG in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as well as IgA in the nasal wash and BALF. These immune responses were sufficient to protect against pneumococcal infection. These results suggest that C-CPE is an efficient vaccine delivery system for the development of nasal vaccines against pneumococcal infection.
TI  - Phytase modulates ileal microbiota and enhances growth performance of the broiler chickens.
AB  - Phytase is well studied and explored, however, little is known about its effects  on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract. In total, 400 one-day-old female Ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to four experimental groups. The dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 complete factorial design, with the factors being adequate (PC) or insufficient calcium (Ca) and digestible phosphor (dP)(NC) and with or without 5000 phytase units (FTU)/kg of Escherichia coli 6-phytase. The gastrointestinal tract pH values, ileal microbial communities and short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the digesta were determined. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly affected pH in the crop and caeca, and addition of phytase to the NC resulted in a pH increase in the ileum. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly lowered, while phytase supplementation increased ileal total bacterial counts. Additionally, the deficient diet reduced butyrate- but increased lactate-producing bacteria. The addition of phytase increased Lactobacillus sp./Enterococcus sp. whereas in case of Clostridium leptum subgroup, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale cluster, Bifidobacterium sp. and Streptococcus/Lactococcus counts, a significant Ca and dP level x phytase interaction was found. However, the recorded interactions indicated that the effects of phytase and Ca and dP levels were not consistent. Furthermore, the reduction of Ca and dP level lowered Clostridium perfringens and Enterobacteriaceae counts. The analysis of fermentation products showed that reducing the Ca and dP content in the diet reduced total SCFA, DL-lactate, and acetic acid in the ileum whereas phytase increased concentrations of these acids in the NC group. This suggests that P is a factor which limits fermentation in the ileum. It may be concluded that phytase plays a role in modulating the gut microbiota of chicken, however, this is clearly linked with the levels of P and Ca in a diet.
TI  - Splenic abscess after splenic blunt injury angioembolization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Splenic Angioembolization (SAE), during Nonoperative Management (NOM) of Blunt Splenic Injury (BSI), is an effective therapy for hemodynamically stable patients with grade III, IV, and V OIS splenic injuries. We report a case of a patient with a blunt abdominal trauma due to an accidental fall, who presented splenic abscess a week after SAE and a review of the literature. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old male arrived at Emergency after an accidental fall with contusion of the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Abdominal CT scan revealed the fracture of the lower splenic pole with intraparenchymal pseudoaneurysms (OIS spleen injury scale IV). Considering the hemodynamic stability, NOM was undertaken and SAE was performed. After a week, the patient developed a splenic abscess confirmed by Abdominal CT; therefore, splenectomy was performed. There was no evidence of bacterial growing in the perisplenic hematoma cultures but the histological examination showed multiple abscess and hemorrhagic areas in the spleen. DISCUSSION: Splenic abscess after SAE during NOM of BSI is a rare major complication. The most frequently cultured organisms include Clostridium perfringens, Alpha-Hemoliticus Streptococcus, gram-positive Staphylococcus, gram-negative Salmonella, Candida, and Aspergillus. This case represents our first reported splenic abscess after SAE. CONCLUSION: SAE is a very useful tool for BSI managing; splenic abscess can occur in a short time, even if it is a rare major complication, so it may be useful to monitor patients undergoing SAE, focusing not only on the hemodynamic parameters but also on the inflammatory and infectious aspects.
TI  - Feed supplementation with red seaweeds, Chondrus crispus and Sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii, affects performance, egg quality, and gut microbiota of layer hens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the inclusion of red seaweed  supplementation to standard poultry diets on production performance, egg quality, intestinal histology, and cecal short-chain fatty acids in Lohmann Brown Classic laying hens. A total of 160 birds were randomly assigned to 8 treatment groups. Control hens were fed a basal layer diet; positive control hens were fed a diet containing 2% inulin; and 6 treatment groups were fed a diet containing one of the following; 0.5, 1, or 2% Chondrus crispus (CC0.5, CC1, and CC2, respectively) and one of the same 3 levels of Sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii (SG0.5, SG1, and SG2, respectively). Dietary supplementation had no significant effect on the feed intake, BW, egg production, fecal moisture content, and blood serum profile of the birds. The feed conversion ratio per gram of egg was significantly more efficient (P = 0.001) for CC2 and SG2 treatments. Moreover, SG1 supplementation increased egg yolk weight (P = 0.0035) and birds with CC1 supplementation had higher egg weight (P = 0.0006). The SG2 and CC2 groups had greater (P < 0.05) villus height and villus surface area compared with the control birds. Seaweed supplementation increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria [e.g., Bifidobacterium longum (4- to 14-fold), Streptococcus salivarius (4- to 15-fold)] and importantly reduced the prevalence of Clostridium perfringens in the gut of the chicken. Additionally, the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids, including acetic acid, propionic acid, n-butyric acid, and i-butyric acid, were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in CC and SG treatments than in the control. In conclusion, dietary supplementation using red seaweed inclusions can act as a potential prebiotic to improve performance, egg quality, and overall gut health in layer hens.
TI  - In vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  - Lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Recent studies have indicated that Streptococcus mutans, Clostridium perfringens, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. However, the previous studies mainly focused on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. This study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. The prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. The screening assays identified 35 species with the ability to utilize lactulose, of which Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. In addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found. Thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.
TI  - Infectious diseases in large-scale cat hoarding investigations.
AB  - Animal hoarders accumulate animals in over-crowded conditions without adequate nutrition, sanitation, and veterinary care. As a result, animals rescued from hoarding frequently have a variety of medical conditions including respiratory infections, gastrointestinal disease, parasitism, malnutrition, and other evidence of neglect. The purpose of this study was to characterize the infectious diseases carried by clinically affected cats and to determine the prevalence of retroviral infections among cats in large-scale cat hoarding investigations. Records were reviewed retrospectively from four large-scale seizures of cats from failed sanctuaries from November 2009 through March 2012. The number of cats seized in each case ranged from 387 to 697. Cats were screened for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in all four cases and for dermatophytosis in one case. A subset of cats exhibiting signs of upper respiratory disease or diarrhea had been tested for infections by PCR and fecal flotation for treatment planning. Mycoplasma felis (78%), calicivirus (78%), and Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (55%) were the most common respiratory infections. Feline enteric coronavirus (88%), Giardia (56%), Clostridium perfringens (49%), and Tritrichomonas foetus (39%) were most common in cats with diarrhea. The seroprevalence of FeLV and FIV were 8% and 8%, respectively. In the one case in which cats with lesions suspicious for dermatophytosis were cultured for Microsporum canis, 69/76 lesional cats were culture-positive; of these, half were believed to be truly infected and half were believed to be fomite carriers. Cats from large-scale hoarding cases had high risk for enteric and respiratory infections, retroviruses, and dermatophytosis. Case responders should be prepared for mass treatment of infectious diseases and should implement protocols to prevent transmission of feline or zoonotic infections during the emergency response and when transferring the rescued cats to other shelters or to adopters.
TI  - Bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics, a novel subgroup of lantibiotics featured by an indispensable disulfide bridge.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally-synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides with potent antimicrobial activities. Discovery of novel lantibiotics has been greatly accelerated with the soaring release of genomic information of microorganisms. As a unique class II lantibiotic, bovicin HJ50 is produced by Streptococcus bovis HJ50 and contains one rare disulfide bridge. By using its precursor BovA as a drive sequence, 16 BovA-like peptides were revealed in a wide variety of species. From them, three representative novel lan loci from Clostridium perfringens D str. JGS1721, Bacillus cereus As 1.348 and B. thuringiensis As 1.013 were identified by PCR screening. The corresponding mature lantibiotics designated perecin, cerecin and thuricin were obtained and structurally elucidated to be bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics especially by containing a conserved disulfide bridge. The disulfide bridge was substantiated to be essential for the function of bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics as its disruption eliminated their antimicrobial activities. Further analysis indicated that the disulfide bridge played a crucial role in maintaining the hydrophobicity of bovicin HJ50, which might facilitate it to exert antimicrobial function. This study unveiled a novel subgroup of disulfide-containing lantibiotics from bacteria of different niches and further demonstrated the indispensable role of disulfide bridge in these novel bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Autocatalytically generated Thr-Gln ester bond cross-links stabilize the repetitive Ig-domain shaft of a bacterial cell surface adhesin.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria are decorated by a variety of proteins that are anchored to the cell wall and project from it to mediate colonization, attachment to host cells, and pathogenesis. These proteins, and protein assemblies, such as pili, are typically long and thin yet must withstand high levels of mechanical stress and proteolytic attack. The recent discovery of intramolecular isopeptide bond cross-links, formed autocatalytically, in the pili from Streptococcus pyogenes has highlighted the role that such cross-links can play in stabilizing such structures. We have investigated a putative cell-surface adhesin from Clostridium perfringens comprising an N-terminal adhesin domain followed by 11 repeat domains. The crystal structure of a two-domain fragment shows that each domain has an IgG-like fold and contains an unprecedented ester bond joining Thr and Gln side chains. MS confirms the presence of these bonds. We show that the bonds form through an autocatalytic intramolecular reaction catalyzed by an adjacent His residue in a serine protease-like mechanism. Two buried acidic residues assist in the reaction. By mutagenesis, we show that loss of the ester bond reduces the thermal stability drastically and increases susceptibility to proteolysis. As in pilin domains, the bonds are placed at a strategic position joining the first and last strands, even though the Ig fold type differs. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that similar domains and ester bond cross-links are widespread in Gram-positive bacterial adhesins.
TI  - Horizontally transferred genetic elements and their role in pathogenesis of bacterial disease.
AB  - This article reviews the roles that laterally transferred genes (LTG) play in the virulence of bacterial pathogens. The features of LTG that allow them to be recognized in bacterial genomes are described, and the mechanisms by which LTG are transferred between and within bacteria are reviewed. Genes on plasmids, integrative and conjugative elements, prophages, and pathogenicity islands are highlighted. Virulence genes that are frequently laterally transferred include genes for bacterial adherence to host cells, type 3 secretion systems, toxins, iron acquisition, and antimicrobial resistance. The specific roles of LTG in pathogenesis are illustrated by specific reference to Escherichia coli, Salmonella, pyogenic streptococci, and Clostridium perfringens.
TI  - Structural studies of Streptococcus pyogenes streptolysin O provide insights into the early steps of membrane penetration.
AB  - Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are a large family of bacterial toxins that exhibit a dependence on the presence of membrane cholesterol in forming large pores in cell membranes. Significant changes in the three-dimensional structure of these toxins are necessary to convert the soluble monomeric protein into a membrane pore. We have determined the crystal structure of the archetypical member of the CDC family, streptolysin O (SLO), a virulence factor from Streptococcus pyogenes. The overall fold is similar to previously reported CDC structures, although the C-terminal domain is in a different orientation with respect to the rest of the molecule. Surprisingly, a signature stretch of CDC sequence called the undecapeptide motif, a key region involved in membrane recognition, adopts a very different structure in SLO to that of the well-characterized CDC perfringolysin O (PFO), although the sequences in this region are identical. An analysis reveals that, in PFO, there are complementary interactions between the motif and the rest of domain 4 that are lost in SLO. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the loss of a salt bridge in SLO and a cation-pi interaction are determining factors in the extended conformation of the motif, which in turn appears to result in a greater flexibility of the neighboring L1 loop that houses a cholesterol-sensing motif. These differences may explain the differing abilities of SLO and PFO to efficiently penetrate target cell membranes in the first step of toxin insertion into the membrane.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, Candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, and Clostridium perfringens. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the ITCs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a MBC of 1.25 mg/ml, against C. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against F. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. These results suggest that the ITCs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.
TI  - A waterborne outbreak and detection of cryptosporidium oocysts in drinking water  of an older high-rise apartment complex in seoul.
AB  - From May to June 2012, a waterborne outbreak of 124 cases of cryptosporidiosis occurred in the plumbing systems of an older high-rise apartment complex in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The residents of this apartment complex had symptoms of watery diarrhea and vomiting. Tap water samples in the apartment complex and its adjacent buildings were collected and tested for 57 parameters under the Korean Drinking Water Standards and for additional 11 microbiological parameters. The microbiological parameters included total colony counts, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus, fecal streptococcus, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia cysts, total culturable viruses, and Norovirus. While the tap water samples of the adjacent buildings complied with the Korean Drinking Water Standards for all parameters, fecal bacteria and Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in the tap water samples of the outbreak apartment complex. It turned out that the agent of the disease was Cryptosporidium parvum. The drinking water was polluted with sewage from a septic tank in the apartment complex. To remove C. parvum oocysts, we conducted physical processes of cleaning the water storage tanks, flushing the indoor pipes, and replacing old pipes with new ones. Finally we restored the clean drinking water to the apartment complex after identification of no oocysts.
TI  - Synthesis of 4-methylumbelliferyl alpha-d-mannopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-d-mannopyranoside and development of a coupled fluorescent assay for GH125 exo-alpha-1,6-mannosidases.
AB  - Certain bacterial pathogens possess a repertoire of carbohydrate processing enzymes that process host N-linked glycans and many of these enzymes are required for full virulence of harmful human pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pneumoniae. One bacterial carbohydrate processing enzyme that has been studied is the pneumococcal virulence factor SpGH125 from S. pneumoniae and its homologue, CpGH125, from C. perfringens. These exo-alpha-1,6-mannosidases from glycoside hydrolase family 125 show poor activity toward aryl alpha-mannopyranosides. To circumvent this problem, we describe a convenient synthesis of the fluorogenic disaccharide substrate 4-methylumbelliferone alpha-d-mannopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-d-mannopyranoside. We show this substrate can be used in a coupled fluorescent assay by using beta-mannosidases from either Cellulomonas fimi or Helix pomatia as the coupling enzyme. We find that this disaccharide substrate is processed much more efficiently than aryl alpha-mannopyranosides by CpGH125, most likely because inclusion of the second mannose residue makes this substrate more like the natural host glycan substrates of this enzyme, which enables it to bind better. Using this sensitive coupled assay, the detailed characterization of these metal-independent exo-alpha-mannosidases GH125 enzymes should be possible, as should screening chemical libraries for inhibitors of these virulence factors.
TI  - Determination of microbial quality and plasmid-mediated multidrug resistant bacteria in fountain drinking water sources in Turkey.
AB  - The bacterial contamination as the total aerobic bacteria, coliform and fecal coliform numbers were determined and analyzed for temperature, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen in seasonally collected water samples from fifteen different stations placed in Adana-Tufanbeyli road line during March 2008 - January 2009. In addition, antibiotic resistance profiles of isolates were examined against frequently used antibiotics, and analyzed plasmid DNAof multiple antibiotic resistant (MAR) isolates. Total aerobic bacteria in fountain water samples was determined as 3 x 10(3) CFU ml(-1) and total and fecal coliforms were determined 460 MPN/100 ml. Results obtained from biochemical analysis showed that 121 of the isolates were Proteus vulgaris, 69 Escherichia coli, 51 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 28 Citrobacter spp. According to these results, the existence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in stations 2 and 10, and Streptococcus faecalis in stations 11 and 15 respectively were confirmed. Clostridium perfringens was not detected in water samples. A total of 273 isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by agar disc diffusion methods. A total of sixteen antibiotics were used for determination of antibiotic resistance of isolates. Resistance to bacitracin, vancomycine, cephalothin and ampicillin was detected in 77, 77, 63 and 50%, respectively. Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) value > or = 0.25 was determined in 68.4% of identified 273 isolates and meaning of this percentage were resistant to four and more antibiotics. Plasmid DNA was isolated from 22 isolates with multiple antibiotic resistance index ranged from 0.3 to 0.6 taken randomly by agarose-gel electrophoresis, some of them contain a high-molecular weight plasmid DNA. Highlight of our study that the appearance of potential antibiotic resistances in fountain drinking water requires increased surveillance for risk assessment and prevention strategies to protect public health.
TI  - [Benign subcutaneous emphysema after nail penetration. Case report and important  differential diagnoses].
AB  - Crepitus under the skin after penetrating injuries: harmless benign subcutaneous  emphysema or life-threatening infection with gas-producing bacteria (gas gangrene because of Clostridium perfringens, crepitating cellulitis because of anaerobic Streptococcus or other coliforme bacteria)? We report a case of a 74-year-old male who developed massive crepitation of the left upper extremity and the lateral thoracic wall and mediastinal emphysema after sustaining a laceration of the left thumb and forefinger from a nail. Because there was the suspicion of gas gangrene we performed generous skin incisions of the ventral and dorsal part of the hand, the forearm and upper arm and open wound treatment. A triple antibiotic therapy was initiated. Due to fast regression of the subcutaneous emphysema and the mediastinal emphysema, continuing lack of symptoms, negative smear test results from the beginning and low infection parameters in the blood all wounds could be closed 9 days after primary surgery. The suspicion of gas gangrene was not confirmed so the diagnosis of benign subcutaneous emphysema was made.
TI  - Development and application of a multiplex PCR assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  - Infections with Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Riemerella anatipestifer, and Escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. It can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. Thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks. The aim of this study was to develop a multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single tube reaction. The target genes used were KMT1 of P. multocida, the invasion protein gene of S. enterica, 16S rDNA of R. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of E. coli. The detection limit of the assay for all bacterial DNA was 10 pg. The mPCR did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Mycoplasma gallinarum, Mycoplasma synoviae, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. We applied mPCR to field samples, and the results were the same as the single PCR results. These results suggest that mPCR for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.
TI  - Sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: AABB Standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) products for microbial contamination. To date, there is no automated blood culture system cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for this application. Our objective was to validate the VersaTREK system (TREK Diagnostic Systems) for sterility testing of apheresis HPC products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four aerobic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, and Bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (Fusobacterium necrophorum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella loescheii, and Propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (Candida albicans) were spiked into apheresis HPC products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. Aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. DNA was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. RESULTS: All aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (TTP) was significantly shorter with aerobic bottles. C. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. Anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. No bacteria were detected by using 16S rRNA gene amplification at 10(4) CFUs/mL. CONCLUSION: Compared to culture, 16S rRNA gene amplification of HPCs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for HPC sterility testing. The VersaTREK system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of apheresis HPC products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 CFUs/mL. Inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest TTP for all species tested.
TI  - Macedovicin, the second food-grade lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198.
AB  - Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was found to produce a second lantibiotic named macedovicin in addition to macedocin. Macedovicin was purified to homogeneity and mass spectrometric analysis identified a peptide of approximately 3.4 kDa. Partial N-terminal sequence analysis and tandem mass spectrometry revealed that macedovicin was identical to bovicin HJ50 and thermophilin 1277 produced by Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus thermophilus, respectively. Macedovicin inhibits a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria, several food spoilage species (e.g. Clostridium spp.) and oral streptococci. We determined the complete biosynthetic gene cluster of macedovicin. Even though the gene clusters of macedovicin, thermophilin 1277 and bovicin HJ50 were almost identical at the nucleotide level, there were important differences in their predicted genes and proteins. Bovicin HJ50-like lantibiotics were also found to be encoded by Streptococcus suis strains SC84 and D12, Enterococcus columbae PLCH2, Clostridium perfringens JGS1721 and several Bacillus strains. All these lantibiotics contained a number of conserved amino acids that may be important for their biosynthesis and activity, while phylogenetic analysis supported their dispersion by horizontal gene transfer. In conclusion, the production of multiple bacteriocins may enhance the bio-protective potential of S. macedonicus during food fermentation.
TI  - The cholesterol-dependent cytolysin signature motif: a critical element in the allosteric pathway that couples membrane binding to pore assembly.
AB  - The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) constitute a family of pore-forming toxins that contribute to the pathogenesis of a large number of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.The most highly conserved region in the primary structure of the CDCs is the signature undecapeptide sequence (ECTGLAWEWWR). The CDC pore forming mechanism is highly sensitive to changes in its structure, yet its contribution to the molecular mechanism of the CDCs has remained enigmatic. Using a combination of fluorescence spectroscopic methods we provide evidence that shows the undecapeptide motif of the archetype CDC, perfringolysin O (PFO), is a key structural element in the allosteric coupling of the cholesterol-mediated membrane binding in domain 4 (D4) to distal structural changes in domain 3 (D3) that are required for the formation of the oligomeric pore complex. Loss of the undecapeptide function prevents all measurable D3 structural transitions, the intermolecular interaction of membrane bound monomers and the assembly of the oligomeric pore complex. We further show that this pathway does not exist in intermedilysin (ILY), a CDC that exhibits a divergent undecapeptide and that has evolved to use human CD59 rather than cholesterol as its receptor. These studies show for the first time that the undecapeptide of the cholesterol-binding CDCs forms a critical element of the allosteric pathway that controls the assembly of the pore complex.
TI  - Identification and proteome analysis of the two-component VirR/VirS system in epidemic Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important zoonotic pathogen that infects pigs and sporadically causes serious infections in humans. Two recent large-scale outbreaks of human streptococcal toxic-shock-like syndrome with high mortality occurred in China, posing new challenges for global public health. However, the global regulation of the virulence of epidemic SS2 isolates lacks a systematic understanding. In this study, we performed a mutational and functional analysis of an SS2 two-component system that is orthologous to the VirR/VirS regulatory system of Clostridium perfringens. An isogenic knockout mutant of VirR/VirS (DeltavirRS) was found to exhibit marked phenotypic changes, including the formation of shorter chains and thinner capsular walls, more easily cleared in whole blood, and decreased oxidative stress tolerance. Furthermore, the DeltavirRS mutant was greatly attenuated in a mouse model. Comparative proteome analysis of the expression profiles of the wild-type strain with the DeltavirRS mutant allowed us to identify 72 proteins that are differentially expressed in the absence of the VirR/VirS system and that are directly responsible for the pleiotropic phenotype of the DeltavirRS mutant.
TI  - Bacteria and their toxins tamed for immunotherapy.
AB  - Bacterial toxins share the ability to enter host cells to target various intracellular proteins and to modulate host immune responses. Over the last 20 years, toxins and their mutated variants, as well as live attenuated bacteria, have been exploited for vaccination and immunotherapy of various infectious, malignant and autoimmune diseases. The ability of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin to translocate its adenylate cyclase domain across the host cell membrane, as well as the pathways of intracellular trafficking of Bacillus anthracis lethal and edema toxins, Shigella dysenteriae shiga toxin or Escherichia coli shiga-like toxin, have been repeatedly exploited for the delivery of antigenic epitopes into host cells and for stimulation of antigen-specific T cell responses. Similarly, E. coli alpha-hemolysin, or effector proteins of Yersinia and Salmonella secreted by the type III secretion systems, were used to facilitate the delivery of fused heterologous proteins or peptides for antigenic presentation. Vibrio cholerae cholera toxin, E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin, B. pertussis pertussis toxin or the Cry1A protein of Bacillus thuringiensis have shown a great potential to act as adjuvants and to stimulate mucosal as well as systemic immune responses. The immunotherapeutic potential of some toxins, like Clostridium perfringens perfringolysin O, Streptococcus intermedius intermedilysin, or Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin needs to be evaluated further. The Bordetella adenylate cyclase toxoid used as a vaccine delivery tool, or Corynebacterium diphtheriae diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A-based immunotoxins, are currently in various phases of clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy, as are some antigen-delivering Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes strains.
TI  - Identification and in vitro analysis of the GatD/MurT enzyme-complex catalyzing lipid II amidation in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The peptidoglycan of Staphylococcus aureus is characterized by a high degree of crosslinking and almost completely lacks free carboxyl groups, due to amidation of the D-glutamic acid in the stem peptide. Amidation of peptidoglycan has been proposed to play a decisive role in polymerization of cell wall building blocks, correlating with the crosslinking of neighboring peptidoglycan stem peptides. Mutants with a reduced degree of amidation are less viable and show increased susceptibility to methicillin. We identified the enzymes catalyzing the formation of D-glutamine in position 2 of the stem peptide. We provide biochemical evidence that the reaction is catalyzed by a glutamine amidotransferase-like protein and a Mur ligase homologue, encoded by SA1707 and SA1708, respectively. Both proteins, for which we propose the designation GatD and MurT, are required for amidation and appear to form a physically stable bi-enzyme complex. To investigate the reaction in vitro we purified recombinant GatD and MurT His-tag fusion proteins and their potential substrates, i.e. UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, as well as the membrane-bound cell wall precursors lipid I, lipid II and lipid II-Gly(5). In vitro amidation occurred with all bactoprenol-bound intermediates, suggesting that in vivo lipid II and/or lipid II-Gly(5) may be substrates for GatD/MurT. Inactivation of the GatD active site abolished lipid II amidation. Both, murT and gatD are organized in an operon and are essential genes of S. aureus. BLAST analysis revealed the presence of homologous transcriptional units in a number of gram-positive pathogens, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus pneumonia and Clostridium perfringens, all known to have a D-iso-glutamine containing PG. A less negatively charged PG reduces susceptibility towards defensins and may play a general role in innate immune signaling.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of LFF571 against Clostridium difficile and 630 other intestinal strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of LFF571, a novel analog of GE2270A that inhibits bacterial growth by binding with high affinity for protein synthesis elongation factor Tu, fidaxomicin, and 10 other antimicrobial agents were determined against 50 strains of Clostridium difficile and 630 other anaerobic and aerobic organisms of intestinal origin. LFF571 possesses potent activity against C. difficile and most other Gram-positive anaerobes (MIC(90), </= 0.25 mug/ml), with the exception of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. The MIC(90)s for aerobes, including enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus (as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, and other streptococci were 0.06, 0.125, 2, and 8 mug/ml, respectively. Comparatively, fidaxomicin showed variable activity against Gram-positive organisms: MIC(90)s against C. difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Bifidobacterium spp. were 0.5, </= 0.015, and 0.125 mug/ml, respectively, but >32 mug/ml against Clostridium ramosum and Clostridium innocuum. MIC(90) for S. pyogenes and other streptococci was 16 and >32 mug/ml, respectively. LFF571 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes.

TI  - Antimicrobial properties of a chitosan dextran-based hydrogel for surgical use.
AB  - A chitosan dextran-based (CD) hydrogel, developed for use in endoscopic sinus surgery, was tested for antimicrobial activity in vitro against a range of pathogenic microorganisms. The microdilution technique was used to determine minimum inhibitory, minimum bactericidal, and minimum fungicidal concentrations. In addition, the time-kill efficacy of CD hydrogel was determined for two bacterial species. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were carried out to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of this compound. CD hydrogel was found to be effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens at its surgical concentration of 50,000 mg/liter. Minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2,000 to 50,000 mg/liter. Dextran aldehyde (DA) was found to be the antimicrobial component of the CD hydrogel with MBC ranging from 2,000 to 32,000 mg/liter. S. aureus appeared to be killed at a slightly faster rate than E. coli. Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more resistant to CD hydrogel and DA. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of E. coli and S. aureus incubated with CD hydrogel and DA alone revealed morphological damage, disrupted cell walls, and loss of cytosolic contents, compatible with the proposed mode of action involving binding to cell wall proteins and disruption of peptide bonds. Motility and chemotaxis tests showed E. coli to be inhibited when incubated with DA. The antibacterial activity of CD hydrogel may make it a useful postsurgical aid at other body sites, especially where there is a risk of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Analysis of a new family of widely distributed metal-independent alpha-mannosidases provides unique insight into the processing of N-linked glycans.
AB  - The modification of N-glycans by alpha-mannosidases is a process that is relevant to a large number of biologically important processes, including infection by microbial pathogens and colonization by microbial symbionts. At present, the described mannosidases specific for alpha1,6-mannose linkages are very limited in number. Through structural and functional analysis of two sequence-related enzymes, one from Streptococcus pneumoniae (SpGH125) and one from Clostridium perfringens (CpGH125), a new glycoside hydrolase family, GH125, is identified and characterized. Analysis of SpGH125 and CpGH125 reveal them to have exo-alpha1,6-mannosidase activity consistent with specificity for N-linked glycans having their alpha1,3-mannose branches removed. The x-ray crystal structures of SpGH125 and CpGH125 obtained in apo-, inhibitor-bound, and substrate-bound forms provide both mechanistic and molecular insight into how these proteins, which adopt an (alpha/alpha)(6)-fold, recognize and hydrolyze the alpha1,6-mannosidic bond by an inverting, metal-independent catalytic mechanism. A phylogenetic analysis of GH125 proteins reveals this to be a relatively large and widespread family found frequently in bacterial pathogens, bacterial human gut symbionts, and a variety of fungi. Based on these studies we predict this family of enzymes will primarily comprise such exo-alpha1,6-mannosidases.
TI  - Analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented West African cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  - In this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in Nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. In particular, PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. DNA sequencing of the highly variable V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes obtained from PCR-DGGE fingerprints identified species related to Weissella confusa, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus amylolyticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Bacillus spp. and Lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. A more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16S rRNA gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the Lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the Streptococcaceae family. Interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. For example, L. plantarum, L. pantheris and L. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while W. confusa, Streptococcus lutetiensis and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. Phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.
TI  - Crystal structure of cytotoxin protein suilysin from Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDC) are pore forming toxins. A prototype of the CDC family members is perfringolysin O (PFO), which directly binds to the cell membrane enriched in cholesterol, causing cell lysis. However, an exception of this general observation is intermedilysin (ILY) of Streptococcus intermedius, which requires human CD59 as a receptor in addition to cholesterol for its hemolytic activity. A possible explanation of this functional difference is the conformational variation between the C-terminal domains of the two toxins, particularly in the highly conserved undecapeptide termed tryptophan rich motif. Here, we present the crystal structure of suilysin, a CDC toxin from the infectious swine pathogen Streptococcus suis. Like PFO, suilysin does not require a host receptor for hemolytic activity; yet the crystal structure of suilysin exhibits a similar conformation in the tryptophan rich motif to ILY. This observation suggests that the current view of the structure-function relationship between CDC proteins and membrane association is far from complete.
TI  - Effects of depletion of RNA-binding protein Tex on the expression of toxin genes  in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Tex was originally identified in Bordetella pertussis, where it serves as a transcriptional regulator of toxin genes. However, the Tex of Streptococcus pneumoniae has no regulatory function in the expression of the pneumococcal major toxin pneumolysin. Here, we identified the CPE2168 gene as Tex in Clostridium perfringens, and examined the roles of Tex in toxin gene expression. We found that the deletion mutant for Tex does not affect growth, but the mRNA levels of three hyaluronidase genes (nagH, nagJ, and nagL) and an exo-sialidase (nanJ) were reduced to less than 50% as compared to the parent strain, C. perfringens strain 13. On the other hand, Tex did not affect the expression of proteases, enterotoxins, hemolysins, either of two hyaluronidase genes (nagI and nagK), an exo-sialidase (nanI), or adhesins. Moreover, purified Tex bound to the 5'-portion of target gene mRNAs. Based on these results, we propose that Tex positively regulates the gene expression of a set of toxin genes in C. perfringens.
TI  - Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  - The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are part of a large family of pore-forming proteins that include the human proteins perforin and the complement membrane attack complex. The activity of all family members is focused on membranes, but the proteins are themselves involved in a diverse range of phenomena. An overview of some of these phenomena is provided here, along with an historical perspective of CDCs themselves and how our understanding of their mechanism of action has developed over the years. The way in which pore formation depends on specific characteristics of the membrane under attack as well as of the protein doing the attacking is emphasised. The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) have been the focus of a renewed keen research interest for over ten years now. Their importance has been even further enhanced by the homology now identified between them and the membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) family of proteins, which includes several components of the complement cascade as well as perforin itself. In this chapter I aim to provide an overview of our understanding of the interaction between CDCs and other members of what is now called the MACPF/CDC superfamily, with their target membranes. CDCs (also in the past known as thiol-activated toxins or cholesterol-binding toxins) were originally identified from four Gram-positive bacterial genera (Clostridium, Listeria, Bacillus and Streptococcus). Well-known examples include listeriolysin, perfringolysin, streptolysin and pneumoysin. Listeriolysin from L. monocytogenes is responsible for the escape of bacteria from the phagosome to colonise the cytoplasm and has been applied as a protein adjuvant in the development of vaccines against cancer and tuberculosis, for example. Perfringolysin from C. perfringens (Fig. 1A) has become perhaps the most studied CDC4 and has an important role in pathology associated with infection (gangrene). Streptolysin from S. pyogenes is another intensely studied CDC and has been applied widely in experimental permeabilisation of biological membranes. Pneumolysin is a major virulence determinant for S. pneumoniae, allowing bacterial invasion of tissues and mediating inflammation and the activation of the complement cascade. However, CDCs have now, for example, been identified in the bacteria Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Gardnerella vaginalis and there also appear to be homologues outside prokaryotes such as the sea anemone Metridium senile pore-forming toxin metridiolysin. The homology with the MACPF family was unknown until the first structures of the canonical fold of that family were solved, revealing the now characteristic MACPF/CDC fold of a twisted 3-sheet around which helices are clustered (Fig. 1A and D). Without any significant other sequence homology, the fold of this superfamily of pore-forming and membrane-binding proteins has been conserved by compensatory mutation around a handful of key conserved glycines. The glycines presumably act as critical hinges during the dramatic refolding that CDCs are known to undergo and which is presumably the selective advantage of this specific structure that has caused it to be conserved over such a vast evolutionary timescale. While not all MACPF domains are involved in pore formation-for example, C6 and C8beta--they are all apparently involved in action on membranes. The dramatic refolding undergone by CDCs is tightly coupled to their oligomerisation and results in the conversion of the helices hemming the core 3-sheet of the MACPF/CDC domain into a pair of beta-hairpins which in tandem and alongside those from other subunits within the oligomer insert into the membrane to create a pore (Fig. 1A-C). It is obviously the basic assumption that where nonCDC members of the superfamily-such as complement proteins and perforin-act on membranes they do so by a mechanism involving similar refolding.58 Even where a member of the MACPF/CDC superfamily is not known to form a pore, or has been shown not to-at least alone-the same conformational change could have other adaptive functions during activity on or at membranes. However, the bicomponent nature of some pore-forming toxins alerts us that showing an absence of activity for one pure protein does not mean that they do not contribute to pore formation quite directly, since that may require the presence of another MACPF/CDC family member or members from the same specific system. Complement acts by a combination of the C5b-8 complex of proteins preassembled on a target membrane recruiting C9 to form a lesion, which may be a complete ring of C9 associated with the C5b-8 or an arc-electron microscopy images show both possibilities.Perforin acts in concert with granzymes, to trigger apoptosis when delivered by cytotoxic cells at their targets (damaged, transformed and infected host cells). Incomplete rings are visible for perforin also and there are many unresolved issues concerning its mechanism and the dependence ofgranzymes on it for their delivery.
TI  - Clostridial dermatitis and cellulitis: an emerging disease of turkeys.
AB  - Clostridial dermatitis of turkeys (CDT) has emerged as a major issue across most  geographic regions of the United States. The prevalence and severity of dermatitis has increased over the last several years, since the time it was first reported in 1993. Cellulitis in poultry can be associated with Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli, but the more recent field situation in turkeys is specifically associated with Clostridium spp. The prevalence of cellulitis is relatively low; however, the disease can be devastating in the individual flocks affected. Clostridium septicum, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium sordelli, and S. aureus can cause cellulitis. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus spp., and other bacteria have occasionally been isolated from birds diagnosed with cellulitis. CDT appears as excessive mortality in older birds around 16-18 weeks of age. It has been reported from field experience as early as 7 wk of age. Clinical signs of CDT can range from sudden death to inappetence, depression, leg weakness, recumbency, and ataxia. The disease is characterized by reddish to dark or greenish discoloration of the skin around the thighs, abdomen, keel, tail region, back, and wings. The lesions can extend into the underlying muscles, and there can be gas bubbles under the skin which result in crepitation. Some cases present with dead birds having "bubbly tail," fluid-filled blisters associated with broken feather follicles around the base of the tail. Bubbly tail in breeder toms might not cause excessive mortality, but the lesions are so severe that the birds cannot be used for semen collection. Incidence of mortality from this condition can be severe and acute (i.e., rapid onset of high mortality). The dead birds decompose very quickly. Microscopically, there is necrosis, with or without inflammation of the skin, especially in the dermis and occasionally in the skeletal muscles, associated with large numbers of rod-shaped bacteria. Overcrowding, aggressive birds, poor-wet litter, decreased down time, a contaminated environment including feed and water, poor hygienic conditions, and contaminated vaccines and vaccine equipment, etc., can predispose birds for CDT. Preventative measures and treatment are discussed extensively in this review.
TI  - Standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, PVP-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics PVP-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. METHODS: MICs and MBCs were determined in accordance with DIN 58940-7 and 58940-8 using Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Haemophilus influenzae and Candida albicans. The microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with DIN EN 1040 and 1275 using S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. RESULTS: For chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, MIC(48) and MBC(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/L. Maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/L, with an efficacy gap against P. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of PVP-iodine were 1024 mg/L, with a gap against S. pneumoniae. Comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. After 1 min, only octenidine and PVP-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. CONCLUSIONS: Tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. When a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine > chlorhexidine > triclosan > PVP-iodine. This is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. Polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. If an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = PVP-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.

TI  - Types of infectious outbreaks and their impact in elderly care facilities: a review of the literature.
AB  - BACKGROUND: infectious outbreaks in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) tend to have a significant impact on infection rates and mortality rates of the residents. OBJECTIVES: this review aimed to update the information on pathogens identified in such outbreaks and to try to explore indicators that reflect the impact of outbreaks among residents and health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: MEDLINE (1966-2008) was used to identify outbreaks using the following thesaurus terms: 'Cross-Infection', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Urinary-Tract Infections' and 'Blood-Borne Pathogens'. Elderly care facilities were identified with the following thesaurus terms: 'Long-Term Care', 'Assisted-Living Facilities', 'Homes for the Aged' and 'Nursing Homes'. Age category was limited using 'Aged'. RESULTS: thirty-seven pathogens were associated with 206 outbreaks. The largest number of reported outbreaks by a single pathogen involved the influenza virus, followed by noroviruses. Among residents, the highest median attack rate for respiratory infection outbreaks was caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae (46%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (40%). In gastrointestinal tract infection outbreaks, high median attack rates were caused by Clostridium perfringens (48%) and noroviruses (45%). Outbreaks with high median case fatality rates were caused by Group A Streptococci (50%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (44%). High median attack rates for HCWs were caused by C. pneumoniae (41%), noroviruses (42%) and scabies (36%). CONCLUSION: a variety of infectious agents were identified as the cause of outbreaks in the elderly and HCWs in LTCFs. Attack rates and case fatality rates are useful indicators for setting priorities for education and prevention of the outbreaks.
TI  - Effect of apple intake on fecal microbiota and metabolites in humans.
AB  - The effects of apple intake on the fecal flora, water content, pH, and metabolic  activities in eight healthy volunteers and the utilization of apple pectin in vitro were investigated. Although several isolates of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, and the Bacteroides fragilis group utilized apple pectin, most isolates of Escherichia coli, Collinsela aerofaciense, Eubacterium limosum, and Clostridium perfringens could not. When fecal samples from healthy adults were incubated in liquid broth with apple pectin present or absent, the numbers of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the former were higher than those in the later. After the intake of apples (2 apples a day for 2 weeks) by eight healthy adult humans, the number of bifidobacteria in feces increased (p < 0.05 on day 7 and p < 0.01 on day 14 of the intake period), and the numbers of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus including Enterococcus tended to increase. However, lecithinase-positive clostridia, including C. perfringens, decreased (p < 0.05), and Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas tended to decrease. Moreover, the concentrations of fecal acetic acid tended to increase on apple intake. The fecal ammonia concentration showed a tendency to reduce and fecal sulfide decreased (p < 0.05) on apple intake. These findings indicate that apple consumption is related to an improved intestinal environment, and apple pectin is one of the effective apple components improving the fecal environment.
TI  - The cholesterol-dependent cytolysin family of gram-positive bacterial toxins.
AB  - The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are a family of beta-barrel pore-forming toxins secreted by Gram-positive bacteria. These toxins are produced as water-soluble monomeric proteins that after binding to the target cell oligomerize on the membrane surface forming a ring-like pre-pore complex, and finally insert a large beta-barrel into the membrane (about 250 A in diameter). Formation of such a large transmembrane structure requires multiple and coordinated conformational changes. The presence of cholesterol in the target membrane is absolutely required for pore-formation, and therefore it was long thought that cholesterol was the cellular receptor for these toxins. However, not all the CDCs require cholesterol for binding. Intermedilysin, secreted by Streptoccocus intermedius only binds to membranes containing a protein receptor, but forms pores only if the membrane contains sufficient cholesterol. In contrast, perfringolysin O, secreted by Clostridium perfringens, only binds to membranes containing substantial amounts of cholesterol. The mechanisms by which cholesterol regulates the cytolytic activity of the CDCs are not understood at the molecular level. The C-terminus of perfringolysin O is involved in cholesterol recognition, and changes in the conformation of the loops located at the distal tip of this domain affect the toxin-membrane interactions. At the same time, the distribution of cholesterol in the membrane can modulate toxin binding. Recent studies support the concept that there is a dynamic interplay between the cholesterol-binding domain of the CDCs and the excess of cholesterol molecules in the target membrane.
TI  - Noncollagenous region of the streptococcal collagen-like protein is a trimerization domain that supports refolding of adjacent homologous and heterologous collagenous domains.
AB  - Proper folding of the (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)(n) sequence of animal collagens requires adjacent N- or C-terminal noncollagenous trimerization domains which often contain coiled-coil or beta sheet structure. Collagen-like proteins have been found recently in a number of bacteria, but little is known about their folding mechanism. The Scl2 collagen-like protein from Streptococcus pyogenes has an N-terminal globular domain, designated V(sp), adjacent to its triple-helix domain. The V(sp) domain is required for proper refolding of the Scl2 protein in vitro. Here, recombinant V(sp) domain alone is shown to form trimers with a significant alpha-helix content and to have a thermal stability of T(m) = 45 degrees C. Examination of a new construct shows that the V(sp) domain facilitates efficient in vitro refolding only when it is located N-terminal to the triple-helix domain but not when C-terminal to the triple-helix domain. Fusion of the V(sp) domain N-terminal to a heterologous (Gly-Xaa-Yaa)(n) sequence from Clostridium perfringens led to correct folding and refolding of this triple-helix, which was unable to fold into a triple-helical, soluble protein on its own. These results suggest that placement of a functional trimerization module adjacent to a heterologous Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeating sequence can lead to proper folding in some cases but also shows specificity in the relative location of the trimerization and triple-helix domains. This information about their modular nature can be used in the production of novel types of bacterial collagen for biomaterial applications.
TI  - [Myonecrosis in users of injecting drugs (a clinical case)].
AB  - Myonecrosis remains one of the severest manifestations of skin and soft tissue infections. Clostridia (C. perfringens, C. novyi, C. septicum, C. sordellii, C. histolyticum) are dominant and Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Bacteriodes fragilis are much less in the etiology of myonecrosis. Cases of gas gangrene have recently become more frequent among injection drug users all over the world. Russia has become the largest opiate market in Europe and consumption of these narcotic drugs is annually growing. In the Russian Federation, a larger number of injection drug users uniquely results in a rise of cases of Clostridium- and mixed flora-induced myonecrosis. Gas gangrene in HIV-positive drug abusers seems to rapidly progress to multiple organ failure and to show high death rates, rather than to develop a localized form. The analyzed case of mixed flora-induced gas gangrene is of interest to physicians of any specialties who can encounter this wound infection in HIV-positive patients.
TI  - tISCpe8, an IS1595-family lincomycin resistance element located on a conjugative  plasmid in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a normal gastrointestinal organism that is a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes and can potentially act as a source from which mobile elements and their associated resistance determinants can be transferred to other bacterial pathogens. Lincomycin resistance in C. perfringens is common and is usually encoded by erm genes that confer macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance. In this study we identified strains that are lincomycin resistant but erythromycin sensitive and showed that the lincomycin resistance determinant was plasmid borne and could be transferred to other C. perfringens isolates by conjugation. The plasmid, pJIR2774, is the first conjugative C. perfringens R-plasmid to be identified that does not confer tetracycline resistance. Further analysis showed that resistance was encoded by the lnuP gene, which encoded a putative lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase and was located on tISCpe8, a functional transposable genetic element that was a member of the IS1595 family of transposon-like insertion sequences. This element had significant similarity to the mobilizable lincomycin resistance element tISSag10 from Streptococcus agalactiae. Like tISSag10, tISCpe8 carries a functional origin of transfer within the resistance gene, allowing the element to be mobilized by the conjugative transposon Tn916. The similarity of these elements and the finding that they both contain an oriT-like region support the hypothesis that conjugation may result in the movement of DNA modules that are not obviously mobile since they are not linked to conjugation or mobilization functions. This process likely plays a significant role in bacterial adaptation and evolution.
TI  - BSAC standardized disc susceptibility testing method (version 8).
AB  - There have been considerable changes to the format of the recommendations since the previous version (version 7). The majority of the footnotes to the tables have been removed and the notations added to the end column; it is hoped that this change will avoid confusion in interpretation. Antibiotics have been separated into groups, e.g. beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, etc. Recommendations for urinary tract infections (UTIs) have been removed for most agents except for those that are administered solely for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs or where there are limited recommendations for specific organisms, e.g. trimethoprim. For agents that previously had dual recommendations, systemic recommendations remain and the intermediate category can be used for interpretation for UTIs because intermediate susceptibility infers that the infection may respond as the agent is concentrated at the site of infection. This change will also avoid errors in interpretation when an organism is isolated from multiple sites, e.g. blood and urine. The changes that have been made to version 7 are as follows: MIC and zone diameter breakpoints (BPs) for trimethoprim, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin for UTIs (Table 7); MIC and zone diameter breakpoints (BPs) for doripenem (Tables 7-9); colistin MIC BPs for Pseudomonas spp. (Table 9), co-trimoxazole MIC BPs for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (Table 10); staphylococci MIC and zone diameter BPs for clarithromycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, trimethoprim UTI, nitrofurantoin UTI and rifampicin (Table 11); Streptococcus pneumoniae MIC and zone diameter BPs for azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, linezolid, rifampicin and telithromycin (Table 12); addition of streptomycin recommendations for enterococci (Table 13); enterococcal MIC and zone diameter BPs for quinupristin/dalfopristin, nitrofurantoin UTI and trimethoprim UTI (Table 13); beta-haemolytic streptococci MIC and zone diameter BPs for azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and telithromycin (Table 15); clarithromycin and erythromycin MIC and zone diameter BPs for Moraxella catarrhalis (Table 16); azithromycin MIC BPs for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Table 17); chloramphenicol and rifampicin MIC BPs for Neisseria meningitidis (Table 18); azithromycin MIC BPs for Haemophilus influenzae (Table 19); MIC BPs for metronidazole for Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Clostridium perfringens (Tables 23-25, respectively); susceptibility testing of Listeria spp. (Appendix 3); the acceptable range for ATCC 25923 to a 10 microg tobramycin disc (Table 26).
TI  - Assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide CECT7121 against human Gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistant Gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. This work investigated the efficacy of AP-CECT7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121) against various pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: Strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard antibiotic treatments. Inhibitory activity of AP-CECT7121 was assessed using the agar-well diffusion method. The most resistant isolates from each species screened (Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis,Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. RESULTS: These bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus and C. perfringens: viable counts for C. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. CONCLUSIONS: AP-CECT7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens liver abscess after pancreatic resection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver abscess is a rare complication after pancreatectomy. Clostridium perfingens is a rare cause of intrahepatic infections. CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer underwent explorative laparotomy, during which encasement of the hepatic artery by the tumor was found. Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy with capecitabine was started, which caused tumor regression, and duodenopancreatectomy was performed. The portal vein was occluded and infiltrated by cancer and therefore was resected and not reconstructed. After a slow recovery, the patient developed hemorrhage at the gastrojejunal anastomosis, which was controlled by fibrin injection. Within a few days, she presented with signs of sepsis, and blood cultures yielded Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus oralis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. The source of the sepsis proved to be a 9-cm liver abscess, which was drained; cultures grew C. perfringens, Hafnia alvei, and Enterobacter cloacae. Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient died from sepsis and multiorgan failure 27 days after pancreatic surgery. CONCLUSION: Such rare infections can follow pancreatic resection with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Clostridium perfringens-associated liver abscess maintains a high mortality rate.
TI  - Diversifying and stabilizing selection of sialidase and N-acetylneuraminate catabolism in Mycoplasma synoviae.
AB  - Sialidase activity varies widely among strains and tends to correlate with strain virulence in the avian pathogen Mycoplasma synoviae. To characterize the forms of selection acting on enzymes required for sialic acid scavenging and catabolism, the ratios of nonsynonymous (K(a)) to synonymous (K(s)) mutation frequency were calculated for codons in the sialidase gene of 16 strains of M. synoviae and for its nearly identical homolog in four strains of Mycoplasma gallisepticum. The K(a)/K(s) (omega) values for the linked genes required for nutritive N-acetylneuraminate catabolism (nanA, nagC, nanE, nagA, and nagB) from nine strains of M. synoviae were also determined. To provide context, omega was determined for all corresponding genes of 26 strains of Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bayesian models of sequence evolution showed that only the sialidase of M. synoviae was under significant (P < 0.001) diversifying selection, while the M. synoviae genes for N-acetylneuraminate catabolism and all genes examined from M. gallisepticum, C. perfringens, and S. pneumoniae were under neutral to stabilizing selection. Diversifying selection acting on the sialidase of M. synoviae, but not on the sialidase of M. gallisepticum or the sialidases or other enzymes essential for sialic acid scavenging in other Firmicutes, is evidence that variation in specific activity of the enzyme is perpetuated by a nonnutritive function in M. synoviae that is influenced by the genomic context of the organism.
TI  - Cellular functions and X-ray structure of anthrolysin O, a cholesterol-dependent  cytolysin secreted by Bacillus anthracis.
AB  - Anthrolysin O (ALO) is a pore-forming, cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) secreted by Bacillus anthracis, the etiologic agent for anthrax. Growing evidence suggests the involvement of ALO in anthrax pathogenesis. Here, we show that the apical application of ALO decreases the barrier function of human polarized epithelial cells as well as increases intracellular calcium and the internalization of the tight junction protein occludin. Using pharmacological agents, we also found that barrier function disruption requires increased intracellular calcium and protein degradation. We also report a crystal structure of the soluble state of ALO. Based on our analytical ultracentrifugation and light scattering studies, ALO exists as a monomer. Our ALO structure provides the molecular basis as to how ALO is locked in a monomeric state, in contrast to other CDCs that undergo antiparallel dimerization or higher order oligomerization in solution. ALO has four domains and is globally similar to perfringolysin O (PFO) and intermedilysin (ILY), yet the highly conserved undecapeptide region in domain 4 (D4) adopts a completely different conformation in all three CDCs. Consistent with the differences within D4 and at the D2-D4 interface, we found that ALO D4 plays a key role in affecting the barrier function of C2BBE cells, whereas PFO domain 4 cannot substitute for this role. Novel structural elements and unique cellular functions of ALO revealed by our studies provide new insight into the molecular basis for the diverse nature of the CDC family.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: A tertiary referral centre in Lagos, Nigeria. SUBJECTS: Twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. Eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral centre. INTERVENTION: Adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. RESULTS: Two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. Sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001). Infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, Streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, Staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (Porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, Peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, Prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, Clostridium perfringens 3.2%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. The anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. Over 92% of the streptococci were sensitive to the beta-Lactams contrast low susceptibility with S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.
TI  - Novel endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  - In an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-GalNAcases), four potential genes were cloned. Three of the expressed proteins EngEF from Enterococcus faecalis, EngPA from Propionibacterium acnes, and EngCP from Clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. Their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-GalNAcases from Streptococcus pneumoniae (EngSP) and Alcaligenes sp. (EngAL). All enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. The Core 1 disaccharide Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 1pNP was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. EngEF exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. EngEF and EngPA were also able to fully hydrolyze the Core 3 disaccharide GlcNAc beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 1pNP. This is the first report of endo-alpha-GalNAcases EngEF and EngPA acting on Core 3 in addition to Core 1 O-glycans. Interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when Gal beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 1pNP or GlcNAc beta 1,3GalNAc alpha 1pNP was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-GalNAcases tested in this work.
TI  - Efficiency of natural systems for removal of bacteria and pathogenic parasites from wastewater.
AB  - A combined constructed wetland formed by a facultative pond (FP), a surface flow  wetland (SF) and a subsurface flow wetland (SSF) was studied from December 2004 until September 2005 in north-western Spain in order to evaluate their efficiency in the removal of pathogenic and indicator microorganisms and to determine their relationships. Microbial removal ranged from 78% for coliphages to over 99% for helminth eggs, depending on the treatment system. The highest removal of indicator bacteria (total coliforms, E. coli, faecal streptococci and Clostridium perfringens) occurred in the stabilization pond, reaching 84%, 96%, 89% and 78%, respectively. However, the greatest removal of protozoan pathogens (Cryptosporidium and Giardia) and coliphages was found in the SSF wetland, 98%, 97% and 94%, respectively. In contrast, the SF wetland was most efficient in the removal of pathogenic parasites when considering superficial removal rates. Seasonal differences in organism removal were not statistically significant during the study period. First-order removal rate constants ranged from 0.0027 to 0.71 m/d depending on the microorganism and type of wetland. Significant correlations were found between pathogenic parasites and faecal indicators in the influent of the treatment system but not in the other sampling points suggesting that such relations varied along the system due to the different survival rates of the microorganisms.
TI  - Molecular analysis of yogurt containing Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus in human intestinal microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Yogurt has traditionally been considered a probiotic-carrier food with health-promoting effects. Despite the universal assumption of this assertion, several researchers have evaluated the real capability of the yogurt bacteria Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus to survive and proliferate in the human intestine and have found contradictory results. OBJECTIVE: This double-blind crossover study assessed the qualitative and quantitative effects of fresh and heat-treated yogurt on bacterial intestinal microbiota from healthy subjects. DESIGN: The subjects were divided into experimental (n=63) and control (n=16) groups. The experimental group consumed fresh and heat-treated yogurt for 15 d according to a crossover design with a washout period of 2 wk. Three different fecal samples per individual were recovered: at baseline, after fresh yogurt intake, and after heat-treated yogurt intake. Qualitative changes in microbiota were studied by denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE) with universal and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) 16S-rRNA primers. Quantitative changes in LAB, Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacteroides groups were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A particular DGGE stable band pattern was observed in each sample. No significant qualitative differences were detected in any fecal sample. However, a significantly higher density of LAB and C. perfringens and a significant decrease in the density of Bacteroides was observed after consumption of both types of yogurt. Microbiota density was not significantly different between the fresh and heat-treated yogurt groups, except for LAB, which was significantly greater in the fresh yogurt group. CONCLUSION: The main change in human microbiota observed after yogurt consumption was an increase in the density of LAB and C. perfringens to the detriment of Bacteroides. Bacterial changes were not different after the consumption of fresh and heat-treated yogurt.
TI  - Structural elements of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins that are responsible  for their cholesterol-sensitive membrane interactions.
AB  - The pore-forming mechanism of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) exhibits an absolute requirement for membrane cholesterol. The structural elements of the CDCs that mediate this interaction are not well understood. Three short hydrophobic loops (L1-L3) and a highly conserved undecapeptide sequence at the tip of domain 4 of the CDC structure are known to anchor the CDC to the membrane. It has been thought that the undecapeptide directly mediates the interaction of the CDCs with a cholesterol-rich cell surface. Herein we show that the L1-L3 loops, not the undecapeptide, are responsible for mediating the specific interaction of the CDCs with cholesterol-rich membranes. The membrane insertion of the undecapeptide was uncoupled from membrane binding by the covalent modification of the undecapeptide cysteine thiol. Modification of the cysteine prevented prepore to pore conversion, but did not affect membrane binding, thus demonstrating that undecapeptide membrane insertion follows that of the L1-L3 loops. These studies provide an example of a structural motif that specifically mediates the interaction of a bacterial toxin with a cholesterol-rich membrane.
TI  - Hormone therapy alters the composition of the vaginal microflora in ovariectomized rats.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the alterations that may take place  in the bacterial genital tract flora in the absence of ovarian hormones. The role of hormone replacement therapy was also assessed. For this purpose, various bacteria were identified from the vaginal flora of ovariectomized and sham operated female rats, following the Bergey's manual criteria. The data of this study showed that substantial differences exist in the vaginal bacterial microflora between ovariectomized and normal cyclic rats. Ovariectomy was associated with a lower total bacterial load that may be due mainly to the absence of Lactobacillus. Anaerobic bacteria were also absent. Streptococcus and Enterococcus were also not favored in an environment lacking the ovarian hormones. In contrast, C. perfringens, Bacteroides, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus were detected in high numbers in ovariectomized rats. In terms of the impact of hormone replacement therapy on vaginal flora, only estradiol (EE2) restored Lactobacillus levels in ovariectomized rats, whereas all hormonal schemes used brought Streptococcus, Clostridium lec (-), and C. perfringens, the spore and vegetative forms, close to those detected in normal cyclic female rats. In conclusion, ovarian hormones appeared to be regulatory factors that favor the presence of a broad variety of bacteria, which are members of the normal genital tract flora. On the other hand, ovariectomy modifies the vaginal microbial profile, and hormone replacement therapy based mainly on schemes containing EE2 could alleviate this disturbance.
TI  - Effect of different dietary methionine sources on intestinal microbial populations in broiler chickens.
AB  - Two experiments were conducted to study the effect of various levels of DL-Met or 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid (MHA-FA) on Clostridium perfringens and other intestinal bacteria in broiler chickens. In each experiment, 2 cages of 6 birds (14 d posthatch) were assigned to 1 of 7 different diets in a 2 x 4 factorial arrangement. The main effects were Met source (either DL-Met or MHA-FA) and Met level (0, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8% dl-Met or 0, 0.227, 0.454, and 0.908% MHA-FA, thus providing 4 corresponding equimolar levels of each Met source). All birds were orally gavaged with a C. perfringens type A broth culture on d 1 and on d 14 to 20 and killed on d 28. Intestinal populations of C. perfringens, lactobacilli, Streptococcus group D, and coliforms were enumerated in the ileum and cecum, and necrotic enteritis intestinal lesions were scored. There was a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in C. perfringens populations in birds fed either Met source in the cecum (experiment 1) or the ileum and cecum (experiment 2). In experiment 2, the lactobacillus populations were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the ceca of birds receiving 0.8% Met than in the birds given diets with the other levels of Met tested. Significantly lower populations (P < 0.05) of coliforms and Streptococcus group D were enumerated in the ileum of birds fed the 0.8% Met-supplemented diet than in the other dietary treatments. The effect of Met source on intestinal bacteria was not significant, suggesting that both DL-Met and MHA-FA have similar antibacterial properties. Last, there were no significant differences in intestinal lesion scores or the performance of birds fed different Met sources and concentrations. The results suggest that both DL-Met and MHA-FA may reduce intestinal populations of C. perfringens in broiler chickens when used in relatively high concentrations, and may reduce the risk of necrotic enteritis. Thus, feeding low-protein diets supplemented with crystalline amino acids might be beneficial in terms of the growth of various enteric pathogens.
TI  - Preliminary study on the efficacy and safety of eight individual and blended disinfectants against poultry and dairy indicator organisms.
AB  - Eight individual and blended chemical disinfectants were screened for preliminary evaluation of safety, bactericidal and virucidal effectiveness against poultry and dairy organisms. The test organisms were Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp. and Clostridium perfringens, in addition to avian influenza virus (AIV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Viable counts of surviving bacteria were determined after 30 min contact with each disinfectant and in the presence or absence of skimmed milk, to simulate the interference of organic matter. The haemagglutination test was used to assess the survival of the test viruses in the presence of the different disinfectants after propagation in 10-day-old chick embryos. In the presence of skimmed milk, a higher concentration of most of the disinfectants examined was required to exert antimicrobial effectiveness. When used individually, quaternary ammonium showed no virucidal activity against NDV and AIV; peracetic acid was not effective against Streptococcus spp., S. Enteritidis and NDV, while iodophors showed low bactericidal and inconsistent virucidal activity. The single and blended disinfectants with high microbicidal activities included phenols (high bactericidal and virucidal activity), blends of quaternary ammonium compounds (high bactericidal activity) and blends of cresols and organic acids (high virucidal activity). This suggests the use of blends of compatible compounds for disinfection operations in poultry and dairy industries since they will target a wider range of micro-organisms. None of the disinfectants had a negative effect on the development of the different organs of chicken embryos and the iodine-based disinfectant, developed for dairy-teat dipping, also showed no adverse reactions in experimental cows.
TI  - Clinical mastitis in ewes; bacteriology, epidemiology and clinical features.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical mastitis is an important disease in sheep. The objective of  this work was to identify causal bacteria and study certain epidemiological and clinical features of clinical mastitis in ewes kept for meat and wool production. METHODS: The study included 509 ewes with clinical mastitis from 353 flocks located in 14 of the 19 counties in Norway. Clinical examination and collection of udder secretions were carried out by veterinarians. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on 92 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from 64 ewes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: S. aureus was recovered from 65.3% of 547 clinically affected mammary glands, coagulase-negative staphylococci from 2.9%, enterobacteria, mainly Escherichia coli, from 7.3%, Streptococcus spp. from 4.6%, Mannheimia haemolytica from 1.8% and various other bacteria from 4.9%, while no bacteria were cultured from 13.2% of the samples. Forty percent of the ewes with unilateral clinical S. aureus mastitis also had a subclinical S. aureus infection in the other mammary gland. Twenty-four of 28 (86%) pairs of S. aureus isolates obtained from clinically and subclinically affected mammary glands of the same ewe were indistinguishable by PFGE. The number of identical pairs was significantly greater than expected, based on the distribution of different S. aureus types within the flocks. One-third of the cases occurred during the first week after lambing, while a second peak was observed in the third week of lactation. Gangrene was present in 8.8% of the clinically affected glands; S. aureus was recovered from 72.9%, Clostridium perfringens from 6.3% and E. coli from 6.3% of the secretions from such glands. This study shows that S. aureus predominates as a cause of clinical ovine mastitis in Norway, also in very severe cases. Results also indicate that S. aureus is frequently spread between udder halves of infected ewes.
TI  - Histone modifications induced by a family of bacterial toxins.
AB  - Upon infection, pathogens reprogram host gene expression. In eukaryotic cells, genetic reprogramming is induced by the concerted activation/repression of transcription factors and various histone modifications that control DNA accessibility in chromatin. We report here that the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes induces a dramatic dephosphorylation of histone H3 as well as a deacetylation of histone H4 during early phases of infection. This effect is mediated by the major listerial toxin listeriolysin O in a pore-forming-independent manner. Strikingly, a similar effect also is observed with other toxins of the same family, such as Clostridium perfringens perfringolysin and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin. The decreased levels of histone modifications correlate with a reduced transcriptional activity of a subset of host genes, including key immunity genes. Thus, control of epigenetic regulation emerges here as an unsuspected function shared by several bacterial toxins, highlighting a common strategy used by intracellular and extracellular pathogens to modulate the host response early during infection.
TI  - Prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (PLT) components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one double-dose PLTs were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL). After split, each PLT unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 CFUs. One unit was photochemically treated (PCT; 150 micromol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A). The other unit was untreated. All units were stored and sampled on Days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux). PLTs were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. RESULTS: In all PCT PLTs, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. In untreated PLTs, Staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. Growth of 1 to 10 CFUs per unit Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 CFUs per unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 to 1000 CFUs per unit Propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. Low levels of Streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 CFUs/unit), Escherichia coli (1-100 CFUs/unit), and Clostridium perfringens (1-100 CFUs/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: For the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated PLTs may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. In contrast, bacterial inactivation by PCT could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of PLTs contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.
TI  - Conformational changes that effect oligomerization and initiate pore formation are triggered throughout perfringolysin O upon binding to cholesterol.
AB  - Pore formation by the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) requires the presence of cholesterol in the target membrane. Cholesterol was long thought to be the cellular receptor for these toxins, but not all CDCs require cholesterol for binding. Intermedilysin, secreted by Streptococcus intermedius, only binds to membranes containing the human protein CD59 but forms pores only if the membrane contains sufficient cholesterol. In contrast, perfringolysin O (PFO), secreted by Clostridium perfringens, only binds to membranes containing substantial amounts of cholesterol. Given that different steps in the assembly of various CDC pores require cholesterol, here we have analyzed to what extent cholesterol molecules, by themselves, can modulate the conformational changes associated with PFO oligomerization and pore formation. PFO binds to cholesterol when dispersed in aqueous solution, and this binding triggers the distant rearrangement of a beta-strand that exposes an oligomerization interface. Moreover, upon binding to cholesterol, PFO forms a prepore complex, unfolds two amphipathic transmembrane beta-hairpins, and positions their nonpolar surfaces so they associate with the hydrophobic cholesterol surface. The interaction of PFO with cholesterol is therefore sufficient to initiate an irreversible sequence of coupled conformational changes that extend throughout the toxin molecule.
TI  - Infection in a leukemia patient.
AB  
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of the immersion chilling procedure during poultry processing.
AB  - The development of treatments to reduce bacterial numbers on poultry carcasses is important for the overall hygienic quality of birds. The important washing effect of the immersion chilling procedure is discussed. Systematic monitoring of fecal bacterial indicators as well as some classic pathogens was performed at selected critical points in a water chiller ecosystem. Clostridium perfringens, fecal coliforms, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus sp. were found in all water chiller samples. The temperature of the chiller ecosystem varied according to location: Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp. were found at 16 degrees C, compared with the 4 degrees C location, where these species were found in lower numbers. Moreover, the psychrotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas was found only at this last location. The temperature of the water during the immersion chilling procedure was unfavorable for the growth of Campylobacter sp., whose presence was always strictly associated with a pH close to 6. Spore forms of C. perfringens were persistent in all locations and seemed to be a reliable indicator of contamination of the water chiller ecosystem.
TI  - Mortality in Pennsylvania captive elk (Cervus elaphus): 1998-2006.
AB  - The necropsy records of 65 elk ranging from 1 day to 13(1/2) years of age were reviewed to determine the primary cause of death of each animal. The animal carcasses were submitted from 22 separate Pennsylvania elk farms over an approximately 8-year period. The most common causes of mortality in animals in which the cause of death was determined were gastrointestinal parasitism (21 cases), pneumonia (7 cases), enterocolitis (5 cases), malnutrition (5 cases), and rumenitis/acidosis (5 cases). The cause of death was undetermined in 4 of the 65 elk. Nematode organisms (20 cases) were the primary parasites identified in cases of mortality owing to gastrointestinal parasitism. Arcanobacterium pyogenes (3 cases), Escherichia coli (3 cases), and Streptococcus sp. (2 cases) were the most commonly isolated bacteria from the lung in the cases of pneumonia. Fungal organisms, consistent with Aspergillus sp. were present histologically within the pulmonary lesions in 5 cases. Bacterial agents associated with enterocolitis included Clostridium perfringens (2 cases), E. coli (1 case), Salmonella Newport (1 case) and Salmonella Thompson (1 case). The majority (56.3%) of the death loss in elk of known ages occurred in animals 1 year of age or less, with 71.4% of the gastrointestinal parasitism, 60.0% of the malnutrition, 60.0% of the enterocolitis, and 57.1% of the pneumonia cases occurring in animals within this age range. In conclusion, gastrointestinal parasitism, pneumonia, malnutrition, enterocolitis and rumenitis/acidosis were considered the most common causes of death in captive elk in this study.
TI  - Aortoduodenal fistula 5 years after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with the Ancure stent graft.
AB  - We report a case of aortoduodenal fistula 5 years after uncomplicated endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The diagnosis was confirmed by abdominal computed tomography scan and esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The patient was successfully treated with primary duodenal repair, removal of the infected graft, in situ placement of a bifurcated graft, and omental interposition. Review of the literature identifies this as one of very few documented aortoduodenal fistulas after endovascular aneurysm repair. Fistulization occurred despite accurate stent graft placement without migration, endoleak, or aortic sac size enlargement on annual postoperative imaging studies.
TI  - Identification of glucose-fermenting bacteria present in an in vitro model of the human intestine by RNA-stable isotope probing.
AB  - 16S rRNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)  spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling were used to identify bacteria fermenting glucose under conditions simulating the human intestine. The TIM-2 in vitro model of the human intestine was inoculated with a GI tract microbiota resembling that of the small intestine, to which subsequently 4, 20 or 40 mM of [U-(13)C]-glucose were added. RNA was extracted from lumen samples after 0 (control), 1, 2 and 4 h and subjected to density-gradient ultracentrifugation. Phylogenetic analysis of unlabeled 16S rRNA revealed a microbial community dominated by lactic acid bacteria and Clostridium perfringens. Distinct (13)C-incorporation into bacterial RNA was only observed for the 40-mM addition. 16S rRNA fingerprinting showed an activity drop of Lactobacillus fermentum after glucose addition, while Streptococcus bovis and C. perfringens were identified as the most active glucose-fermenters. Accordingly, NMR analysis identified lactate, acetate, butyrate and formate as the principal fermentation products, constituting up to 91% of the (13)C-carbon balance. RNA-SIP combined with metabolic profiling allowed us to detect differential utilization of a general model carbohydrate, indicating that this approach holds great potential to identify bacteria involved in the fermentation of dietary relevant oligo- and polymeric carbohydrates in the human intestine.
TI  - Heterologous production and secretion of Clostridium perfringens beta-toxoid in closely related Gram-positive hosts.
AB  - The spore forming bacterium Clostridium perfringens is a widely occurring pathogen. Vaccines against C. perfringens type B and C are currently manufactured using beta-toxin secreted by virulent C. perfringens strains. Large-scale production of vaccines from virulent strains requires stringent safety conditions and costly detoxification and control steps. Therefore, it would be beneficial to produce this toxin in a safe production host and in an immunogenic, but non-toxic form (toxoid). For high-level expression of beta-toxoid, we cloned the highly active ribosomal rpsF promoter of Bacillus subtilis in a broad host range multicopy plasmid. In B. subtilis, we obtained high intracellular production, up to 200 microg ml(-1) culture. However, the beta-toxoid was poorly secreted. The employed rpsF expression system allowed using the same expression plasmids in other heterologous hosts such as Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In these organisms secretion of beta-toxoid was ten times higher compared to the best producing B. subtilis strain. These results show the usefulness of the rpsF based broad host range expression system.
TI  - Characterization of a carbohydrate epitope defined by the monoclonal antibody H185: sialic acid O-acetylation on epithelial cell-surface mucins.
AB  - Sialic acids comprise a large family of derivatives of neuraminic acid containing methyl, acetyl, sulfate, and phosphate among other groups, which confer specific physicochemical properties (e.g., hydrophobicity and resistance to hydrolases) to the molecules carrying them. Several years ago, a monoclonal antibody, designated H185, was developed, which binds to cell membranes of human corneal, conjunctival, laryngeal, and vaginal epithelia and whose distribution is altered on the ocular surface of patients with keratinizing disease. Recent findings using immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion techniques have demonstrated that, in human corneal epithelial cells, the H185 antigen is carried by the membrane-associated mucin MUC16. In this study, we show that the H185 epitope on human corneal cells and in tear fluid is an O-acetylated sialic acid epitope that can be selectively hydrolyzed in an enzyme-concentration-dependent manner by sialidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens and to a lesser extent by sialidases from Newcastle disease virus, Clostridium perfringens, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Binding of the H185 antibody was impaired by treatment of tear fluid with a recombinant 9-O-acetylesterase from influenza C virus. Two O-acetyl derivatives, Neu5,7Ac(2) and Neu5,9Ac(2), were identified in human tear fluid by fluorometric high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray mass spectrometry (MS). Immunoprecipitation of the H185 epitope from human corneal epithelial cells revealed that Neu5,9Ac(2) was the major derivative on the mucin isolate. These results indicate that exposed wet-surfaced epithelia are decorated with O-acetyl sialic acid derivatives on membrane-associated mucins and suggest that O-acetylation on cell surfaces may protect against pathogen infection by preventing degradation of membrane-associated mucins.
TI  - An in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. The agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. In this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic Gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. The time-kill experiment was performed using Anaerobe Broth medium. The drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/L for linezolid, 2mg/L for clindamycin, and 8mg/L for metronidazole. Samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the Bioscience International Autospiral DW. Exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. Plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees C). The species tested included Bacteroides fragilis (2), B. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. varium, Prevotella melaninogenica, Clostridium perfringens, Eubacterium lentum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). The activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. As expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. Metronidazole yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three strains. Linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. The profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.
TI  - Isolation and identification of mixed linked beta -glucan degrading bacteria in the intestine of broiler chickens and partial characterization of respective 1,3-1,4-beta -glucanase activities.
AB  - Media with 1,3-1,4-beta -glucans as selective markers were used for isolation of  non-starch-polysaccharide (NSP) degrading bacteria from the intestinal tract of broiler chicken. Formerly unknown 1,3-1,4-beta endoglucanase activities in various bacterial species were identified in this study. E. faecium , Streptococcus , Bacteroides and Clostridium strains seem to be responsible for degradation of mixed linked beta -glucans in the small intestine and in the hind gut of chickens. Strict anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides ovatus , B. uniformis , presumably B. capillosus and Clostridium perfringens ) as well as an unidentified bacterium with 98% 16S rDNA homology to an uncultered chicken cecum bacterium were isolated. Additionally, Streptococcus bovis with 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity was also detected. Different 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity profiles were observed in SDS/PAGE zymograms.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of BacT/ALERT 3D and BACTEC systems for the recovery of pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare BacT/ALERT (BTA) and BACTEC 9240 (BAC), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented BTA and BAC standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. The time to growth detection (TD) was recorded for each bottle that became positive. A quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess TD of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. RESULTS: A total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both BTA and BAC bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by BTA bottles and 13 (56.5%) by BAC. Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the BTA system. The average TDs were 19.0 and 24.6 h for BTA and BAC, respectively. Analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa but slightly different for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The anaerobic bottle ofthe BTA did not support the growth of H. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) CFU/ml whereas the BAC did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) CFU/ml. TD for S. pneumoniae in the BTA was about half of that in the BAC. CONCLUSIONS: The BTA system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the BAC system to detect the same organism.
TI  - Identification and molecular cloning of a novel glycoside hydrolase family of core 1 type O-glycan-specific endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from Bifidobacterium longum.
AB  - We found endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase in most bifidobacterial strains, which are predominant bacteria in the human colon. This enzyme catalyzes the liberation of galactosyl beta1,3-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (Galbeta1,3GalNAc) alpha-linked to serine or threonine residues from mucin-type glycoproteins. The gene (engBF) encoding the enzyme has been cloned from Bifidobacterium longum JCM 1217. The protein consisted of 1,966 amino acid residues, and the central domain (590-1381 amino acid residues) exhibited 31-53% identity to hypothetical proteins of several bacteria including Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli liberated Galbeta1,3GalNAc disaccharide from Galbeta1,3GalNAcalpha1pNP and asialofetuin, but did not release GalNAc, Galbeta1,3(GlcNAcbeta1,6)GalNAc, GlcNAcbeta1,3GalNAc, and Galbeta1,3GlcNAc from each p-nitrophenyl (pNP) substrate, and also did not release sialo-oligosaccharides from fetuin, indicating its strict substrate specificity for the Core 1-type structure. The stereochemical course of hydrolysis was determined by (1)H NMR and was found to be retention. Site-directed mutagenesis of a total of 22 conserved Asp and Glu residues suggested that Asp-682 and Asp-789 are critical residues for the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The enzyme also exhibited transglycosylation activity toward various mono- and disaccharides and 1-alkanols, demonstrating its potential to synthesize neoglycoconjugates. This is the first report for the isolation of a gene encoding endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase from any organisms and for the establishment of a new glycoside hydrolase family (GH family 101).
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium perfringens by a novel strain of Bacillus subtilis isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to isolate beneficial strains of microorganisms from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens and to screen them against Clostridium perfringens, a causative agent of necrotic enteritis in poultry. One of the bacteria isolated, a strain of Bacillus subtilis, was found to possess an anticlostridial factor that could inhibit the C. perfringens ATCC 13124 used in this study. The anticlostridial factor produced by B. subtilis PB6 was found to be fully or partially inactivated in the presence of pronase, trypsin, and pepsin. In contrast, the antimicrobial activity of the anticlostridial factor was not affected by treatment at 100 or 121 degrees C or by treatment with any of the organic solvents used in the study. The optimum growth temperature and optimum pH for production of the anticlostridial factor were 37 degrees C and 6.20, respectively. Using the mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy technique, the apparent molecular mass of the anticlostridial factor was estimated to be in the range from 960 to 983 Da. In terms of the antimicrobial spectrum, the anticlostridial factor was inhibitory toward various strains of C. perfringens implicated in necrotic enteritis in poultry, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli.
TI  - Identification of the gene encoding a 38-kilodalton immunogenic and protective antigen of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - In our continued effort to search for a Streptococcus suis protein(s) that can serve as a vaccine candidate or a diagnostic reagent, we constructed and screened a gene library with a polyclonal antibody raised against the whole-cell protein of S. suis type 2. A clone that reacted with the antibody was identified and characterized. Analysis revealed that the gene encoding the protein is localized within a 2.0-kbp EcoRI DNA fragment. The nucleotide sequence contained an open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide of 445 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 46.4 kDa. By in vitro protein synthesis and Western blot experiments, the protein exhibited an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 38 kDa. At the amino acid level the deduced primary sequence shared homology with sequences of unknown function from Streptococcus pneumoniae (89%), Streptococcus mutans (86%), Lactococcus lactis (80%), Listeria monocytogenes (74%), and Clostridium perfringens (64%). Except for strains of serotypes 20, 26, 32, and 33, Southern hybridization analysis revealed the presence of the gene in strains of other S. suis serotypes and demonstrated restriction fragment length differences caused by a point mutation in the EcoRI recognition sequence. We confirmed expression of the 38-kDa protein in the hybridization-positive isolates using specific antiserum against the purified protein. The recombinant protein was reactive with serum from pigs experimentally infected with virulent strains of S. suis type 2, suggesting that the protein is immunogenic and may serve as an antigen of diagnostic importance for the detection of most S. suis infections. Pigs immunized with the recombinant 38-kDa protein mounted antibody responses to the protein and were completely protected against challenge with a strain of a homologous serotype, the wild-type virulent strain of S. suis type 2, suggesting that it may be a good candidate for the development of a vaccine that can be used as protection against S. suis infection. Analysis of the cellular fractions of the bacterium by Western blotting revealed that the protein was present in the surface and cell wall extracts. The functional role of the protein with respect to pathogenesis and whether antibodies against the antigen confer protective immunity against diseases caused by strains of other pathogenic S. suis capsular types remains to be determined.
TI  - Structural analysis of human specific cytolysin intermedilysin aiming application to cancer immunotherapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermedilysin (ILY) is a human specific cytolysin secreted by Streptococcus intermedius. In the present study, we performed molecular modeling of ILY and cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) (pneumolysin, PLY; listeriolysin O, LLO; streptolysin O, SLO; alveolysin, ALV; suilysin, SLY; pyolysin, PLO) to compare the membrane binding domains including the undecapeptide (11mer) region which is thought to be necessary for the cytolytic activity of CDCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The molecular models of cytolysins were constructed using InsightII with Homology module with X-ray data of perfringolysin O (PFO). RESULTS: The ILY molecule was long and rod shaped, and comprised four domains. ILY was shown to possess stereocomplementary surfaces within the molecule and the potential to stack with 8 degrees of curvature leading to a ring cluster of 45 molecules or so in the human erythrocyte cell membranes. CONCLUSION: From the molecular orbital calculations and isostatic potential analysis, we considered that the ILY 11mer region has different features from those of traditional CDCs, and the ILY domain 4 should be very useful to apply the human cell-specific targeting module.
TI  - Waterfowl and the bacteriological quality of amenity ponds.
AB  - This study investigated the impact of waterfowl on the bacteriological quality of village ponds in East Yorkshire, north-east England. Water and sediment samples were collected from ponds with and without resident ducks and geese; faecal indicator and potentially pathogenic bacteria were assayed by membrane filtration and by selective enrichment. Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and, to a degree, Clostridium perfringens were more abundant in ponds with waterfowl; Salmonella was isolated in June-August from the sediment of a pond with waterfowl. The results suggested that the bacteriological quality of village ponds might be adversely affected by waterfowl. All water samples from ponds with waterfowl had faecal indicators at higher concentrations than EU requirements for bathing waters. Although these ponds are not bathing waters we suggest skin contact and accidental ingestion of water should be avoided.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Cot mattresses as reservoirs of potentially harmful bacteria and the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Cot mattress materials were investigated as potential reservoirs of bacteria in relation to the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The sleeping position of the infant significantly influenced bacterial population density of cot mattress polyurethane foams (p<0.0000001) and their covers (p<0.004). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated at significantly higher frequency (p<0.03) from the infant's head region of cot mattress materials. Significantly higher bacterial population densities (p<0.001) were associated with polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses (exposed polyurethane foam), when compared to those from mattresses completely covered by polyvinyl chloride (integral type mattress). The frequency of isolation of S. aureus from polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses was also significantly higher (p=0.03) than from foams from the integral type. The following factors were significantly associated with increased frequency of isolation of S. aureus: from the polyurethane foam, previous use of non-integral mattresses by another child (p=0.03 for all sample sites, p=0.01 for torso region); from the covers, sleeping in the prone position (p=0.003 head region, p=0.001 torso region). Prone sleeping was also significantly associated with increased bacterial population levels (p=0.01) and increased frequency of isolation of Escherichia coli (p=0.02) from the torso region of cot mattress covers. These findings could explain some recently identified risk factors for SIDS associated with type and previous use of cot mattresses. Clostridium perfringens was isolated at very low frequency and Streptococcus pyogenes was not isolated from any cot mattress materials tested.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - The solution structure and oligomerization behavior of two bacterial toxins: pneumolysin and perfringolysin O.
AB  - Pneumolysin (PLY), an important protein virulence factor of the human bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, could be a candidate for inclusion in a new anti-streptococcal vaccine. PLY solution species from monomer via multimeric intermediates to ring-shaped oligomers were studied with time-dependent sedimentation velocity in the analytical ultracentrifuge (AUC). Hydrodynamic bead modeling was used to interpret the data obtained. PLY remained mostly monomeric in solution; intermediate PLY multimers were detected in small quantities. Current understanding of PLY molecular mechanism is guided by a model built on the basis of its homology with perfringolysin O (PFO) for which there is an atomic structure. PFO, a virulence factor of the organism Clostridium perfringens, has almost the same molecular mass as PLY and shares 48% sequence identity and 60% sequence similarity with PLY. We report a comparative low-resolution structural study of PLY and PFO using AUC and small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). AUC data demonstrate that both proteins in solution are mostly monodisperse but PLY is a monomer whereas PFO is mostly dimeric. Ab initio dummy atom and dummy residue models for PFO and PLY were restored from the distance distribution function derived from experimental small-angle x-ray scattering curves. In solution, PLY is elongated, consistent with the shape predicted by its high-resolution homology model. The PFO dimer is also an elongated particle whose shape and volume are consistent with a staggered antiparallel dimer.
TI  - Specificity of streptolysin O in cytolysin-mediated translocation.
AB  - Cytolysin-mediated translocation (CMT) is a recently described process in the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes that translocates an effector protein of streptococcal origin into the cytoplasm of a host cell. At least two proteins participate in CMT, the pore-forming molecule streptolysin O (SLO) and an effector protein with the characteristics of a signal transduction protein, the Streptococcus pyogenes NAD-glycohydrolase (SPN). In order to begin to elucidate the molecular details of the translocation process, we examined whether perfringolysin O (PFO), a pore-forming protein related to SLO, could substitute for SLO in the translocation of SPN. When expressed by S. pyogenes, PFO, like SLO, had the ability to form functional pores in keratinocyte membranes. However, unlike SLO, PFO was not competent for translocation of SPN across the host cell membrane. Thus, pore formation by itself was not sufficient to promote CMT, suggesting that an additional feature of SLO was required. This conclusion was supported by the construction of a series of mutations in SLO that uncoupled pore formation and competence for CMT. These mutations defined a domain in SLO that was dispensable for pore formation, but was essential for CMT. However, introduction of this domain into PFO did not render PFO competent for CMT, implying that an additional domain of SLO is also critical for translocation. Taken together, these data indicate that SLO plays an active role in the translocation process that extends beyond that of a passive pore.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem: review of recent studies.
AB  - Ertapenem is a long-acting, 1beta-methyl parenteral Group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-a-day dosing supported by clinical studies. Ertapenem is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. Isolates from a variety of infections (intra-abdominal infections, skin/soft-tissue infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections and urinary tract infections) are inhibited by ertapenem. It has restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. Ertapenem has potent activity against the majority of anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections, and against most of the aerobes isolated from these infections, with the exceptions of the nosocomial pathogens mentioned above. MIC(90)s for most species of Enterobacteriaceae were <1 mg/L, significantly lower than those of imipenem. MIC(90)s for most Bacteroides fragilis group isolates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/L, and MIC(90)s were species specific for Clostridium, ranging from 0.06 mg/L for Clostridium perfringens to 4 mg/L for Clostridium clostridioforme. Ertapenem was equivalent to or better than piperacillin-tazobactam in activity against most anaerobic species isolated from these infections, and was more potent than piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone against the most common skin pathogens (e.g. methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus). Ertapenem was highly active against most of the pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, except for isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (which are infrequent causes of community-acquired infection); these isolates were also resistant to ceftriaxone. Resistance to ertapenem is most commonly attributable to a variety of mechanisms including alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in Gram-positive organisms, and combinations of potent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes, porin protein defects and efflux pumps in Gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Comparative analysis of gene expression among low G+C gram-positive genomes.
AB  - We present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (PHX) genes in the low G+C Gram-positive genomes of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus halodurans, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Clostridium perfringens. Most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are PHX in these genomes, but not those involved in the TCA cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. Only B. subtilis and B. halodurans have several TCA cycle PHX genes, whereas the TCA pathway is entirely missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two Streptococcus species and is incomplete in Listeria, Lactococcus, and Clostridium. Pyruvate-formate lyase, an enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest PHX genes in all these genomes except for C. acetobutylicum (not PHX), and B. subtilis, and B. halodurans (missing). Pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently PHX in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. Phosphotransferase system genes are generally PHX with selection of different substrates in different genomes. The various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the human-specific toxin intermedilysin.
AB  - Intermedilysin is a human-specific toxin from Streptococcus intermedius, which is part of normal human oral flora. The bacterium is an opportunistic pathogen with a tendency for deep-seated infection in the brain and liver. Intermedilysin belongs to the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDCs) family of toxins, which have been identified in several different bacteria including the serious human pathogens S. pneumoniae and Clostridium perfringens. Intermedilysin, however, is the only member that shows exclusive specificity for human cells. The toxin has a couple of non-conservative amino-acid substitutions in a tryptophan-rich region of the molecule (Cys to Ala and Trp to Pro), the most conserved region amongst the CDCs. Mutations in this region are known to render other CDCs inactive. In order to investigate the structure-function relationships of the unusual features of intermedilysin, which will help us to understand the molecular mechanism of the toxin family in general, recombinant intermedilysin has been crystallized. The crystals belong to an orthorhombic space group and contain two molecules per asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were collected to 2.3 A using synchrotron radiation.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - The SKHR motif is required for biological function of the VirR response regulator from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The response regulator VirR and its cognate sensor histidine kinase, VirS, are responsible for toxin gene regulation in the human pathogen Clostridium perfringens. The C-terminal domain of VirR (VirRc) contains the functional FxRxHrS motif, which is involved in DNA binding and is conserved in many regulatory proteins. VirRc was cloned, purified, and shown by in vivo and in vitro studies to comprise an independent DNA binding domain. Random and site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify further amino acids that were required for the functional integrity of the protein. Random mutagenesis identified a unique residue, Met-172, that was required for biological function. Site-directed mutagenesis of the SKHR motif (amino acids 216 to 219) revealed that these residues were also required for biological activity. Analysis of the mutated proteins indicated that they were unable to bind to the DNA target with the same efficiency as the wild-type protein.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil and methanol extracts of Achillea millefolium subsp. millefolium Afan. (Asteraceae).
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the essential oil and methanol extracts of Achillea millefolium subsp. millefolium Afan. (Asteraceae) were investigated. GC-MS analysis of the essential oil resulted in the identification of 36 compounds constituting 90.8% of the total oil. Eucalyptol, camphor, alpha-terpineol, beta-pinene, and borneol were the principal components comprising 60.7% of the oil. The oil strongly reduced the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl radical (IC(50)=1.56 micro g/ml) and exhibited hydroxyl radical scavenging effect in the Fe(3+)-EDTA-H(2)O(2) deoxyribose system (IC(50)=2.7 micro g/ml). It also inhibited the nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation of rat liver homogenate (IC(50)=13.5 micro g/ml). The polar phase of the extract showed antioxidant activity. The oil showed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Acinetobacter lwoffii and Candida krusei while water-insoluble parts of the methanolic extracts exhibited slight or no activity. This study confirms that the essential oil of Achillea millefolium possesses antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in vitro.
TI  - Biology and pathogenesis of thrombosis and procoagulant activity in invasive infections caused by group A streptococci and Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Group A streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis/myonecrosis and Clostridium perfringens gas gangrene are two of the most fulminant gram-positive infections in humans. Tissue destruction associated with these infections progresses rapidly to involve an entire extremity. Multiple-organ failure is common, and morbidity and mortality remain high. Systemic activation of coagulation and dysregulation of the anticoagulation pathways contribute to the pathogenesis of many diverse disease entities of infectious etiology, and it has been our hypothesis that microvascular thrombosis contributes to reduced tissue perfusion, hypoxia, and subsequent regional tissue necrosis and organ failure in these invasive gram-positive infections. This article reviews the coagulation, anticoagulation, and fibrinolytic systems from cellular players to cytokines to novel antithrombotic therapies and discusses the mechanisms contributing to occlusive microvascular thrombosis and tissue destruction in invasive group A streptococcal and C. perfringens infections. A thorough understanding of these mechanisms may suggest novel therapeutic targets for patients with these devastating infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. There are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. However, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. This study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. Disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and MBCs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. Standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. The results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. A concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The MICs for Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. No activity was detected against Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Horizontal transfer of drug-resistant aminoacyl-transfer-RNA synthetases of anthrax and Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - The screening of new antibiotics against several bacterial strains often reveals  unexpected occurrences of natural drug resistance. Two examples of this involve specific inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus isoleucyl-transfer-RNA synthetase 1 (IleRS1) and, more recently, Streptococcus pneumoniae methionyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (MetRS1). In both cases, resistance is due to the presence of a second gene that encodes another synthetase (IleRS2 or MetRS2). Here, we show that both S. pneumoniae MetRS2 and S. aureus IleRS2 have closely related homologues in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. Furthermore, similar to drug-resistant pathogens, strains of B. anthracis and its closest relative, B. cereus, also have wild-type ileS1 and metS1 genes. Clostridium perfringens, the causative agent of gangrene, also has two metS genes, whereas Oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from deep-sea sediments has a single ileS2-type gene. This study shows the importance of understanding complex evolutionary networks of ancient horizontal gene transfer for the development of novel antibiotics.
TI  - The VirR/VirS regulatory cascade affects transcription of plasmid-encoded putative virulence genes in Clostridium perfringens strain 13.
AB  - We analyzed the transcriptional regulation of the putative virulence genes encoded on the plasmid pCP13 from Clostridium perfringens strain 13. The transcription of the beta2-toxin (cpb2) and possible collagen adhesin (cna) genes were regulated in both a positive and negative manner, respectively, by the two-component VirR/VirS system. The secondary regulator of the VirR/VirS system, VR-RNA, also affects the expression of both of these genes in the same fashion as the VirR/VirS system. This indicates that the global regulatory cascade of the VirR/VirS system controls the expression of virulence genes located on the plasmid, as well as those found chromosomally in C. perfringens strain 13.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of computer keyboards in a teaching hospital.
AB  - We tested 100 keyboards in 29 clinical areas for bacterial contamination. Ninety  five were positive for microorganisms. Streptococcus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus (including one vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), Staphylococcus aureus, fungi, and gram-negative organisms were isolated. Computer equipment must be kept clean so it does not become another vehicle for transmission of pathogens to patients.
TI  - Innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  - The hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. The aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. Mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus mitis, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Veillonella parvula, and Neisseria sicca. The levels of interleukin 12 (IL-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-10, and IL-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The TNF-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking CD14, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2), and TLR-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. The levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. Gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. The levels of IL-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of IL-10 were similar in newborns and adults. Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in cord cells. L. plantarum bound or signaled through CD14, TLR-2, and TLR-4, whereas E. coli acted mainly through CD14 and TLR-4. These results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.
TI  - The FxRxHrS motif: a conserved region essential for DNA binding of the VirR response regulator from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The VirSR two-component signal transduction pathway regulates virulence and toxin production in Clostridium perfringens, the causative agent of gas gangrene. The response regulator, VirR, binds to repeat sequences located upstream of the promoter and is directly responsible for the transcriptional activation of pfoA, the structural gene for the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, perfringolysin O. Comparative sequence analysis of the 236 amino acid residue VirR protein revealed a two-domain structure: a typical N-terminal response regulator domain and an uncharacterised C-terminal domain. Database searching revealed that over 40 other proteins, many of which appeared to be response regulators or transcriptional activators, had homology with the VirR C-terminal domain (VirRc). Multiple sequence alignment of this VirRc family revealed a highly conserved region that was designated the FxRxHrS motif. By deletion analysis this motif was shown to be essential for the functional integrity of the VirR protein. Alanine scanning mutagenesis and subsequent phenotypic analysis indicated that conserved residues located within the motif were required for activity. These residues extended from L179 to N194. More detailed site-directed mutagenesis showed that amino acid residues R186, H188 and S190 were essential for activity since even conservative substitutions in these positions resulted in non-functional proteins. Three of the mutant proteins, R186K, S190A and S190C, were purified and shown by in vitro gel shift analysis to be unable to bind to the specific target DNA with the same efficiency as the wild-type protein. These data reveal for the first time that VirRc functions as a DNA binding domain in which the highly conserved FxRxHrS motif has a functional role. These studies have important implications for this new family of transcriptional factors since they imply that the conserved FxRxHrS motif may be involved in DNA binding in all of these proteins, irrespective of their biological role.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated Bacillus sp. Strain 8 A.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by Bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of Brazil. METHODS AND RESULTS: A bacteriocin produced by the bacterium Bacillus cereus 8 A was identified. The antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. A crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, and several species of Bacillus. Clinically relevant bacteria such as Streptococcus bovis and Micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. Bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees C, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees C. It was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase K and pronase E. Bacteriocin activity was observed in the pH range of 6.0-9.0. CONCLUSIONS: A bacteriocin produced by Bacillus cereus 8 A was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.
TI  - Evaluation of N-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - N-Acetylchitooligosaccharides ((GlcNAc)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. A chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using HCl. After purification, the purity of each (GlcNAc)(1-6) was >86%. The growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (BM) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Eubacterium limosum could use (GlcNAc)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and Proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (GlcNac)(1-6). GlcNAc was used more readily than (GlcNAc)(2-6) by Staphylococcus aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. In BM, Streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.
TI  - Proteome and transcriptome analysis of the virulence genes regulated by the VirR/VirS system in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The proteins under the control of the two-component system VirR/VirS in Clostridium perfringens were analyzed by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the culture supernatant from the wild type and the virR mutant. Based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight/mass spectrometry, seven positively regulated proteins and eight negatively regulated proteins were identified. Transcriptome analysis confirmed that 7 of the 15 proteins were regulated by the VirR/VirS system at the transcriptional level, but the remaining proteins were modified with a VirR/VirS-directed protease at the posttranslation and secretion levels. We purified and characterized the VirR/VirS-directed protease from the culture supernatant and identified it as a kind of clostripain. Because this proteolytic activity was strongly inhibited by leupeptin and antipain, it was concluded that this protease was a member of the family of cysteine proteases of C. perfringens.
TI  - Autonomous expression of the slo gene of the bicistronic nga-slo operon of Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - A recent model for cytolysin-mediated translocation in Streptococcus pyogenes proposes that NAD-glycohydrolase is translocated through streptolysin O-generated pores into a host cell (J. Madden, N. Ruiz, and M. Caparon, Cell 104:143-152, 2001). This model also assumes that the NAD-glycohydrolase (nga) and streptolysin O (slo) genes that code for these products are organized in an operon-like structure expressed from a single promoter only (nga). We expand this model by showing that slo possesses its own autonomous promoter, which is located 155 bp upstream of the slo gene. Under experimental conditions in which S. pyogenes is grown in THY medium, the strength of the slo promoter, as measured by the activity of a lacZ reporter gene, resulted in low but highly reproducible values. Finally, we demonstrated that sloR, a S. pyogenes gene that closely resembles the Clostridium perfringens pfoR gene, exerts a negative effect on the expression of the slo gene.
TI  - Shima drinking water--a bacteriological analysis.
AB  - 300 water samples, 60 from piped supply and 240 from 20 natural sources were analyzed bacteriologically for four important bacterial indicators every month over a period of one year. The MPN of total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis were detected by multiple tube method and Clostridium perfringens was isolated using litmus milk medium. From piped water supply, only one sample was found unfit for human consumption. The plate count at 37 degrees C and 22 degrees C varied from 0.5 x 10(3) to 15 x 10(3) per ml. of water. From natural sources, MPN indices for coliforms, Esch. coli and S. faecalis varied from 3 to > 1800, 0 to > 1800 and 0 to 540 per 100 ml. of water respectively. About 1/3rd of samples showed presence of Cl. perfringens. The plate count varied from 1.0 x 10(3) to > 150 x 10(3) per ml. of water. Salmonella typhi was isolated in 1.25% samples by membrane filtration technique. The water from all the natural sources was unfit for human consumption whereas piped water supply was of good quality in general.
TI  - Clostridial VirR/VirS regulon involves a regulatory RNA molecule for expression of toxins.
AB  - We analysed the region encoding VR-RNA (VirR-regulated RNA), which has been reported to be positively regulated by the two-component VirR/VirS system in Clostridium perfringens. The VR-RNA promoter identified by primer extension analysis was preceded by a probable VirR-binding site (CCAGTTNNNCAC), which resembled a repeated sequence motif present in the promoter region of the theta-toxin (pfoA) gene. A VR-RNA-null mutant, constructed by a homologous recombination, exhibited a reduced amount of transcription of the alpha- (plc) and kappa-toxin (colA) genes, which was restored by the complementation of intact VR-RNA, indicating that the VR-RNA region plays an important role in the regulation of the plc and colA genes in C. perfringens. It was found that the regulatory effect was observed even when the hyp7 gene encoded on VR-RNA was deleted or a nonsense mutation was introduced in the hyp7-coding region. We found that the small 3'-portion of VR-RNA was sufficient for the activation of toxin genes, which suggested that VR-RNA itself could act as an RNA regulatory molecule for the plc and colA genes mediating the regulatory information from the VirR/VirS system in C. perfringens.
TI  - Removal of bacterial and viral faecal indicator organisms in a waste stabilization pond system in Choconta, Cundinamarca (Colombia).
AB  - A major objective for domestic wastewater treatment using waste stabilization pond systems is the removal of pathogenic microorganisms. Traditional evaluation parameters for faecal contamination are the total and faecal coliforms. However, epidemiological studies, environmental resistance and the behaviour in the treatment systems, show that viruses are an important disease agent and even more resistant to disinfection than bacteria. Therefore, it is important to introduce viruses as a faecal indicator and to compare them with the traditional bacterial indicators. A waste stabilization pond system was evaluated in the municipality of Choconta, Cundinamarca (Colombia), for the removal of faecal indicators (such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens) and viruses like F+, somatic and Bacteroides fragilis phages. The system includes two facultative ponds in series with a flow of 1555 m3/day. Samples were collected at the entrance of the system, in the two ponds and from the final effluent. Results show a decrease between 0.3 and 4.7 logarithmic units in the bacterial indicators and between 1 and 4.6 logarithmic units with viral indicators.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of Clostridium perfringens, an anaerobic flesh-eater.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive anaerobic spore-forming bacterium that causes life-threatening gas gangrene and mild enterotoxaemia in humans, although it colonizes as normal intestinal flora of humans and animals. The organism is known to produce a variety of toxins and enzymes that are responsible for the severe myonecrotic lesions. Here we report the complete 3,031,430-bp sequence of C. perfringens strain 13 that comprises 2,660 protein coding regions and 10 rRNA genes, showing pronounced low overall G + C content (28.6%). The genome contains typical anaerobic fermentation enzymes leading to gas production but no enzymes for the tricarboxylic acid cycle or respiratory chain. Various saccharolytic enzymes were found, but many enzymes for amino acid biosynthesis were lacking in the genome. Twenty genes were newly identified as putative virulence factors of C. perfringens, and we found a total of five hyaluronidase genes that will also contribute to virulence. The genome analysis also proved an efficient method for finding four members of the two-component VirR/VirS regulon that coordinately regulates the pathogenicity of C. perfringens. Clearly, C. perfringens obtains various essential materials from the host by producing several degradative enzymes and toxins, resulting in massive destruction of the host tissues.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - Evaluation of the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for detecting bacteria and measuring their growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for the detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates, and to determine bacterial growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted units. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apheresis (Cobe Leucocyte Reduction System [LRS]) and pooled buffy coat-derived (Optipress) platelet concentrates (PCs) were tested. Six organisms were used for spiking the PCs: Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Units were inoculated to give a final concentration of approximately equal to 1 and 50 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. On days 0, 2 and 5, BacT/Alert standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles were inoculated with a 5-ml fill volume and bacteria were enumerated. RESULTS: The BacT/Alert Automated blood culture system gave rapid determination times of spiked units, with all positives detected within 48 h and 98.1% detected within 24 h. In general, as the inoculum concentration increased, the detection time decreased. Rapid growth was obtained with all organisms tested except for B. cereus, which failed to grow on four occasions. Bacterial numbers on day 2 ranged from 10(5) to 10(11) CFU/ml and on day 5 ranged from 10(4) to 10(12) CFU/ml. Growth was not significantly greater in leucodepleted units. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed that PCs are an excellent growth medium for bacteria. Rapid and substantial growth was obtained with all organisms under test. Leucodepletion does not appear to enhance bacterial proliferation. The BacT/Alert automated blood culture system could rapidly detect contamination of units. Bacterial screening using an automated blood culture system is therefore a potential option.
TI  - Effects of probiotic administration upon the composition and enzymatic activity of human fecal microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome or functional diarrhea.
AB  - In a clinical trial, 10 patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome or functional diarrhea were administered the probiotic preparation VSL-3. Preliminary results indicated that administration of VSL-3 improved the clinical picture and changed the composition and biochemistry of fecal microbiota. Titer variations of intestinal bacterial groups were evaluated by culture and PCR techniques. A significant increase in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and Streptococcus thermophilus was observed as a consequence of probiotic treatment, while enterococci, coliforms, Bacteroides and Clostridium perfringens did not change significantly. The strains Bifidobacterium infantis Y1 and Bifidobacterium breve Y8, included in VSL-3, were specifically detected in feces of patients treated with the probiotic by using strain-specific PCR primers. In addition, fecal beta-galactosidase increased and urease activities decreased as a result of changes in the intestinal microbiota induced by VSL-3 administration.
TI  - Group G beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.
AB  - Little is known about the relative importance of the four species of Lancefield group G beta-hemolytic streptococci in causing bacteremia and the factors that determine the outcome for patients with group G beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia. From 1997 to 2000, 75 group G beta-hemolytic streptococcal strains were isolated from the blood cultures of 66 patients. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes of the group G beta-hemolytic streptococci showed that all 75 isolates were Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis. The API system (20 STREP) and Vitek system (GPI) successfully identified 65 (98.5%) and 62 (93.9%) isolates, respectively, as S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis with >95% confidence, whereas the ATB Expression system (ID32 STREP) only successfully identified 49 isolates (74.2%) as S. dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis with >95% confidence. The median age of the patients was 76 years (range, 33 to 99 years). Fifty-six patients (85%) were over 60 years old. All patients had underlying diseases. No source of the bacteremia was identified (primary bacteremia) in 34 patients (52%), whereas 17 (26%) had cellulitis and 8 (12%) had bed sore or wound infections. Fifty-eight patients (88%) had community-acquired group G streptococcal bacteremia. Sixty-two patients (94%) had group G Streptococcus recovered in one blood culture, whereas 4 patients (6%) had it recovered in multiple blood cultures. Fifty-nine patients (89%) had group G Streptococcus as the only bacterium recovered in their blood cultures, whereas in 7 patients other bacteria were recovered concomitantly with the group G Streptococcus in the blood cultures (Staphylococcus aureus in 3, Clostridium perfringens in 2, Citrobacter freundii in 1, and Bacteroides fragilis in 1). Overall, 10 patients (15%) died. Male sex, diagnosis other than cellulitis, hospital-acquired bacteremia, and multiple positive blood cultures were associated with mortality [P < 0.005 (relative risk [RR] = 7.6), P < 0.05 (RR = 3.7), P < 0.005 (RR = 5.6), and P < 0.05 (RR = 5.6), respectively]. Unlike group C beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia, group G beta-hemolytic streptococcal bacteremia is not a zoonotic infection in Hong Kong.
TI  - Expression of bacterial beta-glucuronidase in human bile: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial beta-glucuronidase causes deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide resulting in the precipitation of calcium bilirubinate, which contributes to biliary sludge and stone formation. This process is attributed to enzyme activity produced by the aerobic enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. The presence of Clostridium sp. was detected in 48 of 56 intrahepatic stones by using polymerase chain reaction techniques and cultured Clostridium perfringens from 14 of 18 unblocked biliary stents. Such bacteria are reported to produce beta-glucuronidase activity. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of biliary bacteria isolated from pigment stones and stents that produce beta-glucuronidase and to compare the enzyme activity expressed by the different bacteria in human bile. METHODS: A total of 202 bacteria were isolated from blocked and unblocked biliary stents and pigment ductal stones recovered from patients. Of these, 61 bacteria expressed beta-glucuronidase activity in brain heart infusion broth. These 61 bacteria were subsequently grown in human bile under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to the early stationary phase and assayed for beta-glucuronidase activity by using rho-nitrophenyl beta-D glucuronide as substrate. Results were normalized and reported as units of enzyme activity per milligram protein of the bacteria. RESULTS: C. perfringens produced beta-glucuronidase enzyme activity that was 34-fold higher than that for E coli, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium sp., Bacillus sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp., Streptococcus sp., and Klebsiella sp. CONCLUSION: C. perfringens with its higher enzyme activity is more important in the deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide than E coli and Klebsiella sp.
TI  - alpha 2,3-Sialylation of terminal GalNAc beta 1-3Gal determinants by ST3Gal II reveals the multifunctionality of the enzyme. The resulting Neu5Ac alpha 2-3GalNAc linkage is resistant to sialidases from Newcastle disease virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Enzymatic alpha 2,3-sialylation of GalNAc has not been described previously, although some glycoconjugates containing alpha 2,3-sialylated GalNAc residues have been reported. In the present experiments, recombinant soluble alpha 2,3-sialyltransferase ST3Gal II efficiently sialylated the X(2) pentasaccharide GalNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc, globo-N-tetraose GalNAc beta 1-3Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc, and the disaccharide GalNAc beta 1-3Gal in vitro. The purified products were identified as Neu5Ac alpha 2-3GalNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal beta 1-4Glc, Neu5Ac alpha 2-3GalNAc beta 1-3Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc, and Neu5Ac alpha 2-3GalNAc beta 1-3Gal, respectively, by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, enzymatic degradations, and one- and two-dimensional NMR-spectroscopy. In particular, the presence of the Neu5Ac alpha 2-3GalNAc linkage was firmly established in all three products by a long range correlation between Neu5Ac C2 and GalNAc H3 in heteronuclear multiple bond correlation spectra. Collectively, the data describe the first successful sialyltransfer reactions to the 3-position of GalNAc in any acceptor. Previously, ST3Gal II has been shown to transfer to the Gal beta 1-3GalNAc determinant. Consequently, the present data show that the enzyme is multifunctional, and could be renamed ST3Gal(NAc) II. In contrast to ST3Gal II, ST3Gal III did not transfer to the X(2) pentasaccharide. The Neu5Ac alpha 2-3GalNAc linkage of sialyl X(2) was cleaved by sialidases from Arthrobacter ureafaciens and Clostridium perfringens, but resisted the action of sialidases from Newcastle disease virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Therefore, the latter two enzymes cannot be used to differentiate between Neu5Ac alpha 2-3GalNAc and Neu5Ac alpha 2-6GalNAc linkages, as has been assumed previously.
TI  - Linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. It has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroidesfragilis. In controlled phase III studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. Further phase III studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (SSTIs). In these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments, including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated SSTIs. Oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated SSTIs or community-acquired pneumonia. Linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. The most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of S. aureus (including GISA), Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis (including VRE). In controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. As the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among S. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Removal of indicator bacteria, human enteric viruses, Giardia cysts, and Cryptosporidium oocysts at a large wastewater primary treatment facility.
AB  - Pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria occurrence and removal were studied for a  period of 6 months at the Montreal Urban Community wastewater treatment facility. With a capacity of about 7.6 million cubic metres per day (two billion U.S. gallons per day), it is the largest primary physico-chemical treatment plant in America. The plant discharges a nondisinfected effluent containing about 20 mg/L of suspended matter and 0.5 mg/L of total phosphorus on the basis of average annual concentrations. BDO5 (annual mean) is 75 mg/L before treatment and 32 mg/L after treatment. Samples were collected for a period of 6 months, and they demonstrated that the plant was not efficient at removing indicator bacteria and the pathogens tested. Fecal coliforms were the most numerous of the indicator bacteria and their removal averaged 25%. Fecal streptococci removal was 29%, while Escherichia coli removal was 12%. In untreated sewage, fecal coliforms, E. coli, and human enteric viruses were more numerous in summer and early autumn. Fecal streptococci counts remained relatively similar throughout the period. Clostridium perfringens removal averaged 51%. Giardia cysts levels were not markedly different throughout the study period, and 76% of the cysts were removed by treatment. Cryptosporidium oocyst counts were erratic, probably due to the methods, and removal was 27%. Human enteric viruses were detected in all samples of raw and treated wastewater with no removal observed (0%). Overall, the plant did not perform well for the removal of fecal indicator bacteria, human enteric viruses, or parasite cysts. Supplementary treatment and disinfection were recommended to protect public health. Various alternatives are being evaluated.
TI  - Structural basis of pore formation by cholesterol-binding toxins.
AB  - In this paper we describe reconstructions by electron cryo-microscopy of two oligomeric states of the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin. The results are interpreted by the fitting of atomic models of separated domains to the 3-dimensional electron density maps, revealing two steps in the mechanism of pore formation by the family of cholesterol-binding toxins. We briefly describe the observation of the toxin pore in model membranes and contrast the apparent mechanism of pneumolysin with that of other pore-forming toxins.
TI  - Cholesterol-binding cytolytic protein toxins.
AB  - Cholesterol-binding cytolysins (CBCs) are a large family of 50- to 60-kDa single-chain proteins produced by 23 taxonomically different species of Gram-positive bacteria from the genera Streptococcus, Bacillus, Clostridium, Listeria and Arcanobacterium. Apart pneumolysin, which is an intracytoplasmic toxin, all the other toxins are secreted in the extracellular medium. Among the species producing CBCs, only L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii are intracellular pathogens which grow and release their toxins in the phagocytic cells of the host. CBCs are lethal to animals and highly lytic toward eukaryotic cells, including erythrocytes. Their lytic and lethal properties are suppressed by sulfhydryl-group-blocking agents and reversibly restored by thiols or other reducing agents. These properties are irreversibly abrogated by very low concentrations of cholesterol and other 3beta-hydroxysterols. Membrane cholesterol is thought to be the toxin-binding site at the surface of eukaryotic cells. Toxins molecules bind as monomers to the membrane surface with subsequent oligomerization into arc-and ring-shaped structures surrounding large pores generated by this process. Thirteen structural genes of the toxins (all chromosomal) have been cloned and sequenced to date. The deduced primary structure of the proteins shows obvious sequence homology particularly in the C-terminal part and a characteristic common consensus sequence containing a unique Cys residue (ECTGLAWEWWR) near the C-terminus of the molecules (except pyolysin and intermedilysin). However, another Cys residue outside this undecapeptide and closer to the C-terminus occurs in ivanolysin. Genetic replacement of the Cys residue in the consensus undecapeptide by certain amino acids demonstrated that this residue was not essential for toxin function. Other residues in the undecapeptide have been mutagenized, particularly the Trp residues. One of these Trp appeared critical for lytic activity. The recent elucidation of the 3-D structure of perfringolysin O provided interesting information on the structure-activity relationship. The molecule was divided into four domains. Three domains are arranged in a row, giving an elongated shape. Domain 3 is covalently connected to the N-terminal domain 1 and packed laterally against domain 2. Membrane interaction of the monomer appears to be mediated by domain 4, while, oligomerization involves several sites scattered throughout the sequence. The Trp-rich region around the conserved Cys residue within domain 4 is assumed to conformationally adapt to cholesterol, and domain 3 is envisaged to move across the "hinge" by which it is connected to domain 1.
TI  - Genetic analysis of the ycgJ-metB-cysK-ygaG operon negatively regulated by the VirR/VirS system in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The 5'-flanking region of the metB-cysK-ygaG operon, whose expression is negatively regulated by the VirR/VirS system in C. perfringens, was analyzed. The region contained the ycgJ, mscL, and colA genes encoding a hypothetical protein, a large conductance mechanosensitive channel protein, and kappa-toxin (collagenase), respectively. Northern analysis revealed that the ycgJ gene was transcribed as a 4.9-kb operon together with the metB-cysK-ygaG genes and that this operon was negatively regulated by the VirR/VirS system. It is indicated that the pfoA (theta-toxin or perfringolysin O), colA, and ycgJ-metB-cysK-ygaG genes that belong to the VirR/VirS regulon are situated very close together in a 26.5-kb region of the chromosome, but do not form a pathogenic island.
TI  - Hydrodynamic bead modeling of biological macromolecules.
AB  
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Identification of novel VirR/VirS-regulated genes in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Novel genes that are regulated in Clostridium perfringens by the two-component regulatory system, VirR/VirS, were identified using a differential display method. A plasmid library was constructed from C. perfringens chromosomal DNA, and the plasmids were hybridized with cDNA probes prepared from total RNA of wild-type strain 13 and its virR mutant derivative TS133. Three clones were identified that carry newly identified VirR/VirS-regulated genes, two of which were positively regulated and one of which was negatively regulated. Genes located on the identified clones were deduced by nucleotide sequencing, and the target genes of the VirR/VirS system were identified with a set of Northern hybridizations. A 4.9 kb mRNA transcribing the metB (cystathionine gamma-synthase), cysK (cysteine synthase) and ygaG (hypothetical protein) genes was negatively regulated, whereas 1.6 and 6.0 kb transcripts encoding ptp (protein tyrosine phosphatase) and cpd (2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase) respectively, were shown to be positively regulated by the VirR/VirS system. The other gene, hyp7, whose transcript was positively regulated by the VirR/VirS system, was shown to activate the transcription of the colA (kappa-toxin) and plc (alpha-toxin) genes, but not the pfoA (theta-toxin) gene in C. perfringens. These results suggested that the global regulatory system VirR/VirS could regulate various genes, other than toxin genes, both positively and negatively and that the hyp7 gene might encode a novel regulatory factor for toxin production in C. perfringens.
TI  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. The combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus spp. The combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Legioniella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against E. faecalis. The combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. As for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against E. faecium. In patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or VREF infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. Emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with VREF infections. Quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. Systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. Myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. Venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. Hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4 and therefore has the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. In serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. However, in VREF or unresponsive MRSA infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.
TI  - The VirR response regulator from Clostridium perfringens binds independently to two imperfect direct repeats located upstream of the pfoA promoter.
AB  - Regulation of toxin production in the gram-positive anaerobe Clostridium perfringens occurs at the level of transcription and involves a two-component signal transduction system. The sensor histidine kinase is encoded by the virS gene, while its cognate response regulator is encoded by the virR gene. We have constructed a VirR expression plasmid in Escherichia coli and purified the resultant His-tagged VirR protein. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that VirR binds to the region upstream of the pfoA gene, which encodes perfringolysin O, but not to regions located upstream of the VirR-regulated plc, colA, and pfoR genes, which encode alpha-toxin, collagenase, and a putative pfoA regulator, respectively. The VirR binding site was shown by DNase I footprinting to be a 52-bp core sequence situated immediately upstream of the pfoA promoter. When this region was deleted, VirR was no longer able to bind to the pfoA promoter. The binding site was further localized to two imperfect direct repeats (CCCAGTTNTNCAC) by site-directed mutagenesis. Binding and protection analysis of these mutants indicated that VirR had the ability to bind independently to the two repeated sequences. Based on these observations it is postulated that the VirR positively regulates the synthesis of perfringolysin O by binding directly to a region located immediately upstream of the pfoA promoter and activating transcription.
TI  - Elimination of viruses, phages, bacteria and Cryptosporidium by a new generation  Aquaguard point-of-use water treatment unit.
AB  - The elimination of human viruses, phages, bacteria and Cryptosporidium oocysts by a new generation commercial Aquaguard purifier for the domestic treatment of drinking water, has been evaluated. The unit basically consists of a candle prefilter, activated carbon filter and ultraviolet irradiation compartment. Drinking water seeded with selected laboratory test strains of resistant micro-organisms was passed through the unit. Similar tests were carried out with sewage-contaminated river water and secondary treated waste water containing naturally occurring organisms. Test procedures were based on internationally accepted principles for the evaluation of point-of-use water treatment units, including a standard test protocol of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Reduction in numbers of seeded test organisms at several log levels higher than those expected in water for which the unit is intended, was determined by the cultivation of viable organisms. In the case of seeded viruses and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts the qualitative absence of nucleic acid was determined by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At the design flow rate of one litre per minute, numbers of polio, hepatitis A, adeno types 2 and 41, rota SA11, human rota and astro viruses, as well as somatic and MS2 coliphages, and Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, total coliform bacteria, enterococci, heterotrophic bacteria and C. parvum oocysts, were reduced by more than 99.999% in all waters tested. This efficiency conforms to specifications for such units. The quality of the treated water was well within microbiological limits of international specifications for drinking water.
TI  - Synthesis of bromoindolyl 4,7-di-O-methyl-Neu5Ac: specificity toward influenza A  and B viruses.
AB  - N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) was converted into the methyl ester methyl ketoside-8,9-epoxy derivative (8). Methylation of 8 followed by deprotection gave 4,7-di-O-methyl-Neu5Ac (10). Compound 10 was converted into the corresponding methyl ester-chloroacetate derivative, which was subsequently coupled to 5-bromo-indol-3-ol to give the chromogenic product (13). Deprotection of 13 gave 5-bromo-indol-3-yl 4,7-di-O-methyl-Neu5Ac (5). The product 5 was specifically cleaved by sialidase from either influenza A or influenza B virus to give an indigo-blue precipitate, but was not cleaved by several bacterial or viral sialidases tested. The properties of product 5 relative to a fluorescent substrate for sialidase were also documented.
TI  - Two structural transitions in membrane pore formation by pneumolysin, the pore-forming toxin of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae produces soluble pneumolysin monomers that bind host cell membranes to form ring-shaped, oligomeric pores. We have determined three-dimensional structures of a helical oligomer of pneumolysin and of a membrane-bound ring form by cryo-electron microscopy. Fitting the four domains from the crystal structure of the closely related perfringolysin reveals major domain rotations during pore assembly. Oligomerization results in the expulsion of domain 3 from its original position in the monomer. However, domain 3 reassociates with the other domains in the membrane pore form. The base of domain 4 contacts the bilayer, possibly along with an extension of domain 3. These results reveal a two-stage mechanism for pore formation by the cholesterol-binding toxins.
TI  - The molecular mechanism of pneumolysin, a virulence factor from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Pneumolysin, a member of the thiol-activated cytolysin family of toxins, is a virulence factor from the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. The toxin forms large oligomeric pores in cholesterol-containing membranes of eukaryotic cells. A plethora of biochemical and mutagenesis data have been published on pneumolysin, since its initial characterization in the 1930s. Here we present an homology model of the monomeric and oligomeric forms of pneumolysin based on the recently determined crystal structure of perfringolysin O and electron microscopy data. A feature of the model is a striking electronegative surface on parts of pneumolysin that may reflect its cytosolic location in the bacterial cell. The models provide a molecular basis for understanding the effects of published mutagenesis and biochemical modifications on the toxic activity of pneumolysin. In addition, spectroscopic data are presented that shed new light on pneumolysin activity and have guided us to hypothesise a detailed model of membrane insertion. These data show that the environment of some tryptophan residues changes on insertion and/or pore formation. In particular, spectroscopic analysis of a tryptophan mutant, W433F, suggests it is the residue mainly responsible for the observed effects. Furthermore, there is no change in the secondary structure content when the toxin inserts into membranes. Finally, the basis of the very low activity shown by a pneumolysin molecule from another strain of S. pneumoniae may be due to the movements of a key domain-domain interface. The molecular basis of pneumolysin-induced complement activation may be related to the structural similarity of one of the domains of pneumolysin to Fc, rather than the presumed homology of the toxin to C-reactive protein as previously suggested.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effects of Galla Rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibitory activity of Galla Rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active components of Galla Rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (MG) and gallic acid (GA) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. In the test using 10 mg disc-1, MG and GA produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Cl. paraputrificum, Eubacterium limosum, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards Bifidobacterium adolescentis or B. longum whereas the growth of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. animalis, B. thermophilum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. However, GA did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 5 mg disc-1, MG significantly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens and Cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 1 mg disc-1, MG greatly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens alone. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of Galla Rhois.
TI  - Cell-free whey from milk fermented with Bifidobacterium breve C50 used to modify  the colonic microflora of healthy subjects.
AB  - The ingestion of viable bacteria is thought to be required to modify intestinal microflora. In the present study, the effects on fecal flora of consumption of cell-free concentrated whey from milk that had been fermented with Bifidobacterium breve C50 was tested using 10 healthy human volunteers. Results were compared with effects of a commercial milk formula that had been fermented with Streptococcus thermophilus and B. breve C50 and given to 10 control subjects. Nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase activities were assessed as risk indexes for colon carcinogenesis, and beta-galactosidase was measured as an indicator of the fermentation capacity of the colonic flora. Fecal excretion of Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and clostridial spores decreased after 7 d of consumption of either preparation; however, counts of bifidobacteria only increased after intake of B. breve whey. Fecal pH was reduced from 7.1 +/- 0.2 to 6.6 +/- 0.3 after intake of whey that had been fermented with Bif. breve. Fecal nitroreductase and beta-glucuronidase significantly decreased, and beta-galactosidase activity increased, after consumption of either preparation. The results indicate that ingestion of viable bifidobacteria was not required to modify intestinal flora of humans. Repression of B. fragilis and clostridia seems to be independent of colonic bifidobacterial overgrowth in humans.
TI  - Bacterial flora in the duodenum of healthy cats, and effect of dietary supplementation with fructo-oligosaccharides.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes in the duodenal flora of healthy cats over time, and evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation with fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). ANIMALS: 12 healthy, barrier-maintained, specific-pathogen-free cats. PROCEDURE: Duodenal juice for bacteriologic examination was collected via oral endoscopy 5 times from each cat over a 32-week period. Cats were allotted randomly to 2 groups, and a crossover design study, during which they were fed either a replete dry (basal) diet or, for 12 consecutive weeks, basal diet supplemented with 0.75% FOS, was done. Samples (3 from cats fed the basal and 2 from cats fed the FOS diet) were collected for a minimum of 6 weeks after commencement of feeding, and a minimum of 6 weeks apart. RESULTS: Mean aerobic, anaerobic, and total bacterial counts did not differ significantly among sample collection times. After pooling of the results, mean (+/- SD) log10 colony-forming units (CFU) of aerobic, anaerobic, and total bacteria/ml were 5.5 +/- 1.1, 4.8 +/- 1.0 and 5.6 +/- 1.1, respectively. However, individual cats had considerable variation in counts: mean (range) intraindividual coefficients of variation were: 19.0 (6.1 to 34.2), 19.9 (4.8 to 35.5), and 18.1 (5.5 to 32.6)%, respectively. In 1 cat, total bacterial count varied between < 3.0 and 6.3 CFU/ml. Bacterial flora varied qualitatively: only Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides, Pasteurella, and Streptococcus spp, and unidentified gram-negative (aerobic) rods were present in > 50% of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: Wide quantitative and qualitative variation in the duodenal flora of healthy cats was observed over time, which was not affected by dietary supplementation with FOS.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-834, a novel oral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-834 is a novel oral carbapenem antibiotic. This compound is an ester-type prodrug of the active metabolite R-95867. The antibacterial activity of R-95867 was tested against 1,323 clinical isolates of 35 species and was compared with those of oral cephems, i.e., cefteram, cefpodoxime, cefdinir, and cefditoren, and that of a parenteral carbapenem, imipenem. R-95867 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity covering both gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes. Its activity was superior to those of the other compounds tested against most of the bacterial species tested. R-95867 showed potent antibacterial activity against clinically significant pathogens: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus including ofloxacin-resistant strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant strains, Clostridium perfringens, Neisseria spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC at which 90% of strains are inhibited, < or =0.006 to 0.78 microg/ml). R-95867 was quite stable to hydrolysis by most of the beta-lactamases tested except the metallo-beta-lactamases from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Bacteroides fragilis. R-95867 showed potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus and Escherichia coli. Penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of S. aureus and 1Bs, 2, 3, and 4 of E. coli had high affinities for R-95867. The in vivo efficacy of CS-834 was evaluated in murine systemic infections caused by 16 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens. The efficacy of CS-834 was in many cases superior to those of cefteram pivoxil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefdinir, and cefditoren pivoxil, especially against infections caused by S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus vulgaris. Among the drugs tested, CS-834 showed the highest efficacy against experimental pneumonia in mice caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Tissue-specific heterogeneity in alpha-dystroglycan sialoglycosylation. Skeletal  muscle alpha-dystroglycan is a latent receptor for Vicia villosa agglutinin b4 masked by sialic acid modification.
AB  - Because the polypeptide core of alpha-dystroglycan is encoded by a single gene, the difference in apparent molecular mass between alpha-dystroglycans expressed in various tissues is presumably due to differential glycosylation. However, little is presently known about the tissue-specific differences in alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation and whether these modifications may confer functional variability to alpha-dystroglycan. We recently observed that laminin-1 binding to skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan was dramatically inhibited by heparin, whereas the binding of commercial merosin to skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan was only marginally inhibited (Pall, E. A., Bolton, K. M., and Ervasti, J. M. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 3817-3821). In contrast to 156-kDa skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan, both laminin-1 and merosin binding to 120-kDa brain alpha-dystroglycan were sensitive to heparin. We have now examined the laminin binding properties of 140-kDa alpha-dystroglycan purified from cardiac muscle and observed that like skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan, heparin inhibited cardiac alpha-dystroglycan binding to laminin-1, but not to merosin. On the other hand, cardiac and brain alpha-dystroglycans could be distinguished from skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan by their reactivity with the terminal GalNAc-specific lectin Vicia villosa agglutinin. Interestingly, skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan became reactive with V. villosa agglutinin upon digestion with sialidase from Clostridium perfringens, Arthrobacter neurofaciens, or Streptococcus, but not Vibrio cholerae or Newcastle disease virus sialidase. While none of the sialidase treatments affected the laminin binding properties of alpha-dystroglycan, the sum of our results suggests that skeletal muscle alpha-dystroglycan contains a novel sialic acid residue linked alpha2-6 to GalNAc. These properties are also consistent with the cellular characteristics of a GalNAc-terminated glycoconjugate recently implicated in neuromuscular synaptogenesis. Thus, variations in alpha-dystroglycan sialoglycosylation may prove as useful markers to further elucidate the role of alpha-dystroglycan glycoforms in different tissues and perhaps within a single cell type.
TI  - The intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  - Bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. In infants delivered by Caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. The first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. Among them, Staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from the newborn faecal flora at birth. Facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by Bifidobacterium sp. Clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a Caesarean section. Clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as Bacteroides and other Clostridium sp. The impact of Caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. Feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. In humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. Formula feeding seems to promote implantation and persistence of Clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of C. difficile in newborns.

TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of necrotizing fasciitis in children.
AB  - Specimens obtained from eight children with necrotizing fasciitis (NF) were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 21 isolates were recovered, 13 anaerobic and 8 aerobic or facultatives. The facultative organism Streptococcus pyogenes was present alone in two (25%) instances, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated in six (75%). The predominant isolates were Peptostreptococcus spp. (6 isolates, including 3 Peptostreptococcus magnus). S. pyogenes (4), Bacteroides fragilis group (3), Clostridium perfringens (2), Escherichia coli (2), and Prevotella spp. (2). Organisms similar to the ones isolated from the NF aspirates were recovered in the blood of all patients except one. These included S. pyogenes (3 isolates). B. fragilis group (2), E. coli (1), and P. magnus (1) and Clostridium perfringens (1). All patients underwent surgical fasciotomy, and four required skin grafting. Antimicrobials were administered to all children. Despite extensive resection and intense supportive therapy, three patients died from sepsis accompanied by shock acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of NF in children.
TI  - Genetic characterisation of the botulinum toxin complex of Clostridium botulinum  strain NCTC 2916.
AB  - An 8 kb segment of the Clostridium botulinum NCTC 2916 genome 5' to the type A botulinum neurotoxin gene has been sequenced revealing five open reading frames. Four encode components (HA70, HA17, HA34 and NTNH/A) of the progenitor toxin complex. The product of the fifth, OrfX, possesses a putative C-terminal helix-turn-helix motif, exhibits homology with known regulatory proteins (including MsmR from Streptococcus mutans, UviA from C. perfringens and Orftxe1 located upstream of the C. difficile toxin B gene) and is also found within the vicinity of genes encoding tetanus toxin and types B, C, D and G botulinum toxins. Primer extension and Northern blotting analysis demonstrates that the genes are expressed as two divergent operons [HA34, HA17, HA70] and [NTNH/A, type A toxin gene], with the OrfX gene expressed singly. Immediately adjacent to the transcriptional start sites of the HA34 and NTNH/A genes are two highly conserved motifs (5'-ATTTTagGTTTACAAAA-3' and 5'-ATGTTATATgTaA-3'), separated by 12 bp, that span the putative -35 and -10 promoter regions. Homologous sequences occur in the equivalent position relative to the genes at type C botulinum toxin gene and the tetanus toxin gene loci. It is likely that these sequence motifs, together with OrfX, are involved in the co-ordinate expression of the genes encoding the various components of the botulinum toxin complex in groups I, III and IV C. botulinum strains and in that of the tetanus toxin gene.
TI  - Detection of bacteria in equine synovial fluid by use of the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Equine synovial fluid aliquots were inoculated with Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Actinobacillus equuli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus zooepidemicus to obtain approximate concentrations of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 colony forming U/mL. Synovial fluid aliquots were also inoculated with an unquantitated inoculum of Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. Inoculated synovial fluid was incubated in trypticase-soy broth or Columbia broth for approximately 12 hours. Then aliquots were removed for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for detection of a 531 base-pair segment of bacterial DNA corresponding to a region of the 16S ribosomal gene. Duplicate samples of inoculated synovial fluid were prepared for microbial culture. Bacteria were detected in all samples inoculated with bacteria but not in control synovial fluid samples. Under experimental conditions there was no difference between microbial culture and PCR analyses for detection of bacteria. Experimentally, PCR was able to detect bacteria in synovial fluid within 24 hours of inoculation.
TI  - In vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam GV104326.
AB  - GV104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). The in vitro activity of GV104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. GV104326 had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. The trinem had no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. GV104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. Ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of GV104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. Enterococci and Lancefield group A and B streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to GV104326 than they were to amoxicillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to GV104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to GV104326 (MIC90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). The anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.
TI  - The virR/virS locus regulates the transcription of genes encoding extracellular toxin production in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Extracellular toxin production in Clostridium perfringens is positively regulated by the two-component regulatory genes virR and virS. Northern (RNA) blots carried out with RNA preparations from the wild-type strain 13 and the isogenic virR and virS mutants TS133 and JIR4000 showed that the virR and virS genes composed an operon and were transcribed as a single 2.1-kb mRNA molecule. Primer extension analysis led to the identification of two promoters upstream of virR. Hybridization analysis of the mutants and their complemented derivatives showed that the virR/virS system positively regulated the production of alpha-toxin (or phospholipase C, theta-toxin (perfringolysin O), and kappa-toxin (collagenase) at the transcriptional level. However, the modes of regulation of these genes were shown to differ. The theta-toxin structural gene, pfoA, had both a major and a very minor promoter, with the major promoter being virR/virS dependent. The colA gene, which encodes the kappa-toxin, had two major promoters, only one of which was virR/virS-dependent. In contrast, the alpha-toxin structural gene, p1c, had only one promoter, which was shown to be partially regulated by the virR and virS genes. Comparative analysis of the virR/virS-dependent promoters did not reveal any common sequence motifs that could represent VirR-binding sites. It was concluded that either the virR/virS system modulates its effects via secondary regulatory genes that are specific for each toxin structural gene or the VirR protein does not have a single consensus binding sequence.
TI  - New drugs--reports of new drugs recently approved by the FDA. Dirithromycin.
AB  - Dirithromycin is a semisynthetic derivative of erythromycin, a 14-membered ring macrolide antibiotic. The drug is converted during absorption and distribution, to an active metabolite 9-(S)-erythromycylamine, which is the predominant compound found in plasma and extravascular tissues. High tissue concentration of erythromycylamine is achieved after oral doses of dirithromycin, with slow release back into the circulation. The mechanism of action of dirithromycin is like that of erythromycin and other macrolides. These compounds inhibit RNA-dependent protein synthesis. It has recently been suggested that all macrolides stimulate dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from ribosomes during the elongation phase, leading to inhibited protein synthesis. The antimicrobial spectrum of dirithromycin is similar to that of erythromycin, although the drug offers no significant advantage with regard to MIC values. In vitro against Gram-positive isolates, dirithromycin exhibits similar potency to that of clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, and clindamycin. In vivo, dirithromycin is active against penicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Dirithromycin is as effective as penicillin VK against streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsilitis, and as effective as erythromycin against acute superimposed chronic bronchitis and skin and soft-tissue infections. In comparison with other newer macrolides, dirithromycin has shown similar or lesser in vitro activity. In particular, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides spp., Peptococcus-Peptostreprococcus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Legionella spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Chlamydia trachomatis were all less sensitive to dirithromycin than azithromycin or clarithromycin. Once-daily oral administration of dirithromycin (500 mg) has been demonstrated to be similar in efficacy to erythromycin (250 mg, 4 times daily), each for approximately 7 days, in the treatment of acute bronchitis or acute-exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in controlled studies. Proven or presumed pathogen eradication rates were 83 and 86% for acute bronchitis patients treated with dirithromycin and erythromycin, respectively. Corresponding bacteriological response rates in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were 75 to 84% with dirithromycin and 75 to 82% with erythromycin. Both agents achieved clinical cure or improvement in over 85% of the patients with either condition. The main advantage of dirithromycin over erythromycin appears to be once-daily administration. Lilly launched dirithromycin in September 1993, in Spain, received approval from FDA in August 1995, and launched it during October 1995.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - The closely related ermB-ermAM genes from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis (pAM beta 1), and Streptococcus agalactiae (pIP501) are flanked by variants of a directly repeated sequence.
AB  - The Clostridium perfringens macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B resistance gene, ermBP, was sequenced and shown to be identical to the ermB-ermAM gene from the promiscuous Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pAM beta 1 and to have at least 98% nucleotide sequence identity to other ermB-ermAM genes. Flanking the ermBP structural gene were almost identical directly repeated 1,341-bp sequences (DR1 and DR2). These repeats potentially encoded a 298 (or 284)-amino-acid protein that had sequence similarity to chromosomal and plasmid partitioning proteins. The pAM beta 1 and Streptococcus agalactiae (pIP501) erm determinants appeared to have DR2 but had similar internal 973- or 956-bp deletions in DR1, respectively. Some of the other ermB-ermAM class determinants had small portions of DR1, but none had complete copies. It is postulated that the C. perfringens ermBP determinant was derived from an enterococcal or streptococcal determinant that had complete copies of both DR1 and DR2.
TI  - Streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome: spectrum of disease, pathogenesis, and new concepts in treatment.
AB  - Since the 1980s there has been a marked increase in the recognition and reporting of highly invasive group A streptococcal infections with or without necrotizing fasciitis associated with shock and organ failure. Such dramatic cases have been defined as streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome. Strains of group A streptococci isolated from patients with invasive disease have been predominantly M types 1 and 3 that produce pyrogenic exotoxin A or B or both. In this paper, the clinical and demographic features of streptococcal bacteremia, myositis, and necrotizing fasciitis are presented and compared to those of streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome. Current concepts in the pathogenesis of invasive streptococcal infection are also presented, with emphasis on the interaction between group A Streptococcus virulence factors and host defense mechanisms. Finally, new concepts in the treatment of streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome are discussed.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a Bacteroides gene, csuF, which encodes an outer membrane protein that is essential for growth on chondroitin sulfate.
AB  - Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron can utilize a variety of polysaccharides, including  charged mucopolysaccharides such as chondroitin sulfate (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA). Since the enzymes (chondroitin lyases I and II) that catalyze the first step in breakdown of CS and HA are located in the periplasm, we had proposed that the first step in utilization of these polysaccharides was binding to one or more outer membrane proteins followed by translocation into the periplasm, but no such outer membrane proteins had been shown to play a role in CS or HA utilization. Previously we have isolated a transposon-generated mutant, CS4, which was unable to grow on CS or HA but retained the ability to grow on disaccharide components of CS. This phenotype suggested that the mutation in CS4 either blocked the transport of the mucopolysaccharides into the periplasmic space or blocked the depolymerization of the mucopolysaccharides into disaccharides. We have mapped the CS4 mutation to a single gene, csuF, which is capable of encoding a protein of 1,065 amino acids and contains a consensus signal sequence. Although CsuF had a predicted molecular weight and pI similar to those of chondroitin lyases, it did not show significant sequence similarity to the Bacteroides chondroitin lyase II, a Proteus chondroitin ABC lyase, or two hyaluronidases from Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes, nor was any CS-degrading enzyme activity associated with csuF expression in Bacteroides species or Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence of CsuF exhibited features suggestive of an outer membrane protein. We obtained antibodies to CsuF and demonstrated that the protein is located in the outer membrane. This is the first evidence that a nonenzymatic outer membrane protein is essential for utilization of CS and HA.
TI  - Postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria.
AB  - Studies were undertaken to determine the possible role of enteric bacteria in the postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam. Flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam were completely metabolized in blood in the presence of eight species of enteric bacteria to their respective 7-amino-metabolites. The rates of metabolism, at 37 degrees C, ranged from 0.1 ng/mL/min for Streptococcus faecalis to 8.8 ng/mL/min for Clostridium perfringens. The rate of conversion was reduced to 87% by a combination of 0.7% (w/v) sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate, and almost completely inhibited (96%) by 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride. pH had variable effects on the rate of metabolic bioconversion of nitrobenzodiazepines, while increasing temperatures were found to generally increase the rate of nitrobenzodiazepine bioconversion. These data support the proposal that bacteria may mediate postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines.
TI  - Survival of fecal microorganisms in marine and freshwater sediments.
AB  - The survival of culturable fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, and Clostridium perfringens spores in freshwater and marine sediments from sites near sewage outfalls was studied. In laboratory studies, the inhibition of protozoan predators with cycloheximide allowed the fecal coliforms to grow in the sediment whereas the presence of predators resulted in a net die-off. C. perfringens spores did not appear either to be affected by predators or to die off throughout the duration of the experiments (28 days). Studies using in situ membrane diffusion chambers showed that, with the exception of C. perfringens, die-off of the test organisms to 10% of their initial numbers occurred in both marine and freshwater sediments within 85 days. The usual exponential decay model could not be applied to the sediment survival data, with the exception of the data for fecal streptococci. It was concluded that application of the usual decay model to the fecal coliform data was confounded by the complex relationship between growth and predation. The survival of seeded Escherichia coli in marine sediment was studied by using an enumeration method which detected viable but nonculturable bacteria. Throughout the duration of the experiment (68 days), the same proportion of E. coli organisms remained culturable, suggesting that sediment provides a favorable, nonstarvation environment for the bacteria.
TI  - Regulation of extracellular toxin production in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Until recently, little was known about the regulation of toxin production in Clostridium perfringens. Three regulatory genes that control the production of theta toxin (perfringolysin O) have now been identified. Two of these genes make up a two-component sensor-kinase-response-regulator system that also controls the production of other extracellular toxins.
TI  - E-4695, a new C-7 azetidinyl fluoronaphthyridine with enhanced activity against gram-positive and anaerobic pathogens.
AB  - E-4695, (-)-7-[3-(R)-amino-2-(S)-methyl-1-azetidinyl]-1-cyclopropyl-1,4- dihydro-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid, is a new fluorinated naphthyridine with an azetidine moiety. The MICs of E-4695 at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90s) were 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml for gram-positive cocci, including species of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and the MIC90s against gram-negative pathogens such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of Providencia spp. [MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml]) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml. E-4695 inhibited 90% of the Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis isolates at 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against gram-positive cocci the potency of E-4695 was 2- to 8-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin, 4- to 8-fold higher than that of ofloxacin, and 8- to 16-fold higher than that of fleroxacin. Against enteric bacteria and P. aeruginosa the potency of E-4695 was, in general, similar to that of ciprofloxacin and eightfold higher than those of ofloxacin and fleroxacin. E-4695 was four- and eightfold more potent than ciprofloxacin against C. perfringens and B. fragilis isolates, respectively. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin showed similar properties when the effects of pH or magnesium concentration were tested on them. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin had substantial reductions of activity only when pH decreased below 4.8. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin activities were not markedly affected by the presence of 5 or 10 mM Mg2+. The presence of serum and human urine at pH 7.2 decreased the activity of E-4695 between two- and fourfold. After an oral dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight, the maximum level in serum, the biological half-life, and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 10 h for E-4695 were 13.2 microgram/ml, 3.3 h, and 45.6 microgram . h/ml, respectively. The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 h for ciprofloxacin was 2.3 microgram . h/ml at the same dose. Fifty-percent effective doses (ED50S) against Staphylococcus aureus HS-93 infections in mice were 4.5 mg/kg with E-4695 and 37.6 mg/kg with ciprofloxacin. Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae 29206 was more effectively treated with E-4695 (ED50, 41,2 mg/kg) than with ciprofloxacin (ED50, 200 mg/kg). The ED50 of E-4695 for infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae 1625 was 132.2 mg/kg; ciprofloxacin was ineffective at 400 mg/kg against this strain. E-4695 was also more potent than ciprofloxacin in treatment of infections caused by gram-negative organisms such as Escherichia coli HM-42 (ED50S, 1.0 and 3.9 mg/kg, respectively). The ED50S of E-4695 and ciprofloxacin were 33.0 and 145.5 mg/kg against P. aeruginosa HS-116 and 9.6 and 18.9 mg/kg against P. aeruginosa B-120, respectively. The therapeutic efficacy of E-4695 may depend not only on its in vitro activity but also on its improved pharmacokinetic properties.
TI  - Growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  - The initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. Expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". In the present study, the CSH of 133 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, group A streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus magnus, and of 8 Candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. Cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate CSH, i.e., they aggregated in 0.01-2 M ammonium sulfate. When the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher CSH, and 44 strains the same CSH as after growth without serum. The CSH of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and PDM agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The highest CSH was expressed after growth in 5% CO2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. Identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 C, 20 min) serum. The reduced surface tension obtained in 5% CO2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of CSH.
TI  - Regioselective transglycosylation in the synthesis of oligosaccharides: comparison of beta-galactosidases and sialidases of various origins.
AB  - N-Acetyl-lactosamine(beta-D-Gal p-(1-->4)-D-Glc pNAc) was synthesized regioselectively with the aid of the transglycosylation activity of beta-galactosidase isolated from Diplococcus pneumoniae using p-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactopyranoside as the donor. Also, transglycosylation of the sialyl group in an alpha-(2-->8)-linked sialic acid dimer or p-nitrophenyl glycoside of sialic acid to N-acetyl-lactosamine was performed using sialidases of various origins. When sialidase from Clostridium perfringens, Arthrobacter ureafaciens, or Vibrio cholerae was used, alpha-(2-->6)-linked sialyl N-acetyl-lactosamine was obtained regioselectively. In contrast, when sialidase from newcastle disease virus was used, the alpha-(2-->3)-linked isomer was obtained regioselectively. The regioselectivity of the transglycosylation reaction using beta-galactosidase and sialidase was compared with hydrolysis specificity toward the same linkages.
TI  - Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): are common bacterial toxins responsible, and do they have a vaccine potential?
AB  - Despite extensive research, no unifying concept has satisfactorily explained the  cause of the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The details are briefly outlined of some of the evidence supporting the hypothesis that common bacterial toxins are important in the aetiology of SIDS. These bacterial toxins act as triggers to initiate a biochemical cascade resulting in death. Data from four research groups, each working independently, indicated that the bacteria Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. were present in higher numbers in infants who had suffered SIDS than in control infants. Certainly more detailed studies need to be performed on the role of bacterial infections in infants. There are many implications arising from this work, particularly the use of vaccination as a means of reducing infections, and consequently the number of SIDS deaths.
TI  - 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of anaerobic cocci and proposal of Ruminococcus hansenii comb. nov. and Ruminococcus productus comb. nov.
AB  - The 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of representative members of the family Peptococcaceae were determined. The members of the family examined were divided into the following four phylogenetic groups: Peptococcus niger ATCC 27731T (T = type strain), the Sarcina-Peptostreptococcus anaerobius group, the ruminococcus-coprococcus group, and the peptostreptococcus group. Peptococcus niger, the type species of the family, was not related to other members of the family. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC 27337T, the type strain of the type species of the genus Peptostreptococcus, was closely related to Clostridium sordellii NCIB 10717T (level of sequence similarity, 85%). Sarcina ventriculi GIFU 7886, a spore-forming anaerobic gram-positive coccus, clustered with Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124T at a similarity value of 91%. Members of the Sarcina-Peptostreptococcus anaerobius group clustered with clostridia at similarity values ranging from 85 to 91%. The type strains of Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus magnus clustered at levels of sequence homology of 84 to 93%. This cluster was not included in the Peptococcus niger group or the Peptostreptococcus anaerobius group. Thus, these members of the genus Peptostreptococcus should be separated from the other members of the genus and also from members of the family Peptococcaceae. The sequence of Peptostreptococcus productus ATCC 27340T was different from the sequences of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptococcus niger. The sequence of Streptococcus hansenii ATCC 27752T, a strictly anaerobic strain, was different from the sequences of other streptococci; this strain clustered with Peptostreptococcus productus, coprococci, and ruminococci. Several phenotypic characteristics of Streptococcus hansenii ATCC 27752T were similar to characteristics of ruminococci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Immunization and immunotherapy for mastitis.
AB  - Immunization and immunotherapy for mastitis are active areas of investigation. The past decade has seen development of effective and economical R-mutant vaccines for gram-negative mastitis. These vaccines doubtless will prove beneficial on well managed dairies that have eradicated contagious mastitis pathogens. Development of vaccines for other mastitis pathogens has been noticeably slower. A commercially available Staphylococcus aureus vaccine appears to reduce the frequency and severity of clinical episodes, but probably has minimal impact on the incidence or prevalence of infection. This product has not been extensively studied. The recent recognition of virulence factors produced in vivo by Staphylococcus aureus may provide a breakthrough in the development and production of Staphylococcus aureus vaccines. Bacterins employing this principle presently are not commercially available, however. In the case of all contagious mastitis pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycoplasma spp.), traditional control and eradication efforts (teat dip, dry cow therapy, culling programs) likely will prove preferable to long-term immunization. Ongoing research may provide more efficacious vaccines for these mastitis syndromes. Immunostimulants are an active area of research. Although leukopoietic factors appear promising as immunostimulants, no compound has clearly demonstrated efficacy in either the prevention or treatment of bovine mastitis.
TI  - Culture of intraluminal thrombus during abdominal aortic aneurysm resection: significant contamination is rare.
AB  - The significance of positive bacterial cultures from intraluminal thrombus in patients undergoing repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm remains controversial. Over the last 4 years, thrombus was cultured during aneurysm repair in 116 patients. All patients received cephalosporin antibiotic before and for 48 h after operation. Although none of the aneurysms appeared to be clinically infected, six patients (5.2%) had positive cultures. Four groups were identified based on the bacteria cultured: group I, coagulase-negative staphylococci, light growth (three patients); group II, coagulase-negative staphylococci, light growth and 'Streptococcus viridans' (one patient); group III, Bacillus sp., heavy growth (Gram-negative stain) (one patient); group IV, Clostridium perfringens, occasional growth (one patient). One of the six patients died during resection; the other five are alive without graft infection at 5-24 (mean 12) months after operation. The absence of graft infection suggests that positive cultures were not clinically significant or were adequately covered by the antibiotic prophylaxis. The incidence of positive cultures was lower than previously reported. Routine culture of aneurysm thrombus in the absence of clinical infection is probably not cost-effective.
TI  - Investigations on the aerobic flora and Clostridium perfringens in fecal specimens from free-living and captive capercaillies (Tetrao urogallus L., 1758).
AB  - 173 fecal specimens from captive Capercaillies and 92 fecal specimens from free-living Capercaillies were examined bacteriologically. With all specimens the bacteriological examination was limited to the aerobic bacteria which can be isolated by the usual methods and to Clostridium perfringens. The occurrence of fungi and parasites was examined as well. The present paper compares the results of these examinations. The identifiable fecal flora of free-living Capercaillies consists of few species with low colony numbers. In about half of the specimens Bacillus spp. are the main aerobic component while only a small number of the fecal specimens contain Escherichia coli and Streptococcus spp. None of the literature to date has stated that Streptococcus spp. do not belong to the autochthonous fecal or intestinal flora of an avian species. Clostridium perfringens cannot be isolated. The identifiable fecal flora of captive Capercaillies consists of many species with high colony numbers. Almost all fecal specimens contain Escherichia coli and various Bacillus spp. Streptococcus spp. can be isolated frequently, other enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens are present. The results of the examinations for fungi and parasites only differ slightly from those in wild birds.
TI  - Effect of hyperbaric oxygen and surgery on experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene.
AB  - An experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene rat model was developed and the therapeutic effect of surgery was compared to the combined effect of surgery and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO). The infection was caused by an intramuscular injection of a mixture of bacteria including Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. The mortality, morbidity and wound healing were assessed during a follow-up of 2 weeks. The mortality of the control rats was 60%, with rats treated with surgery alone 35% and the combined treatment group 20% (NS). In the combined treatment group, 84.4% of the survivors healed completely; the corresponding figure in the surgery group was 15.4% (p < 0.001). In experimental multimicrobial gas gangrene the addition of HBO to surgery reduces morbidity and improves wound healing but does not reduce mortality statistically significantly.
TI  - [Infectious endocarditis of gyneco-obstetric origin. Apropos of 15 cases].
AB  - With the object of analyzing current characteristics of post-partum and post-abortum infective endocarditis (IE), authors carried out a retrospective study of 15 cases between september 1985 and may 1992. Mean age was 22.2 +/- 4.0 years. Origin of sepsis was delivery (1 case), abortion (14 cases). There was no underlying cardiac lesion in 9 cases, rheumatic heart disease in 6 cases. Infecting organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), streptococcus D (n = 3), Clostridium perfringens (n = 2). There were 10 acute and 5 subacute IE, 7 right-sided, 7 left-sided, and 1 right and left-sided IE. Vegetations were determined by transthoracic echocardiography in 12 cases (80%). The main complications were heart failure (15 cases), and pulmonary or arterial embolism (7 cases). Lethality was 53.3% and was not different in tricuspid acute IE and left-sided IE. Treatment was the more difficult as cardiac surgery is expensive or even inaccessible. Accordingly, prevention is primordial. It consist of antibiotic prophylaxis and fight against illicit abortion.
TI  - Hyperbaric oxygen in the treatment of gas gangrene and perineal necrotizing fasciitis. A clinical and experimental study.
AB  - Between 1971 and 1987, 32 patients with clostridial gas gangrene were treated in  the Department of Surgery, University of Turku. A presumptive diagnosis of gas gangrene was made on the basis of the clinical appearance of the patient and a predominance of Gram positive rods on stain. Between 1973 and 1989, 11 patients with perineal necrotizing fasciitis (Fournier's gangrene) were treated. The diagnosis was based on fulminating progression of perineal gangrene and on the presence of multiple pathogenic organisms in the primary Gram stain or culture. All patients in both series underwent surgical debridement, antibiotic therapy, and intensive care. In addition, the patients were exposed to pure oxygen at 2.5 atmospheres absolute pressure (ATA) for 120 minutes. Three such treatments were given during the first 24 hours after admission after which the treatment was repeated twice daily. Seventeen patients with clostridial gas gangrene had diffusely spreading myonecrosis; 6 died. Fifteen patients developed clostridial cellulitis with toxicity; 3 died. Thus, the overall mortality in gas gangrene was 28%. All the 9 patients who died had been transferred from other hospitals in Finland and were moribund on arrival. The infection in 8 of these patients developed postoperatively. None of the patients with a posttraumatic infection died. Each of the patients with Fournier's gangrene had had nonspecific symptoms before the gangrene became evident. The infection originated from the anorectal area in 5 patients, 1 patient had sustained a scrotal trauma and in 5 patients the underlying condition was unknown. One patient died 2 days after admission. Six patients required a colostomy. To evaluate the therapeutic value of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatment, two experimental models of clostridial gas gangrene, mono- and multimicrobial, were developed in rats. In the monomicrobial infection model, 10(7) colony forming units (cfu) of Clostridium perfringens were injected intramuscularly into the left hind limb of the rat. The mortality of untreated rats was 100%. The mortality of the rats treated with surgery alone was 38% compared to 13% when surgery was used in combination with HBO (p < 0.01; chi 2 test). In the group treated with HBO and surgery, 94% of the survivors healed completely and were able to walk normally, whereas the corresponding figure in the rats treated with surgery alone was 20% (p < 0.001; chi 2-test). In the multimicrobial gas gangrene model the infection was induced by an intramuscular injection of a mixture containing approximately 10(7) cfu of each of the following bacteria: Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - Antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). Meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. Meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Only one strain each of Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. Of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens. Both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacteroides sp. All other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.
TI  - Syntheses and activities of N-substituted derivatives of siastatin B.
AB  - N-Substituted derivatives of siastatin B have been obtained by a chemical modification. Some derivatives showed potent inhibitory activities against Streptococcus sp. and Clostridium perfringens neuraminidases.
TI  - Impact of the advances in age on the gastrointestinal microflora of beagle dogs.
AB  - The gastrointestinal microflora of male beagle dogs in two different age groups;  I) less than month 12 of age, and II) more than year 11 of age, was compared. No detectable difference occurred on the microflora of stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum in both dogs. Large bowel (cecum, colon and rectum) microflora in both dogs yielded the different microbial populations. In all regions of large bowel, the levels of bacteroides, eubacteria, peptostreptococci, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and staphylococci in the elderly dogs were lower than those in the younger animals, whereas the numbers of Clostridium perfringens and streptococci in the elderly animals were higher than those in the youngers. The high incidence of lecithinase-negative clostridia was observed with advances in age, but not that of spiral shaped rods. The result of this study shows that the advances in age of beagle dogs yield some changes in the microbial population of large bowel in the animals.
TI  - Barley inclusion and avoparcin supplementation in broiler diets. 2. Clinical, pathological, and bacteriological findings in a mild form of necrotic enteritis.
AB  - The clinical, pathological, and bacteriological findings of a mild form of necrotic enteritis (NE) in broiler chickens are presented. The term subclinical NE (SNE) is proposed for this condition. A diagnosis of SNE was based on the detection of macroscopically visible, focal necrotic lesions in the small intestinal mucosa. The ileal gut contents from SNE birds yielded increased numbers of Clostridium perfringens and reduced numbers of coliform bacteria. Reduced numbers of lactobacilli and streptococci were detected in birds from SNE pens and coccidial oocysts were not found in the rectal contents of SNE birds. Statistical analyses showed strong correlations between SNE and increased feed conversion ratio and retarded growth rate. An increased occurrence of SNE was observed in birds on a diet containing a large amount of barley.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of new streptogramins, RP 59500, RP 57669 and RP 54476, alone and in combination.
AB  - RP 59500 is a 30:70 mixture of RP 57669 and RP 54476. The activity of RP 59500 and its two components against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms was compared with that of clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and rokitamycin. RP 59500 inhibited 90% of erythromycin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at less than or equal to 1 mg/L (range 0.06-2 mg/L). Both inducibly and constitutively-resistant strains of S. aureus, as well as strains resistant to rifampicin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, were inhibited. Streptococcus pyogenes, including erythromycin-resistant isolates, and group C and G streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 mg/L. Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by 1 mg/L. The MIC90 was 4 mg/L for Haemophilus influenzae and 1 mg/L for Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59500 did not inhibit Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of RP 59500 against streptococci was less than that of the four other macrolides. Clostridium perfringens strains were highly susceptible, as were Bacteroides spp. RP 59500, when combined with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime or gentamicin, did not have altered activity against susceptible species or alter the activity of the other component of the combination against susceptible species. MBCs in serum were increased two- to four-fold for S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, compared with MBCs in broth, but RP 59500 was as active at pH 6 as at pH 7, and there was not an appreciable inoculum effect. RP 59500 has potential use as an agent against inducibly and constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of Gram-positive species and selected anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Barley inclusion and avoparcin supplementation in broiler diets. 1. Effect on small intestinal bacterial flora and performance.
AB  - Diets based on barley or corn without avoparcin supplementation were associated with high counts of Clostridium perfringens in the contents of the small intestine of the birds at the age of 2 to 4 wk. The weight gain of birds younger than 2 wk and the body weight of 4-wk-old birds were significantly lower, and the feed conversion ratio at slaughter was significantly higher, in birds on barley diets than in birds on corn diets. The frequency of birds with sticky droppings on Day 21 was significantly higher for barley diets. The number of C. perfringens, and the feed conversion ratio at slaughter were significantly lower but the number of coliform bacteria, weight gain during the 3rd wk, and body weight of 4-wk-old chickens were significantly higher when the diets were supplemented with 7.5 mg avoparcin/kg feed. The effect of avoparcin on the feed conversion ratio was statistically significant only on a barley diet.
TI  - Bacteriology of ophthalmic infections with special reference to anaerobes.
AB  - A total of 138 eye specimens were processed for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Clinical data were obtained from 50 patients with unilateral ophthalmic infection. Cultures from the uninfected eye of 38 of these 50 patients were also processed for comparison. In addition, 50 cultures were obtained from one or both eyes of 30 healthy controls who had no eye infection. Anaerobes and aerobes were isolated from infected eyes of 6 (12%) and 37 (74%) patients respectively. No growth was observed in infected eye of 8 (16%) patients. A mixture of aerobes and anaerobes were recovered only in 2 cases. Of the total 47 aerobic isolates from infected eye specimens, Staphylococcus aureus (11), coagulase negative staphylococci (12) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9) were predominant isolates. Six anaerobes isolates included Gram positive nonsporing anaerobic bacilli (4 including Propionibacterium acne) as predominant isolates. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from a case of post operative endoophthalmitis. From the uninfected eye of same patients though the number and types of aerobic bacteria were similar, none grew any anaerobes. Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 70 and 6 per cent of eye swabs respectively from the healthy controls.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - Effect of intraperitoneal administration of oxygen on the course of experimentally induced peritonitis.
AB  - Over the first 3 days of experimentally induced peritonitis, 40 rabbits were given oxygen intraperitoneally (IP) up to a pressure of 3 to 5 mm Hg in the peritoneal cavity at 12-hour intervals. Compared with a control group, significant differences were recorded in the mortality rate within the studied 7-day period of peritonitis (p less than 0.05). In 29 rabbits with intraperitoneal administration of oxygen, the size of the area that formed the inner wall of the abscess cavity was significantly smaller (p less than 0.01) on day 7 of peritonitis than in the control group. The number of samples obtained from the abscesses positive for Clostridium perfringens (p less than 0.05) and for Staphylococcus aureus (p less than 0.001) was significantly lower in rabbits that had received intraperitoneal oxygen than in the control group. The number of samples from the abscesses positive for Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis was significantly lower in the control group than in the group with intraperitoneal administration of oxygen (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that intraperitoneal administration of oxygen has an effect on the mortality rate associated with peritonitis, the size of the intraperitoneal abscess, and the bacterial composition of these abscesses.
TI  - Demonstration of transient bacterobilia by foreign body implantation in feline biliary tract.
AB  - The biliary tract of cats is known to be free of autochthonous bacteria above the sphincter of Oddi. In this experiment we investigated whether transient bacterobilia occurs in the biliary system under normal conditions. Polyethylene tubes and human cholesterol stones were implanted surgically into the gallbladder of cats. Sham cholecystostomy was performed as control operation. These cats were euthanized at two, six, and 12 weeks, and the implants were removed, cultured, and studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cultures and SEM also were undertaken for material scraped from the mucosal surface of the biliary tract from these animals. Colonization of bacteria on the polyethylene tubes and the gallstones was found six and 12 weeks after implantation. Adherent bacterial biofilms were demonstrated on the surfaces of these implants. This experiment showed that transient bacterobilia exists in the feline biliary tract. The foreign body implants have facilitated the adhesion of planktonic bacteria in the bile onto their surfaces and have initiated the formation of adherent biofilms within which these bacteria persisted until the system was sampled.
TI  - Activity of mersacidin, a novel peptide, compared with that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and daptomycin.
AB  - Mersacidin, a new peptide antibiotic, was four- to eightfold less active (MIC for 90% of isolates, 8 micrograms/ml) than vancomycin, teicoplanin, or daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml, and the MICs of mersacidin for hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 4 to 8 micrograms/ml. The mersacidin MICs for anaerobic organisms were as follows: Clostridium perfringens, 4 micrograms/ml; Propionibacterium acnes, 8 micrograms/ml; peptococci, 1 microgram/ml; and peptostreptococci, 8 micrograms/ml. Mersacidin had no activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria and Haemophilus species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The size of the inoculum, the pH of the assay (5.5 to 7.5), the type of medium, and the anaerobic conditions had minimal effects on the MICs and MBCs of mersacidin. Overall, mersacidin proved less active than available glycopeptides and peptolides.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against Clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Four strains were isolated belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. The sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. Their resistance to phospholipase D indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. The inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. Their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E-4497, a new 3-amine-3-methyl-azetidinyl tricyclic fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new tricyclic fluoroquinolone, E-4497 [S(-)-9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(3-amine-3-methyl-azetidin-1-yl)-7-oxo- 2,3-dihydro- 7H-pyrido-(1,2,3-de)-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid], were evaluated in comparison with those of DR-3355 [S-(-)-ofloxacin], norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 was more potent than norfloxacin and as potent as or more potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Enterococcus faecalis. With the exception of Providencia spp., E-4497 inhibited 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Against enteric bacteria, E-4497 was similar in potency to norfloxacin but less potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs of E-4497, DR-3355, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin for 90% of strains were 2, 2, 4, and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis, E-4497 (MICs for 90% of strains, 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively) was two- to fourfold more active than norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 activity decreased moderately in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. Urine at pH 5.5 caused a significant decrease in activity compared with urine at pH 7.2. However, the presence of serum either had no effect or increased the activity of E-4497. In general, E-4497 was bactericidal at the MIC. In systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice, the protective effect of E-4497 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and comparable to those of DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Influence of bacteria on Clostridium perfringens infections in young chickens.
AB  - When monoflora chickens with Lactobacillus acidophilus or Streptococcus faecalis  were inoculated with Clostridium perfringens either in broth culture or resuspended in Gifu anaerobic medium broth or supernatant fluid, few or no chickens died. Approximately 50% of germ-free chickens died after inoculation of C. perfringens culture, whereas no conventional birds died after inoculation of broth culture. C. perfringens in the contents of duodenum from germ-free chickens numbered about 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU)/g after inoculation 10(8) CFU broth culture per bird, but in gnotobiotic and conventional chickens this organism decreased or was not detected. When C. perfringens was cultured in intestinal contents collected from germ-free chickens, C. perfringens proliferated but alpha toxin was not detected. These findings indicate that the pathogenicity of C. perfringens was suppressed by L. acidophilus or S. faecalis administered previously or inhibited by normal intestinal flora.
TI  - Proposed scheme for isolation and identification of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium perfringens-like organisms.
AB  - The properties of 220 strains of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium perfringens-like organisms were studied. A scheme was designed for the identification of these strains. The scheme was based on the presence/or absence of lecithinase enzyme, synergestic haemolysis with Streptococcus group B toxin, their inhibition with appropriate antisera and reaction in the lactose gelatin nitrate motility test (LGNM) with the fermentation of a few sugars.
TI  - Alveolysin, the thiol-activated toxin of Bacillus alvei, is homologous to listeriolysin O, perfringolysin O, pneumolysin, and streptolysin O and contains a single cysteine.
AB  - The gene coding for alveolysin, the thiol-activated toxin produced by Bacillus alvei, has been cloned by means of an oligonucleotide based on the known N-terminal sequence of the secreted protein. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene has been determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of alveolysin shows that alveolysin shares homologies with listeriolysin O, perfringolysin O, pneumolysin, and streptolysin O. Alveolysin, like the other members of the family, contains a single cysteine in the conserved peptide sequence ECTGLA WEWWR.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  - For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC50s and MIC90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: Escherichia coli 0.12 and 0.5, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, Proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. Klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. Enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, Citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, Serratia marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive Proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and Providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. The activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as N. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC50s and MIC90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were generally resistant: Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (MIC50 and MIC90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium perfringens (MIC50 and MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for Bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). These results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. For comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. Bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. When tested against a higher inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of Bay v 3522 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. Bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. Clinical studies are thus warranted.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - A54145 a new lipopeptide antibiotic complex: microbiological evaluation.
AB  - A54145 complex is made up of eight factors; A, A1, B, B1, C, D, E, and F which were active in vitro (MIC 0.25 approximately greater than 32 micrograms/ml) against Gram-positive aerobic organisms. The complex, factor B and B1 were found to be active against two strains of Clostridium perfringens. A calcium dependence study on some of the factors showed that their in vitro antibacterial activity was greatly enhanced by the presence of calcium (50 mg/liter) in the media. Resistance build-up was seen when Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. were passed seven times in the presence of sublethal concentrations of A54145 antibiotics. This resistance disappeared immediately when the resistant organisms were passed in the absence of the antibiotics. Factor A was very effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes infections in mice (sc ED50s of 3.3 approximately 2.4 mg/kg x 2, respectively). Factor B was more active against S. pyogenes in vivo (sc ED50, 0.9 mg/kg x 2). Acute mouse toxicities were determined with these antibiotics. Semisynthetic derivatives were evaluated.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. It inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, except for some Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 8 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. Ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The MIC90S of Ro 23-9424 for Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis had an MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal inoculum size effect. The MICs and MBCs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. The MICs of Ro 23-9424 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of Ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.
TI  - Bacteriological quality of on-farm manufactured goat cheese.
AB  - The bacteriological quality of 198 ripened soft or semi-soft goat cheeses obtained from dairy farms and the retail trade was investigated. The cheeses were examined for total counts of aerobic bacteria, coliform bacteria (37 and 44 degrees C respectively), enterococci, coagulase positive staphylococci, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens. Cheeses obtained from dairy-farms were also determined for pH value. In terms of all tests performed, cheeses made of heat-treated milk with starter culture had the best prospects for fulfilling the criteria for 'fit for consumption'. Cheeses made of raw milk without starter culture made up the most unsatisfactory group from a food-hygiene point of view. Bacteriological guidelines for on-farm manufactured goat cheese are suggested.
TI  - Recovery of viruses and bacteria in waters off Bondi beach: a pilot study.
AB  - A pilot study was conducted between February and April, 1989, on the occurrence of sewage-derived viruses and bacteria in the beach and nearshore waters off Bondi, Sydney. Enteroviruses were isolated from 41% of a total of 66 sewage, sea-water, grease and sediment samples. Poliovirus vaccine strains accounted for 78% of the isolates. Adenoviruses were isolated four times and coxsackievirus B was isolated twice in samples that were collected away from the bathing area. Rotavirus and hepatitis A virus were not detected. The number of faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, Aeromonas hydrophila and Clostridium perfringens in the sewage ranged from 10(4) to 10(7) cfu/100 mL. An initial reduction of 10(2)-10(3) in bacterial counts was observed in the plume (the effluent's initial dilution zone) and a further reduction of 10(2)-10(4) in counts in samples that were collected away from the plume. Salmonella spp. were detected in one-third of the samples and low numbers of Campylobacter jejuni were found in the sewage and plume. Salmonella serotypes that were associated with the sewage and plume were distinct from those in the stormwater and beachwater, indicating that stormwater may be an important source of pollution on Bondi beach.
TI  - The survival patterns of selected faecal bacteria in tropical fresh waters.
AB  - The survival of various faecal bacteria used as indicators of the faecal contamination of water supplies has been investigated in a tropical environment (Sierra Leone). Isolates representing the thermotolerant coliform (TtC) and faecal streptococcus (FS) groups, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were studied over a 48 h period of immersion in water from three different sources. Survival patterns varied according to source type, but some general observations were made: a portion of the TtC group was apparently capable of substantial regrowth; FS organisms died off at a faster rate than TtC organisms initially, but survived longer; vegetative cells of C. perfringens died off rapidly; and Salmonella spp. could survive for as long as the other faecal organisms tested. The implications of results for the analysis of tropical waters for faecal contamination are discussed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem ALP-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new penem derivative ALP-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. For comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. ALP-201 was found to be highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile were resistant to ALP-201. When tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of ALP-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. Further investigations are warranted with ALP-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
TI  - Hybridization analysis of three chloramphenicol resistance determinants from Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - The chloramphenicol resistance determinant from a nonconjugative strain of Clostridium perfringens was cloned and shown to be expressed in Escherichia coli. Subcloning and deletion analysis localized the resistance gene, catQ, to within a 1.25-kilobase (kb) partial Sau3A fragment. The catQ gene contained internal HindII, HaeIII, and DraI restriction sites and was distinct from the catP gene, which was originally cloned (L. J. Abraham, A. J. Wales, and J. I. Rood Plasmid 14:37-46, 1985) from the conjugative C. perfringens R plasmid, pIP401. Hybridization studies were carried out with a 0.35-kb DraI-P fragment of pJIR260 as an internal catQ-specific probe and a 0.38-kb EcoRV-HinfI fragment of pJIR62 as an internal catP-specific gene probe. The results showed that the catP and catQ genes were not similar and that neither probe hybridized with cat genes from other bacterial genera. However, the catP gene was similar to the cloned catD gene from Clostridium difficile. Comparative studies with both catP and catD probes showed that these genes had significant restriction identity. We therefore suggest that these genes were derived from a common source.
TI  - Detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Cell walls from various Gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. Bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. After renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. One to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls incorporated into gels. Crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various Gram-positive bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens (15 bands), Micrococcus luteus (1 band), Bacillus megaterium (4 bands), Bacillus sp. (6 bands), B. cereus (3 bands), B. subtilis (7 bands), Staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), Streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and Strep. pyogenes (5 bands). Molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kDa. Lytic activities against cell walls of Corynebacterium sepedonicum (Clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of Strep. pyogenes (45.7 kDa), Strep. faecalis (67 kDa), B. megaterium (67 kDa), and Staph. aureus (67 kDa).
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AT-4140, a new broad-spectrum quinolone.
AB  - AT-4140, 5-amino-1-cyclopropyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(cis-3,5- dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.1 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against gram-positive organisms, such as members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and 0.0125 to 1.56 micrograms/ml against gram-negative organisms, such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genera Pseudomonas, Branhamella, Campylobacter, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. Its MICs were 0.025 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, such as members of the genera Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Moraxella, Flavobacterium, and Brucella; 0.2 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis; 0.0125 to 0.05 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; 0.0125 to 0.2 micrograms/ml against Mycoplasma spp.; 0.031 to 0.063 micrograms/ml against Chlamydia spp.; and 0.1 to 0.3 micrograms/ml against Mycobacterium spp. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-negative organisms were comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and higher than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-positive organisms, glucose nonfermenters, anaerobes, Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., and Mycobacterium spp. were generally higher than those of the quinolones with which AT-4140 was compared. AT-4140 showed good oral efficacy against systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. Its efficacy was better when a daily dose was given once than when it was given in two doses. Good efficacies of the orally administered drug were also observed in pulmonary, dermal, and urinary tract infection models in mice. The in vivo efficacies of AT-4140 were equal to or better than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin.
TI  - Pathogenicity of enterococci in a rat model of fecal peritonitis.
AB  - The pathogenicity of enterococci in intraabdominal sepsis has not been clarified. Therefore, fecal-type peritonitis was induced in rats by intraperitoneal injection of barium sulfate along with a bacterial inoculum consisting of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens with or without Streptococcus faecalis. Mortality at 19 d and characteristics of intraabdominal abscesses in survivors at 19 d were analyzed. The presence of S. faecalis in the original inoculum was significantly associated with death or large (greater than 20 mm) abscess formation when these two end points were examined together. S. faecalis may synergize with other bacteria in intraabdominal sepsis to augment morbidity and possibly mortality.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - [The "diseased" or "dead" guillemots (Uria aalge), three-toed gulls (Rissa tridactyla), silver gulls (Larus argentatus) and laughing gulls (Larus ridibundus) found in the area of the German Bay, 1982-1985].
AB  - Between 1982 and 1985 the cadavers of 50 Guillemots (Uria aalge), 41 Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), 26 Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) and 34 Black-headed Gulls (Larus ridibundus) were examined pathological, bacteriological and virological. The probable cause of death was established. Parasitosis were particularly prevalent in Herring Gulls (49%), where the main infection--as in Black-headed Gulls--was with Cestoides. In Kittiwakes and Guillemots mainly Spiruroideae were recorded. The commonest bacterium isolated in organs and intestinal tract was Escherichia coli, followed by Aeromonas hydrophila and Clostridium perfringens. Salmonella were found in the organs of 5% and in the intestinal tract of 3% of the birds. The species of Salmonella most frequently isolated was Salmonella typhimurium varieties copenhagen. Also recorded were Yersinia intermedia Serovar 0:17 (1x), Pseudomonas spp. (2x), bacteria of the Haemophilus-Pasteurella-Actinobacillus group (1x), Pasteurella multocida (2x), Moraxella septicaemiae (1x), Campylobacter spec. (1x), Mycoplasma spec. (6x), DNase positive Staphylococcus spec. (4x) and Streptococcus spec. (6x). Less in evidence among the birds examined were fungus diseases with Aspergillus spec. (4x) and Blastomyces spec. (4x). As for viruses one Guillemot was found to have an Adenovirus and another one to have a Paramyxovirus. From one of the Herring Gulls there also was isolated a Paramyxovirus, from a second one to a Reovirus. Three other species isolated have get to be identified. The chief cause of sickness and death in the Guillemots was oil-contamination. The majority of the examined Kittiwakes and Herring Gulls were victims of pathogenic agents. Many of the Black-headed Gulls died through traumata as gunshots or road traffic etc. In order to establish the causes of sickness and death in seabirds and to ascertain the importance of the various species as possible carriers of infectious diseases, a systematic series of investigation will be necessary. Without this it will not be possible to assess their epidemiological relevance for other wild birds, domestic poultry and humans.
TI  - Microbiological and compositional status of Turkish white cheese.
AB  - Results of the chemical and microbiological examination of 38 Turkish white cheese samples are presented. On average, the cheese was characterized by a high moisture and salt content, 58.18 and 3.56%, respectively, and a pH of 4.68. Significant variation was found in these compositional factors, indicating the extreme diversity of manufacturing practices. Microbiological analysis revealed the presence of high numbers of coliforms, faecal coliforms and Escherichia coli, extremely high numbers of faecal streptococci, and a low level and incidence of Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella and Clostridium perfringens were not isolated from the samples. There was no correlation between the levels of coliforms, faecal coliforms, E. coli and enterococci, suggesting that the enterococci count in Turkish white cheese may not be a good indicator of sanitary practices.
TI  - Some factors affecting isolation of Clostridium tetani from human and animal stools.
AB  - Clostridium tetani was isolated from human and animal stools at the following rates [95% confidence interval (CI)]: Human, 0% (1.5-0); horse, 1% (5-0); cow in cowshed, 4% (10-1); cow in pasture, 8.3% (17-1), calf in pasture, 0% (7-0); dog, 2% (11-0) and sheep in pasture, 25% (44-14). Quantification of C. tetani in 16 animal stools positive for the bacillus was impossible in most cases, as the number of tetanus bacilli present was not large enough for this purpose. Contaminating anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria in human and animal stools, i.e., C. perfringens and Streptococcus sp., Group G, inhibited isolation of C. tetani from these materials, particularly at the step of isolation employing its swarming character.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the gene for perfringolysin O (theta-toxin) from Clostridium perfringens: significant homology with the genes for streptolysin O and pneumolysin.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence was determined for the gene encoding the thiol-activated  cytolysin, perfringolysin O (theta-toxin), from Clostridium perfringens. The nucleotide-sequence-derived primary structure of perfringolysin O is 499 residues long and exhibits a 27-amino-acid signal peptide. The calculated molecular weight of the secreted (mature) form of perfringolysin O is 52,469. The deduced amino-terminal sequence of perfringolysin O is identical to that determined for purified perfringolysin O. Hydropathy analysis indicated that, except for the signal peptide, no major stretches of hydrophobic residues are present. Extensive amino acid sequence homology (65%) was detected with the low-molecular-weight form of streptolysin O, and a lesser amount (42%) was detected with pneumolysin. The nucleotide sequence of the perfringolysin O gene (pfo) exhibits approximately 60% homology with the streptolysin O gene (slo) and 48% homology with the pneumolysin gene (ply). All three toxins contain an identical region of 12 amino acids, which includes the essential cysteine of all three toxins. The location of these 12 residues was conserved in all three toxins when the primary sequences were aligned for maximum homology.
TI  - Two-stage reimplantation in infected total knee arthroplasty.
AB  - Twenty-one infected total knee arthroplasties (TKA) in 21 patients were treated from September 1980 through October 1987. Of these, 15 were followed for more than one year. Treatment of these patients consisted of thorough debridement of all infected tissue and components; a cement spacer was used in ten patients. The cement was impregnated with antibiotics. This procedure was followed for an average of 4.2 weeks with intravenous antibiotics and TKA utilizing antibiotic-impregnated cement. Five patients had rheumatoid arthritis and ten had osteoarthritis. The organisms included Staphylococcus coagulase negative (seven patients), Streptococcus group B (two patients), Streptococcus bovis (one patient), Enterococcus (one patient), Staphylococcus coagulase positive and Bacillus circulans (one patient), Staphylococcus coagulase negative and Enterococcus (one patient), Staphylococcus coagulase negative and Pseudomonas aeuriginosa (one patient), and Clostridium perfringens (one patient). Of the 15 patients, 12 appeared to be free of infection, two were obvious failures and required knee fusion, and one was suspected of having continued infection at five years and was treated elsewhere. Eleven patients with revision TKA were available for follow-up examinations at an average of 2.9 years (range, one to six years). One patient died five years after reimplantation but had been functioning well. One patient functioning at three years postreimplantation did not return for a later follow-up examination. The average knee score (modification of the Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Score) was 75.5 points (range, 48-94); average flexion was 81 degrees (range, 52 degrees-120 degrees), and average extension was +6 degrees (range, 0 degrees-30 degrees).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The comparative in-vitro activity of ofloxacin.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared with that of nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, enoxacin, pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Ofloxacin was very active against nalidixic acid-susceptible isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae (MIC less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) and was also active against strains resistant to nalidixic acid (MIC less than or equal to 2 mg/l). The activity was similar to norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin but some four-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin. All of the fluoroquinolones were highly active against Vibrio cholerae (MIC less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), V. parahaemolyticus (MIC less than or equal to 0.12 mg/l) Aeromonas hydrophila (MIC less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l), Plesiomonas shigelloides (MIC less than or equal to 0.015 mg/l), Campylobacter jejuni (MIC less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l), Neisseria spp., Haemophilus influenzae, H. ducreyi, Bordetella pertussis and Legionella pneumophila (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l for all species). Ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin (MIC less than or equal to 1, 2 and 2 mg/l, respectively) showed similar activity against Staphylococcus spp. and were somewhat more active than enoxacin (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l) and norfloxacin (MIC less than or equal to 8 mg/l). Ofloxacin was moderately active against beta-haemolytic Streptococcus spp. (MIC less than or equal to 2 mg/l), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and Cory. jeikeium (MIC less than or equal to 2 mg/l) and somewhat less active against alpha- and non-haemolytic Streptococcus spp., Str. pneumoniae and Listeria monocytogenes (MIC less than or equal to 4 mg/l for all species) and Str. faecalis (MIC less than or equal to 8 mg/l). The activity of ofloxacin, against these species, was similar to ciprofloxacin and four to eight times greater than norfloxacin, enoxacin and pefloxacin. Ofloxacin, and all of the fluoroquinolones, were less active against anaerobic than aerobic bacteria. Clostridium perfringens (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l) was more susceptible to ofloxacin than were other anaerobic species and Cl. difficile (MIC less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was more resistant. Ofloxacin was the most active compound tested against Chlamydia trachomatis SA2f (MIC less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l) with only ciprofloxacin (MIC less than or equal to 1 mg/l) approaching similar activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [In vitro activity of roxithromycin against hospital bacteria and the concordance curve].
AB  - This study was set up to establish the regression curve for roxithromycin inhibition zone diameters (disks 15 micrograms) and MIC to create a strain distribution plot, in order to allow accurate interpretation of the disk diffusion method for testing susceptibility to roxithromycin. 373 bacterial strains were studied in three university hospital. Roxithromycin was active against erythromycin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococci at concentrations of 0.06 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode 0.5). Erythromycin resistant strains were also resistant to roxithromycin. Enterococci could be divided into two populations, one resistant (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml) and the other with MIC of 0.5 to 32 (mode 1-2). This was also the case for Streptococci and Pneumococci with MIC lower for susceptible strains (mode 0.06-0.12). Roxithromycin was active on Haemophilus at concentrations of 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml; MIC for beta-lactamase producing strains were comparable to those of strains not producing. MIC for Gonococci were low (less than 0.008 to 0.12), except for three strains. They were higher for Meningococci (0.03 to 32) with a majority of strains inhibited by 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml. MIC were 4 for Clostridium perfringens; Bacteroides fragilis strains were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml. The correlation coefficient for regression curve was 0.79; for critical concentrations less than or equal to 1 and greater than 4 micrograms/ml, critical diameters are greater than or equal to 22 and less than 17 mm.
TI  - Contribution of the microflora to proteolysis in the human large intestine.
AB  - Protease activities in human ileal effluent were approximately 20-fold greater than in normal faeces. Comparative studies with faeces from a person who did not have a pancreas suggested that a substantial proportion of the proteolytic activity in normal faeces was of bacterial origin. Thimerosal, iodoacetate, EDTA and cysteine significantly inhibited proteolysis in faeces, but not in small intestinal contents, showing that cysteine and metalloproteases were produced by bacteria in the large gut. These results, together with results from studies using p-nitroanilide substrates, demonstrated that faecal proteolysis was both qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in the small intestine. Studies with pure cultures of proteolytic gut bacteria indicated that the cell-bound proteases of Bacteroides fragilis-type organisms were likely to contribute significantly towards proteolytic activity associated with the washed cell fraction and washed particulate fraction of faeces. Extracellular proteases were formed by Streptococcus faecalis ST6, Propionibacterium acnes P6, Clostridium perfringens C16, Cl. bifermentans C21 and Cl. sporogenes C25. Inhibition results suggested that these bacteria, and similar organisms, may be partly responsible for the extracellular proteolytic activity found in the cell-free supernatant fraction of faeces.
TI  - Cefotaxime lavage in children undergoing appendicectomy.
AB  - In an attempt to reduce postoperative sepsis, a series of randomised, double-blind studies was begun in 1982, using cefotaxime as backbone therapy. Up to 1985 (stages I and II), the best results were obtained using a combination of cefotaxime (75 mg/kg intravenously in 3 doses at 12-hourly intervals) plus metronidazole (10 mg/kg intravenously in 3 doses), both drugs administered 1 hour before surgery (preoperatively) or at anaesthetic induction (peroperatively). In 300 consecutive cases, the wound infection rates were 1% in uncomplicated acute appendicitis and 5% in perforated/gangrenous appendices. The present study (stage III) reports the findings in 401 consecutive patients: 215 treated with the above regimen, either pre- or perioperatively (group 1) and 186 who additionally had peritoneal lavage with cefotaxime 2 g/L during surgery (group 2). There were 16 wound infections overall, 2 among patients administered prophylaxis preoperatively and 14 in those administered prophylaxis perioperatively. All produced mixed cultures, with Escherichia coli, Streptococcus milleri and Bacteroides fragilis predominating. The overall figures for postoperative sepsis are 12/215 (5.6%) in the non-lavage group and 8/186 (4.3%) in the lavage group. Among patients with a perforated and/or gangrenous appendix, the wound infection rate was 8/72 (11.1%) in the non-lavage group (group 1) and 4/66 (6.1%) in the lavage group (group 2). Each group had 2 cases of pelvic abscess.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the resolvase gene, res, carried by a multicopy plasmid from Clostridium perfringens: common evolutionary origin for prokaryotic site-specific recombinases.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens strain CPN50 harbours a 10.2 kb plasmid known as pIP404 which, in addition to a set of UV-inducible genes involved in bacteriocin production, carries res, a gene probably encoding a site-specific recombinase. The RES protein is highly homologous to the resolvases of transposons from both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria as well as enzymes involved in site-specific DNA inversion. A likely role for the RES protein would be to stabilize pIP404 by reducing the number of plasmid multimers resulting from homologous recombination. A putative resolution site for RES action was found overlapping the res promoter. Phylogenetic analysis of the primary structures of ten site-specific recombinases suggested a common descent and showed the RES protein to be closest to the resolvase encoded by Tn917 from Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Delayed postbacteremic prosthetic joint infection.
AB  - Deep infection of a prosthetic joint is a devastating complication. One proposed  mechanism of late prosthetic joint infection involves hematogenous spread from an extraarticular focus of infection. Two cases clearly demonstrate hematogenously acquired prosthetic joint infections, one caused by Clostridium perfringens and the other by Streptococcus pneumoniae. These cases were unusual in that a long asymptomatic period intervened between the primary bacteremic illness and the subsequent prosthetic infection. Patients with prosthetic joints who develop bacteremic infection at extraarticular sites should be treated promptly and aggressively with appropriate antibiotics. Prophylactic antibiotics should be strongly considered in the patient with a prosthetic joint who undergoes procedures likely to be associated with a bacteremia. Transient arthralgias at the time of bacteremia may represent the onset of the joint infection and should not be overlooked or attributed a priori to the patient's underlying arthritic or medical condition.
TI  - Bacterial survey of well water--Tehran, Iran.
AB  - One hundred twenty-one wells throughout the city of Tehran were monitored during  the four seasons of the year for the presence of bacterial indicators of fecal pollution. None of the sites monitored was connected to Tehran's main water distribution system but represented drinking water sources for small communities, individual factories, hospitals, etc. Only 17 samples showed no indication of fecal bacterial contamination throughout the study. The remaining sites were positive for at least one of the following at some season of the year: Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella-Enterobacter group, Clostridium perfringens, or Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - The influence of various bacteria on the cecal mucosa of monoflora chickens infected with Eimeria tenella. A scanning electron microscopic study.
AB  - Monoflora chickens were established at the age of 2 days by an oral inoculation of one of six species of bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, or Streptococcus faecalis). Two days later the chickens were infected with Eimeria tenella (5 X 10(4) oocytes per bird). There were four groups: uninfected birds as controls, the birds infected with either bacteria or E. tenella alone, and the birds infected with bacteria and E. tenella. As observed under the scanning electron microscope (SEM) seven days after E. tenella infection, damage of the cecal mucosa in all groups infected with bacteria + E. tenella was more severe than in that infected with E. tenella alone. Most severe damage to the cecal mucosa was found in the birds infected with either C. perfringens or B. thermophilum combined with E. tenella.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of T-2588, a new oral cephalosporin, compared with those of other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - T-2588, the pivaloyloxymethyl ester of T-2525, [6R, 7R]-7-[(z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetoamido] -3- [(5-methyl-2H-tetrazol-2-yl)methyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid, is a new oral cephalosporin. T-2525 had a widely expanded antibacterial spectrum against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. T-2525 was more active in vitro than cefaclor, cephalexin, and amoxicillin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Moreover, it exhibited superior in vitro activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. T-2525 was highly stable to various beta-lactamases, which were classified as Richmond and Sykes types Ia, Ib, Ic, III, IV, and Vc. It had high affinities for the lethal (essential) penicillin-binding proteins of Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacteroides fragilis. T-2588 had excellent therapeutic effect on systemic infections in mice with various species of gram-negative bacteria, including beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
TI  - Effect of water coagulation by seeds of Moringa oleifera on bacterial concentrations.
AB  - The effects of a Sudanese water purification method traditionally used in Sudan to treat turbid waters were studied with respect to turbidity reduction and removal of faecal indicator bacteria as well as selected enteric bacterial pathogens. Water treatment was performed at 30 degrees C with Moringa oleifera seed material as a coagulant, and the technique employed corresponded closely to that used to clarify turbid water in Sudanese villages. A turbidity reduction of 80.0-99.5% paralleled by a primary bacterial reduction of 1-4 log units (90.00-99.99%) was obtained within the first 1 to 2 h of treatment, the bacteria being concentrated in the coagulated sediment. During the 24 h observation period a secondary bacterial increase due to regrowth in the supernatant water was consistently observed for Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella sonnei, in some cases for Escherichia coli, but not for Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus faecalis and Clostridium perfringens. The potential of the method when compared with some alternative for the improvement of rural drinking water supplies is discussed.
TI  - Proficiency testing of water microbiology laboratories in The Netherlands.
AB  - In a 3-year period, four series of simulated water samples containing selected test strains were distributed to more than 50 laboratories in The Netherlands for bacteriological testing. Participating laboratories examined the samples by enrichment or membrane filtration methods, or both, for total coliform organisms, thermotolerant coliform organisms, faecal streptococci and standard plate counts (37 degrees and 22 degrees C) according to Dutch standard methods. The results were quantitatively satisfactory: the distribution of positive and negative results with subsamples conformed to stochastic variation; the standard deviation of membrane or plate counts was usually in the range which may be expected from a Poisson distribution, and there was good correspondence between average counts in participating laboratories and those expected from controls in the organizing laboratory. Problems of a qualitative nature were frequently encountered, however. Among them were a false positive response with a strain of Enterobacter cloacae in the thermotolerant coliform test; a false positive result with Clostridium perfringens in enrichment tests for total or thermotolerant coliform organisms and false positive results with Micrococcus varians in the faecal streptococcus test by membrane filtration. It is concluded that quality assessment should be a consistent activity in water microbiology laboratories. For this purpose, stable and well characterized reference materials are needed.
TI  - Effect of infection with Eimeria tenella upon the cecal bacterial population in monoflora chickens.
AB  - Monoflora chickens were established at 2 days of age by an oral inoculation with  one of six species of bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, or Streptococcus faecalis) and were infected with Eimeria tenella (5 X 10(4) oocysts per bird) 2 days later. There were two experimental groups for each bacterium: birds infected with bacteria alone and birds infected with a combination of bacteria and E. tenella. Seven days after E. tenella infection, counts of B. thermophilum in the cecal contents were significantly lower for E. tenella-infected birds than for those infected by B. thermophilum alone, whereas 10 days after E. tenella infection, counts were higher for E. tennella-infected birds. The population of L. acidophilus in the cecal contents of the E. tenella-infected chickens 10 days after inoculation was significantly greater than that in uninfected chickens. No significant differences were observed between the numbers of B. vulgatus, C. perfringens, and S. faecalis in cecal contents of groups with and without E. tenella infections.
TI  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin with a (Z)-propenyl side chain at the 3 position and a p-hydroxyphenylglycyl substituent at the 7 position, was evaluated in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin and, when appropriate, ampicillin and vancomycin. In vitro, BMY 28100 was more active than the reference cephalosporins against streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. BMY 28100 was comparable to cefaclor and more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and ampicillin-susceptible strains of Branhamella catarrhalis; but against ampicillin-resistant strains of B. catarrhalis, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin and more active than cefaclor. Against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin, but less active than cefaclor. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae overall were equally susceptible to BMY 28100 and cefaclor but were less susceptible to cephalexin. In human serum, BMY 28100 was 45% protein bound. After an oral dose to mice, 82% of the drug was recovered in urine. The oral therapeutic efficacy of BMY 28100 in systemically infected mice reflected its activity in vitro.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  - The relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. We used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two Bacteroides spp., eight Gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric Gram-negative aerobic rods. Abscesses were induced by all seven Clostridium perfringens and three C. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. Selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric Gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. Enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. Enhancement was observed mainly with C. perfringens in mixed infections. By contrast, other Clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. Clostridium difficile and C. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species. This study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.
TI  - The significance of clostridial isolates in intra-abdominal sepsis.
AB  - In order to evaluate the significance of clostridial species in intra-abdominal infections, the bacteriology records of three hospitals were reviewed during a period of five years. Included in this report were 41 patients from whom clostridial species were recovered from specimens of free peritoneal fluid, abscess cavities or bile. Seven patients died for a mortality rate of 17.1 per cent. Most patients had polymicrobial infections of which clostridial organisms were one of the several anaerobes isolated. Clostridium perfringens was the single most frequently noted species, identified in 23 of the patients, but it was not associated with a different mortality rate than was observed for the other clostridial species. Clostridial bacteremia was uncommon and demonstrated in only one patient. The mean age of the patients was 56.4 years; 56.2 for males and 56.8 for females. Neither age nor sex of the patient influenced the likelihood of survival. The source of the clostridial isolates--bile, abscess cavity or free peritoneal fluid--had no effect upon the outcome. Several underlying conditions were responsible for the intraperitoneal clostridial organisms identified in this series. Only mesenteric infarction proved significantly predictive of a fatal result. Antibiotic coverage specifically directed against clostridia did not influence survival.
TI  - Potent antagonism of Escherichia coli, Bacteroides ovatus, Fusobacterium varium,  and Enterococcus faecalis, alone or in combination, for enteropathogens in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
AB  - Interactions between representative strains of four predominant resident bacteria of the human colon, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides ovatus, and Fusobacterium varium, and strains of seven enteropathogens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. cholerae serogroup non O1, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens, were examined in studies with an anaerobic continuous flow culture system and medium resembling the content of the mouse caecum (MCM). Potent unilateral antagonism attributable to synergic activities of the resident bacteria against the enteropathogens was evident. The four resident bacteria persisted at levels of c. 10(6) cfu/ml or more in single and in any mixed cultures of the resident species. The seven enteropathogens also persisted in single cultures. In contrast, Y. enterocolitica was excluded in several days in mixed cultures with each of the four resident bacteria. Sh. Flexneri and Staph. aureus were excluded in the presence of E. coli alone. C. perfringens, V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae serogroup non O1 were excluded in the presence of E. coli with B. ovatus and, in some cases, with additional species. S. typhimurium was the most resistant; only c. 10(2)-fold reduction of the population level was observed in mixed culture with all four of the resident species. When the amounts of some components in the medium, such as peptone and yeast extract, were increased, C. perfringens grew and persisted even in the presence of the four resident bacteria. Sh. flexneri, in contrast decreased steadily, even in enriched media.
TI  - An evaluation of various working practices in shops selling raw and cooked meats.
AB  - Three groups of premises (butchers' shops, supermarkets and general dealers) which sell raw and cooked meats were compared. Salmonellas were not detected, but Escherichia coli, and to a lesser degree Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis, were widely distributed in all three groups of premises. Contamination of hands, towels and nail brushes was related to poor working practices. The presence of E. coli or Str. faecalis on slicing machines was associated with contamination of meat samples. A number of wiping cloths were heavily contaminated with E. coli, and many also contained Clostridium perfringens. Fewer premises provided written cleaning plans, and in many cases staff did not receive an adequate training in food hygiene. The use of disinfectants as part of the cleaning process did not necessarily reduce the level of bacterial contamination. In general there was poor correlation between microbiological results and a visual inspection made by an environmental health officer. The possible reasons for this finding are discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of flurithromycin, a novel macrolide antibiotic.
AB  - Flurithromycin is an (8,S)-8-fluoroerythromycin isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces erythraeus ATCC 31772, a blocked mutant of a strain producer of erythromycin. Its in vitro antibacterial activity has been determined on recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens. The range of MIC for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus group A is from 0.0015 to 0.006 microgram/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae from 0.012 to 0.4 microgram/ml, for Staphylococcus aureus from 0.1 to 3.1 micrograms/ml. Its action is bacteriostatic and increases at alkaline pH. Among anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, other species of Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus are particularly susceptible. Flurithromycin also showed some activity on Mycobacterium bovis, M. scrofulaceum and M. phley. The determination of killing curves indicated that in most cases a killing effect was obtained at 4 X MIC. A combination of flurithromycin with ampicillin or doxycycline sometimes was synergic, but more often additive and never antagonistic. The possible interference of flurithromycin on some parameters of the natural system of defense was determined. At concentrations equal to therapeutic levels in blood and tissues, flurithromycin did not influence chemotaxis, phagocytosis, metabolic activation and the killing activity of neutrophils.
TI  - Bacteremia and fungemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  - Forty-nine episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred in 38 of 336 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen at our institution since 1980. There were five types of infections. Infections commonly associated with a T-cell immunodeficiency disorder comprised 16 episodes and included those with Salmonella species, Listeria monocytogenes, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum. Infections commonly associated with a B-cell immunodeficiency disorder included those with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Infections occurring with neutropenia were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. Other infections occurring in the hospital were caused by Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, enteric gram-negative rods, Staphylococcus aureus, and mixed S. aureus and group G streptococcus. Other infections occurring out of the hospital included those with S. aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group B streptococcus. Because two thirds of the septicemias were caused by organisms other than T-cell opportunists, these pathogens should be anticipated during diagnostic evaluation and when formulating empiric therapy.
TI  - Gangrenous cholecystitis and acute cholangitis associated with anaerobic bacteria in bile.
AB  - The incidence of anaerobic bacteria in bile, and the relationship between bacterial species isolated from the bile and the clinical characteristics of disease in these patients was studied. One hundred and twenty-five bile specimens obtained during surgery from the same number of patients were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Seventy patients (56%) had positive cultures and in 30% of the patients with positive cultures anaerobic bacteria were recovered, usually together with aerobic bacteria. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic organisms. There was a high rate of isolation of anaerobic bacteria from bile in patients with gangrenous cholecystitis (72%) or acute cholangitis (50%). Administration of antibiotics effective against anaerobic bacteria should be considered when treating these diseases.
TI  - Agar medium for gas-liquid chromatography of anaerobes.
AB  - This study evaluates a method of performing gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) by direct extraction of fatty acids from agar for identification of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria. The potential use of agar cultures for GLC was studied by comparing chromatograms of 117 clinically isolated anaerobes grown in peptone yeast glucose broth and chopped meat carbohydrate broth, and on enriched brucella blood agar. For 98 of 117 anaerobes, fatty acid patterns from agar cultures were similar to those in broth. Significant differences were only found with Streptococcus intermedius, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tertium, and Actinomyces species, which produced less of certain fatty acids on agar than in broth. Results of this study indicate that GLC of short chain fatty acids produced on agar medium by anaerobes, combined with simple tests such as Gram's stain and colonial morphology, may allow fir direct presumptive genus identification from an initial pure agar culture.
TI  - Treatment of surgical infections with a modern quinolone: therapy of soft tissue  infections and pneumonia with ofloxacin.
AB  - A randomized, open, prospective study including 45 patients with either soft tissue infections (29 cases) or pneumonia (15 cases) after surgical intervention and one case having both indications was carried out with ofloxacin. The standard dose was 200 mg ofloxacin b. i. d. In most cases, clinical symptoms, such as fever, rubor, swelling and pain in soft tissue infections, as well as fever, dyspnoea, physical and radiological signs for pneumonia, subsided within two to seven days. Laboratory data (blood analyses, liver enzymes) remained in the normal range. The overall tolerability was good. Bacteriological controls have proven that ofloxacin is able to eradicate a broad range of pathogens, including persister pathogens and also certain bacteria like Clostridium perfringens and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. In our study, Streptococcus faecalis was of intermediate sensitivity in one case and resistant in another. Ofloxacin has proven to be effective in soft tissue infections and pneumonia after surgical intervention.
TI  - Further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  - Various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21). Taking the specific TK activity of Escherichia coli K12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific TK activities. In the Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than Staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and Streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of Strep. pyogenes (29%). Neisseria sicca, a Gram-negative coccus, lacked TK. Gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (Bacillus, 13-51%; Clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of B. megaterium (2%) and C. difficile (1-3%). Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%). Of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, Vibrio lacked TK, while Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella (148-1120%), Escherichia (59-141%), Klebsiella (78-299%) and Serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. Proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'Pr. rettgerella' (307%). Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium and related organisms other than Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium lacked TK. The seven species of Candida tested, and Cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked TK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a Proteus sp., an Erysipelothrix sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. The intracutaneous injection of Fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to this effect. The in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low MIC; a low MIC was sometimes associated with little action and a high MIC with moderate action. Sixteen organisms were tested. The iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of E. rhusiopathiae. In only one case, with a strain of Proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. On the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and C. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-C streptococcus and one strain each of K. pneumoniae, E. rhusiopathiae and A. hydrophila. It is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate excess of readily available Fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). Insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.
TI  - Evolution and epidemiology of MLS resistance.
AB  - Within the framework of this symposium, it is not feasible to present an exhaustive description of the present state of knowledge regarding the sensitivity and resistance of bacterial species to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins (MLS). This paper is limited to a description of the evolution of different types of resistance in the light of decisive factors described in previous papers, in order to deduce, if at all possible, trends in future strategy in therapeutics. Only acquired resistance lends itself to epidemiological study, in contrast to natural resistance which is, by definition, characteristic of a species or a genus, and not liable to change. Three groups will therefore be studied in turn: Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci and Bacteroides fragilis. There is as yet insufficient accumulated data to draw conclusions regarding the epidemiology and evolution of MLSB resistance observed in Clostridium perfringens and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, or regarding the high-level resistance to erythromycin due to enzymatic inactivation recently described in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from Nsukka meat market: a zoonotic appraisal.
AB  - Swabs collected from butchers hands, knives, tables and meat displayed for sale at Nsukka meat market showed that every item screened was contaminated. Bacteria isolated include Streptococcus faecalis, coagulase positive Staphylococcus, Clostridium perfringens, Brucella species, Corynebacterium haemolyticum, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas multophilia, P. rubescens and beta-haemolytic Streptococci. The zoonotic or public health implications of such contaminations, their probable sources and possible ways of minimizing them are discussed.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. This investigation assessed the effect of light-activated Hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans. Photoactivation of Hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. Combinations of light-activated Hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular S. aureus. The ability of Hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of abscesses.
TI  - [Specificity against group A, C, and G streptococci of the reverse CAMP test for  identifying Clostridium perfringens].
AB  - We studied "reverse CAMP" test specificity for the identification of Clostridium  perfringens, and the probable existence of cross-reactions with groups A, C and G streptococci. Ninety eight Clostridium strains were tested with ten S. agalactiae, ten S. pyogenes, two group C streptococci and one group G. All the strains of S. agalactiae yielded a positive "reverse CAMP" reaction when it was performed with C. perfringens strains. Cross-reactions were not detected when C. perfringens were tested with groups A, C or G streptococci. The "reverse CAMP" test proved to be specific for all the C. perfringens strains used.
TI  - Enterococci in lambs.
AB  
TI  - Hydrolysis of linamarin by intestinal bacteria.
AB  - Linamarin, a cyanogenic glucoside, was hydrolyzed by Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis but not by Clostridium perfringens when these organisms were grown on a glucose or lactose medium.
TI  - Empedopeptin (BMY-28117), a new depsipeptide antibiotic. I. Production, isolation and properties.
AB  - Empedopeptin is a new antibiotic produced by empedobacter haloabium nov. sp. (ATCC 31962). It is a water-soluble depsipeptide antibiotic containing eight amino acid residues and a C14-fatty acid moiety in the molecule. Although structurally unrelated, empedopeptin and vancomycin have similar antimicrobial spectra against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria including antibiotic-resistant strains. Empedopeptin is highly active in vivo in mice against systemic infections of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Empedopeptin is not absorbed orally.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of amniotic fluid in South Indian women.
AB  - Samples of amniotic fluid obtained from 48 South Indian women in the third trimester of pregnancy were studied for antimicrobial activity. The growth of Staphylococcus albus, Candida albicans and Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by nearly all samples studied while the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by 50%, 42% and 18% of samples respectively. The growth of Streptococcus faecalis was not inhibited. Using radial immunodiffusion, IgG was measurable in all 10 samples studied (mean 23 mg/dl), whereas IgA was measurable in only three of these samples (mean 1.32 mg/dl). However, while specific IgA against C. albicans was detected by indirect immunofluorescence in 93% of samples, specific IgG against C. albicans was detected in only 26% of samples (P less than 0.001). Amniotic fluid obtained from parous women had greater inhibitory activity against E. coli (P less than 0.05) than did the amniotic fluid obtained from nulliparae.
TI  - Fish egg polysialoglycoproteins: circular dichroism and proton nuclear magnetic resonance studies of novel oligosaccharide units containing one sialidase-resistant N-glycolylneuraminic acid residue in each molecule.
AB  - Long-core units having the common sequence Ga1NAc beta 1 leads to 4(NeuGc2 leads  to 3)Ga1NAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Ga1 beta 1 leads to 3Ga1NAc are one of the major constituents of rainbow trout egg polysialoglycoproteins. The existing ambiguity regarding the anomeric configuration of the sialidase-resistant unsubstituted sialyl group present in this novel type of oligosaccharide chains has been resolved by a circular dichroism difference spectral method. The fact that the negative band originating from the carbohydrate n leads to pi transition for this sialyl group was observed offers conclusive proof of the alpha-anomeric configuration. Next particularly interesting is the fact that the chemical shifts of the sialidase-resistant sialyl H-3eq and H-3ax protons were respectively found at relatively higher and lower magnetic field than for the corresponding protons of other sialyl groups. A consideration of molecular models shows that the observed anomalies are all in the directions compatible with expectations on the basis of the magnetic anisotropy effect due to the carboxylate group and steric compression effects by van der Walls interactions between groups that are sterically compressed. In addition to the observed resistance to bacterial sialidases of this sialyl group, it did not behave even as a competitive inhibitor of the sialidase, Arthrobacter ureafaciens, indicating that inaccessibility of this unique sialyl group toward the enzyme. Finally, the analysis of the proton nuclear magnetic resonances of sialidase-sensitive mono- and oligosialyl groups present in the long-core units was based on comparisons of diagnostically important regions in the spectra of homologous oligosaccharides of N-glycolylneuraminic acid.
TI  - Novel oligosaccharide chains on polysialoglycoproteins isolated from rainbow trout eggs. A unique carbohydrate sequence with a sialidase-resistant sialyl group, DGa1NAc beta 1 leads to 4(NeuGc2 leads to 3)DGa1NAc.
AB  - A series of novel carbohydrate chains all possessing a hitherto unknown trisaccharide unit, Ga1NAc beta 1 leads to 4-(NeuGc2 leads to 3)Ga1NAc beta 1 leads to, have been isolated from trout egg polysialoglycoproteins, a new class of glycoproteins, on alkali-borohydride treatment. On the basis of chemical (methylation, Smith degradation, and hydrazinolysis-nitrous deamination) and direct-probe mass spectrometric methods. deamination) and direct-probe mass spectrometric methods, the structures of a series of the first major type of oligosaccharide alditols having a sialidase-resistant N-glycolyneuraminic acid residue in each molecule were determined. The structures thus determined are novel and all possess a unique carbohydrate sequence (sialidase-resistant unsubstituted sialyl group italicized): Ga1NAc beta 1 leads to 4(NeuGc2 leads to 3)Ga1NAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to-4Gal beta 1 leads to 3[(leads to 8NeuGc alpha 2)n leads to 6]Ga1NAcol (n = 0 through 3).
TI  - The intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  - The fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. Bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. Conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. The frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. Twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. The organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was Bifidobacterium breve. Bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent Bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was never isolated in this study. Further, the counts and incidences of Clostridium paraputrificum, C. perfringens, and Bacillus subtilis, the counts of C. clostridiiforme, Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis, S. faecalis, and S. faecium and the incidences of C. difficile, C. tertium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
TI  - Cefamandole-erythromycin-heparin peritoneal irrigation: an adjunct to the surgical treatment of diffuse bacterial peritonitis.
AB  - The enthusiasm for the use of peritoneal irrigation has waxed and waned since its introduction by Dr. Pierce in 1905. The purpose of this study was to devise a relatively low-cost irrigant that could be used for continuous intraperitoneal lavage, with the intent of decreasing abscess formation following surgical treatment for generalized bacterial peritonitis. A solution of 1 L of normal saline containing 50 mg erythromycin, 50 mg cefamandole, 500 U heparin, and 5 mEq KCl was proven in in vitro studies to be bactericidal to Peptococcus anaerobius and Clostridium perfringens, and bacteriostatic to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis. In a prospective study 50 patients underwent peritoneal lavage with 36 L over 2 days. No lavage patients developed intraabdominal abscesses. In a control group of 44 patients seven patients (15.9%) developed postoperative abscesses.
TI  - Influence of diets low in protein or lysine on the cecal flora of rats with reference to cecal contents.
AB  - To determine the effect of a certain diet on the intestinal flora of rats, the cecal flora of rats fed a low protein or low lysine diet was examined. Total counts of bacteria in the cecal contents of rats given the four kinds of diet (a normal protein diet, a low protein diet, a normal lysine diet and a low lysine diet) were not significantly different. The counts of Streptococcus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Clostridium perfringens in the cecal contents from rats fed the low protein diet were significantly lower than those from rats fed the normal protein diet. The count of Lactobacillus in the cecal contents of the low protein group were significantly lower than those of the control. But no significant difference was found between the levels of most of the free amino acids in the cecal contents of the low lysine group and those of the control group.
TI  - Comparison of three methods for anaerobe identification.
AB  - In this study we evaluated the ability of three commercial methods, API 20A (Analytab Products, Plainview, N.Y.), Minitek (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.), and Anaerobe-Tek (Flow Laboratories, Inc., McLean, Va.), to accurately identify 165 recent clinical and 38 stock isolates of anaerobic bacteria without supplemental tests or gas-liquid chromatography. Strains included 89 Bacteroides spp., 12 fusobacteria, 10 gram-positive, nonsporing rods, 43 Clostridium spp., 15 Streptococcus intermedius, 18 peptococci, 6 peptostreptococci, 3 Staphylococcus saccharolyticus, and 7 Veillonella spp. The methods used were those of manufacturers, without supplemental tests. API 20A correctly identified 70.0% of strains to species and 6.4% to genus only, with 17.2% as part of a spectrum of identifications and 6.4% incorrect. Minitek, according to the current code book, yielded 69.5% correct identifications to species, 16.8% spectrum identifications, and 13.8% incorrect. Anaerobe-Tek correctly identified 64.0% of strains to species, 21.2% spectrum identifications, and 14.8% incorrect. Thirteen strains were misidentified by API 20A, 28 were misidentified by Minitek, and 30 were misidentified by Anaerobe-Tek. For laboratories without gas-liquid chromatography support and where identification of clinically significant Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens is desired, any of the three systems would provide accurate information. For more extensive anaerobe identification, including the less frequently isolated, more unusual organisms, API 20A and Minitek are preferred at this time. All systems have identification schemes associated with a percentage of misidentifications, the most recently introduced Anaerobe-Tek system being associated with the highest error rate.
TI  - Investigation of the survival characteristics of Rhodococcus coprophilus and certain fecal indicator bacteria.
AB  - Rhodococcus coprophilus and Clostridium perfringens survived in fresh water samples held at 5, 20, and 30 degrees C for over 17 weeks, whereas Escherichia coli and fecal streptococci disappeared after 5 weeks at all three temperatures. R. coprophilus survived for more than 8 months in sterilized sewage and deionized water at all three temperatures, whereas in normal sewage held at 20 degrees C, the survival time was 12 to 26 weeks. In samples held at 30 degrees C, survival times were shorter, probably because of interbacterial competition or protozoal predation. The results indicate that R. coprophilus may be a useful indicator of the presence of remote fecal pollution of farm animal origin, but not of recent pollution, when enumerated alone in polluted waters or wastewaters.
TI  - Teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - Teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and Gram-positive anaerobes (Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and Cl. difficile). Ninety per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of Staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. Vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. Multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. Teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for Str. faecalis. In mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. It was very effective in curing experimental mouse septicemias caused by Gram-positive bacteria (ED50 values less than 1 mg/kg).
TI  - Survival of cultured cells after functional and structural disorganization of plasma membrane by bacterial haemolysins and phospholipases.
AB  - Lesions were induced in the plasma membranes of cultured human fibroblasts by membrane damaging toxins of bacterial origin (haemolysins). Structural disorganization of the membrane was measured as leakage of a radiolabelled small cytoplasmic marker and functional membrane damage was measured as decreased uptake of aminoisobutyrate. Cell survival was scored 24 and 48 hr later by measuring uptake of Trypan Blue and by light microscopical evaluation of cell morphology and proliferation. The membrane damage induced by most bacterial toxins was reversible upon removal of the toxin, since toxin-treated cells recovered and excluded Trypan Blue although they had been permeable to the dye immediately after the toxin treatment. Among ten bacterial toxins tested, the only exception of this general behavior was the Aeromonas hydrophila beta-haemolysin, which irreversibly damaged human fibroblasts. Thus, the action of bacterial haemolysins on cultured cells generally seems restricted to a plasma membrane permeabilization, which is reversible regardless of the mechanism of membrane damaging action of the toxin or of the relative size of the structural lesions induced. Furthermore, the use of Trypan Blue uptake as a measure of cell death caused by membrane damaging agents appears to be of limited value.
TI  - Newcastle disease virus contains a linkage-specific glycoprotein sialidase. Application to the localization of sialic acid residues in N-linked oligosaccharides of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein.
AB  - Newcastle disease virus sialidase was found to exhibit strict specificity for hydrolysis of the NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal linkage contained in glycoprotein oligosaccharides both N-linked to asparagine and O-linked to threonine or serine under conditions that left oligosaccharides containing the NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 2 leads to 6Gal and NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6GallNAc linkages intact. This was determined, in part, by examining the viral sialidase for its ability to hydrolyze glycoprotein oligosaccharides derivatized with purified sialyltransferases to contain the [14C]NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal, [14C]NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6GalNAc, and [14C]NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal linkages. The viral sialidase was also tested for hydrolysis of the NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal and NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal linkages on the N-linked oligosaccharides of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Selective hydrolysis of the NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal linkage was shown by periodate oxidation and by 500-MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy of native and sialidase-treated glycopeptides. The NMR spectra, together with composition data, further indicated that the NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal and NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6Gal linkages were localized to specific branches of the major tri- and tetraantennary oligosaccharides of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. The results indicate that the Newcastle disease virus sialidase can initiate the selective degradation of N-linked oligosaccharide branches containing the NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal linkage.
TI  - Comparative effects of oral administration of trimethoprim/sulphadiazine or oxytetracycline on the faecal flora of horses.
AB  - A study was carried out on the bacteriological faecal flora of horses before and  after oral doses of oxytetracycline or trimethoprim plus sulphadiazine. Administration of oxytetracycline was rapidly followed by large increases in counts of coliforms. Bacteroides and Streptococcus species, the disappearance of Veillonella species, the appearance of Clostridium perfringens type A in large numbers and the accumulation of watery fluid in the rectal contents. These changes were not seen following administration of trimethoprim-sulphadiazine and it was concluded that oral treatment of horses with this combination was unlikely to be accompanied by the hazard of inducing colitis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of DL-8280, a new oxazine derivative.
AB  - DL-8280, 9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H- pyrido-(1,2,3-de)1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid, is a new nalidixic acid analog with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including obligate anaerobes. The activity of DL-8280 against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Clostridium perfringens was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and far exceeded that of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. DL-8280 had greater activity against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., and Bacteroides fragilis than did norfloxacin, pipemidic acid, and nalidixic acid. Nalidixic acid-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, ampicillin-resistant gonococci, and clindamycin-resistant obligate anaerobes were also susceptible to DL-8280. The activity of DL-8280 was affected very little by inoculum size, and its action was bactericidal at two times the minimal inhibitory concentrations at most. Administered orally to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, or P. aeruginosa, DL-8280 was 2 to 7 times more effective than norfloxacin and 7 to more than 50 times more active than pipemidic acid.
TI  - Water disinfection with the hydrogen peroxide-ascorbic acid-copper (II) system.
AB  - Treatment of secondary effluents with hydrogen peroxide (10 mg/liter)-ascorbic acid (10 mg/liter)-Cu2+ (0.5 mg/liter) for 60 min resulted in around 99% reduction of the initial plate count. Hydrogen peroxide could be replaced by other peroxygen compounds; ascorbic acid could be replaced by other reducing agents, of which sodium sulfite and ethanol were the most effective. Cu2+, however, could not be replaced by other metal ions without loss of bactericidal efficiency of the ternary combination. Enterobacteriaceae, total and fecal coliforms, staphylococci, and micrococci were reduced by 99.0 to 99.9%. Group D streptococci aerobic spores were reduced by 80 and 15%, respectively. Clostridium perfringens, yeasts, and molds were not killed by the disinfectant combinations. The effect of pH was only minor in the range from 6 to 7.5. At a higher pH value the bactericidal effects tended to decrease. The hydrogen peroxide-ascorbic acid-Cu2+ combination made it possible to obtain 99% reduction within 30 min. When using the hydrogen peroxide-sodium sulfite-Cu2+ or the hydrogen peroxide-ethanol-Cu2+ combinations, 60 min of contact time was necessary to obtain 99% reduction of the initial plate count. Cu2+ combined to an intermediate product of the ascorbic acid autoxidation is the toxic agent, and its penetration into the cell is promoted by hydrogen peroxide.
TI  - A comparison of the levels of faecal indicator bacteria in water and human faeces in a rural area of a tropical developing country (Sierra Leone).
AB  - The levels of faecal coliforms (FC), indole-positive FC (presumptive Escherichia  coli), faecal streptococci (FS), Streptococcus faecalis and Clostridium perfringens in the natural water sources used by 29 rural settlements in Sierra Leone were investigated. Levels of the same indicators in human faeces were also investigated. The incidence of Salmonella spp. in both habitats and the temperature, pH and conductivity of water sources were also recorded. All water sources were contaminated with the indicator bacteria, mean numbers of which occurred in the relationship FC greater than presumptive E. coli congruent to FS congruent to C. perfringens greater than S. faecalis. FC were also predominant in human faeces, the relationship of means being FC congruent to presumptive E. coli greater than FS greater S. faecalis greater than C. perfringens. The need for confirmation of FC counts obtained from water sources was indicated by the large number of positive tubes produced in the FC multiple-tube dilution test from some samples which could not be confirmed as presumptive E. coli. Salmonella spp. Were isolated from 13 water sources and 6% of faecal samples. Mean water temperature was high (26.2 degrees C), pH low (5.04) and conductivity low (34 microS cm-1). Presumptive E. coli was considered the most appropriate indicator of faecal pollution of the types of water investigated.
TI  - Gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  - Pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. We studied whether other gram-positive species (groups A and B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. Rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. In vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18% for the control). Infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. Thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate C5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. These alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.

TI  - The bacterial flora of neonates with congenital abnormalities of the gastro-intestinal tract.
AB  - The development of the bacterial flora of neonates with congenital abnormalities  of the gastro-intestinal tract was studied in 31 infants during the first 10 days of life. Specimens were collected from the umbilicus, mouth and gastro-intestinal tract on the pre-operative day, at operation and on post-operative days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. Bacteria were isolated semi-quantitatively on a variety of plain and selective media and identified by conventional methods.Staphylococcus albus was the predominant species isolated from the umbilicus; it was recovered from 24 of the 31 babies. The viridans group of streptococci and Streptococcus salivarius were the commonest species isolated from the mouth; there were no differences between the babies with different abnormalities and treatment with antibiotics had no effect on the bacterial flora. Ten babies were colonized by each species on the pre-operative day, and 25 and 19 respectively by the tenth post-operative day. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were the predominant oral anaerobes. Bacteria were not isolated from the rectal swabs of babies with tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TOF) or small bowel atresia on the pre-operative days. Post-operatively the predominant faecal isolates from babies with TOF were Str. faecalis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens. About 80% of the babies with small bowel atresia were colonized by Str. faecalis and Bacteroides vulgatus, 60% each by E. coli, Klebsiella aerogenes and Str. faecium. The five babies with necrotizing enterocolitis were colonized by Str. faecalis, E. coli, Cl. perfringens and Cl. difficile; Bacteroides spp. were not recovered from any of them. The commonest facultative species recovered from babies with large bowel obstruction were Str. faecalis and E. coli. B. vulgatus, Cl. perfringens and Bifidobacterium spp. were the commonest anaerobes and anaerobes outnumbered aerobes. No significant isolates were recovered from the wound swabs and none of the babies developed post-surgical sepsis.
TI  - Microbiological studies on hamburgers.
AB  - One hundred and eighty-two raw, 112 pre-cooked and 750 cooked hamburgers composed mainly of beef or beef and pork were subjected to microbiological examination.Raw hamburgers gave total bacterial counts from 10(6) to 10(8) per g, counts of Enterobacteriaceae from 10(4) to 10(6) per g, of Escherichia coli from 10(3) to 10(5), of group D streptococci from 10(2) to 10(4), of Staphylococcus aureus from 3 to 10(2) and of Clostridium perfringens less than 10 bacteria per g. Of the samples, 32% contained salmonellas; the highest most probable number was 10(2) per g but most estimates were below 1 per g. Corresponding figures for the pre-cooked samples were 2-3 log cycles lower, and only one sample contained salmonella. Yersinia enterocolitica was not isolated from any raw or pre-cooked sample.Three hundred and ninety-five of the cooked hamburgers were prepared by grilling raw hamburgers for between 2 and 5.5 min. These gave total bacterial counts from 10(5) to 10(7) per g, and counts of Enterobacteriaceae from 10(2) to 10(5) per g. Of the samples, 9.4% contained salmonellas, always in numbers below 1 per g. The remaining 355 cooked hamburgers were prepared from samples pre-cooked for 10 min at 80 degrees C. Some were grilled and some fat fried. The total bacterial counts were from 10(3) to 10(5) per g, and counts of Enterobacteriaceae below 10(2) per g. Salmonellae, again in small numbers only, were recovered from 3.5% of samples.When hamburgers were artificially contaminated with Salmonella typhimurium it took 5.5 min on a commercial grill, 2.25 min frying in a frying pan and 1.75 min on a household grill to reliably reduce the salmonella count one hundredfold. This means that at many vending places hamburgers are often cooked for too short a time.D-values were determined for S. typhimurium in hamburger meat at 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 degrees C, these values were 7.1, 5.1, 1.2, 0.9 and 0.6 min respectively. It can be concluded that the heating action in the centre of the hamburgers will take place more slowly than in the hamburger as a whole, and that the time between cooking and consumption is very important in reducing the microbial load to acceptable levels.Pre-cooking (10 min at 80 degrees C in a water bath) gives a reduction in the numbers of salmonella of about 4 x 10(3), after which cooking gives a further reduction as mentioned above.
TI  - Bacteriologic examination of equine fecal flora as a diagnostic tool for equine intestinal clostridiosis.
AB  - The fecal flora of 56 clinically healthy and 23 sick horses were examined bacteriologically for counts of Clostridium perfringens, molds, coliforms, alpha- and beta-hemolytic streptococci, and microbes belonging to genus Bacillus, as well as for the presence of Salmonella spp. Of the healthy horses, 85.7% had a C perfringens count less than 10(1) colony-forming units/g of feces. Of the healthy horses, lowest counts were found in race-horses. Of the sick horses, equine intestinal clostridiosis was diagnosed in 2 horses with large C perfringens counts (10(4) to 10(7) colony-forming units/g) and with acute diarrhea. The 7 isolates of C perfringens were identified as serotype A. Salmonella spp were not detected from any of the horses. The study indicated that diagnosing equine intestinal clostridiosis based on the determination of the fecal C perfringens count was suitable.
TI  - The CAMP test performed by using Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase (beta-haemolysin) and Clostridium perfringens lecithinase.
AB  - The CAMP test was performed by employing Staphylococcus aureus beta-haemolysin (sphingomyelinase) and Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin (lecithinase) for identification of group B streptococci on blood agar, using blood from different origin. Partial purification of Cl perfringens alpha-toxin was carried out by means of sheep erythrocytes. With the toxin preparations described positive CAMP reaction was obtained only on sheep blood agar. False positives with regard to group A streptococci could not be avoided by either of the methods.
TI  - [Comparison of antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime with other cephalosporins against clinically isolated bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - We examined the antibacterial activity of MX in comparison with those of other CEPs, using aerobic Gram-positive cocci, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria, 870 strains in total, all isolated from clinical specimens, in 1979 and 1980. Against Streptococcus, CMX showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMZ, CXM and CTM. Against H. influenzae, CMX also showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMX, CXM, CTM and CEZ. ABPC-and PIPC-resistant strains were sensitive to CMX. CTX, CPZ and CZX also showed antibacterial activities equivalent to that of CMX. Against enteric bacteria, E. coli, Klebsiella, E. cloacae, Serratia, C. freundii and Proteus, CMX showed superior antibacterial activity than those of CFX, CMZ, CXM, CTM and CEZ. Especially, against E. coli, Klebsiella, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri and P. inconstans, CMX showed strong antibacterial activity. As to non-fermentation bacteria, CMX's antibacterial activity was relatively weak except P. putrefaciens, Alcaligenes and Comamonas. However, it was superior than that of CEZ. In comparison with other CEPs, the strength of CMX varied according to the kinds of bacteria. As to anaerobic bacteria, CMX showed strong antibacterial activity against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium, C. perfringens, Veillonella and Fusobacterium. However, its antibacterial activity against Bacteroides was similar to those of other CEPs.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of ceftazidime (GR-20263) and other beta-lactamase  stable cephalosporins against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of ceftazidime was determined against 586 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria by an agar-dilution technique and compared with that of cefuroxime, moxalactam and cefoxitin. At 16 mg/l, only 60% of all isolates were inhibited by ceftazidime, compared to 79% by cefuroxime, 81% by moxalactam and 80% by cefoxitin. Ceftazidime was relatively inactive against Bacteroides fragilis group, Lactobacillus and Clostridium species other than Cl. perfringens. Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Cl. perfringens, microaerophilic streptococci and Propionibacterium were readily inhibited. Moxalactam was the most active agent against Bact. fragilis group, while cefuroxime was the most active agent against Streptococcus and Lactobacillus.
TI  - Salt extends the upper temperature limit for growth of food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - Inclusion of NaCl into the growth medium raised the upper temperature limit of growth of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Salmonella senftenberg, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes, C. perfringens (two strains). The magnitude of the response varied with the culture, the largest being 3.5 degrees with B. cereus cells. The spores of B. cereus were not protected by salt but clostridial spores behaved as the vegetative cells (response of 2.5 degrees). The optimal salt concentration for the protective effect varied with the organism ranging from 0.2 M for the Gram-negative organisms to 1.0 M for S. aureus.
TI  - Introduction and reisolation of selected gram-positive bacteria from fermented edible wastes.
AB  - A fermentation process using Lactobacillus acidophilus added to edible food wastes was evaluated for its bactericidal action on selected gram-positive organisms. The Lactobacillus fermentation converts food wastes into an animal feed ingredient. In this study, 5 gram-positive bacteria of zoonotic importance were individually tested. These organisms were: Group E Streptococcus, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, and Listeria monocytogenes. For each experiment, Lactobacillus was first mixed into ground waste; one of the test organisms was then inoculated and mixed. This mixture was divided among eight 5.5-L containers and incubated (duplicates) at 5 C, 10 C, 20 C, and 30 C for 96 hours. Internal waste temperature, reduction-oxidation, and pH were monitored. Waste samples were taken initially and at subsequent 24-hour periods. Qualitative and quantitative recoveries of the test bacteria were attempted for each sample. Group E Streptococcus was reisolated in increasing numbers at all temperatures throughout the fermentation period. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was recovered throughout the 96-hour period at 5 C; at 10 C it was recovered at 24 hours but not at 48 hours. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was killed by 24 hours at 20 C and 30 C fermentation temperatures. Clostridium perfringens survived the entire test period at 5 C, 10 C, and 20 C; it was killed by 72 hours at 30 C. Neither Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis nor Listeria monocytogenes was reisolated at any temperature at any time.

TI  - [Spontaneous peritonitis due to Clostridium perfringens in three patients with cirrhosis (author's transl)].
AB  - Three cases of spontaneous peritonitis due to Clostridium perfringens in cirrhotic patients with a fatal outcome are reported. The diagnosis was made clinically in two patients and by post-mortem examination in the third. One patient had elevated values of serum alpha-fetoprotein. These cases are compared with three other reported cases in the literature. Blood cultures were negative in the three patients, a fact that lends support to the theory of transmural migration of bacteria. In the authors' experience C. perfringens is the third most frequent agent responsible for spontaneous peritonitis in cirrhosis, preceded by E. coli and Streptococcus and followed by Klebsiella, a surprising fact given the scarce number of reported cases. Routine abdominal paracentesis is recommended in any cirrhotic patient with ascites, followed by appropriate antibiotic treatment whenever positive cultures are obtained. The efficacy of treatment is probably doubtful. The literature on antibiotic treatment of spontaneous peritonitis in cirrhosis is reviewed.
TI  - Some aspects of microbial contamination of hands of workers in food industries.
AB  - With regard to food hygiene, the question is posed whether carriers of pathogenic organisms, like Salmonella can contaminate a product by their hands. This might especially be possible in case of bad toilet hygiene. Experiments were carried out in 13 food and 3 non-food establishments. An inquiry was made into habits of toilet use and hand washing. The following microbiological examinations were performed on workers' hands: total colony-forming-units per hand, and the presence of Salmonella, E. coli, Enterobact., Staph. aureus, faecal Streptococci and Cl. perfringens. Approximately 42% of workers in the food industry and approximately 64% of workers in other industries seems to use the factory toilet regularly for defaecation. Because of the presence of contaminated raw materials in food industries, it is impossible to get direct proof that faecal contamination of the hands is due to toilet use. However, there is indirect evidence that contamination of workers' hands by raw materials, especially of animal origin, is of much more importance than the consequences of toilet use. This is shown by the occurrence of Salmonella on the hands (5-36% pos.) in only those factories where raw materials of animal origin are handled, by the low incidence of E. coli on the hands in food industries where "clean" materials (vegetables, biscuits, chocolate) are handled, and by the total absence of E. coli on the hands of workers in two non-food industries.
TI  - New presumptive identification test for Clostridium perfringens: reverse CAMP test.
AB  - The reverse CAMP test proved to be a highly sensitive test since 97.0% of all Clostridium perfringens cultures tested gave an easily discernible positive reaction.
TI  - Interaction of streptolysin O from Streptococcus pyogenes and theta-toxin from Clostridium perfringens with human fibroblasts.
AB  - The membrane-damaging properties on human diploid embryonic lung fibroblasts of streptolysin O (from Streptococcus pyogenes) and theta-toxin (from Clostridium perfringens) were compared. The results are consistent with the suggested mechanism for hemolysis by streptolysin O involving one fixation site and one lytic site of this cytolysin. However, the membrane-damaging activity of the two toxins differed with respect to (i) relative cytolytic activity on human diploid lung fibroblasts compared with that on sheep erythrocytes, (ii) binding to the fibroblast membrane, (iii) activity at 0 degrees C, (iv) membrane repair after more than 30 min, and (v) effect on influx of amino acids. It is concluded that the mechanism of membrane damage caused by theta-toxin differs from that of cytoplasmic membrane. These results question the current concept that all thiol-activated, cholesterol-inactivated bacterial toxins are similar both structurally and functionally.
TI  - Microbiology of the canine nasal cavities.
AB  - The anterior and superior regions of canine nares yielded two distinct microbial  populations consisting of 25 microbial species. Streptococci predominated in the anterior nose; clostridia and staphylococci were also quite prevalent. At least two distinct microorgranisms were cultured from most anterior sites. In contrast, sterile conditions prevailed in the superior nasal regions of at least 50% of the ninety-two animals. Various Bacillus sp. were recovered from the remainder.
TI  - Evaluation of a clostridial alpha-toxin disk test for rapid presumptive identification of group B streptococci.
AB  - An alpha-toxin disk test is described in which group B streptococci completed the hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes partially lysed by the alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens. The test was performed satisfactorily on the sheep blood agar primary isolation plate, as well as on pure cultures. A total of 95% of strains of pure group B streptococci tested produced positive reactions within 5 h, and all were positive after overnight incubation, with patterns of synergistic hemolysis readily distinguishable from those seen with group A streptococci. The preparation of disks is well within the scope of most clinical laboratories.
TI  - Acute gastric dilatation in monkeys: a microbiologic study of gastric contents, blood and feed.
AB  - Twenty-one of 24 simian primates with acute gastric dilatation had Clostridium perfringens in their gastric contents. Only 2 of 18 normal animals contained this organism in their gastric contents. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from monkey biscuits taken from the cages of five affected animals and from five of 11 incoming lots of feed. After these biscuits were fed to normal animals, this organism could be isolated from the gastric contents. There were no other organisms isolated which could account for the voluminous gas production in this condition.
TI  - Synergistic haemolysis test for presumptive identification and differentiation of Clostridium perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. sordellii, and C. paraperfringens.
AB  - A new test for the presumptive identification of Clostridium perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. sordellii, and C. paraperfringens is described. The test is based on the synergistic haemolysis shown by the clostridia and group B streptococci on sheep and human and CaCl2-supplemented human blood agar. C. perfringens gave crescent-shaped synergistic lytic zones (7 to over 20 mm in length), and C. paraperfringens usually small-sized (3 mm), bullet-shaped reactions on all three types of media. C. bifermentans showed a horseshoe-shaped synergistic reaction only on human blood containing media, and C. sordellii only on CaCl2-supplemented human blood agar. C. perfringens type A antiserum inhibited synergistic lytic activities of the four species. The test provided a reliable method for presumptive identification and differentiation of the four clostridial species and may obviate the need for the Nagler test.

AB  - The effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Clostridium indolis, C. paraputrificum, C. perfringens, C. innocuum, C. nexile, C. ramosum, C. clostridiiforme, Bacteroides multiacidus, Bacteroides fragilis, Veillonella alcalescens, V. parvula, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). The average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with E. coli, S. faecalis, and C. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). In contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with E. coli, S. faecalis, L. acidophilus, C. perfringens, and Bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from that in germfree animals (0.5). The present study demonstrated that the presence of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - LY127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. The lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)s) of LY127935 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. The MIC(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. The MIC(90)s for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. The MIC(90)s for anaerobes ranged from 2 to >32 mug/ml. As determined by MIC(90)s, LY127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. In a population of multidrug-resistant isolates, concentrations of 8 mug or less of LY127935 per ml inhibited 82% of Enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of Enterobacteriaceae and 40% of P. aeruginosa. Increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of LY127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some Enterobacteriaceae. All four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. The broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of LY127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.

TI  - Survival of anaerobic bacteria in common laboratory diluents.
AB  - The survival of six species of anaerobic bacteria was studied in simple or commercially available diluents. Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed excellent survival in all diluents including distilled water. Fusobacterium mortiferum survived well in all diluents except water and water supplemented with 0.1% gelatain. Clostridium perfringens survived best in phosphate-buffered saline with gelatin. Peptococcus asaccharolyticus required gelatin added to the basic diluent, and Streptococcus intermedius showed excellent survival only in minimal essential medium with gelatin. These diluents could provide effective and economical alternatives to more complex and costly diluents often used in work with anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  - A cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. It operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. Shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through a short orifice. If the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. The disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by Stansted Fluid Power Limited, Stansted, England. Phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including Chlorella, Aspergillus fumigatis, Fusarium sp., Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus zooepidermicus and Staphylococcus aureus. The cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. The applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. The case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. Furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.

TI  - [First steps in the bacterial colonization of the digestive tract of neonates (author's transl)].
AB  - Meconium samples obtained from 14 children aged 18 to 51 h were subjected to a quantitative differential analysis. The meconium of one of the children (47 h old) was sterile; in those of the 11 infants aged less than 47 h the dominant flora was composed of either enterobacteria, mainly Escherichia coli sensitive to usual antibiotics, or of streptococci. The genus Acinetobacter constituted the dominant flora in one case only. Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Clostridium (C. perfringens), Bacteroides, Peptococcus, when present in the meconium, represented a very small proportion of the total flora. In the two children aged 48 h and more, the flora was more complex and Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Veillonella, Peptostreptococcus, Clostridium and Staphylococcus were associated to streptococci and enterobacteria. A very small number of lactobacilli was found in one child only. No yeasts were detected. The sequence of establishment of the various bacteria was studied in a child (OG) by an analysis of 8 samples obtained between 0 and 74 h after its birth. E. coli and Streptococcus became established 24 h after parturition, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides the 2nd and 3rd day, respectively. Lactobacillus and Peptococcus were only present in very low number in the first 2 meconium samples and did not become established in the child, although they were present in a rather large number in the vaginal and faecal samples from the mother. In addition, use of axenic mice inoculated with the 3rd meconium from the infant OG revealed the existence of certain genera of bacteria probably of faecal origin which had not been detected by the direct analysis of the meconium. These genera did not become established in the child. The hypothesis according to which the meconium chooses among the fortuitous contaminations before true colonization of the digestive tract is established, is discussed. It was also observed that the evolution of the ratio between the number of E. coli and Proteus morganii in the successive samples obtained from OG was very different from that observed in the mice inoculated with these samples.

TI  - Pathogenesis of mucosal injury in the blind loop syndrome.
AB  - Bacterial extracts were prepared from cultures originating in chronic self-filling intestinal blind loops in rats. Their ability to remove active maltase molecules from isolated brush border membranes was studied in vitro. Twelve strains in 51 tested, belonging to one of three species, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Streptococcus fecalis, possessed maltase-releasing activity. The ability to remove maltase correlated well with the ability to hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-l-alaninate (NBA), an ester substrate rapidly hydrolyzed by elastase, but not with substrated favored by tryhsin and chymotrypsin. Maltase-releasing activity from C. perfringens was strongly inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor and to a lesser extent by lima bean trypsin inhibitor. Of four chloromethylketone active-site directed inhibitors tested with specificities for elastase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, inhibition was maximal with elastase-specific inhibitors. In two species, activity was shown to be heat sensitive, and to be inhibited by concentration of the extract. In one species maltase-releasing activity was shown to be due to an enzyme of molecular weight at least 66,000 with the capacity to remove lactase, sucrase, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as maltase. The results indicate that anaerobic or facultatively anaerobic species, previously identified with the pathology of of the blind loop syndrome, contain proteases which are capable of removing components of the intestinal surface membrane. These proteases appear to have elastase-like substrate specificity and may be involved in the etiology of disaccharidase deficiency in bacterial overgrowth syndromes.
TI  - Synergistic hemolysis phenomenon shown by an alpha-toxin-producing Clostridium perfingens and streptococcal CAMP factor in presumptive streptococcal grouping.
AB  - A new phenomenon of synergistic hemolysis by Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin  and the streptococcal CAMP factor on human and guinea pig erythrocytes is described. A possible mode of action of the CAMP factors is suggested. On human blood agar all of the tested isolates of group B streptococci gave an arrowhead-shaped zone of hemolysis; 74% of group A gave a crescent-shaped lytic zone, whereas all isolates of groups C and G and the remaining 26% of group A streptococci gave a bullet-shaped lytic zone. By comparison, in the CAMP test incubated aerobically and anaerobically, 70 and 91%, respectively, of streptococci other than group B gave positive, arrowhead-shaped lytic zones. If all intermediate positive reactions in the CAMP tests were read as negative after aerobic incubation, only 89% of group B streptococci would be properly identified. The synergistic hemolysis phenomenon, using an alpha-toxin-producing C. perfringens and human blood agar, provided a reliable test for presumptive identification of group B streptococci, with promising potential to differentiate in the same test group A streptococci from other groups.
TI  - Sialyl- and fucosyltransferases in the biosynthesis of asparaginyl-linked oligosaccharides in glycoproteins. Mutually exclusive glycosylation by beta-galactoside alpha2 goes to 6 sialyltransferase and N-acetylglucosaminide alpha1 goes to 3 fucosyltransferase.
AB  
TI  - Synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - Sheep and human erythrocytes, partially processed by Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium perfringens, were susceptible to lysis in the presence of Propionibacterium acnes. P. acnes liberated a lipase that was detected on Tween 80 agar and also on phospholipase C-precipitated egg yolk agar. Such a lipase might have contributed in the process of an intensified cellular lysis. Similar reactions were attempted with Lactobacillus acidophilus, known to possess a nondiffusible lipase, and failed to produce any such reactions. The synergistic reactions, between P. acnes and C. perfringens, were compared with The classical CAMP reaction in an attempt to find a correlation with the established membrane composition of the erythrocytes involved. Synergistic reactions observed do seem to reflect the membrane composition. Such findings, besides being contributory to an understanding of the role of these organisms in the process of pathogenesis, are of importance in the elucidation of molecular organization of biomembranes. Detailed studies, involving a large number of representative anaerobic bacteria, may also help provide an avenue in anaerobic species identification.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of new 2-nitroimidazole derivatives.
AB  - In an earlier paper we described the synthesis and the antitrichomonas activity of 2-nitro-alpha,alpha,1-trimethyl-1H-imidazole-5-methanol (2). Starting from this compound, several derivatives have been synthesized. Among these, the phenyl carbonate 8 has been shown to possess activity equal to that of 2 and to be less toxic. This compound therefore is interesting in comparison with some antitrichomonas agents currently in use clinically. Before undertaking an in-depth investigation, compound 8 was subjected to some studies to see whether it has any effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Preliminary results show that, at therapeutic doses, it might induce unwanted CNS effects to a lesser degree than metronidazole.
TI  - Post-menopausal vaginitis.
AB  - The organisms cultured from the vaginal swabs of 383 women over 50 years old with vaginal discharge were compared with those from 148 normal women of similar age attending a cytology clinic. The only significant difference was that yeasts were found in 20% and 6% of the two groups of women, respectively. It is therefore concluded that in post-menopausal women with vaginal discharge, the main microbiological requirement is for the diagnosis and treatment of yeast infection.
TI  - Monensin, Eimeria tenella infection, and effects on the bacterial populations in  the ceca of gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  - Bacteria-free chicks in separate plastic film isolators were inoculated orally with single species of bacteria. Within an isolator, half the birds were fed unmedicated feed and half received feed containing 100 ppm monensin. With clostridium perfringens as the established species of monoflora, bacterial counts from the duodenum were 10(4) times lower and counts from the ceca were three times lower in monensin-fed birds compared to unmedicated birds. Infection with Eimeria tenella stimulated an eight-fold increase in the numbers of C. perfringens in the ceca of unmedicated birds but no increase in monensin-fed birds. With Bacteroides sp. or Streptococcus faecalis as monoflora, there was no difference in the cecal or duodenal populations between medicated and unmedicated birds uninfected with coccidia. In contrast to C. perfringens, populations of Bacteroides sp. and S. faecalis in the ceca decreased five to 100-fold in both medicated and unmedicated chicks after infection with E. tenella. Duodenal populations of C. perfringens, Bacteroides sp., and S. faecalis were unaffected by the coccidial infection.
TI  - Qualitative study of paradoxical zone phenomenon of penicillins against 17 bacterial species of clinical importance.
AB  - Using a triple agar layer technique and enzymatic inactivation of penicillin, the occurrence of a paradoxical zone phenomenon (illustrated by a typical 'target' image around the reservoir of antibiotic) was determined for several bacterial species specially chosen with regards to their taxonomic position, clinical importance and penicillin susceptibility. Among gram-positive bacteria, a paradoxical zone was obtained for approximately 43% of the strains studied here (all 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, all 10 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 7 of 10 strains of group B beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 of 10 group A strains, 3 of 10 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 3 of 10 strains of Clostridium perfringens but for none of 10 strains each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes). Among gram-negative bacteria, a target image was regularly obtained with Haemophilus influenzae (all 10 strains tested) and Proteus species (9 of 10 strains) but with none of the following species: Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and Bacteroides fragilis. Therapeutic implications of these observations are difficult to assess, and need further investigation.
TI  - Fecal microbial flora in Seventh Day Adventist populations and control subjects.
AB  - A comparison of 13 vegetarian Seventh Day Adventists with 14 nonvegetarian Adventists revealed relatively few statistically significant differences in fecal flora. A separate study involved a comparison of vegetarian Adventists (49 subjects), nonvegetarian Adventists (45), and non-Adventists on a conventional American diet (31) re: the incidence of the C. paraputrificum group in the fecal flora. The Adventist groups had significantly fewer C. septicum and C. tertium isolates than the non-Adventists. Reference to earlier diet studies done by our group revealed certain striking differences. Fusobacterium and C. perfringens counts were very low and lactobacillus counts very high in Adventists as compared with Japanese-Americans on either a Japanese or Western diet or Caucasian individuals on a conventional U.S. diet. Comparison of nonvegetarian Adventists with the other groups on a nonvegetarian Western diet also revealed several statistically significant differences. Finally, there were a number of significant differences in fecal flora when high risk groups (Japanese-Americans on Western diet and Caucasians on conventional U.S. diet) were compared with low risk groups (Japanese-Americans on a Japanese diet and Adventists).
TI  - Bacteriology of the human biliary tract and the duodenum.
AB  - Using the modern anaerobic transport media and meticulous culture techniques, 74  patients undergoing biliary tract surgery were studied. The biliary system was found to be sterile in 58 patients (78%). Fifteen patients had 35 isolates of aerobic and facultative bacteria. The most common ones were Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Escherichia coli. The only anaerobe isolated was Clostridium perfringens. Eight of 17 patients (47%) with acute cholecystitis and five of 49 patients (10%) with chronic cholecystitis, harbored bacteria in the biliary system. This study suggests that anaerobes are rare in the human biliary system; therefore, if antibiotic therapy is considered, aerobic coverage should suffice.
TI  - [Fecal flora of man. V. communication: The fluctuation of the fecal flora of the  healthy adult (author's transl)].
AB  - Seven fecal specimens from each of healthy persons, aged 25 to 42 years, during the period of 2 months were analyzed to obtain the knowledge on the day-to-day variation in the same person and the person-to-person variation. Irrespective of individuals, bacteroidaceae, catenabacteria (eubacteria and strict anaerobic lactobacilli), peptostreptococci (anaerobic gram positive cocci) and bifidobacteria constituted the predominant flora. Spirillaceae, megasphaerae and clostridia (except Cl. perfringens) were also found as predominant flora in specific individuals. In all cases, enterobacteria and streptococci constitute the accompanying flora. In addition, veillonallae and lactobacilli were found as predominant flora in most cases. The remaining flora, consisting of Cl. perfringens, staphylococci and yeast, occurred occasionally in low numbers. With regard to the composition of the fecal flora of each person, a great individual variation was recognized and confirmed statistically. Each person had a characteristic fecal flora. In the same person, the numbers of bacteria of the predominating flora were over a 2 months period relatively constant. On the other hand, a great day-to-day variation in the numbers of bacteria of the accompanying flora as well as the remaining flora was demonstrated.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of some vinyl-substituted 2-nitroimidazoles.
AB  - In previous studies 1-methyl-2-nitro-1H-imidazole-5-carboxaldehyde and 1-methyl-2-nitro-5-vinyl-1H-imidazole were found to posses interesting antimicrobial activities. We have now prepared some 2-nitro-1H-imidazoles in which the 5-vinyl chain bears selected functional groups (CHO, COCH3, NO2) as well as nitrogen-condensation derivatives of the carbonyl functions. Furthermore, 5-methyl-2-nitro-1-vinyl-1H-imidazole has been synthesized. All the compounds, and some intermediates, have been assayed for antimicrobial activity. Several of them exhibited significant antibacterial and antitrichomonal activity in mice.
TI  - Gas gangrene and related infection: classification, clinical features and aetiology, management and mortality. A report of 88 cases.
AB  - The clinical features of gas gangrene and related infection seen in 88 patients over a 10-year period are described. It is suggested that clostridial infection could be simply classified as either 'gas-forming' or 'non-gas-forming'. The gas-forming group represents the more severe form of infection. Non-clostridial gas gangrene may present in a variety of forms. The anaerobic streptococcus was the organism most frequently responsible, but these cases were indistinguishable from clostridial infection on clinical grounds. The treatment of gas gangrene in this series of patients is reported. Emphasis is laid on the importance of adequate prophylaxis with penicillin in patients at risk. The value of antibiotics in established infection remains equivocal. The evidence supporting the value of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is assessed and an attempt made to quantify the response to this treatment. Benefit was apparent in only a proportion of patients. A favourable response indicated clostridial infection and guaranteed immediate survival. Extensive debridement or amputation is unnecessary in this group. No response following hyperbaric oxygen therapy indicated widespread mixed clostridial and non-clostridial infection, or infection due to organisms other than clostridia. Urgent and extensive debridement and amputation remain the predominant measures in this group.
TI  - Synergistic bacterial gangrene following abdominal hysterectomy.
AB  - A case of synergistic bacterial gangrene occurring after abdominal hysterectomy in a 43-year-old patient is presented. After multiple debridement procedures and porcine grafts, the patient responded satisfactorily and eventually recovered.
TI  - Single-dose peroperative antibiotic prophylaxis in gastrointestinal surgery.
AB  - A single intravenous dose of tobramycin and lincomycin, given at the start of gastrointestinal operations, significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative wound infection from 34% to 5%. The occurrence of both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria was reduced. Therapeutic concentrations of the antibiotics were maintained throughout the operative period in most cases. No toxic effects of the antibiotics were detected, no anaesthetic complication occurred, and resistant strains of bacteria normally sensitive to the antibiotics were not isolated from wounds.
TI  - Bifidobacteria in the intestinal tract of infants: an in-vivo study.
AB  - Weekly faecal specimens from 18 babies were examined during the first 8 weeks of  life. Eight infants were breast fed, ten were bottle-fed. All suckling infants received supplementary feeds for the first 8 days. A buffer consisting of acetic acid and acetate was demonstrated in the faeces of all the breast-fed infants at some time during the period of examination. This buffer was rarely detected during the 1st week of life when supplementary feeds were given, and buffer already present gradually disappeared with the introduction of mixed feeding. In contrast, at no time was an acetate buffer demonstrated in the faeces of bottle-fed infants. Babies receiving breast milk produced faeces with low pH, high counts of saccharolytic organisms including bifidobacteria and Streptococcus faecium, and low counts of Escherichia coli, bacteroides and clostridia. Bottle-fed infants on the other hand produced faeces with a high pH and high counts of E. coli and putrefactive bacteria, but with low counts of bifidobacteria.
TI  - Studies on the relationship between intestinal flora and cecal coccidiosis in chicken.
AB  - The bacteriological and histopathological changes in the ceca of young chickens after being infected with sporulated oocysts of Eimeria tenella were investigated. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria showed remarkable decrease in number on the 5th day after infection, when shizont and gametocyate came to appear, and destruction of mucosa along with severe haemorrhaging was noticed. Other predominant bacteria like bacteroidaceae, catenabacteria and peptostreptococci showed only moderate and temporal decrease in number during the infection. Clostridium perfringens prolifereated after the 5th day post infection following the decline of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Proliferation of clostridia was so intense that the number was almost million times greater than that of the uninfected chicken at its peak on the 7th day after infection. Enterobacteria also showed a moderate but persistent increase in number. Most bacteria came to the normal population on the 10th day after infection. As for lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, clostridia and enterobacteria, the disturbances were still noticeable on the 17th day after injection. Antagonism between proliferated bacteria (clostridia and enterobacteria) and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) whose intensity is suppose to be related to the cecal mucosa is suggested during cecal coccidiosis in chickens.
TI  - Bacteria in hip surgery. A study of routine aerobic and anaerobic cultivation from skin and closed suction wound drains.
AB  - One hundred and seven patients with closed suction wound drains after hip surgery were investigated with regard to bacteria in the drain. In one-third of the cases bacterial contamination of the wound was found. In more than half the total number of cases the bacteria in the wound were not identical with those found on the skin, either pre- or post-operatively. Anaerobe bacteria occurred only in one case. Penicillin administration considerably reduced the frequency of positive cultures. These findings support the prophylactic use of antibiotics in the prevention of late infections in endoprosthesis operations even when the early infection rate is satisfactorily low.
TI  - Evolution of the digestive microflora in a unit of specified-pathogen-free mice:  efficiency of the barrier.
AB  - RhoIco strain], barrier-maintained since 1970, is described. Some "contaminants"  appeared spontaneously during the period 1971-1973, but microorganisms belonging to the genera Lactobacillus Streptococcus, Enterobacteria, Escherichia and Bacillus remained stable. The methods of investigation used were not suitable for the assessment of strictly anaerobic strains. The stability of the digestive microflora durine the last 2 years of this study is believed to be related to the skill and conscientiousness of the technicians responsible for the daily care of these mice.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic flora in bladder urine of patients with indwelling urethral catheters.
AB  - Twenty-five bladder urine specimens from 13 patients with long-standing indwelling catheters were obtained by percutaneous suprapubic needle aspiration to avoid contamination by extraneous flora and cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Twenty different species of organism were isolated from twenty-four positive specimens. The isolates were predominantly gram-negative aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacilli, with occasional gram-positive aerobic cocci and yeasts. One patient had Clostridium perfringens and a Bifidobacterium and another had Veillonella and two species of Bifidobacterium. Both patients had four concomitant aerobic or facultative bacteria present. Anaerobic bacteria may therefore be found in the bladder urine of some patients with indwelling urethral catheters, but their role in the initiation and perpetuation of urinary tract infection in this setting remains unclear.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose.
AB  - It has been demonstrated that oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly and markedly reduces the bacterial census of ten different strains of common pathogens when exposed to them in vitro. This was not true of two other hemostatic agents tested, namely, absorbable gelatin sponge and topical thrombin. Wounds in guinea pigs in which oxidized regenerated cellulose was placed and infected with one of three pathogens had healing per primum in 39 of 40 instances. In similar control wounds and incisions in which absorbable gelatin sponge was placed, sepsis of the wound developed in 19 of 20 of the control group and in 39 of 40 guinea pigs in the absorbable gelatin sponge group.
TI  - Competitive inhibition of transformation in group H Streptococcus strain Challis  by heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  - Glucosylated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from phages T4 and T6 competes poorly with homologous DNA causing only a slight decrease of transformation in Group H Streptococcus strain Challis. Other types of heterologous DNAs (Micrococcus luteus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, calf thymus and non-glucosylated phage T6 DNA), in contrast to glucosylated T4 and T6 DNAs, compete with transforming DNA to the normal, high extent. These results indicate that as in transformation of Bacillus subtilis, the presence of glucose attached to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in phage T6 DNA considerably decreases the interaction of such DNA with competent cells of the Challis strain. It also indicates that the guanine plus cytosine content of DNA is not decisive in determining its interaction with competent cells.
TI  - Hematological findings in acute infections and septicemias.
AB  - This paper is a report on twelve cases of septicemia, the diagnosis made possible by medical technologists observing the degenerative morphological findings in the peripheral blood smears. This led to the finding of microorganisms, prior to the bacteriological confirmation, in an active emergency department. It also includes four case reports in which the organism was identified: a meningococcus, a pneumonococcus, an Escherichia coli, and a clostridium perfringens (welchii).
TI  - [Kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  - We have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "L.N.", reared in a plastic isolator. Eight bacterial strains were studied. Seven had been fortuitously introduced: Acinetobacter lwoffi LN1, Staphylococcus epidermidis LN2, Clostridium perfringens LN3, Plectridium anatum LN4, Streptococcus bovis LN5, Enterobacter cloacae LN6, Corynebacterium sp LN7. The eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. This strain is Bacillus licheniformis FD1. The gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child L.N. In addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of B. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. Conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
TI  - [Comparative study of neuraminidases from "Diplococcus pneumoniae" and "Clostridium perfringens"].
AB  - Neuraminidases have been purified from the culture medium of two microorganisms,  one aerobic, Diplococcus neumoniae, the other anaerobic, Clostridium perfringens. The enzymatic properties of the 2 neuraminidases have been studied (pH optimum; effect of cations; activity toward different substrates: neuraminyllactose, dilactaminyllacto-N-tetraose, gangliosides, alpha1-acid glycoprotein, Collocalia glycoprotein, ovine submaxillary mucin, porcin intestinal and human bronchial mucins).

TI  - Competitive effects of intestinal microflora on Vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The coexistence of Vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. The bacteria tested included a Bacteroides sp, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens type A, 2 separate isolates of Escherichia coli, 2 different Lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus faecalis. Each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. No single strain or species was found that would eliminate V cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. Not until a combination of E coli, P mirabilis, and S faecalis was present in the mice did V cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.
TI  - Evaluation of bacteriological transport systems.
AB  - Seven commercially manufactured bacteriological transport systems, including Culturette, Trans-Cul (with Stuart and Amies), Handiswab, Securline (with Amies and Amies without charcoal) and Culture Caddy, were evaluated to determine whether these systems were capable of maintaining the viability and constant numbers of mixtures of hardy, fastidious and anaerobic organisms over 72 hours at 25C and 4C. The results of the study indicated that if specimens are maintained in transport systems at 25C they should be cultured at four hours to minimize loss of viability and to assure accurate quantitation. No one transport system excelled over the other for maintenance of cultures at room temperature. Most organisms survived well in all of the transport systems for 72 hours when refrigerated.
TI  - Survival of human enteric and other sewage microorganisms under simulated deep-sea conditions.
AB  - The survival of pure cultures of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus under simulated deep-sea conditions of low temperature (4 C), seawater, and hydrostatic pressures ranging from 1 to 1,000 atm was determined over a period exceeding 300 h. The viability of E. coli and total aerobic bacteria in seawater-diluted raw sewage subjected to these deep-sea conditions was also measured. There was a greater survival of both E. coli and S. faecalis at 250 and 500 atm than at 1 atm at 4 C. S. faecalis was quite insensitive to 1,000 atm, whereas with E. coli there was a 10-fold die-off per 50-h exposure to 1,000 atm. In contrast, V. parahaemolyticus and C. perfringens were quite sensitive to pressures exceeding 250 atm, and with both of these species there was a total loss of viability of approximately 10(8) cells per ml within 100 h at 1,000 arm and within 200 h at 500 atm. The viability of the naturally occurring fecal coliforms in sewage exposed to moderate pressures at 4 C was found to be similar to the survival patterns demonstrated with pure cultures of E. coli. The total numbers of aerobic bacteria in these sewage samples, however, stabilized at 500 and 1,000 atm after 100 h, and at 1 and 250 atm there was significant growth of sewage-associated bacteria, which apparently utilized the organic compounds in the seawater-diluted sewage samples. A preliminary classification of some of these bacteria indicated that approximately 90% (160 isolates) of the organisms that survived over a 400-h exposure to 500 and 1,000 atm were Arthrobacter/Corynebacterium species, and the representative organisms capable of growing at 1 and 250 atm in seawater at 4 C were gram-positive cellulose digesters and an unidentified gram-negative coccus. The significance of these results with respect to the contamination of the deep ocean with human pathogens and the possibility of sewage-associated microorganisms growing and competing with indigenous marine microbial flora in situ is discussed.
TI  - Sensitive assay for detection of toxin-induced damage to the cytoplasmic membrane of human diploid fibroblasts.
AB  - A sensitive assay was developed for detection and quantitation of subtle permeability changes in the cytoplasmic membrane of human diploid fibroblasts. Release of the non-metabolizable amino acid [1-14C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB; molecular weight (103) from the cytoplasm of prelabeled cells was used as an indicator of toxin-induced membrane damage. An optimal procedure for labeling these cells was designed after varying the conditions with regard to pH, temperature, concentration of AIB, composition of medium, and incubation time. Toxin-induced release of AIB was compared with release of a previously described nucleotide label, [3H]uridine. Melittin from bee venom and the polyene antibiotics filipin and amphotericin B in low concentrations induced a strikingly greater release of AIB than of nucleotide label. The sensitivity of this assay was furthermore demonstrated by treatment with the following bacterial cytolysins: phospholipase C and theta-toxin from Clostridium perfringens, alpha-, beta-, delta-, and gamma-toxins from Staphylococcus aureus, and streptolysin S from Streptococcus pyogenes. In spite of their different modes of action, all these membrane-active toxins at low concentrations induced a significant release of AIB label. For an equal release of nucleotide label, several times higher concentrations were required.

AB  - Postoperative infections after osteosynthesis belong to the most serious complications in traumatology. Efforts to prevent this danger by routine antibiotic prophylaxis are mainly rejected nowadays. Instead, it is studies whether infections can be diagnosed by bacteriological culture of secretions from Redon drains in patients with osteosynthesis for the purpose of starting an early specific antibiotic therapy. Bacteria were cultured from secretions of wounds in 11.3% of samples from 177 patients. Staph. aureus was found most frequently and was responsible for most of the postoperative infections (Tab. 1).

TI  - The quantitative bacteriology of some commercial bivalve shellfish entering British markets.
AB  - Incidents of non-specific illness associated with the consumption of oysters have highlighted the lack of published information on the bacteriology of shellfish suitable for consumption. Investigations showed that the majority of molluscan shellfish entering English markets conform to the accepted standard of less than 5 Escherichia coli/ml. tissue. The numbers of E. coli were related to the sanitary quality of the growing area but no relation could be established between numbers of E. coli and coliforms, faecal streptococci or Clostridium welchii. The numbers of non-specific bacteria varied considerably but shellfish from sources associated with non-specific illness yielded relatively high counts at 37 degrees C. The results showed that there was no justification for a standard based on total plate counts, which often exceeded 10(6)/g. Such a standard would have to be coupled with spoilage or the incidence of non-specific illness. The relation between the numbers of non-specific bacteria growing at 20 and 37 degrees C. appears to be a useful measure for assessing the likelihood that raw shellfish are a public health risk.

TI  - Isolation of Clostridium in human infections: evaluation of 114 cases.
AB  - One hundred fifty-two strains of Clostridium were isolated from 144 patients over a 14-month-peroid. These included 23 recognized species and 23 strains that were unclassified. Soft tissues or abscesses yielded 84 strains of Clostridium. Intraabdominal sites predominated, but clostridia were recovered from empyema, carcinoma, frostbite with gas gangrene, muscle abscess, aortic graft, and brain abscess. Blood cultures yielded 65 strains of Clostridium from 49 patients, representing 0.3% of 16,314 blood cultures (or 2.6% of 2,168 positive cultures). Clostridium perfringens was most common in blood, accounting for 37 isolates (57%). Clostridial bacteremia was often unrelated to the clinical setting and was found in alcoholics with aspiration or Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, meningococcemia, and infantile gastroenteritis. In 20 of the 49 patients (41%), aerobic or other anaerobic bacteria were cultured concurrently from the blood. Thus, clostridial bacteremia should be interpreted with caution since there may be little correlation with the patient's clinical condition.

TI  - Grain overload in cattle and sheep: changes in microbial populations in the cecum and rumen.
AB  - Samples from the rumen and cecum of cattle and sheep were cultured to determine changes in microbial populations resulting from overfeeding with grain. Before the animals were overfed, the predominant organisms from both sides were those that grew anaerobically on a relatively nonselective ruminal fluid medium and would not grow on selective mediums designed to culture lactobacilli, streptococci, coliforms, or Clostridium perfringens. By 24 hours after overfeeding, lactic acid bacteria had increased in numbers so that they were the most numerous organisms in both the rumen and the cecum. The concentrations of coliforms and C perfringens also increased after overfeeding and were generally higher in the cecum than in the rumen.

AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  - Inhibition of enzymes by human salivary immunoglobulin A.
AB  - Human whole saliva inhibited bacterial neuraminidases and the inhibition was found to reside in the salivary IgA fraction. Further, salivary immunoglobulin (Ig)A inhibited various bacterial enzymes and toxins: neuraminidases from Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Clostridium perfringens, hyaluronidase and chondroitin sulfatase from oral bacteria, diphtheria toxin, and streptolysin O. The inhibitory activity of salivary IgA did not correlate with that of serum on the basis of minimum inhibitory dose. A small amount of salivary IgA was required to inhibit oral bacterial neuraminidases, whereas a large amount was required to inhibit other bacterial neuraminidase. Therefore, it is concluded that the absence of neuraminidase activity of oral bacteria in whole saliva may be due to specific inhibition by salivary IgA.

Of potential food poisoning organisms, coagulase positive staphylococci were present in 4% and Clostridium perfringens in 1.7% of all samples in low numbers. Of indicator organisms for fecal and sewage contamination, Escherichia coli were found in 3.2% and Streptococcus fecalis in 5.4% of the samples. The heat treatment applied during processing is not sufficient to destroy these organisms.

AB  - A modification of an assay for intercellular adhesive specificity is described. The method involves the collection of radioactively labeled cells by aggregates of the same (isotypic aggregates) or different (heterotypic aggregates) types of tissue and determination of the number of cells collected by liquid scintillation counting. The use of (32)P to label the tissues permitted a much more rapid estimation of cell collection than was obtained previously. With the use of chick embryo neural retina, liver, forebrain, pectoral muscle, and heart ventricle tissue, it was shown that isotypic was always greater than heterotypic collection. Labeled neural retina cell collection by neural retina aggregates was studied as a function of time, cell suspension density, aggregate diameter, temperature, and aggregate number. Neural retina aggregates were treated with certain enzymes in an attempt to determine whether specific changes on the surface of the aggregates would interfere with labeled neural retina cell collection. Of the various proteases and glycosidases tested, only beta-galactosidase rendered the surface more nonspecific.

AB  - Comparisons of the starch-gel patterns of uninoculated aseptic control samples from rabbit and pig muscle with similar samples inoculated and incubated with Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella enteritidis, Achromobacter liquefaciens, and Kurthia zopfii were made. Results indicated that C. perfringens caused extensive alteration in the proteins or enzymes, or both, of the sarcoplasmic fraction of porcine muscle, whereas S. enteritidis and S. faecalis caused complete breakdown of only myoglobin. Neither A. liquefaciens nor K. zopfii showed any measurable amount of proteolysis in the sarcoplasmic fraction from pig muscle. Although some of the bands in the starch-gel pattern of rabbit muscle decreased in size and intensity of staining, complete proteolysis of any protein fraction was absent for all test organisms. The disc-gel patterns of the 8 m urea-soluble proteins showed that C. perfringens caused extensive proteolysis in pig muscle and a lesser extent of proteolysis in rabbit muscle. None of the other organisms utilized in this study had any measurable effect upon the urea-soluble proteins. In addition, a simple procedure for aseptic isolation of muscle samples for studying meat spoilage is outlined. Results indicate that careful sanitation and cleanliness will give suitable samples for meat spoilage investigations.
TI  - Bacteriological examination of commercial precooked Eastern-type turkey rolls.
AB  - Studies were conducted to ascertain the bacteriological condition of commercially cooked Eastern-type (foil-wrapped-oven roasted) turkey rolls during processing and storage. After 2 weeks at 5 C, numbers of aerobes on the surface of rolls, in slices, and in whole rolls reached levels of from 1 to 10 million per cm(2) or per g. In stored whole rolls, coliform and enterococcus counts ranged, respectively, from about 10,000 to more than 1 million per g and from < 100 to more than 1 million per g. Postcooking processing operations in two plants did not significantly affect the total count of turkey rolls. Eight of 28 rolls obtained after handling and packaging contained coagulase-positive staphylococci.

AB  - Actively growing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were screened by a plate assay, with reconstituted guinea pig collagen as a substrate, for their ability to produce a collagenolytic factor. Collagenolytic activity was not demonstrated among the aerobic organisms tested, with the exception of one strain of Staphylococcus aureus (only when grown under anaerobic conditions). Collagenolytic activity, however, was detected in cultures of Clostridium tetani and Bacteroides species other than B. melaninogenicus. Collagenolytic activity of these organisms could be confirmed by measuring the amount of hydroxyproline liberated from the collagen gel during growth. Although collagenase production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been suggested in previous reports, our results were negative. An extracellular fraction of P. aeruginosa was able to hydrolyze a synthetic hexapeptide Cbz-glycyl-l-prolyl-glycyl-glycyl-l-prolyl-l- alanine, but was without detectable effect on reconstituted collagen.

Aerobic, anaerobic, and facultative organisms can grow in the capillary environment. The sensitivities of several organisms to antibiotics were determined by adding antibiotics to the agar before the capillaries were filled.

A tentative scheme for the biohydrogenation route to stearic acid is presented. The main pathway is through diconjugated cis-cis-cis-octadecatrienoic acid, non-conjugated trans-cis (cis-trans)-octadecadienoic acid and trans-octadecenoic acid, but other pathways are apparent. 3. Washed rumen micro-organisms possessed only a limited capacity to hydrogenate alpha-linolenic acid and oleic acid but the rate was greatly stimulated by a factor(s) present in the supernatant rumen liquor. 4. Pure cultures of Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and a coliform organism isolated from sheep faeces possessed negligible ability to hydrogenate unsaturated fatty acids compared with a mixed population of rumen micro-organisms. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens slowly converted linoleic acid into octadecenoic acid.

The gradient plate screening method, serial dilution, and dry weight techniques were used in the studies. The organisms tested consisted of 14 gram-negative bacteria, 10 gram-positive bacteria, 2 actinomycetes, 7 yeasts, and 8 molds. Inhibitory properties were found to be specific and potent in four compounds, with inhibitory concentrations as low as 0.37 mug/ml. Three of the active steroids are 4-aza cholestanes and one is a 4-nor-3,5-secocholestane amide. Sensitivity to the compounds was greatest in the gram-positive bacteria, followed by the yeasts and molds. The gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. All 16 steroids interfered to some extent with pigmentation in Serratia marcescens but not with pigment production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a few instances, some of the molds were stimulated by the steroids at a concentration of 250 mug/ml.

AB  - A Plexiglas isolator for rearing germfree vertebrates is described. Plastic components were precut and finished by a Plexiglas supplier. This equipment is relatively inexpensive; moreover, neither special facilities nor skills are required in their construction. Advantages of this type of isolator are: readily dismantled for cleaning, durable, excellent visibility of the interior, and minimal maintenance. In 30 separate groups of animals, 27 of these yielded germfree chicks. Many of these chicks were reared germfree for 4 weeks; and several were maintained for about 2 months, without microbial contamination. Pure cultures of Candida albicans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Clostridium perfringens were established as monocontaminations in the intestinal tracts of chickens. In contrast, Alcaligenes faecalis ATCC 9220 failed to grow in the gut of chicks, following peroral administration of this organism. All chicks described were employed on other experiments, and were killed for various assays at times specified.
