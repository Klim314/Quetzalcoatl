TI  == bacterial profile of dentine caries and the impact of ph on bacterial population  diversity.
AB  == dental caries is caused by the release of organic acids from fermentative bacteria, which results in the dissolution of hydroxyapatite matrices of enamel and dentine. while low environmental ph is proposed to cause a shift in the consortium of oral bacteria, favouring the development of caries, the impact of this variable has been overlooked in microbial population studies. this study aimed to detail the zonal composition of the microbiota associated with carious dentine lesions with reference to ph. we used 454 sequencing of the 16s rrna gene (v3-v4 region) to compare microbial communities in layers ranging in ph from 4.5-7.8 from 25 teeth with advanced dentine caries. pyrosequencing of the amplicons yielded 449,762 sequences. nine phyla, 97 genera and 409 species were identified from the quality-filtered, de-noised and chimera-free sequences. among the microbiota associated with dentinal caries, the most abundant taxa included lactobacillus sp., prevotella sp., atopobium sp., olsenella sp. and actinomyces sp. we found a disparity between microbial communities localised at acidic versus neutral ph strata. acidic conditions were associated with low diversity microbial populations, with lactobacillus species including l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and  l. crispatus, being prominent. in comparison, the distinctive species of a more diverse flora associated with neutral ph regions of carious lesions included alloprevotella tanerrae, leptothrix sp., sphingomonas sp. and streptococcus anginosus. while certain bacteria were affected by the ph gradient, we also found that approximately 60% of the taxa associated with caries were present across the investigated ph range, representing a substantial core. we demonstrated that some bacterial species implicated in caries progression show selective clustering with respect to ph gradient, providing a basis for specific therapeutic strategies.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and capacity for biofilm formation of different bacteria isolated from endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth.
AB  == introduction: to date, a variety of microbial species have been isolated from endodontic infections. however, endodontic clinical bacterial isolates have not been sufficiently characterized with regard to their capacity for antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. in this study, antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation of 47 different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates, belonging to 32 different species previously isolated from infected filled root canals, were studied. methods: antibiotic sensitivity to 11 antibiotics including penicillin g, amoxicillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, fosfomycin, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin was tested using the standardized etest method (bio merieux, marcy-1'etoile, france). the antibiotic sensitivity of 4 control strains was also estimated in parallel. additionally, the capacity to form biofilms was quantified using the microtiter plate test. results: different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species were either resistant against a number of antibiotics or showed high minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics. five aerobic and 2 anaerobic isolates, including enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans,  lactobacillus fermentum, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella buccae, and propionibacterium acidifaciens, were characterized as being high biofilm producers, whereas 8 aerobic and 3 anaerobic isolates were found to be moderate biofilm producers. most isolates with resistance or markedly high minimal inhibitory concentration values were also either moderate biofilm producers or high biofilm producers. conclusions: these results suggest that the  clinical significance of endodontic infections could include that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance. furthermore, endodontic treatment should consider the adhesion and biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria.

TI  == shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  == the shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. during a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was  sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). a higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. rothia dentocariosa and scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of mtad and nisin in combination against common pathogens associated with root canal infection.
AB  == introduction: many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. the object of this study was to evaluate the effect of mtad in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. methods: the survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with mtad, mtan (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and mtadn (nisin in combination with doxycycline). the survival rates of enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the  normal physiological state under mtad, mtan, and mtadn challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus paracasei, and porphyromonas gingivalis after mtad and mtadn treatment. results: l. fermenti, l. paracasei, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus gordonii, and peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to mtadn and mtan than to mtad. mtad, mtan, and mtadn showed a rapid antibacterial effect on p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum. enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to mtad, mtan, and mtadn as the control e. faecalis. furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in a. naeslundii and l. paracasei presented significant rupture, and p. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after mtadn treatment. conclusions: mtad in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to  establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an  indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance  of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.

TI  == probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  == aims: the isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. methods and results: out of 76 lactobacillus sp. and seven streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (math) was applied. in the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine escherichia coli 99/14 and human e. coli. this inhibition was due to acid. only a few strains inhibited actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. this inhibition remained after neutralization. the taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). most of the strains were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, a few as lactobacillus gasseri and one as lactobacillus rhamnosus. conclusions: bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. the strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. significance and  impact of the study: our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora activates rat peritoneal mast cells.
AB  == sixteen strains of physiological and pathological vaginal bacteria were tested for their ability to secrete histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells in vitro. we noticed that mycoplasma hominis-induced histamine release was very high (up to 53.6%). the stimulation of rat mast cells with staphylococccus cohnii, staphylococcus coagulase(-) (two strains), ureaplasma urealyticum, peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides capillosus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae resulted in lower but significant histamine secretion (11.2%-17.5%). other bacteria strains (staphylococcus epidermidids, enterococcus  faecalis, escherichia coli, actinomyces naeslundii (two strains) and lactobacillus fermentum (two strains) caused very low (4.2% - 8.8%) histamine release.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

TI  == [the influence of anaerobic bacteria and mycoplasma isolated from the genital tract on mast cell activation].
AB  == nowadays, it is known that mast cells, numerously appearing in all organs and being a source of a wide range of mediators and cytokines, are involved both in physiological and pathological processes. the aim of our study was to examine whether vaginal bacteria, especially those participating in bacterial vaginosis,  are able to activate mast cells to mediators secretion. the study was done on rat peritoneal mast cells. the mast cells were incubated in vitro with suspensions of bacteroides capillosus, actinomyces naeslundii (2 strains), peptostreptococcus spp., lactobacillus fermentum (2 strains), mycoplasma hominis or ureaplasma urealyticum killed by temperature. activation of mast cells was estimated on the  basis of histamine release. it was established that m. hominis, u. urealyticum and b. capillosus strongly stimulated rat mast cells to histamine secretion (histamine release 53.0%, 17.4% and 10.0%, respectively). histamine release induced by peptostreptococcus spp., a. naeslundii and l. fermentum was lower (at  a range of 2.4%-8.2%). the obtained results can suggest that presumably interactions between vaginal bacteria and placental mast cells could influence the course of pregnancy.

TI  == coaggregation of oral lactobacilli with streptococci from the oral cavity.
AB  == the ability of oral lactobacilli to coaggregate with streptococci and actinomycetes was investigated. of the 7 species of lactobacilli studied, only two were capable of coaggregation and the coaggregation was restricted to streptococci. lactobacillus salivarius strains (2/4) coaggregated with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus crista and tufted streptococcus sanguis ii strains. lactobacillus fermentum (2/3) coaggregated with s. gordonii and s. sanguis. the coaggregation between l. salivarius and s. salivarius, s. gordonii or tufted s. sanguis ii strains was mediated by a protein on the surface of the lactobacilli and was not inhibited by lactose. the coaggregation between l. fermentum and the streptococci was mediated by protein on the surface of the streptococci and was inhibited by lactose.

TI  == origin of esterases in human whole saliva.
AB  == whole saliva of 59 healthy persons was used for determination of esterase activity. the pattern of esterase was studied by means of isoelectrofocusing on thin-layer acrylamide gels. the esterases found in whole saliva are suggested to  be derived from the cells of the tissue in the oral cavity. this origin is indicated (e.g.) by comparison between isolectrophoretic esterase patterns of whole saliva, submandibular saliva, gingival biopsy and fibroblast culture. antisera against partially purified saliva esterases were produced in rabbits. these sera, used in immunoelectro-osmophoresis, gave esterase-active immunoprecipitate against whole saliva, the water-soluble materials of disrupted  gingival biopsy and fibroblast culture, but not against the material of the bacteria, streptococcus sanguis, strptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus and lactobacillus fermentum.
