TI  == lactobacillus salivarius ren counteracted unfavorable 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide-induced changes in colonic microflora of rats.
AB  == probiotics and carcinogens both have a significant effect on the microfloral composition of the human intestine. the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of an important carcinogen, 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide on colonic microflora and the efficacy of the probiotic lactobacillus salivarius ren as an agent of counteracting these effects. using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) combined with redundancy analysis, we demonstrated that both 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and l. salivarius ren significantly altered the bacterial communities of rat colons. a total of 27 bacterial strains were identified as being affected by treatment with 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide or l. salivarius ren using a t-value biplot combined with band sequencing. 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide treatment increased the abundance of two potential pathogens (one helicobacter strain and one desulfovibrio strain), as well as reducing the abundance of two potentially beneficial strains (one ruminococcaceae strain and one rumen bacteria). the helicobacter strain was initally detected in  carcinogen-treated rat intestinal microflora, but l. salivarius ren treatment effectively suppressed the growth of the helicobacter strain. these results suggested that l. salivarius ren may be a potential probiotic, efficiently acting against the initial infection with, and the growth of pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == identification and characterization of potential performance-related gut microbiotas in broiler chickens across various feeding trials.
AB  == three broiler feeding trials were investigated in order to identify gut bacteria  consistently linked with improvements in bird performance as measured by feed efficiency. trials were done in various geographic locations and varied in diet composition, broiler breed, and bird age. gut microbial communities were investigated using microbial profiling. eight common performance-linked operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified within both the ilea (180, 492, and 564-566) and ceca (140-142, 218-220, 284-286, 312, and 482) across trials. otu 564-566 was associated with lower performance, while otus 140-142, 482, and 492 were associated with improved performance. targeted cloning and sequencing of these eight otus revealed that they represented 26 bacterial species or phylotypes which clustered phylogenetically into seven groups related  to lactobacillus spp., ruminococcaceae, clostridiales, gammaproteobacteria, bacteroidales, clostridiales/lachnospiraceae, and unclassified bacteria/clostridia. where bacteria were identifiable to the phylum level, they belonged predominantly to the firmicutes, with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria also identified. some of the potential performance-related phylotypes showed high sequence identity with classified bacteria (lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus aviarius, lactobacillus crispatus, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, escherichia coli, gallibacterium anatis, clostridium lactatifermentans, ruminococcus torques, bacteroides vulgatus, and alistipes finegoldii). the 16s rrna gene sequence information generated will allow quantitative assays to be developed which will enable elucidations of which of these phylotypes are truly performance related. this information could be used to monitor strategies to improve feed efficiency and feed formulation for optimal gut health.
