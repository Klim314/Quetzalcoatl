TI  == voice prosthetic biofilm formation and candida morphogenic conversions in absence and presence of different bacterial strains and species on silicone-rubber.
AB  == morphogenic conversion of candida from a yeast to hyphal morphology plays a pivotal role in the pathogenicity of candida species. both candida albicans and candida tropicalis, in combination with a variety of different bacterial strains  and species, appear in biofilms on silicone-rubber voice prostheses used in laryngectomized patients. here we study biofilm formation on silicone-rubber by c. albicans or c. tropicalis in combination with different commensal bacterial strains and lactobacillus strains. in addition, hyphal formation in c. albicans and c. tropicalis, as stimulated by rothia dentocariosa and lactobacilli was evaluated, as clinical studies outlined that these bacterial strains have opposite results on the clinical life-time of silicone-rubber voice prostheses. biofilms were grown during eight days in a silicone-rubber tube, while passing the biofilms through episodes of nutritional feast and famine. biofilms consisting of combinations of c. albicans and a bacterial strain comprised significantly less viable organisms than combinations comprising c. tropicalis. high percentages of candida were found in biofilms grown in combination with lactobacilli. interestingly, l. casei, with demonstrated favorable effects on the clinical life-time of voice prostheses, reduced the percentage hyphal formation in candida biofilms as compared with candida biofilms grown in absence of bacteria or grown in combination with r. dentocariosa, a bacterial strain whose presence is associated with short clinical life-times of voice prostheses.

TI  == microbiological profiles in saliva and supragingival plaque from caries-active adolescents before and after a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with  probiotic bacteria - a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the microbial profile in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents before and after a daily short-term intake of milk supplemented with  the probiotic bacteria. materials and methods: the present study group consisted  of 18 caries-active adolescents of both sexes who volunteered for participation giving an informed consent. the study has a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind pilot design with two parallel arms. after a 2-week run-in period, the subjects were instructed to drink 2.5 dl of milk supplemented with lactobacillus rhamnosus lb21 (107 cfu/ml) (test) or standard control milk (placebo) once daily for a period of 2 weeks (intervention period). samples of stimulated whole saliva and supragingival plaque were collected at baseline (after run-in) and immediately after the end of the intervention period (follow-up). the salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were estimated by conventional culturing on selective agar plates. the presence and level of 19 oral species associated with the caries process were determined using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation technique. differences between the groups  were assessed using the non-parametric wilcoxon-mann-whitney and chi-square tests. results: the mean caries experience was high with an average of 7.0 +/- 3.8 proximal enamel lesions. the most prevalent dominating species in the plaque  samples were streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula and streptococcus gordonii. the saliva samples displayed a more mixed profile, with streptococcus mitis, rothia dentocariosa, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus curvata being frequently identified species. all of the subjects harboured mutans streptococci  in their saliva, with 61% of them colonised with salivary lactobacilli. no statistically significant differences in the microbial profiles or the estimated  counts between the baseline and follow-up samples, or between the two study groups, were observed. conclusions: the present study showed that a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with the probiotic bacterium l. rhamnosus lb21  did not significantly affect the microbial profiles or the levels of caries-associated bacteria in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents.
