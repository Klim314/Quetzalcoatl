TI  - Spectroscopic analysis, DNA binding and antimicrobial activities of metal complexes with phendione and its derivative.
AB  - A novel ligand (E)-2-styryl-1H-imidazo [4, 5-f] [1, 10] phenanthroline(L) has been synthesized from 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione. Its transition metal complexes, [FeLCl4][L-H] and [CuL2](NO3)2 have also been synthesized. Besides, three mixed ligand lanthanide metal complexes of Phendione and beta-diketones have been synthesized, namely [Eu(TFN)3(Phendione)] (TFN = 4,4,4-trifluoro-1(2-napthyl)-1,3-butanedione), [Eu(HFT)3(Phendione)] (HFT = 4,4,5,5,6,6,6-heptafluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-1,3-hexanedione), [Yb(HFA)3(Phendione)] (hfa = hexafluoroacetylacetonate). The synthesized ligands and metal complexes have been characterized by FTIR, UV-Visible spectroscopy and PL spectra. DNA binding activities of the complexes and the ligands have been studied by DNA gel electrophoresis. DNA binding studies showed that Fe complex of the synthesized ligand is more potent DNA binding and damaging agent compare to others under study. The synthesized compounds were also screened for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion method against three microbes, namely Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus penneri. The lanthanide complexes of phendione showed great antibacterial activities.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of UTIs during two different time periods (from February 1999 to March 2000, and from April 2000 to September 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. The frequency of occurrence of ESBL--producing Gram-negative rods increased during second period study. The isolated ESBL--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol Gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms. Isolated organisms from urine samples included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundi, Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. Only 9.4% of isolated Enterococcus spp. were high-level aminoglicoside resistant (HLAR) strains. No vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were isolated. Among coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) methicillin resistant strains (MRCNS) were isolated in 43.3%.
