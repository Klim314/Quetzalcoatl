isolation of lactobacillus salivarius 1077 (nrrl b-50053) and characterization of its bacteriocin, including the antimicrobial activity spectrum.
lactobacillus salivarius 1077 (nrrl b-50053) was isolated from poultry intestinal materials, and in vitro anti-campylobacter jejuni activity was demonstrated. the isolate was then used for bacteriocin production and its enrichment. the protein content of the cell-free supernatant from the spent medium was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and dialyzed to produce the crude antimicrobial preparation. a typical bacteriocin-like response of sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes and resistance to lysozyme, lipase, and 100 degrees c was observed with this preparation. the polypeptide was further purified by gel filtration, ion-exchange, and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms), edman degradation, and isoelectrofocusing were used to characterize its 3,454-da molecular mass, the amino acid sequence of its 37 residue components, and the isoelectric point of pi 9.1 of the bacteriocin. bacteriocin l-1077 contained the class iia bacteriocin signature n-terminal sequence ygngv. mics of bacteriocin l-1077 against 33 bacterial isolates (both gram negative and gram positive) ranged from 0.09 to 1.5 mug/ml. subsequently, the therapeutic benefit of bacteriocin l-1077 was demonstrated in market-age (40- to 43-day-old) broiler chickens colonized with both c. jejuni and salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis. compared with untreated control birds, both c. jejuni and s. enteritidis counts in colonized ceca were diminished by >4 log(10) and s. enteritidis counts in both the liver and the spleen of treated birds were reduced by 6 to 8 log(10)/g compared with those in the nontreated control birds. bacteriocin l-1077 appears to hold promise in controlling c. jejuni/s. enteritidis among commercial broiler chickens.
