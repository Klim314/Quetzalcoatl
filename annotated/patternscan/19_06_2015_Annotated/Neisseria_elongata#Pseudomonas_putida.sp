TI  == enhancement of biodegradation of crude petroleum-oil in contaminated water by the addition of nitrogen sources.
AB  == addition of nitrogen sources as supplementary nutrient into msm medium to enhance biodegradation by stimulating the growth four isolates, acinetobacter faecalis, staphylococcus sp., pseudomonas putida and neisseria elongata isolated from petroleum contaminated groundwater, wastewater aeration pond and biopond at the oil refinery terengganu malaysia was investigated. the organic nitrogen sources tested not only supported growth but also enhances biodegradation of 1% tapis crude oil. all four isolates showed good growth especially when peptone was employed as the organic nitrogen compared to growth in the basal medium. gas chromatography showed that more then 91, 93, 94 and 95% degradation of total hydrocarbon was observed after 5 days of incubation by isolates pseudomonas putida, neisseria elongate, acinetobacter faecalis and staphylococcus sp., respectively.

TI  == growth enhancement of effective microorganisms for bioremediation of crude oil contaminated waters.
AB  == the bioremediation of polluted groundwater, wastewater aeration pond and biopond  sites was investigated using bacteria isolated from these sites located at the oil refinery terengganu malaysia. out of 62 isolates, only 16 isolates from groundwater (8) and wastewater aeration pond (3) and biopond (5) were chosen based on growth medium containing 1% (v/v) tapis crude oil. only four isolates; acinetobacter faecalis, staphylococcus sp., pseudomonas putida and neisseria elongata showed percentage biodegradation of crude oil more than 50% after 5 days using mineral salts medium (msm). the effect of physical parameters (temperature, ph and agitation) on growth by all four strains showed a maximum growth in msm medium with 1% tapis crude oil at 37 degrees c with ph 7 and agitation of 130 rpm.
