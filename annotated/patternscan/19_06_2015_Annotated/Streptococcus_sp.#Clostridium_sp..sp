TI  == application of a pathogen microarray for the analysis of viruses and bacteria in  clinical diagnostic samples from pigs.
AB  == many of the disease syndromes challenging the commercial swine industry involve the analysis of complex problems caused by polymicrobial, emerging or reemerging, and transboundary pathogens. this study investigated the utility of the lawrence  livermore microbial detection array (lawrence livermore national laboratory, livermore, california), designed to detect 8,101 species of microbes, in the evaluation of known and unknown microbes in serum, oral fluid, and tonsil from pigs experimentally coinfected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) and porcine circovirus-2 (pcv-2). the array easily identified prrsv and pcv-2, but at decreased sensitivities compared to standard polymerase chain reaction detection methods. the oral fluid sample was the most informative, possessing additional signatures for several swine-associated bacteria, including streptococcus sp., clostridium sp., and staphylococcus sp.

TI  == phytase modulates ileal microbiota and enhances growth performance of the broiler chickens.
AB  == phytase is well studied and explored, however, little is known about its effects  on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract. in total, 400 one-day-old female ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to four experimental groups. the dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 complete factorial design, with the factors being adequate (pc) or insufficient calcium (ca) and digestible phosphor  (dp)(nc) and with or without 5000 phytase units (ftu)/kg of escherichia coli 6-phytase. the gastrointestinal tract ph values, ileal microbial communities and  short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the digesta were determined. the reduction in ca and dp concentration significantly affected ph in the crop and caeca, and addition of phytase to the nc resulted in a ph increase in the ileum.  the reduction in ca and dp concentration significantly lowered, while phytase supplementation increased ileal total bacterial counts. additionally, the deficient diet reduced butyrate- but increased lactate-producing bacteria. the addition of phytase increased lactobacillus sp./enterococcus sp. whereas in case  of clostridium leptum subgroup, clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale cluster, bifidobacterium sp. and streptococcus/lactococcus counts, a significant  ca and dp level x phytase interaction was found. however, the recorded interactions indicated that the effects of phytase and ca and dp levels were not  consistent. furthermore, the reduction of ca and dp level lowered clostridium perfringens and enterobacteriaceae counts. the analysis of fermentation products  showed that reducing the ca and dp content in the diet reduced total scfa, dl-lactate, and acetic acid in the ileum whereas phytase increased concentrations of these acids in the nc group. this suggests that p is a factor which limits fermentation in the ileum. it may be concluded that phytase plays a role in modulating the gut microbiota of chicken, however, this is clearly linked with the levels of p and ca in a diet.

TI  == bacterial community structure associated with elective cesarean section versus vaginal delivery in chinese newborns.
AB  == objectives: increasing attention is being paid to the potential for cesarean birth to influence the taxa of the bacteria that compose the infant intestinal microbiota. the present study characterized the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in newborn infants delivered vaginally (vd) or by cesarean section (cd). methods: a cross-sectional study was performed using fecal specimens collected on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life from 25 vd infants and 16 cd infants. profiles of the fecal microbiota were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing of the clones corresponding to the degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) bands. results: on days 2 and 4 of postnatal  life, vd and cd infants did not differ in the richness and evenness of the fecal  bacterial community; however, the taxa of the fecal microbiota were significantly different between the 2 groups. in vd infants, escherichia coli, bacteroides sp,  and bifidobacterium longum were the dominant microbes. in cd infants, staphylococcus sp, clostridium sp, enterobacter sp, and streptococcus sp were more common. conclusions: these results demonstrate that delivery method has a profound influence on the structure of the intestinal microbiota in chinese newborn infants. this is in accordance with data reported in other regions.

TI  == dietary supplementation with soybean oligosaccharides increases short-chain fatty acids but decreases protein-derived catabolites in the intestinal luminal content of weaned huanjiang mini-piglets.
AB  == the improvement of gut health and function with prebiotic supplements after weaning is an active area of research in pig nutrition. the present study was conducted to test the working hypothesis that medium-term dietary supplementation with soybean oligosaccharides (sbos) can affect the gut ecosystem in terms of microbiota composition, luminal bacterial short-chain fatty acid and ammonia concentrations, and intestinal expression of genes related to intestinal immunity and barrier function. ten huanjiang mini-piglets, weaned at 21 days of age, were  randomly assigned to 2 groups. each group received a standard diet containing either dietary supplementation with 0.5% corn starch (control group) or 0.5% sbos (experimental group). the results showed that dietary supplementation with sbos increased the diversity of intestinal microflora and elevated (p < .05) the numbers of some presumably beneficial intestinal bacteria (e.g., bifidobacterium  sp, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, fusobacterium prausnitzii, and roseburia). soybean oligosaccharide supplementation also increased the concentration of short-chain fatty acid in the intestinal lumen, and it reduced (p < .05) the numbers of bacteria with pathogenic potential (e.g., escherichia coli, clostridium, and streptococcus) and the concentration of several protein-derived  catabolites (e.g., isobutyrate, isovalerate, and ammonia). in addition, sbos supplementation increased (p < .05) expression of zonula occludens 1 messenger rna, and it decreased (p < .05) expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 8 messenger rna in the ileum and colon. these  findings suggest that sbos supplementation modifies the intestinal ecosystem in weaned huanjiang mini-piglets and has potentially beneficial effects on the gut.

TI  == characterization of rumen bacterial strains isolated from enrichments of rumen content in the presence of propolis.
AB  == propolis presents many biological properties, including antibacterial activities, and has been proposed as an additive in ruminant nutrition. twenty bacterial strains, previously isolated from enrichments of brazilian cow rumen contents in  the presence of different propolis extracts (llos), were characterized using phenotyping and 16s rrna identification. seven strains were assigned to streptococcus sp., most likely s. bovis, and were all degrading starch. one amylolytic lactate-utilizing strain of selenomonas ruminantium was also found. two strains of clostridium bifermentans were identified and showed proteolytic activity. two strains were assigned to mitsuokella jalaludinii and were saccharolytic. one strain belonged to a bacillus species and seven strains were affiliated with escherichia coli. all of the 20 strains were able to use many sugars, but none of them were able to degrade the polysaccharides carboxymethylcellulose and xylans. the effect of three propolis extracts (llos b1, c1 and c3) was tested on the in vitro growth of four representative isolates  of s. bovis, e. coli, m. jalaludinii and c. bifermentans. the growth of s. bovis, e. coli and m. jalaludinii was not affected by the three propolis extracts at 1 mg ml(-1). c. bifermentans growth was completely inhibited at this llos concentration, but this bacterium was partially resistant at lower concentrations. llos c3, with the lower concentration of phenolic compounds, was  a little less inhibitory than b1 and c1 on this strain.

TI  == identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [poe]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [pte]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [ee]). several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. however, until now, the polybacterial communities of poe, pte, and ee have not been precisely studied. hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries. of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-pcr-positive samples. the obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra) to identify unique clones. the multiple types of ardra patterns (p=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (p=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in poe, pte, and ee. moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in ee. gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus spp. (n=19), streptococcus spp. (n=18), staphylococcus spp. (n=6), exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), gemella spp. (n=2), enterococcus spp. (n=2), a lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a clostridium sp. (n=1), and a nocardia sp. (n=1), and  gram-negative bacteria, including serratia spp. (n=18), pseudomonas spp. (n=10),  enterobacter spp. (n=8), acinetobacter spp. (n=3), pantoea spp. (n=3), a haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. interestingly,  among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of poe, pte, and ee infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == time-dependent post mortem changes in the composition of intestinal bacteria using real-time quantitative pcr.
AB  == post mortem or even normal changes during life occurring in major gut bacterial populations are not known. we investigated bacteroides sp., bifidobacterium sp.,  clostridium leptum, clostridium coccoides, streptococcus sp., lactobacillus sp. and enterobacteriacaea ratios in 7 fecal samples from healthy volunteers and in 61 autopsies rectum and cecum samples and studied the effect of post mortem time  using quantitative real-time pcr. bacterial ratios in stool samples from volunteers and rectum samples from autopsy cases were similar and did not change  significantly up to 5 days post mortem. in cecum, significant post mortem time-dependent differences were observed in ratios of bacteroides sp. (p = 0.014) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.024). our results showed that ratios of bacteroides  sp., bifidobacterium sp., clostridium leptum, clostridium coccoides, streptococcus sp., lactobacillus sp. and enterobacteriacaea can be investigated in autopsy rectum samples up to 5 days after death.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == green-lipped mussel extract (perna canaliculus) and glucosamine sulphate in patients with knee osteoarthritis: therapeutic efficacy and effects on gastrointestinal microbiota profiles.
AB  == objective: to investigate how changes in the gastrointestinal tract (git) microbiota profile may influence nutraceutical efficacy in osteoarthritis (oa) and allow the formulation of a hypothesis that explains in part the inconsistent  and contentious findings from oa clinical studies with green-lipped mussel (glm)  and glucosamine. methods: a non-blinded randomised clinical trial was conducted with 38 subjects diagnosed with knee oa. each participant received either 3,000 mg/day of a whole glm extract or 3,000 mg/day of glucosamine sulphate (gs), p.o.  for 12 weeks. faecal microbial analyses were carried out after collecting stools  at t (0) and t (12) weeks. additional pharmacometric measures were obtained from  changes in arthritic scores in the western ontario mcmaster universities arthritis index (womac) and the lequesne algofunctional indices and the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (gsrs). an intention-to-treat analysis was  employed and participant data collected at t (0), t (6) and t (12) weeks. results: there were no statistically significant changes in bacterial growth patterns determined by the wilcoxon test. in both groups there was a trend towards a decrease in clostridium and staphylococcus species and increase in lactobacillus, streptococcus and eubacterium species. in the glm group bifidobacterium tended to increase and enterococcus and yeast species to decrease. the gs-treated group demonstrated a trend towards a decrease in bacteroides and an increase in yeasts and coliforms species, most notably escherichia coli. we further confirm significant improvement (p < 0.05) in all oa outcome measures from t (0) to t (12) weeks for both the glm and gs groups. the gsrs scores indicated that git function significantly improved over the 12 weeks  duration with glm and gs supplementation. conclusion: both glm and gs reduced oa  symptoms and non-significantly altered the gut microbiota profile from baseline.  changes in the microbiota profiles occurred in both treatment groups; the most notable being a reduction in the clostridia sp. this study suggests that nutritional supplements such as glm and gs may regulate some of the metabolic and immunological activities of the git microbiota. the decrease in clostridia, a potent modulator of colonic th17 and cd4+ regulatory t cells, was consistent with a decrease in inflammation; improved gsrs scores and oa symptoms for these oa participants. the git microbiota may be important factor in the first-pass metabolism of these nutraceuticals.

TI  == the human small intestinal microbiota is driven by rapid uptake and conversion of simple carbohydrates.
AB  == the human gastrointestinal tract (gi tract) harbors a complex community of microbes. the microbiota composition varies between different locations in the gi tract, but most studies focus on the fecal microbiota, and that inhabiting the colonic mucosa. consequently, little is known about the microbiota at other parts of the gi tract, which is especially true for the small intestine because of its  limited accessibility. here we deduce an ecological model of the microbiota composition and function in the small intestine, using complementing culture-independent approaches. phylogenetic microarray analyses demonstrated that microbiota compositions that are typically found in effluent samples from ileostomists (subjects without a colon) can also be encountered in the small intestine of healthy individuals. phylogenetic mapping of small intestinal metagenome of three different ileostomy effluent samples from a single individual indicated that streptococcus sp., escherichia coli, clostridium sp. and high g+c  organisms are most abundant in the small intestine. the compositions of these populations fluctuated in time and correlated to the short-chain fatty acids profiles that were determined in parallel. comparative functional analysis with fecal metagenomes identified functions that are overrepresented in the small intestine, including simple carbohydrate transport phosphotransferase systems (pts), central metabolism and biotin production. moreover, metatranscriptome analysis supported high level in-situ expression of pts and carbohydrate metabolic genes, especially those belonging to streptococcus sp. overall, our findings suggest that rapid uptake and fermentation of available carbohydrates contribute to maintaining the microbiota in the human small intestine.

TI  == clostridiolysin s, a post-translationally modified biotoxin from clostridium botulinum.
AB  == through elaboration of its botulinum toxins, clostridium botulinum produces clinical syndromes of infant botulism, wound botulism, and other invasive infections. using comparative genomic analysis, an orphan nine-gene cluster was identified in c. botulinum and the related foodborne pathogen clostridium sporogenes that resembled the biosynthetic machinery for streptolysin s, a key virulence factor from group a streptococcus responsible for its hallmark beta-hemolytic phenotype. genetic complementation, in vitro reconstitution, mass  spectral analysis, and plasmid intergrational mutagenesis demonstrate that the streptolysin s-like gene cluster from clostridium sp. is responsible for the biogenesis of a novel post-translationally modified hemolytic toxin, clostridiolysin s.

TI  == noncollagenous region of the streptococcal collagen-like protein is a trimerization domain that supports refolding of adjacent homologous and heterologous collagenous domains.
AB  == proper folding of the (gly-xaa-yaa)(n) sequence of animal collagens requires adjacent n- or c-terminal noncollagenous trimerization domains which often contain coiled-coil or beta sheet structure. collagen-like proteins have been found recently in a number of bacteria, but little is known about their folding mechanism. the scl2 collagen-like protein from streptococcus pyogenes has an n-terminal globular domain, designated v(sp), adjacent to its triple-helix domain. the v(sp) domain is required for proper refolding of the scl2 protein in  vitro. here, recombinant v(sp) domain alone is shown to form trimers with a significant alpha-helix content and to have a thermal stability of t(m) = 45 degrees c. examination of a new construct shows that the v(sp) domain facilitates efficient in vitro refolding only when it is located n-terminal to the triple-helix domain but not when c-terminal to the triple-helix domain. fusion of the v(sp) domain n-terminal to a heterologous (gly-xaa-yaa)(n) sequence from clostridium perfringens led to correct folding and refolding of this triple-helix, which was unable to fold into a triple-helical, soluble protein on  its own. these results suggest that placement of a functional trimerization module adjacent to a heterologous gly-xaa-yaa repeating sequence can lead to proper folding in some cases but also shows specificity in the relative location  of the trimerization and triple-helix domains. this information about their modular nature can be used in the production of novel types of bacterial collagen for biomaterial applications.

TI  == bacterial diversity of darfiyeh, a lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  == in order to contribute to the preservation of the lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety  made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. three independent batches of darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (lab) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. in order to explore the darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. the latter included polymerase chain reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge), classical pcr and quantitative pcr. these methods revealed the presence of streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus malodoratus, group d streptococcus sp., lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus curvatus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, clostridium sp./eubacterium tenue. real-time pcr  enabled quantification of e. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. the present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of lebanese artisanal dairy products.

TI  == novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases with broader substrate specificity.
AB  == in an effort to identify novel endo-alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidases (endo-alpha-galnacases), four potential genes were cloned. three of the expressed proteins engef from enterococcus faecalis, engpa from propionibacterium acnes, and engcp from clostridium perfringens were purified and characterized. their substrate specificity was investigated and compared to the commercially available endo-alpha-galnacases from streptococcus pneumoniae (engsp) and alcaligenes sp. (engal). all enzymes were incubated with various synthetic substrates, and natural glycoproteins and the released sugars were detected by colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography analysis. the core 1 disaccharide gal beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was the most rapidly hydrolyzed substrate by all enzymes tested. engef exhibited the highest k(cat) for this substrate. engef and engpa were also able to fully hydrolyze the core 3 disaccharide glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp. this is the first report of endo-alpha-galnacases engef and engpa acting on core 3 in addition to core 1 o-glycans. interestingly, there were no significant differences in transglycosylation activities when gal beta 1,3galnac  alpha 1pnp or glcnac beta 1,3galnac alpha 1pnp was incubated with various 1-alkanols in the presence of the endo-alpha-galnacases tested in this work.

TI  == adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  == a wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have  been described with several neonatal infections. we studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. the infections diagnosed included neisseria meningitidies, group a streptococcus, rickettsia rickettsii, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ehrlichia sp., bacillus anthracis, leptospira sp., clostridium sp., klebsiella sp., legionella sp., yersinia pestis, and treponema pallidum. bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with n. meningitidis, four with r. rickettsii, four with s. pneumoniae, three with group a streptococcus, two with s. aureus, two with b. anthracis, one with t. pallidum, and one with legionella sp. bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. although n. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of the immersion chilling procedure during poultry processing.
AB  == the development of treatments to reduce bacterial numbers on poultry carcasses is important for the overall hygienic quality of birds. the important washing effect of the immersion chilling procedure is discussed. systematic monitoring of fecal  bacterial indicators as well as some classic pathogens was performed at selected  critical points in a water chiller ecosystem. clostridium perfringens, fecal coliforms, enterococcus sp., and streptococcus sp. were found in all water chiller samples. the temperature of the chiller ecosystem varied according to location: escherichia coli and salmonella sp. were found at 16 degrees c, compared with the 4 degrees c location, where these species were found in lower numbers. moreover, the psychrotrophic bacterium pseudomonas was found only at this last location. the temperature of the water during the immersion chilling procedure was unfavorable for the growth of campylobacter sp., whose presence was always strictly associated with a ph close to 6. spore forms of c. perfringens were persistent in all locations and seemed to be a reliable indicator of contamination of the water chiller ecosystem.

AB  == the necropsy records of 65 elk ranging from 1 day to 13(1/2) years of age were reviewed to determine the primary cause of death of each animal. the animal carcasses were submitted from 22 separate pennsylvania elk farms over an approximately 8-year period. the most common causes of mortality in animals in which the cause of death was determined were gastrointestinal parasitism (21 cases), pneumonia (7 cases), enterocolitis (5 cases), malnutrition (5 cases), and rumenitis/acidosis (5 cases). the cause of death was undetermined in 4 of the 65  elk. nematode organisms (20 cases) were the primary parasites identified in cases of mortality owing to gastrointestinal parasitism. arcanobacterium pyogenes (3 cases), escherichia coli (3 cases), and streptococcus sp. (2 cases) were the most commonly isolated bacteria from the lung in the cases of pneumonia. fungal organisms, consistent with aspergillus sp. were present histologically within the pulmonary lesions in 5 cases. bacterial agents associated with enterocolitis included clostridium perfringens (2 cases), e. coli (1 case), salmonella newport  (1 case) and salmonella thompson (1 case). the majority (56.3%) of the death loss in elk of known ages occurred in animals 1 year of age or less, with 71.4% of the gastrointestinal parasitism, 60.0% of the malnutrition, 60.0% of the enterocolitis, and 57.1% of the pneumonia cases occurring in animals within this  age range. in conclusion, gastrointestinal parasitism, pneumonia, malnutrition, enterocolitis and rumenitis/acidosis were considered the most common causes of death in captive elk in this study.

TI  == quantitative analysis of a high-rate hydrogen-producing microbial community in anaerobic agitated granular sludge bed bioreactors using glucose as substrate.
AB  == fermentative h(2) production microbial structure in an agitated granular sludge bed bioreactor was analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and polymerase chain reaction-denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). this hydrogen-producing system was operated at four different hydraulic retention times (hrts) of 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 h and with an influent glucose concentration of  20 g chemical oxygen demand/l. according to the pcr-dgge analysis, bacterial community structures were mainly composed of clostridium sp. (possibly clostridium pasteurianum), klebsiella oxytoca, and streptococcus sp. significant  increase of clostridium/total cell ratio (68%) was observed when the reactor was  operated under higher influent flow rate. the existence of streptococcus sp. in the reactor became more important when operated under a short hrt as indicated by the ratio of streptococcus probe-positive cells to clostridium probe-positive cells changing from 21% (hrt 4 h) to 38% (hrt 0.5 h). fish images suggested that  streptococcus cells probably acted as seeds for self-flocculated granule formation. furthermore, combining the inspections with hydrogen production under  different hrts and their corresponding fish analysis indicated that k. oxytoca did not directly contribute to h(2) production but possibly played a role in consuming o(2) to create an anaerobic environment for the hydrogen-producing clostridium.

TI  == immunohistochemical evidence of clostridium sp, staphylococcus aureus, and group  a streptococcus in severe soft tissue infections related to injection drug use.
AB  == severe soft tissue infections are caused by either single or multiple microorganisms. we performed a retrospective immunohistochemical (ihc) study on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded soft tissue samples from 20 injection drug users who were part of a cluster of severe illness and death after skin and soft  tissue infections in scotland and ireland in 2000. the ihc assays used antibodies against clostridium sp, staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci, and bacillus anthracis. intact bacilli and granular clostridium antigen staining in areas with necrosis, edema, and inflammation were observed in skin, fascia, or muscle samples of 12 (60%) patients. a variety of clostridia were isolated from affected soft tissues in 10 ihc-positive cases. staphylococcus aureus antigens were observed in 3 cases including 1 where s aureus was isolated, 1 with negative cultures, and 1 where mixed cultures were obtained. group a streptococcal antigens were observed in 1 case in which streptococcus pyogenes and s aureus were isolated. by using ihc, we detected different bacteria in archival soft tissue samples from patients with severe skin and soft tissue infections. immunohistochemical assays can be of great diagnostic value, particularly for bacteria such as clostridium sp, which are difficult to isolate because of their  anaerobic fastidious growth requirements.

AB  == morphological, biochemical, and molecular genetic studies were performed on an unknown anaerobic, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium isolated from dog feces. the unknown bacterium was tentatively identified as a eubacterium species, based on cellular morphological and biochemical tests. 16s rrna gene sequencing studies, however, revealed that it was phylogenetically distant from eubacterium limosum, the type species of the genus eubacterium. phylogenetically, the unknown species forms a hitherto unknown sub-line proximal  to the base of a cluster of organisms (designated rrna cluster xvi), which includes clostridium innocuum, streptococcus pleomorphus, and some eubacterium species. based on both phenotypic and phylogenetic criteria, it is proposed that  the unknown bacterium be classified as a new genus and species, allobaculum stercoricanis. using a specific rrna-targeted probe designed to identify allobaculum stercoricanis, in situ hybridisation showed this novel species represents a significant organism in canine feces comprising between 0.1% and 3.7% of total cells stained with dapi (21 dog fecal samples). the type strain of  allobaculum stercoricanis is dsm 13633(t)=ccug 45212(t).

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100  degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees  c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == lotus corniculatus condensed tannins decrease in vivo populations of proteolytic  bacteria and affect nitrogen metabolism in the rumen of sheep.
AB  == condensed tannins in forage legumes improve the nutrition of sheep by reducing ruminal degradation of plant protein and increasing crude protein flow to the intestine. however, the effects of condensed tannins in forage legumes on rumen bacterial populations in vivo are poorly understood. the aim of this study was to investigate the specific effects of condensed tannins from lotus corniculatus on  four proteolytic rumen bacteria in sheep during and after transition from a ryegrass (lolium perenne)-white clover (trifolium repens) diet (i.e., low condensed tannins) to a lotus corniculatus diet (i.e., higher condensed tannins). the bacterial populations were quantified using a competitive polymerase chain reaction. lotus corniculatus was fed with or without ruminal infusions of polyethylene glycol (peg), which binds to and inactivates condensed tannins, enabling the effect of condensed tannins on bacterial populations to be examined. when sheep fed on ryegrass-white clover, populations of clostridium proteoclasticum b316t, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens c211a, eubacterium sp. c12b, and streptococcus bovis b315 were 1.5 x 10(8), 1.1 x 10(6), 4.6 x 10(8), and 7.1 x 10(6) ml(-1), respectively. when the diet was changed to lotus corniculatus, the  average populations (after 8-120 h) of c. proteoclasticum, b. fibrisolvens, eubacterium sp., and s. bovis decreased (p < 0.001) to 2.4 x 10(7), 1.1 x 10(5),  1.1 x 10(8), and 2.5 x 10(5) ml(-1), respectively. when peg was infused into the  rumen of sheep fed lotus corniculatus, the populations of c. proteoclasticum, b.  fibrisolvens, eubacterium sp., and s. bovis were higher (p < 0.01-0.001) than in  sheep fed lotus corniculatus without the peg infusion, with average populations (after 8-120 h) of 4.9 x 10(7), 3.8 x 10(5), 1.9 x 10(8), and 1.0 x 10(6), respectively. sheep fed the lotus corniculatus diet had lower rumen proteinase activity, ammonia, and soluble nitrogen (p < 0.05-0.001) than sheep that were fed lotus corniculatus plus peg. the lotus corniculatus diet reduced rumen nitrogen digestibility (p < 0.05) and ammonia pool size and increased the flow of undegraded feed nitrogen to the abomasum. the nitrogen intake, rumen non-ammonia  nitrogen pool size, rumen microbial non-ammonia nitrogen pool size, and abomasal  microbial non-ammonia nitrogen fluxes were similar both in sheep fed only lotus corniculatus and in sheep fed lotus corniculatus plus peg, but nonmicrobial non-ammonia nitrogen flux to the abomasum was higher (p < 0.01) for the sheep fed only lotus corniculatus. although condensed tannins in lotus corniculatus reduced the populations of some proteolytic bacteria, total ruminal microbial protein and microbial protein outflow to the abomasum were unchanged, suggesting a species-specific effect of condensed tannins on bacteria in the rumen.

TI  == [combination use of kampo-medicines and drugs affecting intestinal bacterial flora].
AB  == the intestinal bacteria, eubacterium sp. and bifidobacterium sp., participate in  the metabolism of active kampo-ingredients, glycyrrhizin (gl), sennoside (sen) and baicalin (bl). since antibiotics and bacterial preparations, bifidobacterium  longum (lac-b), clostridium butyricum (miya-bm), and streptococcus faecalis (biofermin), affect the bacterial population in intestinal bacterial flora, metabolism of the active kampo-ingredients in the bacterial flora may be altered  by their combined administration. we investigated 1199 prescriptions including kampo-medicines for 308 patients. combination use of kampo-medicines with antibiotics and bacterial preparations occurred with 7% and 10% of the kampo-prescription, respectively. most antibiotics have activity against intestinal bacteria, except that cephems and macrolides are not active against to e. coli. this means that antibiotics may lower the metabolism of gl, sen and bl when administered in combination. on the other hand, it is also highly possible that bacterial preparations increase the number of eubacterium sp. and bifidobacterium sp., resulting in enhanced metabolism of gl and sen when they are used concomitantly with kampo-medicines. the present results suggested that the drug interactions of kampo-medicines with antibiotics and bacterial preparations  should be confirmed in clinical studies.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in human tungiasis.
AB  == tungiasis is caused by penetration of the female sand flea tunga penetrans into the epidermis of its host. it is endemic in many countries in latin america, the  caribbean and sub-saharan africa. although superinfection is a common clinical observation, the frequency and the pattern of bacterial pathogens associated with tungiasis have never been investigated systematically. we conducted a prospective clinico-bacteriological study with patients living in a shantytown in fortaleza,  capital of ceara state (northeast brazil), where tungiasis is hyperendemic. swabs were taken from 78 patients with multiple lesions after surgical extraction of the parasite, and the specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. ninety-nine specimens were investigated for aerobic bacteria, from which 146 pathogens were identified. the most common species were staphyloccous aureus (35.5%) and various enterobacteriaceae (29.5%). bacillus sp., enteroccous faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas sp. were also isolated. eighty-four anaerobic cultures yielded 20 pathogens: in eight cases we  detected peptostreptococcus sp., in seven cases clostridium sp., and in five cases non-identifiable gram-negative bacilli. these results show that secondary infection is very common in tungiasis, and caused by a variety of highly pathogenic microorganisms. it is proposed that t. penetrans acts as a foreign body facilitating biofilm formation within the epidermis. to prevent spreading of pathogens to the surrounding tissue and/or the systemic circulation, sand fleas should be surgically extracted immediately after penetration.

TI  == the effect of condensed tannins from lotus pedunculatus and lotus corniculatus on the growth of proteolytic rumen bacteria in vitro and their possible mode of action.
AB  == five strains of proteolytic rumen bacteria were treated with condensed tannins (ct) purified from lotus pedunculatus and lotus corniculatus to investigate their effect on the growth of these bacteria in vitro. streptococcus bovis ncfb 2476, eubacterium sp. c124b, prevotella bryantii b14, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c, and clostridium proteoclasticum b316t were tested against 200, 400, and 600 microg ct x ml(-1) extracted from l. pedunculatus and l. corniculatus. in the absence of ct, all bacterial strains showed typical growth and reached maximum optical density (od) after 6-8 h of incubation in a plant protein medium. growth  of eubacterium sp., p. bryantii, and b. fibrisolvens was inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) more by the ct from l. pedunculatus than by the ct from l. corniculatus. all strains continued to grow in the presence of 200 microg x ml(-1) of the ct from l. pedunculatus, but attained significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) lower maximum od600 values than (minus ct) controls, except for s. bovis. at 400  and 600 microg x ml(-1), the addition of ct from l. pedunculatus inhibited (p < 0.05-0.001) the growth of all bacterial strains tested compared with controls. the growth of eubacterium sp. and p. bryantii was stimulated for the first 4-6 h  of incubation (p < 0.001) by 200 microg x ml(-1) of ct from l. corniculatus, but  then declined leading to a significant difference in od values compared with the  controls. at 400 microg x ml(-1), the ct from l. corniculatus reduced (p < 0.05-0.01) the growth of all strains except s. bovis, while 600 microg x ml(-1) inhibited (p < 0.01-0.001) the growth of all strains. to study the mechanism of ct action, the degradation of the large subunit (lsu) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco; fraction 1 leaf protein) was followed after bacterial cells or rubisco were preincubated with ct  extracted from l. corniculatus and l. pedunculatus. both preincubations decreased lsu degradation, but they differed in their response to polyethylene glycol (peg) addition. addition of peg to ct-rubisco preincubations negated the effects of ct, while peg addition to ct-bacteria preincubations did not. this implies that the ct-bacterial interaction is stronger than the ct-rubisco interaction or the interaction is of a different type. also, l. pedunculatus ct reduced the degradation of the lsu to a greater extent than the ct from l. corniculatus when  preincubated with bacteria.

TI  == expression of bacterial beta-glucuronidase in human bile: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: bacterial beta-glucuronidase causes deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide resulting in the precipitation of calcium bilirubinate, which contributes to biliary sludge and stone formation. this process is attributed to  enzyme activity produced by the aerobic enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli and klebsiella sp. the presence of clostridium sp. was detected in 48 of 56  intrahepatic stones by using polymerase chain reaction techniques and cultured clostridium perfringens from 14 of 18 unblocked biliary stents. such bacteria are reported to produce beta-glucuronidase activity. the aim of this study was to determine the proportion of biliary bacteria isolated from pigment stones and stents that produce beta-glucuronidase and to compare the enzyme activity expressed by the different bacteria in human bile. methods: a total of 202 bacteria were isolated from blocked and unblocked biliary stents and pigment ductal stones recovered from patients. of these, 61 bacteria expressed beta-glucuronidase activity in brain heart infusion broth. these 61 bacteria were subsequently grown in human bile under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to the early stationary phase and assayed for beta-glucuronidase activity by using rho-nitrophenyl beta-d glucuronide as substrate. results were normalized and reported as units of enzyme activity per milligram protein of the bacteria. results: c. perfringens produced beta-glucuronidase enzyme activity that was 34-fold higher than that for e coli, staphylococcus, corynebacterium sp., bacillus sp., enterococcus sp., acinetobacter sp., streptococcus sp., and klebsiella sp. conclusion: c. perfringens with its higher enzyme activity is more important in the deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide than e coli and klebsiella sp.

AB  == because of the increasing number of renal transplantations performed and the rarity of reported cases of infective endocarditis in these patients, we studied  the clinical characteristics of this infection in this population. we report on two cases from our experience and review reported cases of infective endocarditis in renal transplant recipients retrieved from the medline system. in addition, we reviewed a large series of infective endocarditis looking for patients with renal transplants. in addition to our 2 cases, 12 previously reported cases were found. the mean time from transplantation to diagnosis of infective endocarditis was 3.5 years (range 2 months to 15 years). causative organisms included fungi, staphylococcus aureus (3 cases each), corynebacterium sp. (2 cases), streptococcus viridans, vre, brucella sp., clostridium sp., nocardia sp. and erysipelothrix sp. (one case each). skin manifestations of endocarditis and/or splenomegaly were not reported in these patients. septic emboli and mycotic aneurysms were relatively common. the overall mortality rate was 50% (7 of 14 patients died). infective endocarditis seems to be rare in renal transplant recipients. the few reported cases are characterized by unusual causative micro-organisms and atypical clinical presentation. further studies are needed to delineate the magnitude and scope of this association.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

TI  == [results of treatment of deep neck abscesses and phlegmons].
AB  == introduction: neck, as a structure very closely connected with oral cavity and pharynx, with great number of lymph nodes, (about 2, 3 of all are in the neck), is sometimes a localization of purulent inflammatory process but its incidence is not so high as the incidence of inflammations of surrounding organs and tissue. deep neck abscesses are localized under the upper fascial layer. they have a serious clinical picture which could be further complicated if inflammation spreads on vessels or neck organs. if the processes spread toward the mediastinum because of the communication space between medial and deep fascial layer with mediastinum, it could be mediastinal inflammation with high mortality. the aim of this study is evaluation of results of treatment in patients with deep neck abscesses and phlegmons treated at clinic in a ten year period (1988-1997). material and methods: this study comprised 21 patients who were treated at the ent clinic in novi sad during 1988-1997. the group consisted of 5 female and 16 male patients from one to 65 years of age. sixteen (76.2%) patients were treated  with antibiotics in general practice, and 5 were admitted without previous therapy, 8 patients were afebrile, with temperatures between 37-38 degrees c and  5 with fever and high temperature. in 17 patients 5 days passed from onset of symptoms to admittance at the clinic, and 4 patients had enlarged neck lymph nodes a few months. unknown primary site of infections were in 13 (61.9%) patients, that means abscesses developed as colliquation of inflammatory changed  lymph node. in the rest of 8 patients abscesses developed as: oropharyngeal inflammation (4 patients), foreign body perforation of esophagus, chronic otitis  media, neck injury, malignant lymphoma. lateral side of the neck was the most frequent site of neck abscesses and phlegmon in 16 (76%) patients. red skin over  the abscesses didn't appear in 4 patients. in 2 patients neck emphysema developed: anaerobic inflammation in one patient and esophageal perforation in the second. in a patient with se over the 50 per hour the length of the abscess was over 7 cm, and in those with se over 100 per hour, the whole neck inflammed.  all patients underwent surgical therapy between 24 to 48 h after admission with incision or excision of the abscesses. pus was collected for culture during the incision or excision of the abscesses and phlegmon. bacteria were discovered in specimens taken during the incision in 4 (19%) of patients. different aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated: enterococcus, peptostreptococcus sp, streptococcus viridans, clostridium species. surgery was the basic therapy of neck phlegmons and abscesses. in all patients incision was sutured in the second  stage. only one patient got paralysis of n. accesorius. one patient died with gas gangrene of the neck. discussion and conclusion: deep neck abscesses and phlegmons are relatively rare inflammations in spite of high incidence of surrounding tissue inflammations. the most frequent causes are inflammatory changes of lymph nodes. treatment has to be urgent, because of vital neck structures and communications between deep neck space and mediastinum. we consider that surgery is the basic principle of therapy although we have not had  experience with needle aspiration. antimicrobial agents must be given only parenterally.

(cncm i-841) isolated from a commercial probiotic product was shown to be antagonistic towards several food-borne pathogens including clostridium sp. and listeria monocytogenes. this strain produced and excreted an antibacterial substance in mrs broth. the inhibitory substance was different from hydrogen peroxide, since it was unaffected by catalase. it was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, indicating that the active moiety of the inhibitor was proteinaceous in nature, and it had no effect on its  producer strain. these properties suggested that the inhibitory substance could be considered as a bacteriocin-like substance. the antimicrobial substance was also produced in m17 and tryptose broths if they were supplemented with tween-80. partial purification allowed a 10.5-fold increase in the specific activity. a preliminary characterization showed that it was active against lactobacilli, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium sp. and listeria sp. it was not affected by 2-h treatment at 60 degrees c, but was sensitive to treatments at 100 degrees c and to autoclaving at 121 degrees c. the activity was not affected by treatments  at ph values ranging from 2 to 11.

TI  == isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of lactobacillus acidophilus lf221.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus lf221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: bacillus cereus, clostridium sp., listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus d. l. acidophilus lf221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin lf221 a and acidocin lf221 b, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase fplc. the  antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase k) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide a and 35 of peptide b were determined. among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. no significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin lf221 a and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology  was found between acidocin lf221 b and brevicin 27. l. acidophilus lf221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.

TI  == the intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  == bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. in infants delivered by caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. the first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which  remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. among them, staphylococcus,  enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from  the newborn faecal flora at birth. facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by bifidobacterium sp. clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a caesarean section. clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as bacteroides and other clostridium sp. the impact of caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. in humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. formula feeding seems  to promote implantation and persistence of clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of c. difficile in newborns.

TI  == culture of intraluminal thrombus during abdominal aortic aneurysm resection: significant contamination is rare.
AB  == the significance of positive bacterial cultures from intraluminal thrombus in patients undergoing repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm remains controversial. over the last 4 years, thrombus was cultured during aneurysm repair in 116 patients. all patients received cephalosporin antibiotic before and for 48 h after operation. although none of the aneurysms appeared to be clinically infected, six patients (5.2%) had positive cultures. four groups were identified  based on the bacteria cultured: group i, coagulase-negative staphylococci, light  growth (three patients); group ii, coagulase-negative staphylococci, light growth and 'streptococcus viridans' (one patient); group iii, bacillus sp., heavy growth (gram-negative stain) (one patient); group iv, clostridium perfringens, occasional growth (one patient). one of the six patients died during resection; the other five are alive without graft infection at 5-24 (mean 12) months after operation. the absence of graft infection suggests that positive cultures were not clinically significant or were adequately covered by the antibiotic prophylaxis. the incidence of positive cultures was lower than previously reported. routine culture of aneurysm thrombus in the absence of clinical infection is probably not cost-effective.

TI  == abdominal pain associated with an umbilical abscess in a llama.
AB  == a 3-month-old llama with a presenting complaint of lethargy, anorexia, and a painful, distended abdomen was evaluated. the llama had intermittently strained to defecate during the 3 days prior to admission. physical examination results, hematologic data and lateral abdominal radiographs were used to diagnose a large  umbilical abscess, which was causing a partial obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. under general anesthesia, 3 liters of purulent exudate were drained from the abscess. the abscess cavity was then lavaged with saline solution and its capsule was marsupialized to the skin. cultures of the abscess content yielded proteus sp, streptococcus equisimilis, and clostridium septicum.  two days after surgery, the llama was drinking, eating, and passing feces. the abscess was lavaged daily for a total of 11 days. six months after surgery, the llama was the same size as other llamas of the same age, and the owners were pleased with the cosmetic appearance of the ventral abdomen. umbilical abscesses  can vary in size and clinical presentation; they should be recognized as a possible cause of abdominal pain with a potential for causing intestinal obstruction in llamas.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). only one strain each of enterococcus faecium and pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and clostridium perfringens. both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, streptococcus pyogenes and bacteroides sp. all other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin  which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == a randomized prospective study of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with or without teicoplanin as an empiric antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients.
AB  == febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a hickman line-associated infection. at 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol  violation or death due to other causes. a total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. the diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (34), hodgkin's disease  (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), escherichia coli (13), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), klebsiella sp. (3), enterobacter cloacae (2), streptococcus faecalis (2), ent. adenocarboxylata (1), clostridium septicum (1). strept. b (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and p. fluorescens (1), in-vitro testing showed that all  gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. there were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), strep. sangius (1), strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and p. maltophilia (1). both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. there is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. in view of the very high incidence of gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that  teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in  all febrile neutropenic patients.

TI  == a54145 a new lipopeptide antibiotic complex: microbiological evaluation.
AB  == a54145 complex is made up of eight factors; a, a1, b, b1, c, d, e, and f which were active in vitro (mic 0.25 approximately greater than 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive aerobic organisms. the complex, factor b and b1 were found  to be active against two strains of clostridium perfringens. a calcium dependence study on some of the factors showed that their in vitro antibacterial activity was greatly enhanced by the presence of calcium (50 mg/liter) in the media. resistance build-up was seen when staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp. were passed seven times in the presence of sublethal concentrations of a54145 antibiotics. this resistance disappeared immediately when the resistant organisms were passed in the absence of the antibiotics. factor a was very effective against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes infections in mice (sc ed50s of 3.3 approximately 2.4 mg/kg x 2, respectively). factor b was more active against s. pyogenes in vivo (sc ed50, 0.9 mg/kg x 2). acute mouse toxicities were determined with these antibiotics. semisynthetic derivatives were evaluated.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

(6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

TI  == antimicrobial substance from a human lactobacillus strain.
AB  == lactobacillus sp. strain gg, which was isolated from the feces of a normal person, produced a substance with potent inhibitory activity against a wide range of bacterial species. it inhibited anaerobic bacteria (clostridium spp., bacteroides spp., bifidobacterium spp.), members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp. staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus spp., as demonstrated by a microbiological assay; however, it did not inhibit other lactobacilli. the inhibitory activity occurred between ph 3 and 5 and was heat stable. bactericidal activity against escherichia coli was demonstrated at a dilution of 1:128. the inhibitory substance was distinct from lactic and acetic acids. it had a low molecular weight (less than 1,000) and was soluble in acetone-water (10:1). because of these characteristics, the inhibitory material could not be considered a bacteriocin; it most closely resembled a microcin, which has been associated previously with members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == twenty-six pediatric patients with osteomyelitis caused by anaerobic bacteria are presented. the etiologic factors were chronic mastoiditis (7 patients), decubitus ulcers (5), chronic sinusitis (4), periodontal abscesses (3), bites (3), paronychia (2), trauma (1) and scalp infection after fetal monitoring (1). seventy-four organisms (2.8 isolates/specimen), including 63 anaerobes (2.4/specimen), and 11 facultative and aerobic bacteria (0.4/specimen) were recovered. the predominant organisms were anaerobic cocci (29 isolates), bacteroides sp. (21), fusobacterium sp. (8), streptococcus sp. (5) and clostridium sp. (4). the organisms generally reflected the microbial flora of the mucous surface adjacent to the infected site. ten beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 7 (27%) patients. these included all isolates of the bacteroides fragilis (4) and of staphylococcus aureus (3), 2 of the 12 bacteroides melaninogenicus group and 1 of 3 bacteroides oralis. the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of anaerobic osteomyelitis in children are discussed.

AB  == the activities of four enzymes (beta-glucuronidase, nitrate reductase and nitroreductase) in selected intestinal bacteria (escherichia coli, clostridium sp., streptococcus sp., bacteroides sp. and lactobacillus salivarius) were measured after growth in vitro and in vivo. the five strains differed in their activities with clostridium sp. being the most active for beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and nitroreductase, and e. coli the most active producer of nitrate reductase. enzyme activity in vivo tended to be higher than in vitro but  there were instances where the comparative activities were reversed.

TI  == the antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  == to test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a proteus sp., an erysipelothrix sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae. tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal  doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma  concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. the intracutaneous injection of fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to  this effect. the in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low mic; a low mic was sometimes associated with little action and a high mic with moderate action. sixteen organisms were tested. the iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of  e. rhusiopathiae. in only one case, with a strain of proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. on the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and c. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-c streptococcus and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, e. rhusiopathiae and a. hydrophila. it is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate  excess of readily available fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement  of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. mics were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of enterobacteriaceae, with mode mics  varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for enterobacter. only a few resistant strains were  found, mainly among enterobacter and citrobacter. ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter (mode mics: 16 micrograms/ml). haemophilus sp. and gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic less than 0.008-0.032). ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other streptococci and pneumococci had low mics (0.03-0.25). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes (clostridium: 0.06-2, bacteroides: 0.5-32). our data show that its particularly strong activity against proteus, haemophilus and neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other  third-generation cephalosporins.

TI  == in vitro effects of sulphasalazine, azodisal sodium, and their metabolites on clostridium difficile and some other faecal bacteria.
AB  == the effects of sulphasalazine (sasp), azodisal sodium (ads), and their metabolites were tested in vitro on aerobic and anaerobic faecal bacterial strains. sulphapyridine (sp) had a mild to moderate effect on escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. sasp also had a growth-inhibitory effect on strep. faecalis. the other substances had no effect on the aerobic strains. sasp, sp, 5-aminosalicylic acid, and, to a certain extent, n-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid exerted a growth-inhibitory effect on the anaerobic strains. of special interest  was the inhibitory effect on clostridium difficile strains. in recent years the possibility that overgrowth of cl. difficile could cause flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease has been discussed. some studies suggested that sasp treatment could predispose to cl. difficile superinfection, whereas others found  sasp more probable to exert a prophylactic effect. our findings support the theory that sasp treatment reduces rather than promotes the risk of cl. difficile superinfection.

TI  == a novel iga protease from clostridium sp. capable of cleaving iga1 and iga2 a2m(1) but not iga2 a2m(2) allotype paraproteins.
AB  == three bacterial strains of bifidobacterium and clostridium sp. from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (i.b.d.) and streptococcus pneumoniae from a patient with pneumonia were identified to produce extracellular proteases cleaving iga into fab and fc fragments. although the proteases from the bifidobacterium and the streptococcus pneumoniae showed the characteristics of typical iga1 proteases, cleaving the iga of only the iga1 subclass, the protease from clostridium sp. revealed a dual substrate specificity, in that it cleaved both iga1 and iga2 of the a2m(1) allotype. the latter protease, however, did not show  any activity with respect to the iga2 of the a2m(2) allotype. fc fragments isolated from the iga1 and the iga2 a2m(1) by digestion with the clostridium sp.  protease were identified to have an identical amino terminal residue of valine. the site of cleavage in both the alpha 1 and the alpha 2 of a2m(1) by the protease was assumed to be an identical peptide bond at pro(221)-val(222), which  is a common one present just before the hinge of both the alpha 1 and the alpha 2 of the a2m(1) but not of the alpha 2 of the a2m(2). the protease was sensitive to ethylene-diamino tetraacetic acid, a chelating agent, similar to other already reported iga1 proteases.

(including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.

AB  == this study reports bacterial specimens obtained from 112 children presenting with a ruptured appendix. additional samples were studied from 11 of these patients who developed a postoperative surgical draining wound. bacterial growth occurred  in 100 peritoneal fluid specimens. anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 14 specimens, aerobes alone in 12, and mixed aerobic an anerobic flora in 74 specimens. there were 144 aerobic isolates (1.4 per specimen). the predominant isolates were: e. coli (57 specimens); alpha-hemolytic steptococcus (16 specimens); gamma-hemolytic streptococcus (15 specimens); group d streptococcus (12 specimens); and p. aeruginosa (9 specimens). there were 301 anaerobic isolates (three per specimen). the predominant isolates were: 157 bacteroides spp. (including 92 b. fragilis group and 26 b. melaninogenicus group); 62 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (including 30 peptococcus sp.; 29 peptostreptococcus sp.); 27 fusobactenium sp.; and 16 clostridium sp. b. fragilis and peptococcus sp. occurred in 23 patients. beta lactamase production was detectable in 98 isolates recovered from 74 patients. these included all isolates of b. fragilis and six of the 23 bacteroides sp. forty-nine organisms (16 aerobic and 33 anaerobic) were recovered from the draining wounds. the predominant organisms were: b. fragilis (8 specimens); e. coli (6 specimens); peptostreptococcus sp. (5 specimens); and three specimens each of p. aeruginosa and peptococcus sp. most of these isolates were also recovered from the peritoneal cavity of the patients. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of peritoneal cavity and postoperative wound flora in children with perforated appendix, and demonstrate the presence of beta lactamase-producing organisms in three-fourths of the patients.

TI  == controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  == a cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. it operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through  a short orifice. if the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. the disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by stansted fluid power limited, stansted, england. phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including chlorella, aspergillus fumigatis, fusarium sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus zooepidermicus and staphylococcus aureus. the cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. the applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. the case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.

TI  == increase in the population of duodenal immunoglobulin a plasmocytes in axenic mice associated with different living or dead bacterial strains of intestinal origin.
AB  == various bacterial strains were tested for their ability to stimulate immunoglobulin a (iga) plasmocytes to populate the duodenal lamina propria in axenic mice. the mice were associated with the strains for at least 4 weeks. the  strains inhabiting the conventional mouse intestine and belonging to the genera lactobacillus, streptococcus, eubacterium, actinobacillus, micrococcus, corynebacterium, and clostridium (including the extremely oxygen-sensitive ones)  are only slightly or nonimmunogenic, whereas the strains belonging to the genera  bacteroides and escherichia have an immunogenic effect. the same result was obtained with bacteroides and escherichia strains isolated from the digestive tract of other animal species. the kinetics of appearance of intestinal iga plasmocytes are similar in axenic mice monoassociated with a stimulatory strain and in conventional mice. the association of two or more strains with axenic mice leads either to the same or a greater number of duodenal iga plasmocytes as that  obtained with the most stimulatory strain monoassociated with axenic mice. the maximum stimulation recorded in all of these trials represents about two-thirds of that observed in conventional mice and was obtained in the duodenum of gnotoxenic mice harboring four bacterial strains isolated from the conventional mouse microflora. the orally administered killed cells of two immunogenic strains, e. coli and bacteroides sp., are as immunogenic as the living cells, provided that their concentration in the digestive tract is sufficient.

AB  == an examination of the fecal microflora of adult swine was made with regard to the efficiency of several roll tube media in enumeration and recovery of anaerobes, the effects of medium constituents on recovery, and the isolation and identification of the predominant kinds of bacteria. total number of organisms by microscopic bacterial counts varied among fecal samples from 4.48 x 10(10) to 7.40 x 10(10) bacteria/g (wet weight). comparison of different nonselective roll  tube media indicated that about 30% of the fecal bacteria could be recovered with a rumen fluid (40%, vol/vol) medium (m98-5). recoveries of 21 and 15%, respectively, were obtained with m10 and rumen fluid-glucose-cellobiose agar (rgca) media. rumen fluid, trypticase, sugars, and co2 gas phase were important components required for maximum recovery with this medium. similar high recoveries of anaerobes were also obtained with m98-5 containing swine cecal extract of place in rumen fluid or m10 plus swine cecal extract. significantly lower recoveries were observed with rcga, media supplemented with swine fecal extracts, reinforced clostridial medium, brain heart infusion agar, and prereduced blood agar. ninety percent of the bacteria isolated from roll tube media were gram positive and consisted of facultatively anaerobic streptococci, eubacterium sp., clostridium sp., and propionibacterium acnes. the remainder of the flora (8%) included several other species of anaerobes and escherichia coli.  rumen fluid (or volatile fatty acids), trypticase, and yeast extract additions to basal media stimulated the growth of anaerobic strains. variation in the relative proportions of the predominant fecal microflora was observed. this work indicates that satisfactory enumeration, isolation and cultivation of the predominant microflora in swine feces can be obtained when strict anaerobic culture methods and a rumen fluid medium are used.

TI  == characterization of anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria isolated from freshwater lake sediments.
AB  == strict anaerobic culture techniques were used to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria present at the sediment-water interface of hyperutrophic wintergreen lake (augusta, mich.). anaerobic plate counts remained constant from march through december, 1973, ranging from 2.4 x 10(6) to 5.7 x 10(6) organisms/g (dry weight) of sediment. the isolatable bacteria represented a small percentage of the total microbial community, which was shown by direct microscopic counts to be 2.0 x 10'' organisms/g (dry weight)  of sediment during june and july. bacteria of the genus clostridium dominated the isolates obtained, accounting for 71.8% of the 960 isolates examined. a single species, clostridium bifermentens, comprised 47.7% of the total. additional bacterial groups and the percentage in which they were isolated included: streptococcus sp. (10.8%), unidentified curved rods (9.5%y, gram-positive nonsporing rods (5.6%), and motile gram-negative rods (1.9%). temperature growth  studies demonstrated the ability of all the isolates to grow at in situ sediment  temperatures. gas-liqid radiochromatography was used to determine the soluble metabolic end products from [u-14c]glucose and a u-14c-labeled amino acid mixture by representative sedimentary clostridial isolates and by natural sediment microbial communities. at in situ temperatures the natural sediment microflora produced soluble fermentative end products characteristic of those elaborated by  the clostridial isolates tested. these results are considered strong presumptive  evidence that clostridia are actively metabolizing in the sediments of wintergreen lake.
