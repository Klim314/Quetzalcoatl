TI  == shewanella halifaxensis sp. nov., a novel obligately respiratory and denitrifying psychrophile.
AB  == indigenous bacteria found in the sediment of the emerald basin (depth of 215 m, atlantic ocean) located offshore of halifax harbour (nova scotia, canada) were previously found to be able to degrade the explosive compound hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (rdx). in the present study, a novel obligately respiratory, denitrifying and rdx-mineralizing bacterium, designated strain haw-eb4(t), was isolated from the marine sediment. this bacterium utilized peptone, yeast extract, casamino acids, esters (tweens 20, 40 and 80), sugars (n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, ribose), several c2 and c3 acids (acetate, pyruvate, lactate, propionate) and amino acids (serine, proline) as sole carbon and energy  sources. aerobically grown cells (in marine broth 2216 at 10 degrees c) contained c(14 : 0) (6 %), iso-c(15 : 0) (12 %), c(16 : 0) (20 %), c(16 : 1)omega7 (37 %),  c(18 : 1)omega7 (7 %) and c(20 : 5)omega3 (7 %) as major membrane fatty acids, and q7 (28.1 %) and mk-7 (60.9 %) as dominant respiratory quinones, consistent with deep-sea species of shewanella. the novel bacterium had a dna g+c content of 45 mol% and showed similarity to shewanella species in terms of 16s rrna and gyrb gene sequences (93-99 and 67.3-88.4 % similarity, respectively), with shewanella  pealeana being the most closely related species. genomic dna-dna hybridization between strain haw-eb4t and s. pealeana revealed a level of relatedness of 17.9 %, lower than the 70 % species cut-off value, indicating that strain haw-eb4t (=  ncimb 14093t = dsm 17350t) is the type strain of a novel species of shewanella, for which the name shewanella halifaxensis sp. nov. is proposed.

TI  == shewanella fidelis sp. nov., isolated from sediments and sea water.
AB  == two marine bacterial strains, kmm 3582t and kmm 3589, isolated respectively from  sediments of the south china sea and sea water of the sea of japan, have been characterized. comparative 16s rdna sequence-based phylogenetic analysis placed the two strains in a separate branch of the gamma-proteobacteria within the members of the genus shewanella. kmm 3582t showed the highest similarity (97.1 and 97.4%, respectively) to shewanella pealeana and shewanella gelidimarina. the  g + c contents of the dnas of the two strains studied were 45.0 mol%. the level of dna-dna relatedness between the two strains was 82%, indicating that they represent a single genospecies. these organisms were slightly pinkish, gram-negative, polarly flagellated, facultatively anaerobic, mesophilic (with temperature range from 4 to 30 degrees c), neutrophilic and haemolytic and were able to degrade alginate, gelatin and dna. the novel organisms were susceptible to gentamicin, lincomycin, oleandomycin, streptomycin and polymyxin. the predominant fatty acids were characteristic for shewanellae: 13 : 0-i, 15 : 0-i,  16 : 0 and 16 : 1omega7. eicosapentaenoic acid, 20 : 5omega3, was not detected. phylogenetic evidence, together with phenotypic characteristics, showed that the  two bacteria constitute a novel species of the genus shewanella. the name shewanella fidelis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain kmm 3582t (=lmg 20551t =atcc baa-318t).

TI  == shewanella marinintestina sp. nov., shewanella schlegeliana sp. nov. and shewanella sairae sp. nov., novel eicosapentaenoic-acid-producing marine bacteria isolated from sea-animal intestines.
AB  == three novel shewanella species are described on the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic studies. a total of six novel halophilic, aerobic organisms with the ability to produce eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) were isolated from various sea animals in japan. cells of all six isolates were gram-negative,  rod-shaped and motile by means of polar flagella. they were able to produce large amounts of epa (about 20% of the total fatty acids) and had isoprenoid quinones q-7 and q-8 as major components. analysis of the nearly complete 16s rrna gene sequences of the novel isolates showed that they are very close phylogenetically  (sequence similarity > 99%) and the closest species was shewanella pealeana, with 97% sequence similarity. however, analysis of gyrb sequences indicated that the novel isolates were divided into three groups at sufficient phylogenetic distance to indicate that they are different species (< 90% sequence similarity). dna-dna  hybridization experiments supported this conclusion. the first group (three strains) had positive reactions for lipase, dnase, onpg and trimethylamine oxide  (tmao) reduction and had g + c contents of 43 mol% (determined by hplc). the second group (two strains) was positive for urease, dnase, onpg and tmao reduction but not lipase. their g + c content was 45 mol%. the third group (one strain) was negative for onpg, dnase and tmao reduction and had a g + c content of 43 mol%. strains of the second group, but not those of the first or third groups, grew at 32 degrees c. on the basis of the polyphasic taxonomic data, the  novel strains isolated from intestines of sea animals are placed in three novel species of the genus shewanella: shewanella marinintestina sp. nov. (type strain: jcm 11558t =lmg 21403t), shewanella schlegeliana sp. nov. (type strain: jcm 11561t =lmg 21406t) and shewanella sairae sp. nov. (type strain: jcm 11563t =lmg  21408t).

TI  == shewanella pealeana sp. nov., a member of the microbial community associated with the accessory nidamental gland of the squid loligo pealei.
AB  == a new, mesophillic, facultatively anaerobic, psychrotolerant bacterium, strain ang-sq1t (t = type strain), was isolated from a microbial community colonizing the accessory nidamental gland of the squid loligo pealei. it was selected from the community on the basis of its ability to reduce elemental sulfur. the cells are motile, gram-negative rods (2.0-3.0 microns long, 0.4-0.6 micron wide). ang-sq1t grows optimally over the temperature range of 25-30 degrees c and a ph range of 6.5-7.5 degrees c in media containing 0.5 m nacl. 16s rrna sequence analysis revealed that this organism belongs to the gamma-3 subclass of the proteobacteria. the closest relative of ang-sq1t is shewanella gelidimarina, with a 16s rrna sequence similarity of 97.0%. growth occurs with glucose, lactate, acetate, pyruvate, glutamate, citrate, succinate, casamino acids, yeast extract or peptone as sole energy source under aerobic conditions. the isolate grows anaerobically by the reduction of iron, manganese, nitrate, fumarate, trimethylamine-n-oxide, thiosulfate or elemental sulfur as terminal electron acceptor with lactate. growth of ang-sq1t was enhanced by the addition of choline chloride to growth media lacking casamino acids. the addition of leucine or valine also enhanced growth in minimal growth media supplemented with choline. the results of both phenotypic and genetic characterization indicate that ang-sq1t is a shewanella species. thus it is proposed that this new isolate be assigned to the genus shewanella and that it should be named shewanella pealeana  sp. nov., in recognition of its association with l. pealei.

TI  == polyphasic taxonomy of the genus shewanella and description of shewanella oneidensis sp. nov.
AB  == the genus shewanella has been studied since 1931 with regard to a variety of topics of relevance to both applied and environmental microbiology. recent years  have seen the introduction of a large number of new shewanella-like isolates, necessitating a coordinated review of the genus. in this work, the phylogenetic relationships among known shewanellae were examined using a battery of morphological, physiological, molecular and chemotaxonomic characterizations. this polyphasic taxonomy takes into account all available phenotypic and genotypic data and integrates them into a consensus classification. based on information generated from this study and obtained from the literature, a scheme  for the identification of shewanella species has been compiled. key phenotypic characteristics were sulfur reduction and halophilicity. fatty acid and quinone profiling were used to impart an additional layer of information. molecular characterizations employing small-subunit 16s rdna sequences were at the limits of resolution for the differentiation of species in some cases. as a result, dna-dna hybridization and sequence analyses of a more rapidly evolving molecule (gyrb gene) were performed. species-specific pcr probes were designed for the gyrb gene and used for the rapid screening of closely related strains. with this  polyphasic approach, in addition to the ten described shewanella species, two new species, shewanella oneidensis and 'shewanella pealeana', were recognized; shewanella oneidensis sp. nov. is described here for the first time.
