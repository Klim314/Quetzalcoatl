TI  - Quantifying the forces guiding microbial cell adhesion using single-cell force spectroscopy.
AB  - During the past decades, several methods (e.g., electron microscopy, flow chamber experiments, surface chemical analysis, surface charge and surface hydrophobicity measurements) have been developed to investigate the mechanisms controlling the adhesion of microbial cells to other cells and to various other substrates. However, none of the traditional approaches are capable of looking at adhesion forces at the single-cell level. In recent years, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been instrumental in measuring the forces driving microbial adhesion on a single-cell basis. The method, known as single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS), consists of immobilizing a single living cell on an AFM cantilever and measuring the interaction forces between the cellular probe and a solid substrate or another cell. Here we present SCFS protocols that we have developed for quantifying the cell adhesion forces of medically important microbes. Although we focus mainly on the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum, we also show that our procedures are applicable to pathogens, such as the bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis and the yeast Candida albicans. For well-trained microscopists, the entire protocol can be mastered in 1 week.
TI  - [Disorganization of biofilms of clinical strains of staphylococci by metabolites  of lactobacilli].
AB  - AIM: To study morpho-physiologic characteristics of clinical biofilm-forming strains of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis suppressed by metabolites of lactobacilli, which produce bacteriocin-like substances. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two clinical biofilm-forming strains of S. aureus and one strain of S. epidermidis were used. Strains Lactobacillus plantarum L3 and L. fermentum 97 were used as producers of bactericidal metabolites. Ability of staphylococci to form biofilms was studied after their growth during 18 h at 37 degrees C in beef-extract broth with subsequent registration of biofilms attached to walls and bottom of polystyrene plate and stained by 0.1% alcohol solution of crystal violet. Ultrastructural changes in target cells were visualized by electron microscopy. RESULTS: Suppressive effect of lactobacilli metabolites on formation of biofilms by staphylococci was established. Ultrasructural changes, which characterize disorganization of vital processes such as mitosis, synthesis of DNA and peptidoglycan layer, were revealed in target cells. Formation and detachment of peptidoglycan globules from cell wall surface externally were noted. CONCLUSION: Metabolites of lactobacilli are able to suppress formation of biofilms and induce ultrastructural changes in S. aureus and S. epidermidis, which lead to their destruction.
TI  - Neonatal cord blood subsets and cytokine response to bacterial antigens.
AB  - We compared lymphocyte subsets and cytokine responses to bacteria among term, preterm infants, and adults. Lymphocyte subset percentages in cord blood (22 preterm, 27 term neonates) and peripheral blood from 21 adults and cytokine/chemokine interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, interferon gamma (IFN gamma) responses to Escherichia coli, group B Streptococcus (GBS), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Lactobacillus plantarum (Lp299v) were assessed by flow cytometry. Preterm compared with term infants had increased CD8 (+) T cells (p = 0.02) and reduced naive CD4 (+) T cells (p < 0.0001). Memory T and natural killer (NK) T cells were reduced (p < 0.001) in neonates; NK and CD56 (+)161 (+) NK cells were increased (p < 0.001). CD56 (+)CD8 (+) NK cells were higher in preterm compared with term infants. Despite individual exceptions, cytokine responses in neonates were weaker than adults except for IL-8 response to E. coli in preterm and IL-12 response to Lp299v in term infants. IL-10 responses were weaker in preterm (p = 0.01) and term (p = 0.005) infants to S. epidermidis and to E. coli (p = 0.03 for both) compared with adults. Differences in regulatory subpopulations of NK and T cells between neonates and adults and term compared with preterm infants were observed. These differences rather than intrinsic functional deficiency may account for neonatal cytokine responses to bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  - The present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a R. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. The bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis and Ent. faecium, and Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli) while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. The Lactobacillus plantarum and L. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. While L. plantarum CRL 1606 also inhibited red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. However, by using a MRS medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. The surface properties of Lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate ABO human erythrocytes, while the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. This paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of Lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.
TI  - Cytokine expression in response to bacterial antigens in preterm and term infant  cord blood monocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal susceptibility to bacterial infection is associated with an  immature immune system, but the role of different bacterial antigens in specific responses is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in intracellular cytokine response to physiologically relevant bacterial antigens in term and preterm infants as compared with adults. METHODS: Cord blood samples from preterm and term neonates and adult peripheral blood samples were cultured ex vivo with and without whole heat-killed bacteria. Intracellular leukocyte production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-8 responses was assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Monocytes were the primary producers of all mediators. Escherichia coli was the most potent stimulant. Lactobacillus plantarum 299v activated fewer monocytes as compared with E. coli for all responses (p < 0.05), except for IL-12 in term neonates. IL-6 response to Staphylococcus epidermidis was lower in both groups of neonates as compared with adults (p = 0.023 and p = 0.001). IL-8 response to S. epidermidis was lower in term as compared with preterm neonates and adults (p = 0.003). IL-10 response to group B streptococci was lower in term neonates as compared with adults and higher in preterm as compared with term neonates (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Monocytes from term neonates compared to preterm neonates show a downregulated anti-inflammatory response to specific bacteria. High neonatal response to pathogenic E. coli in the preterm infant could cause uncontrolled inflammatory response, while lower IL-6 response to S. epidermidis in neonates may indicate a basis for vulnerability to S. epidermidis infection.
TI  - [Regulation of nitrogen metabolism in gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - We searched for new members of the TnrA and GlnR regulons controlling assimilation of nitrogen in gram-positive bacteria. We identified the regulatory signals for these transcription factors with consensuses ATGTNAWWWWWWWTNACAT for GlnR and TGTNAWWWWWWWTNACA for TnrA. We described the structure and found new potential members for the TnrA/GlnR regulons in Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, Geobacillus kaustophilus, Oceanobacillus iheyensis, for the TnrA regulon in B. halodurans and for the GlnR regulons in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. mutans, S. agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of "androlla", a Spanish traditional pork sausage.
AB  - Counts of total aerobic mesophilic microflora, lactic acid bacteria, salt-tolerant microflora, Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, moulds and yeasts, and staphylococci, and some physico-chemical parameters (total solids, NaCl and nitrate contents and pH and aw values) were determined in 20 units of "androlla", a traditional dry-fermented sausage made in the NW of Spain. In general, high counts of all the investigated microbial groups were observed, with average values of 8.99 +/- 0.46 log cfu/g for the total aerobic mesophilic microflora, 9.11 +/- 0.16 log cfu/g for the lactic acid bacteria, 6.87 +/- 0.68 log cfu/g for the salt-tolerant microflora, 2.80+/-1.85 log cfu/g for the Enterobacteriaceae, 3.25 +/- 1.86 log cfu/g for the enterococci, 4.30 +/- 1.73 log cfu/g for the moulds and yeasts, and 3.62 +/- 0.60 log cfu/g for the staphylococci. From MRS agar, SPC agar + 7.5% NaCl, VRBG agar, and KAA agar, 10 colonies were randomly taken from each androlla unit and from each culture medium. A total of 200 strains per culture medium were then identified using the classical methods. Among the isolates from MRS agar, Lactobacillus sakei predominated, followed by Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus alimentarius and Lactobacillus plantarum. Of the 200 isolates obtained from SPC agar + 7.5% NaCl, only 56 strains belonged to the Staphylococcaceae or Micrococcaceae families. Among the Staphylococcaceae, Staphylococcus xylosus was the main species, followed by Staph. epidermidis; Staph. equorum, Staph. capitis and Staph. saprophyticus were isolated in very low proportions. Among the Micrococcaceae, Micrococcus luteus predominated, followed by Micrococcus lylae, Kocuria varians and Kocuria kristinae. Of the 150 isolates obtained from VRBG agar, Hafnia alvei was the main species, followed by Serratia liquefaciens and Enterobacter amnigenus; six isolates were identified as Salmonella. Among the 190 isolates obtained from KAA agar, 122 were considered enterococci; 20 isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecium, one as Enterococcus faecalis and 101 as Enterococcus inter faecalis-faecium.
TI  - Microbial quality and direct PCR identification of lactic acid bacteria and nonpathogenic Staphylococci from artisanal low-acid sausages.
AB  - Detection of six species of lactic acid bacteria and six species of gram-positive catalase-positive cocci from low-acid fermented sausages (fuets and chorizos) was assessed by species-specific PCR. Without enrichment, Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus curvatus were detected in 11.8% of the samples, and Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus xylosus were detected in 17.6%. Enriched samples allowed the detection of L. sakei and S. xylosus in all of the samples (100%) and of Enterococcus faecium in 11.8% of the sausages. The percentages of L. curvatus, L. plantarum, Staphylococcus carnosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis varied depending on the sausage type. L. curvatus was detected in 80% of fuets and in 57% of chorizos. L. plantarum was found in 50% of fuets and 100% of chorizos. S. epidermidis was detected in only 11.8% of fuets, and S. carnosus was detected in only 5.9% of chorizos. Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus warneri, and Staphylococcus simulans were not detected in any sausage type. From a microbiological point of view, 70.6% of the samples could be considered of high quality, as they had low counts of Enterobacteriaceae and did not contain any of the food-borne pathogens assayed.
TI  - Typing and subtyping of 83 clinical isolates purified from surgically implanted silicone feeding tubes by random amplified polymorphic DNA amplification.
AB  - In this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices) were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. The tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. Classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus. Both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of Bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of Bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of Bacillus pumilus, 3 isolates of Enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of Enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of Enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates of Escherichia coli, 8 isolates of Lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Amplified DNA fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. A total of 62 distinct RAPD types were categorized from the five genera studied. Typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus in three patient pairs. Genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.
TI  - Microbiology of controlled rotting of egusi (Colocynthis citrullus L.) fruits for the harvesting of the seeds.
AB  - Microorganisms isolated from naturally rotting egusi fruits which are used as a source of dietary seeds, were mainly bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. polymyxa, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, La. brevis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Micrococcus and Candida spp. The rotting period of egusi fruits could be decreased from 120 to 72 h by using a mixture of B. subtilis and B. licheniformis.
TI  - Immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  - Although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the species in question are not adequately known. The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. Using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes. It was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in B lymphocytes. The polyclonal activation of B cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in Gram-negative anaerobes. Furthermore, all of the tested species excluding Bacteroides oralis were poor T cell mitogens. These findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. It thus seems plausible that a battery of complex immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.
TI  - The occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  - Minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees C) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (Pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the pH of the mix to 4.5-4.7. Significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis. Micrococcus varians and Micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. Less growth was exhibited by Bacillus megaterium and yeasts. Pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (P. pentosaceus and L. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. The growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. Inoculated Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella sofia, and Staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. Lesser growth occurred for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with P. acidilactici.
TI  - [The range of antigenic specificity of Bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic relationships of Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (LVA-3, 791, GO-4), bifidobacteria of other species (B. adolescentis GO-13, B. breve 79-38, B. lactentis 79-41, B. longum GO-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (Streptococcus faecalis 6-3. Staphylococcus aureus COM 885, S. epidermidis COM 2124. Lactobacillus plantarum 1, Escherichia coli M-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans. The level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to L. plantarum and E. coli was considerably less pronounced. Copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, S. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.
TI  - Activation of the human complement cascade by bacterial cell walls, peptidoglycans, water-soluble peptidoglycan components, and synthetic muramylpeptides--studies on active components and structural requirements.
AB  - Cell walls isolated from 29 strains of 24 gram-positive bacterial species, whose  peptidoglycans belong to the group A type of Schleifer and Kandler's classification, with one exception (Arthrobacter sp.), were shown to activate the complement cascade in pooled fresh human serum mainly through the alternative pathway and partly through the classical one. The complement-activating effect of cell walls (5 species) possessing group B type peptidoglycan, except those of Corynebacterium insidiosum, was weaker than that of the walls with group A type peptidoglycan. Preparations of peptidoglycan isolated from cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Lactobacillus plantarum also activated the alternative pathway of the complement cascade, but less effectively than the respective parent cell walls. A water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits (SEPS), which was prepared from Staphylococcus epidermidis peptidoglycans by treatment with a cross-bridge degrading endopeptidase, retained most of the complement-activating ability of the parent cell walls. A peptidoglycan "monomer," SEPS-M, which was obtained by hydrolysis of the glycan chain of SEPS with endo-N-acetylmuramidase to disaccharide units did not activate complement. In conformity with this finding, neither synthetic N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP) nor MDP-L-Lys-D-Ala activated the complement cascade. Among several lipophilic derivatives of MDP, 6-O-(3-hydroxy-3-docosylhexacosanoyl)-MDP-L-Lys-D-Ala (BH48-MDP-L-Lys-D-Ala) and 6-O-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-MDP (B30-MDP) were shown to activate complement through the alternative as well as the classical pathway and exclusively through the classical pathway, respectively. The finding that a D-isoasparagine analog of B30-MDP caused the same effect as the parent molecule strongly suggests that the activation of complement by B30-MDP is different from that caused by cell wall peptidoglycans and a water-soluble "polymer" of peptidoglycan subunits.
TI  - Enhancement of dengue virus type 2 replication in mouse macrophage cultures by bacterial cell walls, peptidoglycans, and a polymer of peptidoglycan subunits.
AB  - The effects of bacterial cell walls, peptidoglycans, and a water-soluble polymer  of peptidoglycan subunits on dengue virus type 2 replication in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages were studied. Pretreatment of macrophage cultures with all of test cell walls isolated from seven bacterial species for 3 days significantly enhanced the virus production in the cultures. Peptidoglycans prepared from four of the above cell walls also exerted the virus production-enhancing effects in a similar manner as the walls. A water-soluble polymer of peptidoglycan subunits which was prepared by treatment of Staphylococcus epidermidis wall peptidoglycan with an interpeptide bridge-splitting enzyme (endopeptidase) also definitely enhanced the virus production in macrophage cultures, although its activity was weaker than that of the original wall and peptidoglycan. Macrophage cultures from athymic nude mice, when treated with cell walls and peptidoglycans of S. epidermidis and Lactobacillus plantarum for 3 days, also showed an increased ability to support dengue virus type 2 replication. The infectious center assay demonstrated that the virus replication enhancement by S. epidermidis cell wall and peptidoglycan was primarily due to an increase in the number of virus-infected cells. This finding did not seem to be in conflict with the observation that macrophages treated with the above cell wall or peptidoglycan phagocytized more latex particles than did untreated macrophages. The conclusions based on the above experiments are that the treatment of mouse peritoneal macrophage cultures with bacterial cell walls and their components increases the take of dengue virus type 2 by macrophages and thus raises the virus production in the macrophage cultures.
TI  - Contractile effects of bacterial cell walls, their enzymatic digests, and muramyl dipeptides on ileal strips from guinea pigs.
AB  - Cell walls isolated from four bacterial species (Streptococcus pyogenes, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptomyces gardneri, and Nocardia corynebacteriodes), which exhibited the adjuvant effect of stimulating cellular and humoral immune responses against ovalbumin in guinea pigs, caused the slow-starting and long-lasting contraction of guinea pig ileal strips suspended in Tyrode solution. In contrast to these cell walls active in immunoadjuvancy, those isolated from five bacterial species (Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Arthrobacter atrocyaneus, Corynebacterium insidiosum, and Ampullariella regularis), which lacked immunoadjuvancy at least in intact walls, caused no or very weak contraction of the ileal strips. Further study demonstrated that both a monomer and a polymer of disaccharide-stem peptides, which were obtained by enzymatic degradation of S. epidermis cell wall peptidoglycans, displayed similar contractile effects. It was finally revealed that guinea pig ileum strips showed a definite contractile response to N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP) and 6-O-stearoyl- and 6-O-(2-tetradecylhexadecanoyl)-MDPs, but not to their analogs, whose C-terminal amino acid was L-isoglutamine or D-isoasparagine in place of D-isoglutamine and which lacked adjuvancy. 6-O-(3-Hydroxy-2-docosylhexacosanoyl)-MDP, on the other hand, caused a slow and lasting relaxation of the ileum strips, but its L-isoglutamine and D-isoasparagine analogs did not.
TI  - Polyclonal B cell activation by cell wall preparations of gram-positive bacteria. In vitro responses of spleen cells obtained from Balb/c, nu/nu, nu/+, C3H/He, C3H/HeJ and hybrid (DBA/N x Balb/c)F1 mice.
AB  - The effects of polyclonal B cell activation (PBA) of cell walls and their cell wall fractions obtained from several kinds of gram-positive bacteria were studied using the anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) or anti-trinitrophenylated (TNP) SRBC plaque forming cell (PFC) responses of cultured spleen cells from Balb/c, athymic nu/nu, their littermates (nu/+), C3H/He (LPS-responder), C3H/HeJ (LPS-nonresponder), (CBA/N x Balb/c) F1 male with an X-linked defect in B cell function and the F1 female mice. The cell walls of Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 8014), Micrococcus lysodeikticus (NCTC 2665), Mycobacterium rhodochrous (ATCC 184), Streptomyces gardneri (ATCC 23911) and Nocardia corynebacteriodes (ATCC 14898) had the ability to induce polyclonal B cell responses in the spleen cells of Balb/c, nu/nu, nu/+, C3H/He and C3H/HeJ mice. The cell wall fractions prepared by enzymatic digestion from the cell walls of S. epidermidis, S. gardneri or N. corynebacteriodes were also capable of inducing polyclonal B cell responses. The responses of spleen cells from (CBA/N x Balb/c) F1 male mice to these active preparations, except the cell walls of M. rhodochrous which possess this ability. The PBA-ability of synthetic peptidoglycan, muramyl dipeptide (N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine, MDP), was also examined, and a similar activity was observed in MDP.
TI  - Induction of delayed type hypersensitivity-like skin reaction by peptidoglycans of bacterial cell walls.
AB  - Water-soluble glycopeptides isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus epidermidis cell walls elicited a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH)-like skin reaction in rats previously immunized with Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell walls, but not in unimmunized rats. Histological examination of the skin reaction sites in immunized animals revealed a close similarity of this skin reaction to a typical DTH reacton with respect to the time course of development and the types of cells that infiltrated into the skin reaction sites, which were characterized by a predominant infiltration of mononuclear cells at 48 hr. This DTH-like reaction was also demonstrated by immunizing the rats with the cell wall peptidoglycans of L. plantarum or S. epidermidis and skin testing them with homologous as well as heterologous peptidoglycans. The DTH-like reaction appeared to be caused by peptidoglycans that exist in common in the cell walls of phylogenetically distant bacterial species. Furthermore, it was also suggested that the putative antigenic determinants(s) might include both the glycan chain and part of the peptide moieties of the cell wall peptidoglycan rather than either of the single moieties.
TI  - Susceptibility to adjuvant-induced arthritis among germfree, specific-pathogen-free, and conventional rats.
AB  - Germfree F344 rats developed severe arthritis with 100% incidence after a single  intradermal inection of either squalane containing 0.5 mg of heat-killed Mycobacterium bovis BCG or a water-in-oil emulsion containing 0.2 mg of peptidoglycan derived from Staphylococcus epidermidis. Conventional F344 rats developed less-severe arthritis with 20% incidence for heat-killed BCG and 0% incidence for peptidoglycan. Specific-pathogen-free rats showed an intermediate susceptibility between germfree and conventional rats. Interestingly, both unimmunized specific-pathogen-free and conventional rats. but not unimmunized germfree rats, showed weak delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to peptidoglycans derived from either S. epidermidis or Lactobacillus plantarum, suggesting that a bacterial flora may furnish a stimulus for induction of cell-mediated immunity to ubiquitous bacterial peptidoglycans. It is thus possible that although a bacterial flora is not necessary for development of adjuvant arthritis, it may have some suppressive effect on the development of the disease in specific-pathogen-free and conventional F344 rats, possibly through modulation of the immune response.
TI  - Inhibition of macrophage migration by muramyl peptides.
AB  - In the capillary tube migration system a synthetic muramyl dipeptide (MDP; N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine), a part of bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans, inhibited the migration of peritoneal exudate macrophages from normal guinea pigs or rats. The migration inhibition was also caused by some MDP-containing peptidoglycan fragments from cell walls of Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The migration inhibition could not be explained on the basis of macrophage migration inhibitory factor. A stereochemically highly specific structure of MDP required for its adjuvant activity was also required for the macrophage migration inhibition. These findings suggest that MDP and MDP-containing cell wall fragments may activate macrophages and that this activation may be important in the exertion of their adjuvant activity.
TI  - Deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. The small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("Fukushima Type 1"). Bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. THE RESULTS: 1) Among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis and Lactobacillus (L.) bifidus. Species of which none of the strains split were Escherichia (E.) coli, E. communior, E. freundii, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. buchneri, L. cellobiosus, L. bulgaricus, S. aureus, Aerobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was Intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) Among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split were Bacteroides (B.) vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, Corynebacterium (C.) granulosum, C. avidum, Peptostreptococcus (Peptostrept.) putridus, Eubacterium (Eubact.) lentum, Peptococcus (Pept.) grigoroffii, Pept. anaerobius, Veillonella (V.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were Coryne. diphtheroides, Eubact. parvum, Peptostrept. intermedius. Species of which none of the strains split were Coryne, parvum, Peptostrept. micros, V. alcalescens, V. parvula, Catenabacterium (Catena.) catenaforme, and Catena. filamentosum. 3) All or none, or almost all or none, of the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
TI  - Immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible Micrococcus lysodeikticus (NCTC 2665) and lysozyme-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. Using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of Staphylococcus aureus (Copenhagen), Streptococcus pyogens (group A, type 6; S43/100), Streptococcus salivarius (IFO 3350), Streptococcus faecalis (IFO 12580), Streptococcus mutans (BHT), Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 8014), Bacillus megaterium (IFO 12068), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (Park-Williams No. 8), Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Actinomyces viscous (ATCC 15987). Evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.
