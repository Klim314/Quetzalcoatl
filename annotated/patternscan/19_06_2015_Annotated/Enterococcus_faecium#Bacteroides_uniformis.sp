TI  == maldi-tof identification of the human gut microbiome in people with and without diarrhea in senegal.
AB  == background: in africa, there are several problems with the specific identification of bacteria. recently, maldi-tof mass spectrometry has become a powerful tool for the routine microbial identification in many clinical laboratories. methodology/principal findings: this study was conducted using feces from 347 individuals (162 with diarrhea and 185 without diarrhea) sampled in health centers in dakar, senegal. feces were transported from dakar to marseille, france, where they were cultured using different culture conditions. the isolated colonies were identified using maldi-tof. if a colony was unidentified, 16s rrna sequencing was performed. overall, 2,753 isolates were tested, allowing for the identification of 189 bacteria from 5 phyla, including 2 previously unknown species, 11 species not previously reported in the human gut,  10 species not previously reported in humans, and 3 fungi. 2,718 bacterial isolates (98.8%) out of 2,750 yielded an accurate identification using mass spectrometry, as did the 3 candida albicans isolates. thirty-two bacterial isolates not identified by maldi-tof (1.2%) were identified by sequencing, allowing for the identification of 2 new species. the number of bacterial species per fecal sample was significantly higher among patients without diarrhea (8.6+/-3) than in those with diarrhea (7.3+/-3.4; p = 0.0003). a modification of  the gut microbiota was observed between the two groups. in individuals with diarrhea, major commensal bacterial species such as e. coli were significantly decreased (85% versus 64%), as were several enterococcus spp. (e. faecium and e.  casseliflavus) and anaerobes, such as bacteroides spp. (b. uniformis and b. vulgatus) and clostridium spp. (c. bifermentans, c. orbiscindens, c. perfringens, and c. symbosium). conversely, several bacillus spp. (b. licheniformis, b. mojavensis, and b. pumilus) were significantly more frequent among patients with  diarrhea. conclusions/significance: maldi-tof is a potentially powerful tool for  routine bacterial identification in africa, allowing for a quick identification of bacterial species.

TI  == isolation and identification of mixed linked beta -glucan degrading bacteria in the intestine of broiler chickens and partial characterization of respective 1,3-1,4-beta -glucanase activities.
AB  == media with 1,3-1,4-beta -glucans as selective markers were used for isolation of  non-starch-polysaccharide (nsp) degrading bacteria from the intestinal tract of broiler chicken. formerly unknown 1,3-1,4-beta endoglucanase activities in various bacterial species were identified in this study. e. faecium , streptococcus , bacteroides and clostridium strains seem to be responsible for degradation of mixed linked beta -glucans in the small intestine and in the hind  gut of chickens. strict anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides ovatus , b. uniformis , presumably b. capillosus and clostridium perfringens ) as well as an unidentified bacterium with 98% 16s rdna homology to an uncultered chicken cecum bacterium were isolated. additionally, streptococcus bovis with 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity was also detected. different 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity profiles were observed in sds/page zymograms.
