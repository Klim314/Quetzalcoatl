TI  == infant botulism due to c. butyricum type e toxin: a novel environmental association with pet terrapins.
AB  == we describe two cases of infant botulism due to clostridium butyricum producing botulinum type e neurotoxin (bont/e) and a previously unreported environmental source. the infants presented at age 11 days with poor feeding and lethargy, hypotonia, dilated pupils and absent reflexes. faecal samples were positive for c. butyricum bont/e. the infants recovered after treatment including botulism immune globulin intravenous (big-iv). c. butyricum bont/e was isolated from water from tanks housing pet 'yellow-bellied' terrapins (trachemys scripta scripta): in case a the terrapins were in the infant's home; in case b a relative fed the terrapin prior to holding and feeding the infant when both visited another relative. c. butyricum isolates from the infants and the respective terrapin tank waters were indistinguishable by molecular typing. review of a case of c. butyricum bont/e botulism in the uk found that there was a pet terrapin where the infant was living. it is concluded that the c. butyricum-producing bont type e in these cases of infant botulism most likely originated from pet terrapins. these findings reinforce public health advice that reptiles, including terrapins, are not suitable pets for children aged <5 years, and highlight the importance of hand washing after handling these pets.

TI  == detection of pathogenic clostridia in biogas plant wastes.
AB  == as the number of biogas plants has grown rapidly in the last decade, the amount of potentially contaminated wastes with pathogenic clostridium spp. has increased as well. this study reports the results from examining 203 biogas plant wastes (bgws). the following clostridium spp. with different frequencies could be isolated via a new enrichment medium (krune medium) and detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms): clostridium perfringens (58 %) then clostridium bifermentans (27  %), clostridium tertium (23 %) and clostridium butyricum (19 %), clostridium cadaveris (15 %), clostridium parapurificum (6 %), clostridium glycolicum (5 %),  clostridium baratii (4 %), clostridium sporogenes (2 %), clostridium sordellii (1 %) and clostridium subterminale (0.5 %). the mean most probable number (mpn) count of sulfite reducing bacteria was between 10(3) and 10(4)/ml, and the higher the mpn, the more pathogenic clostridium spp. were present. also, real-time pcr was used to be compared with culture method for c. perfringens, c. bifermentans,  c. butyricum, c. sporogenes/clostridium botulinum and c. sordellii. although real-time pcr was more sensitive than the culture method, both systems improve the recovery rate but in different ways and are useful to determine pathogenic clostridia in biogas plants. in conclusion, bgws could present a biohazard risk of clostridia for humans and animals.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of infant botulism in california and elsewhere, 1976-2010.
AB  == background: infant botulism (ib), first identified in california in 1976, results from clostridium botulinum spores that germinate, multiply, and produce botulinum neurotoxin (bont) in the immature intestine. from 1976 to 2010 we created an archive of 1090 bont-producing isolates consisting of 1012 ib patient (10 outpatient, 985 hospitalized, 17 sudden death), 25 food, 18 dust/soils, and 35 other strains. methods: the mouse neutralization assay determined isolate toxin type (56% bont/a, 32% bont/b). amplified fragment-length polymorphism (aflp) analysis of the isolates was combined with epidemiologic information. results: the aflp dendrogram, the largest to date, contained 154 clades; 52% of isolates clustered in just 2 clades, 1 bont/a (n=418) and 1 bont/b (n=145). these clades constituted an endemic c. botulinum population that produced the entire clinical  spectrum of ib. isolates from the patient's home environment (dust/soil, honey) usually located to the same aflp clade as the patient's isolate, thereby identifying the likely source of infective spores. c. botulinum a(b) strains were identified in california for the first time. conclusions: combining molecular methods and epidemiological data created an effective tool that yielded novel insights into the genetic diversity of c. botulinum and the clinical spectrum, occurrence, and distribution of ib in california.

TI  == arrangement of the clostridium baratii f7 toxin gene cluster with identification  of a sigma factor that recognizes the botulinum toxin gene cluster promoters.
AB  == botulinum neurotoxin (bont) is the most poisonous substances known and its eight  toxin types (a to h) are distinguished by the inability of polyclonal antibodies  that neutralize one toxin type to neutralize any of the other seven toxin types.  infant botulism, an intestinal toxemia orphan disease, is the most common form of human botulism in the united states. it results from swallowed spores of clostridium botulinum (or rarely, neurotoxigenic clostridium butyricum or clostridium baratii) that germinate and temporarily colonize the lumen of the large intestine, where, as vegetative cells, they produce botulinum toxin. botulinum neurotoxin is encoded by the bont gene that is part of a toxin gene cluster that includes several accessory genes. we sequenced for the first time the complete botulinum neurotoxin gene cluster of nonproteolytic c. baratii type  f7. like the type e and the nonproteolytic type f6 botulinum toxin gene clusters, the c. baratii type f7 had an orfx toxin gene cluster that lacked the regulatory  botr gene which is found in proteolytic c. botulinum strains and codes for an alternative sigma factor. in the absence of botr, we identified a putative alternative regulatory gene located upstream of the c. baratii type f7 toxin gene cluster. this putative regulatory gene codes for a predicted sigma factor that contains dna-binding-domain homologues to the dna-binding domains both of botr and of other members of the tcdr-related group 5 of the sigma70 family that are involved in the regulation of toxin gene expression in clostridia. we showed that this tcdr-related protein in association with rna polymerase core enzyme specifically binds to the c. baratii type f7 botulinum toxin gene cluster promoters. this tcdr-related protein may therefore be involved in regulating the  expression of the genes of the botulinum toxin gene cluster in neurotoxigenic c.  baratii.

TI  == [traumatic wound botulism].
AB  == botulism is a rare illness caused by a potent neurotoxin produced by the bacterium of the clostridium family. clostridium botulinum is the most frequent one, but clostridium baratti and clostridium butyricum are also neurotoxins producers. there are seven neurotoxins types, a to g; a, b, e, f and g cause human botulism. every neurotoxin type blocks cholinergic transmission at the myoneural junction. the least frequent syndrome results from clostridium botulinum colonization of a wound and it is clinically similar to the other botulism syndromes, but with fever due to an infected wound. disease should be suspected in lucid patient with a symmetric descending, flaccid paralysis. this syndrome appears within the first twenty days, but it could be present for weeks  or months before the disease is diagnosed. this disease is poorly known, so to be diagnosed it requires a high index of suspicion. the treatment is a supportive one; administration of the specific antitoxin must be early in order to neutralize the toxin before the debridement and cleaning of the infected wound.

TI  == growth limiting ph, water activity, and temperature for neurotoxigenic strains of clostridium butyricum.
AB  == some rare strains of clostridium butyricum carry the gene encoding the botulinal  type e neurotoxin and must be considered as possible hazards in certain types of  food. the limiting growth conditions for c. butyricum were determined in peptone  yeast glucose starch (pygs) broth incubated anaerobically at 30 degrees c for up  to 42 days. the minimum ph values permitting growth depended on the acidulant and strain. organic acids were more effective at inhibiting growth than hcl as expected. the lowest ph values at which growth of toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of c. butyricum was observed in broth acidified with hcl were 4.1 and 4.2, respectively. in organic acids, however, the minimum ph varied between 4.4 and 5.1 depending on acid type and concentration. the minimum water activity for  growth of toxigenic strains of c. butyricum was 0.96. the minimum growth temperatures of the toxigenic strains of c. butyricum (ca 10-11 degrees c) were somewhat higher than for non-toxigenic ones (8 degrees c). it was concluded that  control of toxigenic c. butyricum in the food industry needs to allow for the greater ph tolerance of this species compared with proteolytic c. botulinum.

TI  == genetic characteristics of toxigenic clostridia and toxin gene evolution.
AB  == clostridia comprise a heterogenous group of environmental bacteria containing 15  pathogenic species, which produce the most potent toxins. the origin of toxins is still enigmatic. it is hypothesized that toxins exhibiting an enzymatic activity  have derived from hydrolytic enzymes, which are abundantly secreted by these bacteria, and that pore-forming toxins have evolved from an ancestor transmembrane protein. the presence of related toxin genes in distinct clostridium species and the variability of some toxin genes support horizontal toxin gene transfer and subsequent independent evolution from strain to strain. clostridium perfringens toxin genes involved in myonecrosis, mainly alpha toxin and perfringolysin genes, are chromosomally located, whereas toxin genes responsible for intestinal and food borne diseases are localized on plasmids except the enterotoxin gene which can be located either on the chromosome or plasmids. the distribution of these plasmids containing one or several toxin genes accounts for the diverse c. perfringens toxinotypes. clostridium difficile  strains show a high genetic variability. but in contrast to c. perfringens, toxin genes are clustered in pathogenicity locus located on chromosome. the presence of related toxin genes in distinct clostridial species like clostridium sordellii, clostridium novyi, and c. perfringens supports interspecies mobilization of this  locus. the multiple c. difficile toxinotypes based on toxin gene variants possibly reflect strain adaptation to the intestinal environment. botulinum toxin genes also show a high level of genetic variation. they have a diverse genetic localization including chromosome, plasmid or phage, and are spread in various clostridium species (clostridium botulinum groups, clostridium argentinense, clostridium butyricum, clostridium baratii). exchange of toxin genes not only include transfers between clostridium species but also between clostridium and other bacterial species as well as eukaryotic cells as supported by the wide distribution of related pore-forming toxins of the aerolysin family in various clostridial and non-clostridial species, animal, mushroom and plant.

TI  == genetic diversity of the flagellin genes of clostridium botulinum groups i and ii.
AB  == botulinum neurotoxins (bonts) are produced by phenotypically and genetically different clostridium species, including clostridium botulinum and some strains of clostridium baratii (serotype f) and clostridium butyricum (serotype e). bont-producing clostridia responsible for human botulism encompass strains of group i (secreting proteases, producing toxin serotype a, b, or f, and growing optimally at 37 degrees c) and group ii (nonproteolytic, producing toxin serotype e, b, or f, and growing optimally at 30 degrees c). here we report the development of real-time pcr assays for genotyping c. botulinum strains of groups i and ii based on flavr (variable region sequence of flaa) sequences and the flab gene. real-time pcr typing of regions flavr1 to flavr10 and flab was optimized and validated with 62 historical and canadian c. botulinum strains that had been  previously typed. analysis of 210 isolates of european origin allowed the identification of four new c. botulinum flavr types (flavr11 to flavr14) and one  new flavr type specific to c. butyricum type e (flavr15). the genetic diversity of the flavr among c. botulinum strains investigated in the present study reveals the clustering of flavr types into 5 major subgroups. subgroups 1, 3, and 4 contain proteolytic clostridium botulinum, subgroup 2 is made up of nonproteolytic c. botulinum only, and subgroup 5 is specific to c. butyricum type e. the genetic variability of the flagellin genes carried by c. botulinum and the possible association of flavr types with certain geographical areas make gene profiling of flavr and flab promising in molecular surveillance and epidemiology  of c. botulinum.

TI  == production of a neutralizing mouse-human chimeric antibody against botulinum neurotoxin serotype e.
AB  == a mouse-human chimeric antibody that can neutralize botulinum neurotoxin serotype e (bont/e) was developed. variable regions of heavy and light chains obtained using a mouse hybridoma clone (e9-4) cdna, which was selected on the basis of neutralizing activity against bont/e, were fused with the upstream regions of the constant counterparts of human kappa light and gamma 1 heavy chain genes, respectively. cho-dg44 cells were transfected with these plasmids and a mouse-human chimeric antibody (ec94) was purified to examine binding and neutralizing activity against bont/e. ec94 exhibited the same levels of binding activities against bont/e as those of a parent mouse monoclonal antibody and neutralized more than 4,000 ld(50)/mg antibody. this chimeric antibody seems to be a useful candidate for infant botulism in which the use of passive immunotherapy is not planned so as to avoid serious events such as anaphylactic shock. we designed shuffling chimeric antibodies with replacement of v(h) or v(l) of ec94 with that of a chimeric antibody (ac24) that possessed neutralizing activity against bont/a. these shuffling antibodies did not exhibit neutralizing  activity against either bont/e or bont/a.

TI  == genetic diversity within clostridium botulinum serotypes, botulinum neurotoxin gene clusters and toxin subtypes.
AB  == clostridium botulinum is a species of spore-forming anaerobic bacteria defined by the expression of any one or two of seven serologically distinct botulinum neurotoxins (bonts) designated bont/a-g. this gram-positive bacterium was first identified in 1897 and since then the paralyzing and lethal effects of its toxin  have resulted in the recognition of different forms of the intoxication known as  food-borne, infant, or wound botulism. early microbiological and biochemical characterization of c. botulinum isolates revealed that the bacteria within the species had different characteristics and expressed different toxin types. to organize the variable bacterial traits within the species, group i-iv designations were created. interestingly, it was observed that isolates within different groups could express the same toxin type and conversely a single group  could express different toxin types. this discordant phylogeny between the toxin  and the host bacteria indicated that horizontal gene transfer of the toxin was responsible for the variation observed within the species. the recent availability of multiple c. botulinum genomic sequences has offered the ability to bioinformatically analyze the locations of the bont genes, the composition of  their toxin gene clusters, and the genes flanking these regions to understand their variation. comparison of the genomic sequences representing multiple serotypes indicates that the bont genes are not in random locations. instead the  analyses revealed specific regions where the toxin genes occur within the genomes representing serotype a, b, c, e, and f c. botulinum strains and c. butyricum type e strains. the genomic analyses have provided evidence of horizontal gene transfer, site-specific insertion, and recombination events. these events have contributed to the variation observed among the neurotoxins, the toxin gene clusters and the bacteria that contain them, and has supported the historical microbiological, and biochemical characterization of the group classification within the species.

TI  == lipid diversity among botulinum neurotoxin-producing clostridia.
AB  == clostridium botulinum has been classified into four groupings (groups i to iv) based on physiological characteristics and 16s rrna sequencing. we have examined  the lipid compositions of 11 representative strains of c. botulinum and a strain  of clostridium sporogenes by 2d-tlc and by ms. all strains contained phosphatidylglycerol (pg), cardiolipin (cl) and phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) in  both the all-acyl and the alk-1'-enyl (plasmalogen) forms. five strains in proteolytic group i, which are related to c. sporogenes, contained varying amounts of an ethanolamine-phosphate derivative of n-acetylglucosaminyl-diradylglycerol, which is also present in c. sporogenes. three strains in group ii, which are related to clostridium butyricum, clostridium beijerinckii and clostridium acetobutylicum, contained lipids characteristic of these saccharolytic species: a glycerol acetal and a pg acetal  of the plasmalogen form of pe. two group iii strains, which are related to clostridium novyi, contained amino-acyl derivatives of pg, which are also found in c. novyi. a strain in group iv had pe, pg and cl, but none of the distinguishing lipids. this work shows that the lipidome of c. botulinum is consistent with its classification by other methods.

TI  == [the new microbiological hazards in food].
AB  == this paper describes the new microbiological hazards in food. for protecting human health, nowadays food safety authorities face with many challenges, that years ago were largely unheard. in 2011 verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4 has been isolated in germany. strain came from fenugreek sprouts originated from egypt. it was characterized by unique features such as presence of enteroaggregative escherichia coli genes (aata, aggr, aap, agga, aggc) and resistance to most antibiotics. in poland only three cases of disease caused by o104:h4 strain have been reported. another emergence pathogen in poland is yersinia enterocolitica 08, biotype 1b. it is the most pathogenic bioserotype recently isolated in the usa only. food-borne is commonly associated with raw or  undercooked pork. the source of yersinia spp. may be also milk and water. the presence ofbotulinum neurotoxins in food is not new, but still an important issue because of their high toxicity to human. botulinum neurotoxins are high-molecular thermolabile proteins produced by clostridium botulinum and some strains of clostridium butyricum and clostridium baratii. based on their antigenic properties, botulin neurotoxins are divided into seven types a-g, however only types a, b, e and f are toxic to humans and some animals. increasing risk associated with food results from antimicrobial resistance eg. extended spectrum  beta-lactamases (esbls) producing bacteria, particularly enterobacteriaceae. until recently strains esbl+ were isolated in hospitals, however during last years they have been isolated from healthy humans, animals and food of animal origin. increasingly common microbiological hazard in food is methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). although prevalence of this pathogen in food is not high, the thread comes from difficulties of treating of infections caused by mrsa. the occurrence of food-borne in humans may also be associated with presence of viruses in food and water. the carrier of viruses may be equipment in food plant, production line, packaging and man. most food-borne are caused by noroviruses, rotaviruses, hepatitis a virus and hepatitis e virus.  an increased number of food-borne viral outbreaks are recorded in several countries. reasons for this include the improved diagnostic methods that have enhanced detection of some virus groups, and the increased marketing of fresh and frozen foods that has led to a worldwide availability of high risk food. viruses  may contaminate food either through contamination at source, principally through  sewage pollution of the environment, or in association with food

TI  == effects of different replicons in conjugative plasmids on transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, gene expression and n-butanol biosynthesis in clostridium tyrobutyricum.
AB  == clostridium tyrobutyricum atcc 25755 can produce butyric acid, acetic acid, and hydrogen as the main products from various carbon sources. in this study, c. tyrobutyricum was used as a host to produce n-butanol by expressing adhe2 gene under the control of a native thiolase promoter using four different conjugative  plasmids (pmtl82151, 83151, 84151, and 85151) each with a different replicon (pbp1 from c. botulinum nctc2916, pcb102 from c. butyricum, pcd6 from clostridium difficile, and pim13 from bacillus subtilis). the effects of different replicons  on transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, adhe2 expression and aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase activities, and butanol production by different mutants of c. tyrobutyricum were investigated. among the four plasmids and replicons studied, pmtl82151 with pbp1 gave the highest transformation efficiency, plasmid stability, gene expression, and butanol biosynthesis. butanol production from various substrates, including glucose, xylose, mannose, and mannitol were then investigated with the best mutant strain harboring adhe2 in pmtl82151. a high butanol titer of 20.5 g/l with 0.33 g/g yield and 0.32 g/l h productivity was obtained with mannitol as the substrate in batch fermentation with ph controlled at ~6.0.

TI  == identification of novel linear megaplasmids carrying a ss-lactamase gene in neurotoxigenic clostridium butyricum type e strains.
AB  == since the first isolation of type e botulinum toxin-producing clostridium butyricum from two infant botulism cases in italy in 1984, this peculiar microorganism has been implicated in different forms of botulism worldwide. by applying particular pulsed-field gel electrophoresis run conditions, we were able to show for the first time that ten neurotoxigenic c. butyricum type e strains originated from italy and china have linear megaplasmids in their genomes. at least four different megaplasmid sizes were identified among the ten neurotoxigenic c. butyricum type e strains. each isolate displayed a single sized megaplasmid that was shown to possess a linear structure by atp-dependent exonuclease digestion. some of the neurotoxigenic c. butyricum type e strains possessed additional smaller circular plasmids. in order to investigate the genetic content of the newly identified megaplasmids, selected gene probes were designed and used in southern hybridization experiments. our results revealed that the type e botulinum neurotoxin gene was chromosome-located in all neurotoxigenic c. butyricum type e strains. similar results were obtained with the 16s rrna, the tetracycline tet(p) and the lincomycin resistance protein lmrb  gene probes. a specific moba gene probe only hybridized to the smaller plasmids of the italian c. butyricum type e strains. of note, a ss-lactamase gene probe hybridized to the megaplasmids of eight neurotoxigenic c. butyricum type e strains, of which seven from clinical sources and the remaining one from a food implicated in foodborne botulism, whereas this ss-lactam antibiotic resistance gene was absent form the megaplasmids of the two soil strains examined. the widespread occurrence among c. butyricum type e strains associated to human disease of linear megaplasmids harboring an antibiotic resistance gene strongly suggests that the megaplasmids could have played an important role in the emergence of c. butyricum type e as a human pathogen.

TI  == preliminary study on the isolation of clostridium butyricum strains from natural  sources in the uk and screening the isolates for presence of the type e botulinal toxin gene.
AB  == clostridia such as clostridium tyrobutyricum, c. pasteurianum and c. butyricum may cause spoilage problems in certain types of food, but they are not normally regarded as dangerous. however some strains of c. butyricum have acquired the type e botulinum neurotoxin gene and have caused both infant and classical botulism in italy (1986), china (1994) and india (1996). this study was carried out to examine a range of samples from fresh vegetables to food and environmental samples in the uk and test their ability to produce type e botulinal neurotoxin (bont) by probing for the presence of the toxin gene. samples were enriched in modified bhat and barker (mbb) broth which is a minimal medium with lactate and acetate as a source of carbon and energy. in addition selective antibiotics are present in the medium to favour the growth of c. butyricum. this was followed by  plating out onto iron sulphite agar (isa) for isolation of c. butyricum from food and environmental samples. a total of 978 samples were tested and 302 (31%) yielded presumptive c. butyricum isolates. the highest percentage of positives came from soil, potato skins, swede skin, yoghurt and cream. no positive isolates were obtained from pate, garlic or spring greens. a sub-sample of isolates was examined for the presence of gene encoding the type e botulinum neurotoxin using  pcr. only one of the many existing pcr methods was successful and therefore used  for screening c. butyricum isolates for the presence of the type e toxin gene. none of the 93 tested isolates were found to be toxigenic (type e botulinal neurotoxin).

TI  == an innovative molecular detection tool for tracking and tracing clostridium botulinum types a, b, e, f and other botulinum neurotoxin producing clostridia based on the genedisc cycler.
AB  == rapid and specific detection of botulinum neurotoxin (bont) producing clostridia  is a priority for public health authorities, in case of both natural and intentional botulism outbreaks. this study reports on the evaluation of a detection system based on the genedisc cycler designed for simultaneously testing the bont/a, bont/b, bont/e and bont/f genes encoding for the botulinum neurotoxins types a, b, e and f. bont-producing clostridia (n = 102) and non-bont-producing bacteria (n = 52) isolated from clinical, food and environmental samples were tested using this macro-array and results were compared to the reference lethality test on mice. the bont genes were correctly detected in all c. botulinum type a, b, e and f strains available, as well as in  toxigenic c. baratii type f and toxigenic c. butyricum type e. no cross reactivity was observed with non human-toxigenic bacteria, c. botulinum types c,  d and g. the identification of the bont genotype using the macro-array was correlated to toxino-typing of the bonts as determined by the mouse bioassay. an  "evaluation trial" of the genedisc array performed blind in four european laboratories with 77 bont-producing clostridia as well as 10 food and clinical samples showed that the developed macro-array is specific and reliable for identifying bont/a-, bont/b-, bont/e- and bont/f-producing clostridial strains and for screening naturally contaminated food and fecal samples. the test is robust, has a low detection limit (c.a. 5 to 50 genome copies in the pcr reaction microwell) and is promising for monitoring bont-producing clostridia in different kinds of samples including food and clinical samples.

TI  == presence of soil-dwelling clostridia in commercial powdered infant formulas.
AB  == objective: because clostridium botulinum was isolated from powdered infant formula (pif) fed to an infant in the united kingdom who subsequently developed infant botulism and from unopened pif from the same manufacturer, we tested pif manufactured in the united states for the presence of clostridial spores. study design: thirty pif ingested by 19 california infants with botulism within 4 weeks of onset of illness (48% of all patients fed pif during study) in 2006-2007 were  cultured anaerobically to isolate clostridia. all isolated clostridia were identified to the species level and enumerated with standard microbiologic and molecular methods. results: five of 30 (17%) pif samples ingested by patients contained clostridial spores. spores were also found in 7 of 9 (78%) market-purchased pif samples. clostridium sporogenes was isolated most frequently, followed by clostridium butyricum and at least 10 other soil-dwelling clostridial species. no neurotoxigenic clostridia were isolated. the most probable number of clostridial spores in pif ranged between 1.1 to >23 per 100 g. conclusions: with the notable exception of production of botulinum neurotoxin, c  sporogenes is physiologically comparable with proteolytic strains of c botulinum, and both share the same natural reservoir (soils and dust worldwide). the isolation of c sporogenes and potentially pathogenic clostridia from u.s.-manufactured pif suggests that neurotoxigenic clostridial spores have the potential to be present in these products.

TI  == recombination and insertion events involving the botulinum neurotoxin complex genes in clostridium botulinum types a, b, e and f and clostridium butyricum type e strains.
AB  == background: clostridium botulinum is a taxonomic designation for at least four diverse species that are defined by the expression of one (monovalent) or two (bivalent) of seven different c. botulinum neurotoxins (bonts, a-g). the four species have been classified as c. botulinum groups i-iv. the presence of bont genes in strains representing the different groups is probably the result of horizontal transfer of the toxin operons between the species. results: chromosome and plasmid sequences of several c. botulinum strains representing a, b, e and f  serotypes and a c. butyricum type e strain were compared to examine their genomic organization, or synteny, and the location of the botulinum toxin complex genes.  these comparisons identified synteny among proteolytic (group i) strains or nonproteolytic (group ii) strains but not between the two groups. the bont complex genes within the strains examined were not randomly located but found within three regions of the chromosome or in two specific sites within plasmids.  a comparison of sequences from a bf strain revealed homology to the plasmid pclj  with similar locations for the bont/bv b genes but with the bont/a4 gene replaced by the bont/f gene. an analysis of the toxin cluster genes showed that many recombination events have occurred, including several events within the ntnh gene. one such recombination event resulted in the integration of the bont/a1 gene into the serotype toxin b ha cluster, resulting in a successful lineage commonly associated with food borne botulism outbreaks. in c. botulinum type e and c. butyricum type e strains the location of the bont/e gene cluster appears to be the result of insertion events that split a rara, recombination-associated  gene, independently at the same location in both species. conclusion: the analysis of the genomic sequences representing different strains reveals the presence of insertion sequence (is) elements and other transposon-associated proteins such as recombinases that could facilitate the horizontal transfer of the bonts; these events, in addition to recombination among the toxin complex genes, have led to the lineages observed today within the neurotoxin-producing clostridia.

AB  == botulinum neurotoxin (bont), the most toxic substance known, is produced by the spore-forming bacterium clostridium botulinum and, in rare cases, also by some strains of clostridium butyricum and clostridium baratii. the standard procedure  for definitive detection of bont-producing clostridia is a culture method combined with neurotoxin detection using a standard mouse bioassay (smb). the smb is highly sensitive and specific, but it is expensive and time-consuming and there are ethical concerns due to use of laboratory animals. pcr provides a rapid alternative for initial screening for bont-producing clostridia. in this study, a previously described multiplex pcr assay was modified to detect all type a, b, e, and f neurotoxin genes in isolated strains and in clinical, food, environmental samples. this assay includes an internal amplification control. the effectiveness of the multiplex pcr method for detecting clostridia possessing type a, b, e, and f neurotoxin genes was evaluated by direct comparison with the smb. this method showed 100% inclusivity and 100% exclusivity when 182 bont-producing clostridia and 21 other bacterial strains were used. the relative accuracy of the multiplex  pcr and smb was evaluated using 532 clinical, food, and environmental samples and was estimated to be 99.2%. the multiplex pcr was also used to investigate 110 freshly collected food and environmental samples, and 4 of the 110 samples (3.6%) were positive for bont-encoding genes.

TI  == biology and genomic analysis of clostridium botulinum.
AB  == the ability to form botulinum neurotoxin is restricted to six phylogenetically and physiologically distinct bacteria (clostridium botulinum groups i-iv and some strains of c. baratii and c. butyricum). the botulinum neurotoxin is the most potent toxin known, with as little as 30-100 ng potentially fatal, and is responsible for botulism, a severe neuroparalytic disease that affects humans, animals, and birds. in order to minimize the hazards presented by the botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia, it is necessary to extend understanding of the biology of these bacteria. analyses of recently available genome sequences in conjunction with studies of bacterial physiology are beginning to reveal new and  exciting information on the biology of these dangerous bacteria. at the whole organism level, substantial differences between the six botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia have been reported. for example, the genomes of proteolytic c. botulinum (c. botulinum group i) and non-proteolytic c. botulinum  (c. botulinum group ii) are highly diverged and show neither synteny nor homology. it has also emerged that the botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia are not overtly pathogenic (unlike c. difficile), but saprophytic bacteria that use the neurotoxin to kill a host and create a source of nutrients. one important feature that has contributed to the success of botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia is their ability to form highly resistant endospores. the spores, however, also present an opportunity to control these bacteria if escape from lag phase (and hence growth) can be prevented. this is dependent on extending understanding of the biology of these processes. differences in the genetics and  physiology of spore germination in proteolytic c. botulinum and non-proteolytic c. botulinum have been identified. the biological variability in lag phase and its stages has been described for individual spores, and it has been shown that various adverse treatments extend different stages of lag phase. for example, heat treatment primarily extended germination, while incubation at a chilled temperature primarily extended outgrowth. the neurotoxin gene is present within a cluster of associated genes, and can be located on the chromosome, a plasmid or a bacteriophage. two basic types of neurotoxin cluster have been identified. evolution of the neurotoxin gene and cluster has occurred independently of the organism, and involved a series of recombination events but is still poorly understood. factors affecting the regulation of neurotoxin formation also remain  poorly understood, and will be the focus of much future research.

TI  == development of real-time pcr tests for detecting botulinum neurotoxins a, b, e, f producing clostridium botulinum, clostridium baratii and clostridium butyricum.
AB  == aims: to develop real-time pcr assays for tracking and tracing clostridia responsible for human botulism. methods and results: real-time pcr assays based on the detection of the genes ntnh encoding the nontoxin-nonhaemagglutinin (ntnh) proteins or the most homologous regions of the botulinum neurotoxin (bont) genes  have been developed together with four real-time pcr assays, each being specific  of the genes bont/a, bont/b, bont/e, bont/f and enables a toxin type-specific identification. the specificity of the assays was demonstrated using a panel of botulinum toxin producing clostridia (29 strains), nonbotulinum toxin producing clostridia (21 strains) and various other bacterial strains. the toxin type-specific assays had a sensitivity of 100 fg-1000 fg of total dna in the pcr  tube (25-250 genome equivalents) which correspond to 10(3) to 10(4) cells ml(-1). after a 48 h enrichment in anaerobic conditions, these pcr assays allowed the detection of clostridium botulinum type a in a naturally contaminated sample of 'foie gras' suspected in a c. botulinum outbreak. conclusion: these pcr tests are specific and reliable for detection of heterogeneous bont producing clostridia responsible for human botulism. significance and impact of the study: adoption of these pcr assays is a step forward a reliable and rapid detection of these clostridia in food samples.

TI  == an overview of type e botulism in china.
AB  == the geographical distribution of c. botulinum type e and its associated disease,  type e botulism in china, is different from that in other areas of the world. cases of type e botulism generally arise in costal regions. in china, however, type e botulism is found primarily in the qinghai-tibet plateau of northwest china far from the ocean, at an altitude of approximately 4-5 km. the foods most  commonly associated with the disease are fermented grain and beans as well as raw meat. a suspected outbreak of type e botulism poisoning in the central costal region of china in the 1990s prompted the collection and analysis of samples of mud, sand, and fish from the region. the toxin produced by type e botulinum was found in these samples. surprisingly, though, upon further analysis, the strain isolated from the samples was identified not as type e c. botulinum, but as the neurotoxigenic bacterium clostridium butyricum.

TI  == real-time pcr detection of the nontoxic nonhemagglutinin gene as a rapid screening method for bacterial isolates harboring the botulinum neurotoxin (a-g)  gene complex.
AB  == botulinum neurotoxin (bont) producing clostridia contain genes encoding a specific neurotoxin serotype (a-g) and nontoxic associated proteins that form the toxin complex. the nontoxic nonhemagglutinin (ntnh) is a conserved component of the toxin complex in all seven toxin types. a real-time pcr assay that utilizes a locked nucleic acid hydrolysis probe to target the ntnh gene was developed to detect bacterial strains harboring the botulinum neurotoxin gene cluster. the specificity of the assay for clostridium botulinum types a-g, clostridium butyricum type e and clostridium baratii type f was demonstrated using a panel of 73 bont producing clostridia representing all seven toxin serotypes. in addition, exclusivity of the assay was demonstrated using non-botulinum toxin producing clostridia (7 strains) and various enteric bacterial strains (n=27). using purified dna, the assay had a sensitivity of 4-95 genome equivalents. c. botulinum type a was detected directly in spiked stool samples at 10(2)-10(3) cfu/ml. stool spiked with 1 cfu/ml was detected when the sample was inoculated into enrichment broth and incubated for 24 h. these results indicate that the ntnh real-time pcr assay can be used to screen enrichment cultures of primary specimens at earlier time points (24 h) than by toxin detection of unknown culture supernatants (up to 5 days).

TI  == botulism: an update.
AB  == botulism is a paralytic illness caused by the action of a neurotoxin elaborated by clostridium botulinum. other clostridial bacteria, like c.butyricum and c.baratii can also produce the toxin leading to signs and symptoms of botulism. though rare, the illness is potentially fatal and can masquerade as other illnesses making diagnosis difficult. physicians need to familiarize themselves with the disease as prompt recognition and early treatment can considerably curtail the fatal outcome in the affected and prevent additional cases in the unaffected. new diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive modalities to tackle the disease have come into focus. botulinum toxin, generally considered a potent poison, is successfully being used for treatment of various neuromuscular disorders representing one of the most dramatic role reversals of modern times.

TI  == intestinal toxemia botulism in italy, 1984-2005.
AB  == botulism in humans is caused by botulinum neurotoxins, produced in most cases by  clostridium botulinum, although other clostridia species are implicated as well.  of the five forms of botulism in humans, three are referred to as "infective": wound botulism, infant botulism, and adult intestinal botulism; the latter two forms are also referred to as "intestinal toxemia botulism" because the organism  colonizes the lumen of the intestinal tract and produces botulinum neurotoxin in  vivo. twenty-three cases of infant botulism and three cases of adult intestinal botulism occurred in italy between 1984 and 2005. microbiological analyses of clinical, environmental, and food samples and analysis of clinical and epidemiological data revealed two main characteristics of intestinal toxemia botulism in italy that are not common in cases in other countries: the isolation  of a strain of c. butyricum that produced botulinum neurotoxin type e in 6 of 26  cases, including two cases of adult intestinal toxemia botulism, and the onset of botulism in these cases with concomitant severe gastrointestinal symptomatology.  this report summarizes the microbiological, clinical, and epidemiological data of all cases of intestinal toxemia botulism that have occurred in italy in the period 1984-2005.

TI  == sybr green real-time pcr method to detect clostridium botulinum type a.
AB  == botulinum toxins (bonts) are classically produced by clostridium botulinum but rarely also from neurotoxigenic strains of clostridium baratii and clostridium butyricum. bont type a (bont/a), bont/b, bont/e, and very rarely bont/f are mainly responsible for human botulism. standard microbiological methods take into consideration only the detection of c. botulinum. the presumptive identification  of the toxigenic strains together with the typing of bont has to be performed by  mouse bioassay. the development of pcr-based methods for the detection and typing of bont-producing clostridia would be an ideal alternative to the mouse bioassay. the objective of this study was to develop a rapid and robust real-time pcr method for detecting c. botulinum type a. four different techniques for the extraction and purification of dna from cultured samples were initially compared. of the techniques used, chelex 100, dneasy tissue kit, instagene matrix dna, and  boiling, the boiling technique was significantly less efficient than the other three. these did not give statistically different results, and chelex 100 was chosen because it was less expensive than the others. in order to eliminate any false-negative results, an internal amplification control was synthesized and included in the amplification mixture according to iso 22174. the specificity of  the method was tested against 75 strains of c. botulinum type a, 4 strains of c.  botulinum type ab, and 101 nontarget strains. the detection limit of the reaction was less than 6 x 10(1) copies of c. botulinum type a dna. the robustness of the  method was confirmed using naturally contaminated stool specimens to evaluate the tolerance of inhibitor substances. sybr green real-time pcr showed very high specificity for the detection of c. botulinum types a and ab (inclusivity and exclusivity, 100%).

TI  == botulism: the challenge of diagnosis and treatment.
AB  == botulism is a rare paralytic disease caused by a neurotoxin produced from the spore-forming bacterium clostridium botulinum and in rare cases clostridium butyricum and clostridium baratii. botulism has 4 naturally occurring syndromes:  foodborne, wound, infant botulism, and adult intestinal toxemia. inhalational botulism could result from aerosolization of botulinum toxin, and iatrogenic botulism can result from injection of toxin. all of these produce the same clinical syndrome of symmetrical cranial nerve palsies followed by descending, symmetric flaccid paralysis of voluntary muscles, which may progress to respiratory compromise and death. treatment includes meticulous intensive care that includes mechanical ventilation, when necessary, and administration of antitoxin.

TI  == automated ribotyping for the identification and characterization of foodborne clostridia.
AB  == the dupont qualicon riboprinter was employed to determine if automated ribotyping could be used to differentiate between and characterize various species of foodborne clostridia. ecori digests were used to ribotype 49 isolates that represented seven clostridium species: c. aerotolerans, c. beirjerinckii, c. botulinum, c. butyricum, c. perfringens, c. putrificum, and c. sporogenes. ecorv  digests were also used to ribotype 17 c. botulinum isolates to determine if an alternate restriction enzyme was more suitable than was ecori for toxin typing. it was concluded that the riboprinter could be potentially used to identify most  of the clostridia represented in the study, but that the system has difficulty distinguishing between c. botulinum and c. sporogenes. the system may also be potentially used to characterize clostridia based on phenotypic characteristics.  toxin typing of clostridia remains problematic, but may be improved by the use of restriction enzyme combinations.

TI  == laboratory diagnostics of botulism.
AB  == botulism is a potentially lethal paralytic disease caused by botulinum neurotoxin. human pathogenic neurotoxins of types a, b, e, and f are produced by  a diverse group of anaerobic spore-forming bacteria, including clostridium botulinum groups i and ii, clostridium butyricum, and clostridium baratii. the routine laboratory diagnostics of botulism is based on the detection of botulinum neurotoxin in the patient. detection of toxin-producing clostridia in the patient and/or the vehicle confirms the diagnosis. the neurotoxin detection is based on the mouse lethality assay. sensitive and rapid in vitro assays have been developed, but they have not yet been appropriately validated on clinical and food matrices. culture methods for c. botulinum are poorly developed, and efficient isolation and identification tools are lacking. molecular techniques targeted to the neurotoxin genes are ideal for the detection and identification of c. botulinum, but they do not detect biologically active neurotoxin and should not be used alone. apart from rapid diagnosis, the laboratory diagnostics of botulism should aim at increasing our understanding of the epidemiology and prevention of the disease. therefore, the toxin-producing organisms should be routinely isolated from the patient and the vehicle. the physiological group and  genetic traits of the isolates should be determined.

TI  == phylogeny and taxonomy of the food-borne pathogen clostridium botulinum and its neurotoxins.
AB  == until recently, all clostridia producing neurotoxins able to cause paralysis symptomatic of botulism were deemed to be clostridium botulinum. defining cl. botulinum on the basis of this single phenotypic trait has resulted in the species encompassing metabolically very diverse organisms, and four distinct phenotypic groups are recognized within this taxon (designated groups i-iv). nucleic acid hybridization and 16s ribosomal rna sequencing studies have revealed the presence of four phylogenetically distinct lineages within the species, which correlate with these phenotypic divisions. in addition to marked phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity between groups, the taxonomy of the species is further complicated by the existence of strains which are closely related, if not genetically identifiable, to members of each cl. botulinum group, but are non-toxigenic. furthermore, strains of species other than cl. botulinum (viz. cl. baratii, cl. butyricum) have been found which express botulinum neurotoxin (bont). great advances have been made in recent years in elucidating the nucleotide sequences of genes encoding the various bont antigenic types (a through to g). genealogical trees derived from bonts show marked discordance with those depicting 'natural' relationships inferred from 16s rrna and phenotypic clusters, and strong evidence exists for bont gene transfer between some groups of cl. botulinum (e.g. groups i and ii), and with non-botulinum species. botulinum neurotoxin is produced by cl. botulinum as a non-covalently bound progenitor toxin complex of two or more protein components. information on the evolutionary histories of the various non-toxic progenitor proteins is currently  limited, although there is evidence of gene recombination. in particular, chimera-like or mosaic non-toxic-non-haemagglutinins (ntnh) genes in group i cl.  botulinum have been described, and it is now apparent that the phylogeny of the ntnhs is not going to 'mirror' that of botulinal neurotoxins, although their genes are physically contiguous. in this article, the current state of knowledge  of the phylogenetics of the species cl. botulinum and its neurotoxins is reviewed, and a view is presented that a nomenclature based rigidly on bont production is no longer tenable.

AB  == denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) is a recently developed technique for rapid screening of nucleotide polymorphisms in pcr products. we used this technique for the identification of type a, b, e, and f botulinum neurotoxin genes. pcr products amplified from a conserved region of the type a, b, e, and f botulinum toxin genes from clostridium botulinum, neurotoxigenic c. butyricum type e, and c. baratii type f strains were subjected to both dhplc analysis and sequencing. unique dhplc peak profiles were obtained with each different type of botulinum toxin gene fragment, consistent with nucleotide differences observed in the related sequences. we then evaluated the ability of this technique to identify botulinal neurotoxigenic organisms at the genus and species level. a specific short region of the 16s rrna gene which contains genus-specific and in some cases species-specific heterogeneity was amplified from botulinum neurotoxigenic clostridia and from different food-borne pathogens  and subjected to dhplc analysis. different peak profiles were obtained for each genus and species, demonstrating that the technique could be a reliable alternative to sequencing for the rapid identification of food-borne pathogens, specifically of botulinal neurotoxigenic clostridia most frequently implicated in human botulism.

TI  == identification of the major steps in botulinum toxin action.
AB  == botulinum toxin is a uniquely potent substance synthesized by the organisms clostridium botulinum, clostridium baratii, and clostridium butyricum. this toxin, which acts preferentially on peripheral cholinergic nerve endings to block acetylcholine release, is both an agent that causes disease (i.e., botulism) as well as an agent that can be used to treat disease (e.g., dystonia). the ability  of botulinum toxin to produce its effects is largely dependent on its ability to  penetrate cellular and intracellular membranes. thus, toxin that is ingested or inhaled can bind to epithelial cells and be transported to the general circulation. toxin that reaches peripheral nerve endings binds to the cell surface then penetrates the plasma membrane by receptor-mediated endocytosis and  the endosome membrane by ph-induced translocation. internalized toxin acts in the cytosol as a metalloendoprotease to cleave polypeptides that are essential for exocytosis. this review seeks to identify and characterize all major steps in toxin action, from initial absorption to eventual paralysis of cholinergic transmission.

TI  == intestinal toxemia botulism in two young people, caused by clostridium butyricum  type e.
AB  == two unconnected cases of type e botulism involving a 19-year-old woman and a 9-year-old child are described. the hospital courses of their illness were similar and included initial acute abdominal pain accompanied by progressive neurological impairment. both patients were suspected of having appendicitis and  underwent laparotomy, during which voluminous meckel's diverticula were resected. unusual neurotoxigenic clostridium butyricum strains that produced botulinum-like toxin type e were isolated from the feces of the patients. these isolates were genotypically and phenotypically identical to other neurotoxigenic c. butyricum strains discovered in italy in 1985-1986. no cytotoxic activity of the strains that might explain the associated gastrointestinal symptoms was demonstrated. the clinical picture of the illness and the persistence of neurotoxigenic clostridia  in the feces of these patients suggested a colonization of the large intestine, with in vivo toxin production. the possibility that meckel's diverticulum may predispose to intestinal toxemia botulism may warrant further investigation.

TI  == efficacy of oxonia active against selected spore formers.
AB  == alternatives to hydrogen peroxide are being sought for use in aseptic packaging systems because this sterilant is efficacious at temperatures higher than some of the newer packaging materials can tolerate. earlier in this century, peracetic acid was known to be bactericidal, sporicidal, and virucidal but was not widely used because of handling, toxicity, and stability problems. sanitizer suppliers have capitalized on the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, and peracetic acid stabilized with a sequestering agent. formulations have been improved and marketed as oxonia active, and its use as an alternative sterilant to hydrogen peroxide merits evaluation. oxonia was assessed at a concentration of 2% and a temperature of 40 degrees c against a number of spore-forming organisms, including foodborne pathogens. spores tested in aqueous suspension showed an order of sensitivity (least to greatest) to oxonia as follows: bacillus cereus >  b. subtilis a > b. stearothermophilus > b. subtilis var. globigii > b. coagulans  > clostridium sporogenes (pa3679) > c. butyricum > c. botulinum type b (nonproteolytic) > c. botulinum type b (proteolytic) = c. botulinum type a = c. botulinum type e. b. subtilis a and b. stearothermophilus spores tested in the dry state were less sensitive to oxonia than when tested in aqueous suspension. b. cereus, a foodborne pathogen, proved to be markedly less sensitive to oxonia under the described test conditions. the decreased sensitivity to oxonia by the foodborne pathogen b. cereus raises concern about the efficacy of the sterilant for aseptic packaging of low-acid foods. further work will be needed to determine if this decreased sensitivity is an inherent property of the organism that affords unusual protection against oxonia or if the challenge parameters selected were at the minimum conditions for efficacy.

TI  == psychrotrophic clostridia mediated gas and botulinal toxin production in vacuum-packed chilled meat.
AB  == a cocktail of washed spores from six psychrotrophic clostridium strains isolated  from blown vacuum-packed meats was inoculated onto lamb chumps. a second washed spore cocktail of four toxigenic reference cl. botulinum strains, types a, b (two strains) and e, and a cl. butyricum type e strain, was similarly inoculated onto  lamb chumps. all inoculated lamb chumps were individually vacuum-packed and placed into storage at various temperatures typical of good to grossly abusive chilled storage (-1 degree c to 15 degrees c). all packs were observed for gas production (pack-'blowing') over a 12 week storage period. on gas production, or  after 12 weeks of storage, packs were examined by mouse bioassay for botulinum toxin production. the packs inoculated with the meat isolate cocktail showed evidence of gas production earlier than packs inoculated with reference strains.  no botulinum toxin was recovered from the meat isolate inoculated packs, while botulinal toxin was detected in reference strain inoculated packs down to a nominal storage temperature of 2 degrees c.

TI  == isolation and characterisation of neurotoxigenic clostridium butyricum from soil  in china.
AB  == soil specimens collected from a site around the home of patients with food-borne  type e. botulism probably caused by neurotoxigenic clostridium butyricum in guanyun, jiangsu province, china, were examined for the presence of neurotoxigenic c. butyricum. five lakeside sites of weishan lake, in an area near to the sites where the type e. botulism outbreaks caused by neurotoxigenic c. butyricum occurred were also surveyed. type e toxin-producing c. butyricum was isolated from soil from four sites including the site in guanyun. polymerase chain reaction assay demonstrated the presence of the type e toxin gene in all the toxigenic isolates. the biochemical properties of the isolates from the guanyun soil and the lakeside soil were identical except for inulin fermentation  and starch hydrolysis properties. these results indicate that neurotoxigenic c. butyricum has its principal habitat in soil.

TI  == evaluation of the use of the biomerieux rapid id32 a for the identification of clostridium botulinum.
AB  == the neurotoxins produced by clostridium botulinum are amongst the most potent known to man. toxin production is detected by a mouse bioassay, which requires several days for a result and is not acceptable for routine use unless there is a high level of suspicion. the rapid id32 a kit produced by biomerieux gives an identification of an isolate within 4 h. the aim of this study was to examine the efficiency of the identification of cl. botulinum using the rapid id32 a. forty-two strains of cl. botulinum, one strain each of botulinum toxin-producing  cl. butyricum and cl. baratii, and four strains of cl. sporogenes, were tested. one strain of group i cl. botulinum gave a presumptive identification of group ii cl. botulinum, six strains of cl. botulinum were identified as 50-98% cl. botulinum in some tests, and 17 strains of cl. botulinum were identified as < 50% cl. botulinum. thirteen strains of cl. botulinum were identified as > 99% cl. sporogenes or 86% cl. histolyticum, and five strains gave a combination of these  results. all strains of cl. sporogenes were correctly identified. these results show that some strains of cl. botulinum may not be correctly identified using the rapid id32a.

TI  == gene arrangement in the upstream region of clostridium botulinum type e and clostridium butyricum bl6340 progenitor toxin genes is different from that of other types.
AB  == the cluster of genes encoding the botulinum progenitor toxin and the upstream region including p21 and p47 were divided into three different gene arrangements  (class i-iii). to determine the gene similarity of the type e neurotoxin (bont/e) complex to other types, the gene organization in the upstream region of the nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin gene (ntnh) was investigated in chromosomal dna from clostridium botulinum type e strain iwanai and c. butyricum strain bl6340. the gene cluster of type e progenitor toxin (iwanai and bl6340) was similar to those  of type f and type a (from infant botulism in japan), but not to those of types a, b, and c. though genes for the hemagglutinin component and p21 were not discovered, genes encoding p47, ntnh, and bont were found in type e strain iwanai and c. butyricum strain bl6340. however, the genes of orf-x1 (435 bp) and orf-x2  (partially sequenced) were present just upstream of that of p47. the orientation  of these genes was in inverted direction to that of p47. the gene cluster of type e progenitor toxin (iwanai and bl6340) is, therefore, a specific arrangement (class iv) among the genes encoding components of the bont complex.

TI  == simple method for detection of clostridium botulinum type a to f neurotoxin genes by ploymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method was established to detect each type of neurotoxin genes of clostridium botulinum types a to f by employing the oligonucleotide primer sets corresponding to special regions of the light chains  of the neurotoxins. in this procedure, the pcr products were easily confirmed by  restriction enzyme digestion profiles, and as little as 2.5 pg of template dnas from toxigenic strains could be detected. the specific pcr products were obtained from toxigenic c. botulinum types a to f, a type e toxin-producing c. butyricum strain, and a type f toxin-producing c. baratii strain, but no pcr product was detected in nontoxigenic strains of c. botulinum and other clostridial species. the neurotoxin genes were also detected in food products of a seasoned dry salmon and a fermented fish (izushi) which had caused type e outbreaks of botulism. therefore, it is concluded that this pcr-based detection method can be used for the rapid diagnosis of botulism.

TI  == botulinal neurotoxin c1 complex genes, clostridial neurotoxin homology and genetic transfer in clostridium botulinum.
AB  == the botulinal neurotoxins (bont) associate with non-toxic proteins (antp) by non-covalent bonds to form large complexes. in c. botulinum c, the bont/c1 locus  consists of six genes which are organized in three clusters. cluster 1 encompasses the genes of bont/c1 and antp/139 which could be involved in the resistance of the bont/c1 to the acidic ph and protease degradation. the second cluster consists of three genes which encode hemagglutinin components. the last gene encodes a dna binding protein (orf22) which might regulate the bont/c1 complex gene expression. bont and tetanus toxin (tetx) display similar structure  and mechanism of action at the molecular level. their identity at the amino acid  level range from 34 to 96.8%, indicating that the clostridial neurotoxin genes probably derive from a common ancestor. the fact that clostridium other than c. botulinum such as c. butyricum and c. baratii can produce a bont suggests that the bont genes can be transferred between clostridium strains. the toxigenic c. butyricum strains seem to derive from originally non-toxic strains by neurotoxin  gene transfer from c. botulinum e, probably including a mobile dna element. in c. botulinum c and d the gene encoding the exoenzyme c3 has been localized in a transposon-like element of 21.5 kbp. transposons could be involved in bont gene transfer in c. botulinum.

TI  == clostridial infection in children.
AB  == a survey of the isolation of clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. the isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified clostridium spp., 37 (33%) c. perfringens, 13 (12%) c. ramosum, five (4%) c. innocuum, six (5%) c. botulinum, three (3%) c. difficile, two (2%) c. butyricum, and one isolate each of c. bifermentans, c. clostridiiforme, c. limosum and c. paraputrificum. most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. these were  immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). the clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. the species most  commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); bacteroides spp. (b. fragilis group) (50), escherichia coli (22), pigmented prevotella or porphyromonas spp. (18) and fusobacterium spp. (10). most bacteroides and escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck  sites. antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). only two patients died. these data illustrate the  importance of clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.

TI  == clostridium butyricum neurotoxin: partial amino acid sequence of major proteolytic fragments and intracellular activity in pc12 cells.
AB  == the approximately 150 kda single-chain neurotoxin produced by clostridium butyricum, reported to be similar to c. botulinum neurotoxin serotype e (gimenez  and sugiyama, infect. immun. 54, 926-929, 1988), was probed with trypsin and endoproteinase lys-c. the two proteases cleaved the butyricum neurotoxin between  residues arg 421-lys 422 and lys 418-gly 419, respectively. cleavage at this region, highly susceptible to proteolysis, generated approximately 50 kda light and approximately 100 kda heavy chains, whose identities were established by amino acid sequence determination. in the approximately 150 kda dichain neurotoxin these two chains remained linked by an interchain disulfide bond. the  endoproteinase lys-c also cleaved the heavy chain between residues lys 594-ile 595, yielding a approximately 73 kda fragment. a total of 77 amino acid residues  was identified by edman degradation of the major fragments generated by proteolysis. by analogy with other botulinum neurotoxin serotypes, the light chain contains the intracellular inhibitory domain and the heavy chain the receptor-binding and channel-forming domains. butyricum neurotoxin, whether in single-chain or dichain form, inhibited approximately 70% of the ca2+ stimulated  [3h]norepinephrine release from permeabilized pc12 cells. reduction with 5 mm dithiothreitol enhanced the intracellular inhibitory activity of dichain neurotoxin about 30-fold and increased the extent of inhibition to about 80%, while the activity of single-chain neurotoxin was slightly affected. increase in  the intracellular inhibitory activity of butyricum neurotoxin following mild treatment with trypsin (i.e. conversion of the single-chain protein to the dichain form) was virtually complete within 6 min.

TI  == detection of type a, b, and e botulism neurotoxin genes in clostridium botulinum  and other clostridium species by pcr: evidence of unexpressed type b toxin genes  in type a toxigenic organisms.
AB  == we studied the effectiveness of the pcr in detecting the type a, b, and e botulism neurotoxin genes in 209 strains of clostridium botulinum and 29 strains  of other clostridium spp. all 79 strains that produced type a toxin, 77 strains that produced type b toxin, and 51 organisms that produced type e toxin (46 c. botulinum and 5 c. butyricum) were pcr positive in reactions with primers targeting sequences specific for their respective toxin genes. the pcr for type a toxin was positive for one type b toxin-producing strain that produced a small amount of type a toxin in addition to a large amount of type b toxin. surprisingly, the type b toxin gene was detected in addition to the type a toxin  gene in 43 type a toxin-producing strains, only 1 of which could be shown by bioassay to produce biologically active type b toxin in culture. the type b gene  was also detected in two strains of c. subterminale, which were determined to be  nontoxigenic by bioassay. while the pcr was sensitive and specific in detecting the neurotoxin genes, the discovery of unexpressed toxin genes indicates that pcr results may not be adequate for establishing type b neurotoxigenicity.

AB  == for investigation of the genes of proteins associated in vivo with botulinum neurotoxin (bont), polymerase chain reaction (pcr) experiments were carried out with oligonucleotide primers designed to regions of the nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin (ntnh) gene of clostridium botulinum type c. the primers were used to amplify a dna fragment from genomic dna of c. botulinum types a, b, e, f, g and toxigenic strains of clostridium barati and clostridium butyricum. the amplified product from all of these strains hybridized with an internal oligonucleotide probe, whereas all nontoxigenic clostridia tested gave no pcr product and showed no reaction with the probe. the ntnh gene was shown to be located upstream of the gene encoding bont, thereby revealing a conserved structure for genes encoding the proteins of the m complex of the progenitor botulinum toxin in these organisms. the sequence of the ntnh gene of nonproteolytic c. botulinum type f was determined by pcr amplification and sequencing of overlapping cloned fragments. ntnh/f showed 71% and 61% identity with ntnh of c. botulinum type e and type c respectively.

AB  == two clostridium butyricum strains from infant botulism cases produce a toxic molecule very similar to c. botulinum type e neurotoxin. chromosomal, plasmid, and bacteriophage dnas of toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of c. butyricum and  c. botulinum type e were probed with (i) a synthesized 30-mer oligonucleotide encoding part of the l chain of type e botulinum toxin and (ii) the dna of phages lysogenizing these cultures. the toxin gene probe hybridized to the chromosomal dna of toxigenic strains but not to their plasmid dna. all toxigenic and most nontoxigenic strains tested were lysogenized by a prophage on the chromosome. prophages of toxigenic strains, irrespective of species, had related or identical dnas which differed from the dnas of prophages in nontoxigenic strains. the prophage of toxigenic strains was adjacent or close to the toxin gene on the chromosome. phage dnas purified from toxigenic strains did not hybridize with the toxin gene probe but could act as the template of the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the toxin gene. the toxin gene was not transferred between c. botulinum and c. butyricum (either direction) when different pairs of a possible  gene donor and a recipient strain were grown as mixed cultures. nontoxigenic c. butyricum or c. botulinum type e-like strains did not become toxigenic when grown in broth containing the phage induced from a toxigenic strain of the other species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a polymerase chain reaction method was developed for the specific detection of the botulinum neurotoxin (bont) gene of clostridium botulinum. degenerate oligonucleotide primers, designed from the nucleotide sequence of the heavy chain of the bont gene, amplified a specific fragment of approximately 1.1 kb from strains of c. botulinum toxin types a, b, e, f, and g and neurotoxin-producing strains of clostridium barati and clostridium butyricum, but no fragment was obtained from nontoxigenic strains. the fragments amplified from several strains  of c. botulinum types b, e, and f were cloned in escherichia coli and their nucleotide sequences were determined. sequences within this region were used to design oligonucleotide probes specific for bont type b (bont/b), bont/e, and bont/f genes. an additional probe was designed for the detection of the bont/f gene of c. barati, which differed in sequence from bont/f genes of both proteolytic and nonproteolytic strains of c. botulinum.

AB  == the neurotoxin gene from clostridium barati atcc43756 was cloned as a series of overlapping polymerase chain reaction (pcr) generated fragments using primers designed to conserve toxin sequences previously published. the toxin gene has an  open reading frame (orf) of 1268 amino acids giving a calculated molecular mass of 141,049 da. the sequence identity between the c. barati atcc43756 and non-proteolytic c. botulinum 202f neurotoxins is 64.2% for the light chain and 73.6% for the heavy chain. this is much lower than reported identities for the type e neurotoxins from c. botulinum and c. butyricum (96% identity between light chains and 98.8% between the heavy chains). previously identified conserved regions in other botulinal neurotoxins were also conserved in that of c. barati.  an orf upstream of the toxin coding region was revealed. this shows strong homology to the 3' end of the gene coding for the nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin (ntnh) component of the progenitor toxin from c. botulinum type c neurotoxin.

TI  == comparative molecular topography of botulinum neurotoxins from clostridium butyricum and clostridium botulinum type e.
AB  == production of botulinum-like neurotoxin by a non-clostridium botulinum organism has profound implications in the epidemiology of the disease botulism. molecular  topography of the approximately 150 kda neurotoxic protein produced by clostridium butyricum (strain 5839) and its activation kinetics were examined and compared with a serologically related botulinum neurotoxin produced by c. botulinum type e to further characterize the butyricum neurotoxin. botulinum neurotoxin was fully activated within 30 min of incubation with trypsin, whereas  butyricum neurotoxin achieved maximum activation within 5 min of incubation. molecular topography of the two neurotoxins was analyzed in terms of secondary structures and the surface accessibilities of the polypeptide domains containing  aromatic amino acids. the secondary structure parameters of the butyricum neurotoxin (alpha-helix 22%, beta-sheet 41% and random coil 37%), as estimated from the far ultraviolet circular dichroic spectra, appeared similar to that of botulinum neurotoxin. (singh, b.r. and dasgupta, b.r., (1989) mol. cell. biochem. 86, 87). second derivative ultraviolet spectral analysis revealed 37 and 41 tyr residues exposed on the surface of butyricum and botulinum neurotoxins, respectively, suggesting a differential surface accessibility of polypeptide segments containing tyr residues. fluorescent trp residues in both the botulinum  type e and butyricum neurotoxins were in a relatively hydrophobic environment as  indicated by the blue-shifted emission maxima (334 nm). about half of the fluorescent trp residues of both proteins were accessible to acrylamide, a neutral fluorescence quencher, and appeared to be in a similar molecular environment. the ionic surface probe, i-, quenched the trp fluorescence of botulinum significantly, but not that of butyricum neurotoxin. thus, a considerable number of fluorescent trp residues were apparently located on the surface of the botulinum, but not on that of the butyricum neurotoxin. botulinum  and butyricum neurotoxins, indistinguishable by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, migrated differently in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate suggesting difference(s) in their surface charge distribution. these results provide the first report of the secondary and tertiary structure parameters of the neurotoxin produced by a non-botulinum species and comparison of the molecular topography of the neurotoxin with the antigenically related botulinum neurotoxin type e.

TI  == cloning of a dna fragment encoding the 5'-terminus of the botulinum type e toxin  gene from clostridium butyricum strain bl6340.
AB  == chromosomal dna was extracted from toxigenic clostridium butyricum strain bl6340  isolated from a case of infant botulism. after digestion by ecori, a dna fragment of about 1 kbp was cloned into escherichia coli using lambda gt11, and was subcloned into puc118. the e. coli cells transformed with this cloned fragment produced a 33 kda protein which reacted with monoclonal antibodies recognizing the light chain (lc) component of botulinum type e toxin. the nucleotide sequence of the cloned fragment was determined. the sequence was similar to that from botulinum type e toxin gene fragments previously determined by our laboratory (strains mashike, otaru and iwanai). several highly homologous sequences among the botulinum type a, c, e, butyricum and tetanus toxin genes were found in both  translated and untranslated regions. these results suggest that the toxin gene of c. butyricum may have evolved by transfer from c. botulinum.

TI  == immunological characterization of clostridium butyricum neurotoxin and its trypsin-induced fragment by use of monoclonal antibodies against clostridium botulinum type e neurotoxin.
AB  == we examined the reactivities of clostridium butyricum neurotoxin to nine monoclonal antibodies against clostridium botulinum type e neurotoxin which recognize the light chain or the amino-terminal half (h-1 fragment) or the carboxyl-terminal half (h-2 fragment) of the heavy chain of botulinum neurotoxin. butyricum neurotoxin and its derived chains did not react to two of four monoclonal antibodies recognizing the light chain, one of three recognizing the h-1 fragment, and one of two recognizing the h-2 fragment. the results indicate that the immunological difference between the two neurotoxins is not attributable to a particular portion of the toxin molecule. the fragment of butyricum neurotoxin obtained by prolonged tryptic treatment was found to comprise the light chain and h-1 fragment linked together by a disulfide bond.

TI  == characterization of neurotoxigenic clostridium butyricum strain by dna hybridization test and by in vivo and in vitro germination tests of spores.
AB  == the germination of spores of a neurotoxigenic clostridium butyricum strain (bl 6340), which was isolated from infant botulism in italy, and that of a nontoxigenic c. butyricum type strain (ncib 7423) were studied. the spores of bl  6340 strain were killed at 80 c for 10 min, and required the mixture of l-alanine, l-lactate, glucose and bicarbonate for their optimal germination. these characteristics are the same as those of clostridium botulinum type e strain, but different from those of ncib 7423 strain. in a hybridization test, however, the labeled dnas extracted from ncib 7423 strain highly (98%) hybridized to the dnas of the bl 6340 strain, but little (45%) to the dnas of c. botulinum type e strain. the biochemical properties of the bl 6340 and ncib 7423 strains were identical, but different from those of c. botulinum type e. these data confirmed that the bl 6340 strain belongs to c. butyricum species, but that only  its characteristics of toxin production, its minimum requirements for germination, and the behavior of its spores to heat treatment are the same as those of c. botulinum type e. when conventionally raised suckling mice were injected with 5 x 10(7) spores of bl 6340 strain intra- or orogastrically, botulism was not observed. however, 8- to 13-day-old mice had type e botulinum toxin in the large intestine 3 days after introduction of its spores.

TI  == comparison of toxins of clostridium butyricum and clostridium botulinum type e.
AB  == the toxin of clostridium butyricum strains isolated from two infants with botulism is neutralized by antitoxin for type e botulinum toxin. this toxin and that of a c. botulinum type e strain were purified by the same protocol. both toxins were mr 145,000 proteins which, when activated with trypsin, were composed of an h subunit of mr 105,000 and an l subunit of mr 50,000. the activated specific toxicity of purified butyricum toxin based on an intravenous assay was 2 x 10(8) mouse 50% lethal doses (ld50s)/mg of protein, but that based on an intraperitoneal assay was 7 x 10(7) ld50s/mg, compared with 6 x 10(7) ld50s/mg for type e toxin as determined by both methods. immunodiffusion tests with antitoxin raised with type e toxin indicated that the two toxins were serologically very similar except for a spur formed by type e toxin. the close similarities of the two toxins suggest that toxigenic c. butyricum could arise when a wild-type strain, which is normally nontoxigenic, acquires the toxin gene  of a c. botulinum type e strain.

AB  == a total of 243 strains of 35 clostridium species were tested for cytotoxin production in cooked meat medium or liver broth within 48-72 h at 37 degrees c, using human embryonal lung fibroblasts in tissue-culture as indicator cells. cytotoxin could be detected in the culture-filtrates of all toxigenic strains of  c. chauvoei, c. difficile, c. histolyticum, c. novyi types a and b, c. septicum and c. tetani, but not in the atoxigenic ones. the cytotoxin of c. novyi correlated with alpha-toxin in the culture filtrate. all strains of c. perfringens and c. novyi d tested were not cytotoxic for lung fibroblasts despite their pathogenicity for guinea-pigs. further cytotoxigenic strains were found among c. hastiforme, c. limosum, c. oceanicum, c. putrificum, c. ramosum, c. sordellii, c. sporogenes, and c. subterminale. the morphological changes in lung  fibroblasts caused by the culture filtrates were characteristic and species-specific and corresponded with pathogenicity for guinea-pigs and/or mice. no cytotoxin was produced by c. absonum, c. barati, c. bifermentans, c. botulinum (atoxic), c. butyricum, c. cadaveris, c. carnis, c. clostridioforme, c. cochlearium, c. glycolicum, c. innocuum, c. malenominatum, c. mangenotii, c. paraputrificum, c. putrefaciens, c. rectum, c. tertium, and c. tyrobutyricum.

TI  == examination of feces and serum for diagnosis of infant botulism in 336 patients.
AB  == in the 12-year period 1975 to 1987, feces from 336 infants were examined for botulinal neurotoxin and clostridium botulinum. all the infants had illnesses which prompted their physicians to consider infant botulism in the diagnosis. stool specimens from 113 of the infants yielded organisms that produced botulinal neurotoxins assumed to be responsible for the illness. the types of botulinal toxin in the confirmed cases were distributed as follows: 38 a, 69 b, 2 atypical  b, 1 e, 1 f, 1 a + b, and 1 b + f. the type a and b toxins in a single infant were produced by two different strains of organism, and the type b and f toxins in another infant were produced by a single strain. the physiological characteristics of all the isolated toxigenic organisms except two were consistent with those of group i (proteolytic) c. botulinum. the toxigenic isolate from the infant with type e botulism was identified as c. butyricum, and  that from the infant with type f botulism was identified as c. barati. toxin of the same type as produced by the isolated organisms was identified in feces of 98 of 111 culture-positive infants. botulinal toxin was identified in the serum of 9 of 67 culture-positive infants (8 of 22 infants with type a organisms; 1 of 43 infants with type b organisms; neither of 2 infants with a + b or atypical type b organisms). botulinal toxin was not detected in feces (206 infants) or in serum (114 infants) of the culture-negative infants. the culture-positive infants had clinical features and a course of illness consistent with those of infant botulism. most of the culture-negative infants probably had illnesses other than  botulism, but specimens might have been obtained late in some infants' illnesses, when the organism had disappeared.

TI  == two cases of type e infant botulism caused by neurotoxigenic clostridium butyricum in italy.
AB  == the first two confirmed cases of type e infant botulism occurred in two 16-week-old girls in rome, italy. the original diagnosis for the first patient was intestinal blockage due to an ileocecal invagination, which was treated surgically. postoperatively, the patient became unresponsive and required ventilatory assistance. a diagnosis of infant botulism was then made. the second  infant presented to the same hospital 7 1/2 months later with profound weakness,  hypotonicity, mydriasis, and areflexia. this case was recognized as possible botulism at admission. both cases were confirmed by detection and identification  of type e botulinal toxin in stool specimens and in enrichment cultures of those  specimens. the toxigenic organisms isolated were quite different from clostridium botulinum type e. the apparent causative organism in each case resembles clostridium butyricum but produces a neurotoxin that is indistinguishable from type e botulinal toxin by its effects on mice and by its neutralization with type e botulinal antitoxin.

TI  == the role of intestinal bacteria in gallstone formation in animal model. a study on biliary lipid composition and bile acid profiles in bile, small intestinal contents and feces of clostridium butyricum miyairi no. 588 monocontaminated mice.
AB  == contradictory results in the studies on experimental gallstone formation using conventional and germfree mice have been reported. to study the role of bacteria  in gallstone formation in the animal model jcl:icr male germfree mice were monocontaminated with clostridium butyricum miyairi no. 588. gallstone formation, biliary lipid composition and bile acid profiles in the bile, small intestinal contents and feces were analyzed after feeding the diet containing cholesterol and cholic acid. the rate of gallstone formation in the monocontaminated mice (38%) was less than that in the germfree mice (100%). the relative concentrations of biliary lipids of the two groups were located out of the micellar zone on the  triangular co-ordinates by admirand and small. the bile acid concentrations in the small intestine and fecal excretions in the monocontaminated mice were higher than in the germfree mice. the composition as well as the mode of conjugation of  the bile acids did not differ significantly between the two groups. the infestation of bacteria in the intestine enhanced the excretion of bile acids and inhibited the gallstone formation in mice, in which direct metabolic activity by  bacterial enzymes on bile acid did not seem necessary to exert such effect.

TI  == taxonomy of the clostridia: ribosomal ribonucleic acid homologies among the species.
AB  == rrna homologies have been determined on reference strains representing 56 species of clostridium. competition experiments using tritium-labelled 23s rrna were employed. the majority of the species had dna with 27 to 28% guanine plus cytosine (%gc). these fell into rrna homology groups i and ii, which were well defined, and a third group which consisted of species which did not belong in groups i and ii. species whose dna was 41 to 45% gc comprised a fourth group. thirty species were placed into rrna homology group i on the basis of having 50%  or greater homology with clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. carnis, c. sporogenes, c. novyi or c. pasteurianum. ten subgroups were delineated in homology group i. species in each subgroup either had high homology with a particular reference species or a similar pattern of homologies to all of the reference organisms. the eleven species in rrna homology group ii had 69% or greater homology to c. lituseburense. species in groups i and ii had intergroup homologies of 20 to 40%. the six species in group ii had very low homologies with groups i and ii. negligible homology also resulted when five of the species were  tested against the sixth, c. ramosum. the five species having dna with 41 to 45%  gc were c. innocuum, c. sphenoides, c. indolis, c. barkeri and c. orotic um. little rrna homology was apparent between c. innocuum and the other high % gc species or with several bacillus species having similar %gc dna. correlations between homology results and phenotypic characteristics are discussed.
