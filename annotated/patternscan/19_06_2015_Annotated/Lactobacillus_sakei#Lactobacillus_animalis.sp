TI  == advantageous direct quantification of viable closely related probiotics in petit-suisse cheeses under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions by propidium monoazide--qpcr.
AB  == species-specific quantitative real time pcr (qpcr) alone and combined with the use of propidium monoazide (pma) were used along with the plate count method to evaluate the survival of the probiotic strains lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12, and the bacteriocinogenic and potentially probiotic strain lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei 2a in synbiotic (f1) and probiotic (f2) petit-suisse cheeses exposed throughout shelf-life to in  vitro simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions. the three strains studied showed a reduction in their viability after the 6 h assay. bb-12 displayed the highest survival capacity, above 72.6 and 74.6% of the initial populations, respectively, by plate count and pma-qpcr, maintaining population levels in the range or above 6 log cfu/g. the prebiotic mix of inulin and fos did not offer any additional protection for the strains against the simulated gastrointestinal environment. the microorganisms' populations were comparable among the three methods at the initial time of the assay, confirming the presence of mainly viable and culturable cells. however, with the intensification of the stress induced throughout the various stages of the in vitro test, the differences among the methods increased. the qpcr was not a reliable enumeration method for the quantification of intact bacterial populations, mixed with large numbers of injured and dead bacteria, as confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy results. furthermore, bacteria plate counts were much lower (p<0.05) than with the pma-qpcr method, suggesting the accumulation of stressed or dead microorganisms unable to form colonies. the use of pma overcame the qpcr inability to differentiate between dead and alive cells. the combination of pma and species-specific qpcr in this study allowed a quick and unequivocal way of enumeration of viable closely related species incorporated into probiotic and synbiotic petit-suisse cheeses and under stress conditions.

TI  == correlation between body mass index and gut concentrations of lactobacillus reuteri, bifidobacterium animalis, methanobrevibacter smithii and escherichia coli.
AB  == background: genus and species level analysis is the best way to characterize alterations in the human gut microbiota that are associated with obesity, because the clustering of obese and lean microbiotas increases with the taxonomic depth of the analysis. bifidobacterium genus members have been associated with a lean status, whereas different lactobacillus species are associated both with a lean and an obese status. objectives and methods: we analyzed the fecal concentrations of bacteroidetes, firmicutes, methanobrevibacter smithii, the genus lactobacillus, five other lactobacillus species previously linked with lean or obese populations, escherichia coli and bifidobacterium animalis in 263 individuals, including 134 obese, 38 overweight, 76 lean and 15 anorexic subjects to test for the correlation between bacterial concentration and body mass index (bmi). of these subjects, 137 were used in our previous study. findings: firmicutes were found in >98.5%, bacteroidetes in 67%, m. smithii in 64%, e. coli in 51%, lactobacillus species between 17 and 25% and b. animalis in 11% of individuals. the fecal concentration of lactobacillus reuteri was positively correlated with bmi (coefficient=0.85; 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.12-0.58; p=0.02) in agreement with what was reported for lactobacillus sakei. as reported, b. animalis (coefficient=-0.84; 95% ci -1.61 to -0.07; p=0.03) and m. smithii (coefficient=-0.43, 95% ci -0.90 to 0.05; p=0.08) were negatively associated with the bmi. unexpectedly, e. coli was found here for the first time to negatively correlate with the bmi (coefficient=-1.05; 95% ci -1.60 to -0.50; p<0.001). conclusion: our findings confirm the specificity of the obese microbiota and emphasize the correlation between the concentration of certain lactobacillus species and obesity.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == searching for bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria in soil.
AB  == a survey was conducted on the isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria in soil. forty-two acid-producing bacterial strains were isolated from 55 soil samples collected in yamanashi prefecture, japan. investigation of antibacterial activities of isolates revealed that three isolates, lactobacillus animalis c060203, enterococcus durans c102901  and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides c060204, showed antibacterial  activities against the indicator strain of lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157t. bacteriocin from enterococcus durans c102901 showed different characteristics from the known durancin l28-1a, produced by enterococcus durans l28-1. furthermore, this is the first report of a bacteriocin being produced by lactobacillus animalis. viewing from the species, bacteriocins from strains c102901 and c060203 showed high possibilities for the novel substances. these significant findings suggest that soil may be a common source for the isolation of novel bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria.
