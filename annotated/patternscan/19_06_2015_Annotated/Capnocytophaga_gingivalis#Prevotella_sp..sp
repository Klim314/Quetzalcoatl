TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == bacterial species in subgingival plaque and oral bone loss in postmenopausal women.
AB  == background: oral bacteria are widely recognized in the etiology of periodontal disease. we investigated the prevalence of subgingival bacterial infection with eight species, tested associations between infection and oral bone loss, and assessed potential confounding factors and effect modifiers of those associations in a large community-based cohort of postmenopausal women. methods: a cross-sectional study of oral health and osteoporosis in 1,256 postmenopausal women recruited from the buffalo, new york women's health initiative observational study was conducted. standardized dental radiographs were used to measure alveolar crestal height (ach). subgingival plaque samples were taken, and the presence of eight bacterial species was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy in each participant. results: the most prevalent infection was streptococcus sanguis (59.5%), followed by prevotella intermedia (43.4%), tannerella forsythensis (37.9%), capnocytophaga sp. (36.9%), eubacterium saburreum (32.7%), campylobacter rectus (17.4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (15.1%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (14.2%). infections with p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, p. intermedia, and c. rectus were associated with an increased likelihood of having oral bone loss as measured by ach, even after adjustment for age, smoking, and income. the body mass index (bmi) was a modifier of this association. overweight women with t. forsythensis infection were more likely to  have oral bone loss (or = 3.37; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.08 to 5.46) than  normal weight (or = 1.27; 95% ci: 0.82 to 1.98) or obese (or = 1.26, 95% ci: 0.72 to 2.20) women with t. forsythensis infection. conclusions: the prevalence of specific bacterial infections was determined for a large group of postmenopausal  women. those with infection were more likely to have oral bone loss. further studies should investigate potential modifying effects of bmi and/or inflammatory factors.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

TI  == localized aggressive periodontitis in primary dentition: a case report.
AB  == background: a 5-year-old japanese boy presented with persistent gingival inflammation and severe mobility of the right lower primary incisors. due to severe alveolar bone loss and a deep periodontal pocket (5 mm), the incisors were extracted at the second visit. methods: clinical, radiographic, histological, and microbiological examinations were carried out. then, the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique was employed to detect specific periodontal pathogens. the chemotactic activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils was also measured. results: tannerella, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, and eikenella sp. were recovered from the subgingival microflora around the right lower incisors, while  a. actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected using the pcr method. further chemotaxis assay revealed  that neutrophil function was depressed compared with that of healthy controls. conclusions: although inflammation remained around the right primary second molars, the bone loss was controlled by periodic professional mechanical teeth cleaning (pmtc), subgingival irrigation, and local antibiotic application. the probing depths of all teeth, including permanent incisors and molars, were within 2.5 mm.

TI  == antibacterial activity of medicinal plant extracts against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of althaea officinalis l. roots, arnica montana l. flowers, calendula officinalis l. flowers, hamamelis virginiana l. leaves, illicium verum hook. fruits and melissa  officinalis l. leaves, against anaerobic and facultative aerobic periodontal bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veilonella parvula, eikenella corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces odontolyticus. the methanol extracts of h. virginiana and a. montana and, to a lesser extent, a. officinalis were shown to possess an inhibiting activity (mic < or = 2048 mg/l) against many of the species tested. in comparison, m. officinalis and c. officinalis extracts had a lower inhibiting activity (mic > or = 2048 mg/l) against all the tested species with the exception of prevotella sp. illicium verum methanol extract was not very active though it had a particular good activity against e. corrodens. the results suggest the use of the alcohol extracts of h. virginiana, a. montana and a. officinalis for topical medications in periodontal prophylactics.

TI  == microbiologic and radiographic analysis of ligature-induced peri-implantitis with different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == purpose: the goal of this study was to evaluate microbiota and radiographic peri-implant bone loss associated with ligature-induced peri-implantitis. materials and methods: thirty-six dental implants with 4 different surfaces (9 commercially pure titanium, 9 titanium plasma-sprayed, 9 hydroxyapatite, and 9 acid-etched) were placed in the edentulous mandibles of 6 dogs. after 3 months with optimal plaque control, abutment connection was performed. on days 0, 20, 40, and 60 after placement of cotton ligatures, both microbiologic samples and periapical radiographs were obtained. the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, campylobacter spp, capnocytophaga spp, fusobacterium spp,  beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and candida spp were evaluated culturally. results: p intermedia/nigrescens was detected in 13.89% of implants at baseline and 100% of implants at other periods. p gingivalis was not detected at baseline, but after 20 and 40 days it was detected in 33.34% of implants and at 60 days it was  detected in 29.03% of dental implants. fusobacterium spp was detected in all periods. streptococci were detected in 16.67% of implants at baseline and in 83.34%, 72.22%, and 77.42% of implants at 20, 40, and 60 days, respectively. campylobacter spp and candida spp were detected in low proportions. the total viable count analysis showed no significant differences among surfaces (p = .831), although a significant difference was observed after ligature placement (p < .0014). however, there was no significant qualitative difference, in spite of the difference among the periods. the peri-implant bone loss was not significantly different between all the dental implant surfaces (p = .908). discussion and conclusions: these data suggest that with ligature-induced peri-implantitis, both time and periodontal pathogens affect all surfaces equally after 60 days.

TI  == comparative microbiological characteristics of failing implants and periodontally diseased teeth.
AB  == background: the purpose of this report was to compare the distribution of periodontal pathogens recovered from failing implants and teeth with adult and recurrent forms of periodontitis. methods: a total of 41 consecutive microbial samples from patients with failing implants (imp) were received at the microbiology testing laboratory (mtl) of the university of pennsylvania over a 2-year period. paired control samples were selected from samples received concurrently by mtl from 41 patients with a diagnosis of adult periodontitis (ap) and 41 with a diagnosis of recurrent or refractory periodontitis (rp). patients'  mean ages for the 3 categories were 59, 47, and 53 years, respectively. samples were collected with paper points or scalers and shipped in prereduced medium by express mail to the laboratory where they were processed within 48 hours from the time of collection. culture was used for detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, p. micros, capnocytophaga and  fusobacterium sp., enteric gram-negative rods, enterococcus and staphylococcus sp., and yeast. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. morphotypes were enumerated by dark-field microscopy. results: the most frequently detected microorganisms from imp were b. forsythus (59%), spirochetes (54%), fusobacterium (41%), p. micros (39%), and p. gingivalis (27%). recovery levels (mean +/- sd) were 1+/-1, 4+/-5, 4+/-5, 9+/-11, 1+/-2, respectively. the most frequently detected organisms for ap were b. forsythus (83%), fusobacterium (80%), spirochetes (79%), p. gingivalis (59%), p. micros (51%), and e. corrodens (37%), at levels 2+/-2, 5+/-4, 9+/-6, 4+/-5, and 6+/-7, respectively. corresponding data for rp were b. forsythus (85%), fusobacterium (83%), p. gingivalis (60%), spirochetes (59%), c. rectus (56%), and p. micros (56%), at levels of 3+/-2, 8+/-8, 4+/-4, 2+/-2, 1+/-1, and 9+/-10, respectively.  conclusions: these results indicate that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens in failing implants are significantly different from that of teeth with periodontitis; however, the detection frequency and levels of recovery are similar in teeth affected by adult and refractory (recurrent) forms of periodontitis.

TI  == comparison of randomly cloned and whole genomic dna probes for the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus.
AB  == whole genomic and randomly-cloned dna probes for two fastidious periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus were labeled with digoxigenin and detected by a colorimetric method. the specificity and sensitivity of the whole genomic and cloned probes were compared. the cloned probes were highly specific compared to the whole genomic probes. a significant degree of cross-reactivity with bacteroides species, capnocytophaga sp. and prevotella sp. was observed with the whole genomic probes. the cloned probes were less sensitive than the whole genomic probes and required at least 10(6) target cells or a minimum of 10 ng of target dna to be detected during hybridization. although a ten-fold increase in sensitivity was obtained with the whole genomic probes, cross-hybridization to closely related species limits their reliability in identifying target bacteria in subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == occurrence of certain bacterial species and morphotypes in juvenile periodontitis in chile.
AB  == the occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (gjp) patients. the subgingival proportion of  the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. the results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%)  there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, c. rectus, and f. nucleatum in ljp, and for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum in gjp. the mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (p < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. capnocytophaga sp, f. nucleatum, p. intermedia, and e. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in ljp. when taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with ljp and gjp in chile are p. gingivalis (66% of ljp and 80% of gjp affected sites), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of ljp and 50% in gjp affected sites). different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease  process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.
