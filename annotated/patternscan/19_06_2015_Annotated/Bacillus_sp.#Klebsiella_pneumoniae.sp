TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == structural properties of prokaryotic promoter regions correlate with functional features.
AB  == the structural properties of the dna molecule are known to play a critical role in transcription. in this paper, the structural profiles of promoter regions were studied within the context of their diversity and their function for eleven prokaryotic species; escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas auroginosa, geobacter sulfurreducens helicobacter pylori, chlamydophila pneumoniae, synechocystis sp., synechoccocus elongates, bacillus anthracis, and the archaea sulfolobus solfataricus. the main anchor point for these promoter regions were transcription start sites identified through high-throughput experiments or collected within large curated databases.  prokaryotic promoter regions were found to be less stable and less flexible than  the genomic mean across all studied species. however, direct comparison between species revealed differences in their structural profiles that can not solely be  explained by the difference in genomic gc content. in addition, comparison with functional data revealed that there are patterns in the promoter structural profiles that can be linked to specific functional loci, such as sigma factor regulation or transcription factor binding. interestingly, a novel structural element clearly visible near the transcription start site was found in genes associated with essential cellular functions and growth in several species. our analyses reveals the great diversity in promoter structural profiles both between and within prokaryotic species. we observed relationships between structural diversity and functional features that are interesting prospects for further research to yet uncharacterized functional loci defined by dna structural properties.

TI  == cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  == the cell free culture filtrate of bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, rhabditis (oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. the structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (fabms, (1)h  nmr, (13)c nmr, (1)h-(1)h cosy, (1)h-(13)c hmbc) and marfey's method. the compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (cdps): cyclo(l-pro-l-trp), cyclo(l-leu-l-val), cyclo(d-pro-d-met), and cyclo(d-pro-d-phe), respectively. compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant s. aureus) except cyclo(l-leu-l-val). cyclo(l-leu-l-val) recorded activity only against gram positive bacteria. best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against s. aureus (4 mug/ml). the four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (trichophyton rubrum, aspergillus flavus, candida albicans, candida tropicalis and cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin b, the standard fungicide. the highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) was recorded against t. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. the activity of cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against t. rubrum, c. neoformans and c. albicans were better than amphotericin b, the standard antifungal agent. to our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of cdps against the human pathogenic fungi t. rubrum and c. neoformans. the four cdps are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. we conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.

TI  == antibacterial and antifungal activities of crude plant extracts from colombian biodiversity.
AB  == on a global scale, people have used plants to treat diseases and infections, and  this has raised interest on the plant biodiversity potencial in the search of antimicrobial principles. in this work, 75 crude n-hexanes, dichloromethane and methanol extracts from the aerial parts of 25 plants belonging to four botanical  families (asteraceae, euphorbiaceae, rubiaceae and solanaceae), collected at the  natural regional park ucumari (risaralda, colombia), were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities by the agar well diffusion method. the antibacterial activities were assayed against two gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis, and three gram-negative ones named,  klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition,  the same plant extracts were tested against the yeast candida albicans and the fungi aspergillus fumigatus and fusarium solani. overall, the plant extracts examined displayed better bactericide rather than fungicide activities. in general, the best antibacterial activity was showed by the plant extracts from the rubiaceae family, followed in order by the extracts from the euphorbiaceae and solanaceae ones. it is important to emphasize the great activity displayed by the methanol extract of alchornea coelophylla (euphorbiaceae) that inhibited four out of five bacteria tested (b. subtilis, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and e. coli).  furthermore, the best minimal inhibitory concentration for the extracts with antifungal activities were displayed by the dichloromethane extracts from acalypha diversifolia and euphorbia sp (euphorbiaceae). the most susceptible fungus evaluated was f. solani since 60% and 20% of the dichloromethane and methanol extracts evaluated inhibited the growth of this phytopathogenic fungus.  the antimicrobial activity of the different plant extracts examined in this work  could be related to the secondary metabolites contents and their interaction and  susceptibility of pathogenic microorganism evaluated.

TI  == fate of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in crude oil contaminated wetland ultisol.
AB  == the effect of crude oil on the growth of legumes (calopogonium muconoides and centrosema pubescens) and fate of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in wetland ultisol was investigated using standard cultural techniques. the results revealed observable  effects of oil on soil physico-chemistry, plant growth and nodulation as well as  on densities of heterotrophic, hydrocarbonoclastic and nitrogen fixing bacteria.  the effects however varied with different levels (0.5%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) of pollution. ammonium and nitrate levels were high in the unpolluted soil but decreased with increase in pollution levels. nitrite was not detected in contaminated soil probably due to the reduction in numbers of nitrogen fixers, from 5.26 +/- 0.23 x l0(6)cfu/g in unpolluted soil to 9.0 +/- 0.12 x 10(5) and 2.2 +/- 0.08 x l0(5) cfu/g in soils with 5% and 20% levels of pollution respectively. the contaminated soil also exhibited gross reduction in the nodulation of legumes. a range of 13-57 nodules was observed in legumes from polluted soil against 476 nodules recorded for plants cultured on unpolluted soil. the heterogeneity of the microbial loads between oil-polluted and unpolluted soil were statistically significant (p < 0.05, anova). positive significant relationships were observed between the levels of hydrocarbons and the densities of heterotrophic bacteria (r = 0.91) and that of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria (r = 0.86). on the other hand, relationships between the densities of nitrogen fixing bacteria and total hydrocarbons content was negative (r = -0.30) while positive relationships were recorded between the densities of different microbial groups and treatment periods except at 15% and 20% pollution  levels. the lsd tests revealed highly significant differences (p < 0.001) in the  physiological groups of soil microorganisms at all levels of pollution. the results imply that crude oil seriously affects rhizosphere microbial growth in legumes. among the bacterial species isolated, clostridium pasteurianum, bacillus polymyxa and pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited greater ability to degrade hydrocarbons than azotobacter sp, klebsiella pneumoniae and derxia gummusa while  nitrosomonas and nitrobacter had the least degradability. a continuous monitoring of the environment is advocated to prevent extinction of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and total loss of soil fertility attributable to petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in the niger delta ultisol.

TI  == isolation, characterization and phylogeny of sponge-associated bacteria with antimicrobial activities from brazil.
AB  == bacteria associated with marine sponges represent a rich source of bioactive metabolites. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize bacteria with  antimicrobial activities from brazilian sponges. a total of 158 colony-forming units were isolated from nine sponge species. among these, 12 isolates presented  antimicrobial activities against pathogenic bacteria. based on comparative sequence analysis of their 16s rrna genes, the sponge-associated bacterial strains could be subdivided into three phylogenetically different clusters. five  strains were affiliated with firmicutes (genera bacillus and virgibacillus), three with alpha-proteobacteria (pseudovibrio sp.) and four with gamma-proteobacteria (genera pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas). the sponge-associated bacterial strains pseudomonas fluorescens h40 and h41 and pseudomonas aeruginosa h51 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including strains such as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae. bacillus pumilus pc31 and pc32, pseudovibrio ascidiaceicola pm31 and  ca31 and pseudovibrio denitrificans mm37 strains were more effective against gram-positive bacteria. these findings suggest that the identified strains may contribute to the search for new sources of antimicrobial substances, an important strategy for developing alternative therapies to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == tetracycline and chloramphenicol efficiency against selected biofilm forming bacteria.
AB  == despite the constantly increasing need for new antimicrobial agents, antibiotic drug discovery and development seem to have greatly decelerated in recent years.  presented with the significant problem of advancing antimicrobial resistance, the global scientific community has attempted to find alternative solutions; one of the most promising ones is the evaluation and use of old antibiotic compounds. a  number of old antibiotic compounds, such as aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline, are re-emerging as valuable alternatives for the treatment of difficult-to-treat infections. this study examined the in vitro potency for biofilm formation of five isolates (klebsiella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, achromobacter sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacillus pumilis) and the effects of antibiotics on these biofilms. furthermore the quantitative analysis of planktonic, loosely attached cells, and their susceptibility to antibiotics was also determined. twitching motility was observed to determine any effect in the biofilm forming capability of the isolates. all the isolates tested were efficient biofilm-forming strains in the polypropylene and borosilicate test tubes. standard bacterial enumeration technique and cv staining produced equivalent results both in biofilm and planktonic assays. the biofilm formation of all the strains was affected in the presence of tetracycline or chloramphenicol. highly significant decrease (p < 0.01) in biofilm formation was  observed by treatment with chloramphenicol compared to tetracycline. in addition, the two antibiotics also affected adversely the planktonic and loosely attached cells of all isolates. thus, testing the effects of older antibiotics on biofilms may supply useful information in addition to standard in vitro testing, particularly in diseases where biofilm formation is involved in the pathogenesis.

AB  == a wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have  been described with several neonatal infections. we studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. the infections diagnosed included neisseria meningitidies, group a streptococcus, rickettsia rickettsii, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ehrlichia sp., bacillus anthracis, leptospira sp., clostridium sp., klebsiella sp., legionella sp., yersinia pestis, and treponema pallidum. bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with n. meningitidis, four with r. rickettsii, four with s. pneumoniae, three with group a streptococcus, two with s. aureus, two with b. anthracis, one with t. pallidum, and one with legionella sp. bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. although n. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.

TI  == differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == microbial diversity and prevalence of virulent pathogens in biofilms developed in a water reclamation system.
AB  == bacterial biofilm is a common phenomenon in both natural and engineered systems which often becomes a source of contamination and microbially influenced corrosion. it is thought that formation of biofilm in the monoculture of several  bacterial species is regulated by acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) quorum-sensing signals. in this study, we investigated the microbial diversity and existence of  ahl-producing and ahl-degrading bacterial species in the biofilm samples from a water reclamation system located in a tropical environment. 16s ribosomal dna sequencing analysis indicated the presence of at least 11 bacterial species, including the frequently encountered bacterial pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, and several rare pathogens. we showed that only two groups of isolates, belonging to p. aeruginosa and enterobacter agglomerans, produced ahl signals. we also found that three bacterial isolates, i.e., agrobacterium tumefaciens xj01, bacillus cereus xj08, and ralstonia sp. xj12, expressed ahl degradation enzymes. furthermore, we showed that p. aeruginosa isolate hl43 was virulent against animal model caenorhabditis elegans and released 2-6-fold more pyocyanin cytotoxin than p. aeruginosa strains pa01 and pa14, the two commonly used laboratory strains. these data indicate the complexity and importance of biofilm research in water reclamation.

TI  == ahld, an n-acylhomoserine lactonase in arthrobacter sp., and predicted homologues in other bacteria.
AB  == quorum sensing is a signalling mechanism that controls diverse biological functions, including virulence, via n-acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) signal molecules in gram-negative bacteria. with the aim of isolating strains or enzymes capable of blocking quorum sensing by inactivating ahl, bacteria were screened for ahl degradation by their ability to utilize n-3-oxohexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (ohhl) as the sole carbon source. among four isolates, strain ibn110, identified as arthrobacter sp., was found to grow rapidly on ohhl, and to degrade various ahls with different lengths and acyl side-chain substitutions. co-culture of arthrobacter sp. ibn110 and the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora significantly reduced both the ahl amount and pectate lyase activity in co-culture medium, suggesting the possibility of applying arthrobacter sp. ibn110 in the control of ahl-producing pathogenic bacteria. the ahld gene from arthrobacter sp. ibn110 encoding the enzyme catalysing ahl degradation was cloned, and found to encode a protein of 273 amino acids. a mass spectrometry analysis showed that ahld probably hydrolyses the lactone ring of n-3-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone, indicating that ahld is an n-acylhomoserine lactonase (ahlase). a comparison of ahld with other known ahl-degrading enzymes,  bacillus sp. 240b1 aiia, a bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kyushuensis aiia homologue and agrobacterium tumefaciens attm, revealed 25, 26 and 21 % overall identities, respectively, in the deduced amino acid sequences. although these identities were relatively low, the hxdh approximately h approximately d motif was conserved in all the ahlases, suggesting that this motif is essential for ahlase activity. from a genome database search based on the conserved motif, putative ahld-like lactonase genes were found in several other bacteria, and ahl-degrading activities were observed in klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus stearothermophilus. furthermore, it was verified that ahlk, an ahld homologue, encodes an ahl-degrading enzyme in k. pneumoniae. accordingly, the current results suggest the possibility that ahld-like ahlases could exist in many other  micro-organisms.

AB  == infection of escherichia coli by bacteriophage lambda depends on two membrane protein complexes: (i) maltoporin (lamb) in the outer membrane for adsorption and (ii) the iic(man)-iid(man) complex of the mannose transporter in the inner membrane for dna penetration. iic(man) and iid(man) are components of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) which together with the iiab(man) subunit mediate transport and phosphorylation of sugars. to identify structural determinants important for penetration of lambda dna, the homologous iic-iid complexes of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and b. subtilis, and chimeric complexes between the iic and iid were characterized. all three complexes support sugar transport in e. coli. only iic-iid of e. coli and b. subtilis also support bacteriophage lambda infection. the six chimeric complexes  had lost transport activity, but three containing iic of e. coli or b. subtilis continue to support bacteriophage lambda infection. complexes containing iic(man) and fusion proteins between truncated iid(man) and alkaline phosphatase or beta-galactosidase support penetration of lambda dna if less than 100 residues are missing from the c-terminus of iid(man). truncation of iic(man) renders the complex unstable. taken together, these results suggest, that iic is the major specificity determinant for lambda infection but that the iic subunit is stably expressed only in a complex with the iid subunit. lambda dna in transit across the periplasmic space, but not transforming plasmid dna, is inaccessible to the non-specific nuclease nuca of anabaena sp. targeted to the periplasmic space either in soluble form or as a fusion protein to the c-terminus of iid(man).

TI  == [establishment of the phylogenetic relationship between the microbial producers of cyclodextrin glucanotransferases using their complete amino acid sequences].
AB  == a phylogenetic tree was constructed on the basis of the amino acid sequences of the known cyclodextrin glucanotransferases (cdgts), including those deduced from  the nucleotide sequences of bacillus sp. strain 6.6.3 and paenibacillus macerans  ib-7 genes encoding alpha- and beta-cdgts. the tree clearly demonstrates the existence of distinct phylogenetic groups of cdgt-producing microorganisms and the divergence of the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cdgt produced by microorganisms from the genera bacillus, paenibacillus, brevibacillus, and thermoanaerobacter from a common ancestor, whereas the cdgt of klebsiella pneumoniae is independent  and results from the convergence of different ancestors. the degree of homology of the leader peptide sequences of cdgts may serve as a criterion of intraspecies relatedness between cdgt-producing microorganisms.

TI  == cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  == the algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (ind), lysine decarboxylase (ldc), and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, ind positive (ind(+)), escherichia coli; metallic blue, ind(+), ldc(+), and odc negative (odc(-)), klebsiella oxytoca; ind(+), ldc(-), and odc(+), citrobacter diversus; ind(+) or ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(-), citrobacter freundii; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(+), enterobacter aerogenes; ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(+), enterobacter cloacae; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(-), klebsiella pneumoniae;  diffuse brown and ind(+), morganella morganii; ind(-), proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, serratia marcescens; bluish green and ind(+), proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. during an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. a total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on chromagar orientation medium. for 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. the cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. the results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. in addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == the biological activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  == cyclic dipeptides are widely used as models for larger peptides because of their  simplicity and limited conformational freedom. some cyclic dipeptides have been shown to be antiviral, antibiotic and anti-tumour. the aim of this study was to determine the biological activity of four cyclic dipeptides synthesized in this laboratory: cyclo(l-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tyrosyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-prolyl) and cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). the enhancement or inhibition of calcium channels in ventricular myocytes from rats and delayed-rectifier potassium channels in ventricular myocytes from guinea-pigs were determined by use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. the induction of  differentiation in ht-29 cells was assessed by assaying for an increase in the expression of alkaline phosphatase. antibiotic properties against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilus and streptococcus sp. were determined by use of the kirby-bauer disc-diffusion assay. results from these assays indicate that the cyclic dipeptides have biological activity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. three of  the dipeptides block cation channels in ventricular myocytes and all increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase. all the dipeptides have concentration-dependent antibacterial properties. these results suggest that with increased solubility the cyclic dipeptides might have potential as muscle relaxants, anti-tumour compounds and antibiotics.

TI  == bacterial flavohaemoglobins: a consensus sequence and identification of a discrete enterobacterial group and of further bacterial globins.
AB  == the amino acid sequences of haemoglobin-like proteins from the bacteria alcaligenes eutrophus, bacillus subtilis, erwinia chrysanthemi, escherichia coli, vibrio parahaemolyticus, vitreoscilla sp. and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae  were studied. phylogenies based on distance and parsimony analysis showed that the eubacterial group can be easily distinguished from the other haemoglobin-like proteins. the construction of a consensus bacterial flavohaemoglobin based on the alignment of six bacterial and one yeast globins allowed the design of consensus  primers to search for haemoglobin-like genes in other bacteria. pcr products of the expected size were found in campylobacter jejuni, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, rhizobium leguminosarum, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == quantification of frankia strains and other root-associated bacteria in pure cultures and in the rhizosphere of axenic seedlings by high-performance liquid chromatography-based muramic acid assay.
AB  == application of a high-performance liquid chromatography-based muramic acid assay  with precolumn fluorescence derivatization to quantification of root-associated bacteria was studied both in pure cultures and in the rhizosphere of axenic festuca rubra seedlings. quantities of muramic acid from acid-hydrolyzed cells of frankia strains, streptomyces griseoviridis, enterobacter agglomerans, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas sp., and bacillus polymyxa were mostly proportional to the respective cell protein and carbon quantities, but in some strains, culture age and particularly sporulation affected these ratios considerably. the muramic  acid/cell protein ratio was generally 2 to 4 times higher in strains of the two actinomycete genera, frankia and streptomyces, than in the rest of the strains. quantification of frankia strains, s. griseoviridis, e. agglomerans, and pseudomonas sp. was also attempted from the rhizosphere of f. rubra seedlings which had been inoculated with pure cultured bacteria and incubated briefly. it was possible to quantify frankia cells by use of the muramic acid assay from both the root and the growth medium, whereas cells of the rest of the bacterial genera could only be detected in the medium. the detection limit for muramic acid was about 10 ng/ml hydrolysis volume, and from the festuca rhizosphere, 28 to 63% of  the muramic acid in the frankia inoculum was recovered.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression of thermophilic bacillus sp. strain tb-90 urease gene complex in escherichia coli.
AB  == the urease of thermophilic bacillus sp. strain tb-90 is composed of three subunits with molecular masses of 61, 12, and 11 kda. by using synthetic oligonucleotide probes based on n-terminal amino acid sequences of each subunit,  we cloned a 3.2-kb ecori fragment of tb-90 genomic dna. moreover, we cloned two other dna fragments by gene walking starting from this fragment. finally, we reconstructed in vitro a 6.2-kb dna fragment which expressed catalytically active urease in escherichia coli by combining these three dna fragments. nucleotide sequencing analysis revealed that the urease gene complex consists of nine genes, which were designed urea, ureb, urec, uree, uref, ureg, ured, ureh, and urei in order of arrangement. the structural genes urea, ureb, and urec encode the 11-, 12-, and 61-kda subunits, respectively. the deduced amino acid sequences of ured, uree, uref, and ureg, the gene products of four accessory genes, are homologous to those of the corresponding ure proteins of klebsiella aerogenes. ured, uref, and ureg were essential for expression of urease activity in e. coli and are suggested to play important roles in the maturation step of the urease in a co- and/or posttranslational manner. on the other hand, ureh and urei exhibited no significant similarity to the known accessory proteins of other bacteria. however, ureh showed 23% amino acid identity to the alcaligenes eutrophus hoxn protein, a high-affinity nickel transporter.

TI  == utility of phenomenological models for describing temperature dependence of bacterial growth.
AB  == we compared three unstructured mathematical models, the master reaction, the square root, and the damage/repair models, for describing the relationship between temperature and the specific growth rates of bacteria. the models were evaluated on the basis of several criteria: applicability, ease of use, simple interpretation of model parameters, problem-free determination of model parameters, statistical evaluation of goodness of fit (chi 2 test), and biological relevance. best-fit parameters for the master reaction model could be  obtained by using two consecutive nonlinear least-square fits. the damage/repair  model proved to be unsuited for the data sets considered and was judged markedly  overparameterized. the square root model allowed nonproblematical parameter estimation by a nonlinear least-square procedure and, together with the master reaction model, was able to describe the temperature dependence of the specific growth rates of klebsiella pneumoniae ncib 418, escherichia coli nc3, bacillus sp. strain ncib 12522, and the thermotolerant coccobacillus strain na17. the square root and master reaction models were judged to be equally valid and superior to the damage/repair model, even though the square root model is devoid  of a conceptual basis.

TI  == effect of organic amendments on bacterial multiplication in lake water.
AB  == in cayuga lake water amended with 30 micrograms of glucose or amino acids per ml, an added strain of pseudomonas fluorescens and indigenous bacteria grew extensively, pseudomonas sp. b4 and two rhizobia multiplied at a moderate extent, and introduced escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae multiplied but to only  a slight degree. the amendments did not enhance growth of micrococcus flavus and  arthrobacter citreus, and an asporogenous strain of bacillus subtilis decreased in numbers. the pseudomonads, rhizobia, e. coli and k. pneumoniae multiplied extensively when inoculated into sterile lake water amended with amino acids, a.  citreus grew to a slight extent, but the numbers of m. flavus and b. subtilis did not change appreciably. in nonsterile lake water amended with 30 micrograms of trypticase soy broth per ml, the indigenous bacteria greatly increased in abundance, the pseudomonads, rhizobia, and e. coli developed to a lesser extent,  the numbers of k. pneumoniae, a. citreus and m. flavus showed little increase, and b. subtilis decreased in numbers. tests in pure culture containing 2 to 64 micrograms of trypticase soy broth per ml demonstrated good growth of p. fluorescens, pseudomonas sp. b4, and the rhizobia at all concentrations; an initial decline followed by growth of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and r. leguminosarum biovar phaseoli at low concentrations; little or no growth or decline at the low  levels but multiplication at the high levels by a. citreus and b. subtilis; and decline of m. flavus. it is proposed that the apparent ks value, mumax value, length of lag phase and resistance to stress can be used to predict behavior of bacteria in lake water receiving low levels of organic nutrients.

TI  == the nosocomial colonization of t. bear.
AB  == a national effort to reduce nosocomial infections includes a program developed at the national institutes of health to encourage handwashing in hospitals and day care centers. the program promotes a symbolic teddy bear (t. bear) with slogans to remind hospital personnel and patients to practice handwashing. one of the items used is a stuffed toy t. bear to be dispensed to the hospitalized child. considering the manner in which children handle stuffed toys, we suspected the t. bear might serve as a "fomite" for transmission of nosocomial microbes. a prospective study of 39 sterilized t. bears revealed that all became colonized with bacteria, fungi, or both within 1 week of hospitalization. hospital acquired organisms cultured from the t. bear included staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, alpha streptococci, corynebacterium acnes, micrococcus sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, bacillus sp, and species of candida, cryptococcus, trichosporon, aspergillus and others. concomitant cultures of the patients revealed similar isolates. although the t. bear handwashing campaign should not be discredited, the promotional toy may pose an unnecessary expense and hazard and should not be used in hospitals or day care centers.

TI  == two-component regulatory systems responsive to environmental stimuli share strongly conserved domains with the nitrogen assimilation regulatory genes ntrb and ntrc.
AB  == we report that the ntrb and ntrc proteins of bradyrhizobium sp. [parasponia] strain rp501 share homology with other regulatory proteins. there is extensive conservation of c-terminal regions between products of rp501 ntrb; klebsiella pneumoniae ntrb; escherichia coli envz, cpxa, and phor; agrobacterium tumefaciens vira; and, to a lesser extent, e. coli chea. there is also extensive conservation of n-terminal regions between products of rp501 ntrc; k. pneumoniae ntrc; e. coli ompr, sfra, phob, chey and cheb; salmonella typhimurium cheb and chey; bacillus subtilis spooa and spoof; and a. tumefaciens virg. we propose that these regulatory genes comprise two-component regulatory systems that evolved from a common ancestral system that involved transduction of information about the status of the environment by one protein domain (the c-terminal regions conserved among ntrb, envz, etc.) to a second one (the n-terminal region conserved among ntrc, ompr, etc.). the ntrc-set protein then acts upon a specific responding mechanism, typically as a transcriptional activator but also as an effector of the maturation of outer membrane proteins or as a modulator of the direction of flagella rotation.

TI  == dinitrogen-fixing bacteria: computer-assisted identification of soil isolates.
AB  == dinitrogen-fixing (acetylene-reducing) bacteria may be readily isolated from soils but extensive biochemical or immunobiological testing, or both, are required to identify them absolutely. a computer-assisted scheme for identification of nine genera of dinitrogen-fixing bacteria was developed and tested. the computer program is based on interpretation of the 70 biochemical tests of the api 20e and 50e, supplemented with tests for acetylene reduction, nitrate and nitrite reduction, catalase, oxidase, motility, and growth on macconkey's bile salt medium. dinitrogen-fixing enterobacteriaceae (klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and erwinia herbicola) were accurately identified using the data base in the api analytical profile index. nonenteric dinitrogen-fixing bacteria (azotobacter spp., azospirillum spp., derxia sp., rhodospirillum sp., clostridium sp., and bacillus spp.) were subjected to these tests to form a new data base for these bacteria. the api tests agreed with standard biochemical tests commonly used to identify these bacteria, were reproducible with time, and were sufficiently unique to permit accurate identification of each species. the use of the api 20e and 50e tests plus the additional seven tests with these known data bases permitted rapid and precise identification of acetylene reducing bacteria from various agricultural ecosystems.

TI  == goiter prevalence and bacterial contamination of water supplies.
AB  == previous epidemiological studies have shown a significant statistical correlation (p < 0.005 to p < 0.0005) between goiter prevalence and rock types in the watersheds that supply 37 localities in western columbia. bacterial contamination has also been implicated as a cause of endemic goiter. we, therefore, did bacteriological studies to incorporate this variable into the statistical model in 34 of the 37 localities previously surveyed. samples of the water in the 34 localities were taken at the water source or intake of water supply and at the pipeline system in households and schools. samples were collected in sterile bottles and cultured on several media for 48 h. the number of bacteria per ml was determined by quebec's camera and the bacteria (e. coli, bacillus sp., k. pneumoniae, proteus sp., and neisseria sp.) were identified according to conventional methods. multiple regression analysis and the logistic regression model were used to analyze the data. only two variables had significant relationships with goiter prevalence: k. pneumoniae in the water source (p < 0.01) is related to a lower prevalence and the overall concentration of bacteria  in the pipeline system (p < 0.05) is related to a higher prevalence. multiple regression analysis to compare the effects of bacteriological variables to those  of geological variables indicating rock types showed sedimentary rocks in the watershed associated (p < 0.005) with higher goiter prevalence and an increased concentration of k. pneumoniae in the water source again associated (p < 0.025) with lower goiter prevalence. bacterial concentration in the pipeline system was  of marginal importance (0.05 < p < 0.10). thus, the presence of sedimentary rocks was the best indicator of disease. a second best indicator was the concentration  of k. pneumoniae in the water source. we hypothesize that the lower goiter prevalence associated with k. pneumoniae may be a natural example of biodegradation of the organic contaminants that produce goiter.

TI  == degradation of uric acid by certain aerobic bacteria.
AB  == we have isolated and identified nine cultures of aerobic bacteria capable of growing on an elective medium containing uric acid as the only source of carbon,  nitrogen, and energy. four of these cultures were identified as aerobacter aerogenes, two as klebsiella pneumoniae, and the remainder as serratia killiensis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus species. another culture identified as p. fluorescens required both glucose and uric acid for growth. when 23 laboratory stock cultures were inoculated into the uric acid medium, a. aerogenes, b. subtilis, mycobacterium phlei, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens were able to grow. these five cultures also grew when the uric acid was replaced  with adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, or allantoin, but growth was poor. in all of these media, including the uric acid medium, addition of glucose along  with the nitrogenous compounds yielded good growth. induction experiments demonstrated that the ability of a. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, s. kiliensis, s. marcescens, b. subtilis, and bacillus sp. to degrade uric acid is an induced property. of these organisms, only bacillus sp. accumulated a small amount of intracellular uric acid.
