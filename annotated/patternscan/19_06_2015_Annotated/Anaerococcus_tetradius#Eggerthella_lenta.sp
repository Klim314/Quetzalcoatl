TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == bacterial conversion of secoisolariciresinol and anhydrosecoisolariciresinol.
AB  == aims: it has been investigated whether secoisolariciresinol (seco) and anhydrosecoisolariciresinol (ahs), an acid degradation product of seco, could be  fermented in a similar way, and to a similar extent, by members of the intestinal microbiota. methods and results: ahs and seco were demethylated by peptostreptococcus productus, eubacterium limosum and clostridium methoxybenzovorans. these bacteria have been identified as members of the human intestinal flora or closely related species. demethylated ahs and demethylated seco were purified by preparative rp-hplc, and subsequently subjected to fermentation with eggerthella lenta, clostridium scindens and clostridium hiranonis. eggerthella lenta efficiently dehydroxylated demethylated seco to enterodiol, whereas the other bacteria showed no dehydroxylation activity. conclusions: the conversion of the diol structure of seco into the furan ring in  ahs did not influence the demethylation capability of the tested bacteria. the results also showed that the extent of dehydroxylation of demethylated ahs was much lower than that of demethylated seco. significance and impact of the study:  plant lignans are converted into bioactive mammalian lignans by the human intestinal bacteria. this study showed that the modification of plant lignans resulted in the formation a new type of mammalian lignan.

TI  == occurrence and activity of human intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of dietary lignans.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is necessary for the production of enterolignans  from the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg). however, little is known about the bacteria that contribute to sdg conversion. therefore, we aimed at describing the occurrence and activity of sdg metabolising bacteria. the data showed differences in conversion efficiency between sdg deglycosylating species, but sdg was completely deglycosylated within 20 h by five of six strains. the strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db showed the highest initial rate  of sdg deglycosylation. furthermore, we found that bacteroides distasonis and b.  fragilis made up 0.5% and 3.3% of total faecal bacteria, respectively. however, clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db was detected within the dominant microbiota of only  two out of 20 faecal samples. bacteria involved in the demethylation step of sdg  conversion also demethylated a variety of compounds other than sdg. in particular, peptostreptococcus productus demethylated the lignans pinoresinol, lariciresinol and matairesinol. finally, eggerthella lenta catalysed the reduction of pinoresinol and lariciresinol to secoisolariciresinol.

TI  == phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg) via secoisolariciresinol (seco) to  the enterolignans enterodiol (ed) and enterolactone (el). however, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of sdg. strains of bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db, deglycosylated sdg. demethylation of seco was catalysed by strains of butyribacterium methylotrophicum, eubacterium callanderi, eubacterium limosum and peptostreptococcus productus. dehydroxylation of seco was catalysed by strains of clostridium scindens and eggerthella lenta. finally, the newly isolated strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ed to el. the results indicate that the activation of sdg involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == intestinal bacterial communities that produce active estrogen-like compounds enterodiol and enterolactone in humans.
AB  == lignans are dietary diphenolic compounds which require activation by intestinal bacteria to exert possible beneficial health effects. the intestinal ecosystem plays a crucial role in lignan metabolism, but the organisms involved are poorly  described. to characterize the bacterial communities responsible for secoisolariciresinol (seco) activation, i.e., the communities that produce the enterolignans enterodiol (ed) and enterolactone (el), a study with 24 human subjects was undertaken. seco activation was detected in all tested fecal samples. the intestinal bacteria involved in ed production were part of the dominant microbiota (6 x 10(8) cfu g(-1)), as revealed by most-probable-number enumerations. conversely, organisms that catalyzed the formation of el occurred at a mean concentration of approximately 3 x 10(5) cfu g(-1). women tended to have higher concentrations of both ed- and el-producing organisms than men. significantly larger amounts of el were produced by fecal dilutions from individuals with moderate to high concentrations of el-producing bacteria. two organisms able to demethylate and dehydroxylate seco were isolated from human feces. based on 16s rrna gene sequence analyses, they were named peptostreptococcus productus seco-mt75m3 and eggerthella lenta seco-mt75m2. a new 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probe specific for p. productus and related species was designed and further used in fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments, along with five additional group-specific probes. significantly higher proportions of p. productus and related species (p = 0.012), as well as bacteria belonging to the atopobium group (p = 0.035), were typical of individuals with moderate to high concentrations of el-producing communities.

TI  == dna-dna relatedness and phylogenetic positions of slackia exigua, slackia heliotrinireducens, eggerthella lenta, and other related bacteria.
AB  == recently, two asaccharolytic eubacterium species, eubacterium exiguum and eubacterium lentum, and peptostreptococcus heliotrinreducens have been reclassified as slackia exigua, eggerthella lenta and slackia heliotrinireducens  in the novel genera on the basis of 16s rdna sequence analysis. but dna-dna relatedness among these species and other related bacteria have not been reported yet. dna-dna relatedness is the standard arbiter and the recommended method for the designation and evaluation of new species, particularly closely related ones. in the present study, dna-dna hybridization studies were performed on s. exigua,  s. heliotrinireducens and e. lenta together with the other bacterial species in the related genera. the phylogenetic relationships of these species were also investigated by comparison analysis of 16s rdna sequence data. in the dna-dna hybridization studies, s. exigua showed a dna homology level of 33% to s. heliotrinireducens and 11% to e. lenta. dna-dna homology between s. heliotrinireducens and e. lenta was 10%. but these three species showed very low  homology (less than 5%) to the related asaccharolytic species such as eubacterium and mogibacterium. in conclusion, the dna-dna relatedness data together with the  evolutionary data in the present paper further support the reclassification of eubacterium exiguum, peptostreptococcus heliotrinreducens and eubacterium lentum  as slackia exigua, slackia heliotrinireducens and eggerthella lenta, respectively.

TI  == bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  == background: acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. however, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. objective: to determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. study design: tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. results: aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with  healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; p < 0.01). bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were peptostreptococcus micros (66%), bilophila wadsworthia (63%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (44%), eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (41%). of the aerobes escherichia coli (88%) and streptococcus anginosus group (former streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. conclusions: the shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. the unusually high frequencies of b. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.

TI  == the family coriobacteriaceae: reclassification of eubacterium exiguum (poco et al. 1996) and peptostreptococcus heliotrinreducens (lanigan 1976) as slackia exigua gen. nov., comb. nov. and slackia heliotrinireducens gen. nov., comb. nov., and eubacterium lentum (prevot 1938) as eggerthella lenta gen. nov., comb.  nov.
AB  == 16s rrna gene sequences were determined for eubacterium exiguum and peptostreptococcus heliotrinreducens. these species were found to be closely related and, together with eubacterium lentum, to constitute a branch of the coriobacteriaceae. two new genera are proposed on the basis of phenotypic characteristics and 16s rrna gene sequence comparisons: slackia to include the bile-sensitive species eubacterium exiguum and p. heliotrinreducens, and eggerthella to include the bile-resistant eubacterium lentum. it is proposed that eubacterium exiguum and peptostreptococcus heliotrinreducens are transferred to the genus slackia gen. nov. as slackia exigua gen. nov., comb. nov. (type strain  atcc 700122t) and slackia heliotrinireducens gen. nov., comb. nov. (type strain ntcc 11029t), respectively, and eubacterium lentum is transferred to the genus eggerthella gen. nov. as eggerthella lenta gen. nov., comb. nov. with eggerthella lenta as the type species.
