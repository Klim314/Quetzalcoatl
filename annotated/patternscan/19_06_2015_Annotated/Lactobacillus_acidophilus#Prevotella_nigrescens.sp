TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == microbial risk markers for childhood caries in pediatricians' offices.
AB  == dental caries in pre-school children has significant public health and health disparity implications. to determine microbial risk markers for this infection, this study aimed to compare the microbiota of children with early childhood caries with that of caries-free children. plaque samples from incisors, molars, and the tongue from 195 children attending pediatricians' offices were assayed by 74 dna probes and by pcr to streptococcus mutans. caries-associated factors included visible plaque, child age, race, and snacking habits. species were detected more frequently from tooth than tongue samples. lactobacillus gasseri (p < 0.01), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus vaginalis, and s. mutans with streptococcus sobrinus (all p < 0.05) were positively associated with caries. by  multifactorial analysis, the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus was negatively associated with caries. prevotella nigrescens was the only species (p < 0.05) significantly associated with caries by the 'false discovery' rate. analysis of the data suggests that selected lactobacillus species, in addition to mutans streptococci, are risk markers for early childhood caries.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.
