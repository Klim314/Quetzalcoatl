TI  == the cytologist and bacterioses of the vaginal-ectocervical area. clues, commas and confusion.
AB  == to evaluate the role of the cytologist in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, the predominant bacterial patterns seen in 157 papanicolaou-stained cervical smears were assessed and classified as large bacillus, anaerobic or scanty. a large bacillus pattern was found in 73 smears (46%), an anaerobic pattern in 77 (49%) and scanty bacteria in 7 (5%). comma-shaped (curved) bacilli were found in  34 smears. the prevalence of clue cells in smears with anaerobic patterns was 73%. gardnerella vaginalis was cultured from 89% of the cases with anaerobic-type smears containing clue cells and from 88% of those with anaerobic-type smears lacking clue cells. mobiluncus sp. was cultured from 83% of the cases with anaerobic-type smears showing curved bacilli and 14% of those with anaerobic-type smears lacking curved bacilli. papanicolaou-stained smears were found to be more  sensitive and more specific for identifying clue cells than were wet preparations. a positive association was found between a positive koh "whiff" test and the presence of curved bacilli on the papanicolaou-stained smear. the clinical significance of these findings is discussed.
