TI  == control of natural transformation in salivarius streptococci through specific degradation of sigmax by the meca-clpcp protease complex.
AB  == competence for natural dna transformation is a tightly controlled developmental process in streptococci. in mutans and salivarius species, the abundance of the central competence regulator sigma(x) is regulated at two levels: transcriptional, by the comrs signaling system via the sigma(x)/comx/sigx-inducing peptide (xip), and posttranscriptional, by the adaptor protein meca and its associated clp atpase, clpc. in this study, we further investigated the mechanism and function of the meca-clpc control system in the salivarius species streptococcus thermophilus. using in vitro approaches,  we showed that meca specifically interacts with both sigma(x) and clpc, suggesting the formation of a ternary sigma(x)-meca-clpc complex. moreover, we demonstrated that meca ultimately targets sigma(x) for its degradation by the clpcp protease in an atp-dependent manner. we also identify a short sequence (18  amino acids) in the n-terminal domain of sigma(x) as essential for the interaction with meca and subsequent sigma(x) degradation. finally, increased transformability of a meca-deficient strain in the presence of subinducing xip concentrations suggests that the meca-clpcp proteolytic complex acts as an additional locking device to prevent competence under inappropriate conditions. a model of the interplay between comrs and meca-clpcp in the control of sigma(x) activity is proposed.

TI  == the thioredoxin system in the dental caries pathogen streptococcus mutans and the food-industry bacterium streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the streptococcus genus includes the pathogenic species streptococcus mutans, the main responsible of dental caries, and the safe microorganism streptococcus thermophilus, used for the manufacture of dairy products. these facultative anaerobes control the levels of reactive oxygen species (ros) and indeed, both s. mutans and s. thermophilus possess a cambialistic superoxide dismutase, the key enzyme for a preventive action against ros. to evaluate the properties of a crucial mechanism for repairing ros damages, the molecular and functional characterization of the thioredoxin system in these streptococci was investigated. the putative genes encoding its protein components in s. mutans and s. thermophilus were analysed and the corresponding recombinant proteins were purified. a single thioredoxin reductase was obtained from either s. mutans (smtrxb) or s. thermophilus (sttrxb1), whereas two thioredoxins were prepared from either s. mutans (smtrxa and smtrxh1) or s. thermophilus (sttrxa1 and sttrxa2). both smtrxb and sttrxb1 reduced the synthetic substrate dtnb in the presence of nadph, whereas only smtrxa and sttrxa1 accelerated the insulin reduction in the presence of dtt. to reconstitute an in vitro streptococcal thioredoxin system, the combined activity of the thioredoxin components was tested through the insulin precipitation in the absence of dtt. the assay functions with a combination of smtrxb or sttrxb1 with either smtrxa or sttrxa1.  these results suggest that the streptococcal members of the thioredoxin system display a direct functional interaction between them and that these protein components are interchangeable within the streptococcus genus. in conclusion, our data prove the existence of a functioning thioredoxin system even in these microaerophiles.

TI  == properties of a putative cambialistic superoxide dismutase from the aerotolerant  bacterium streptococcus thermophilus strain lmg 18311.
AB  == the aerotolerance of the lactic - fermentative bacterium streptococcus thermophilus is mainly based on the key antioxidant function of superoxide dismutase (stsod). in this work, the comparison of recombinant stsod (rstsod) forms obtained from two different initiation triplets indicated that the enzyme from s. thermophilus strain lmg 18311 spans 201 residues. rstsod is organised as  a homodimer, even though protein aggregates are formed in concentrated solutions. the capability of binding and exchanging fe or mn in the active site classifies rstsod as a putative cambialistic enzyme; the moderate preference for iron is counteracted by a 1.5-fold higher activity measured for the mn-containing form. the enzyme is thermostable, being its half-inactivation time 10 min at 73.5 degrees c; the energetic parameters of the heat inactivation process are regulated by the level of mn cofactor. the effect of mn content on the rstsod sensitivity towards inhibitors and inactivators was also evaluated. sodium azide  acts as a weak inhibitor of rstsod and its mn content does not greatly affect this sensitivity. concerning the physiological inactivator hydrogen peroxide, the mn-enriched rstsod displays a great resistance; a moderate sensitivity is instead observed in the presence of a low mn content. contrary to hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxynitrite is a powerful inactivator, a behaviour enhanced in the mn-enriched enzyme. all these results were compared with the corresponding data previously reported for the cambialistic sod from the taxonomically related s. mutans. in s. thermophilus the regulation of the enzyme functions by the mn content appears less relevant with respect to s. mutans.

TI  == biology and genome sequence of streptococcus mutans phage m102ad.
AB  == m102ad is the new designation for a streptococcus mutans phage described in 1993  as phage m102. this change was necessitated by the genome analysis of another s.  mutans phage named m102, which revealed differences from the genome sequence reported here. additional host range analyses confirmed that s. mutans phage m102ad infects only a few serotype c strains. phage m102ad adsorbed very slowly to its host, and it cannot adsorb to serotype e and f strains of s. mutans. m102ad adsorption was blocked by c-specific antiserum. phage m102ad also adsorbed equally well to heat-treated and trypsin-treated cells, suggesting carbohydrate receptors. saliva and polysaccharide production did not inhibit plaque formation. the genome of this siphophage consisted of a linear, double-stranded, 30,664-bp dna molecule, with a gc content of 39.6%. analysis of the genome extremities indicated the presence of a 3'-overhang cos site that was 11 nucleotides long. bioinformatic analyses identified 40 open reading frames, all in the same orientation. no lysogeny-related genes were found, indicating that phage m102ad is strictly virulent. no obvious virulence factor gene candidates were found. twelve proteins were identified in the virion structure by mass spectrometry. comparative genomic analysis revealed a close relationship between s. mutans phages m102ad and m102 as well as with streptococcus thermophilus phages. this study also highlights the importance of conducting research with biological materials obtained from recognized microbial collections.

TI  == exploring internal features of 16s rrna gene for identification of clinically relevant species of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == background: streptococcus is an economically important genus as a number of species belonging to this genus are human and animal pathogens. the genus has been divided into different groups based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the variability observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish them. the present study was taken up to explore 16s rrna gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification  and can supplement the existing methods for identification of clinically-relevant isolates of the genus streptococcus. methods: 16s rrna gene sequences belonging to the isolates of s. dysgalactiae, s. equi, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, s. gallolyticus, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. pneumoniae, s. thermophilus and s. anginosus were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic variability within each species to generate a phylogenetic framework, to identify species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. results: the framework based analysis was used to segregate streptococcus spp. previously  identified upto genus level. this segregation was validated using species-specific signatures and in-silico restriction enzyme analysis. 43 uncharacterized streptococcus spp. could be identified using this approach. conclusions: the markers generated exploring 16s rrna gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == increasing competence in the genus streptococcus.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important model organisms for studies on natural genetic transformation in bacteria. the prevalence of this gene exchange mechanism in the genus streptococcus has not been subjected to systematic investigations, but it has been known for decades that only a few streptococcal species develop the competent state spontaneously when grown under  laboratory conditions. the recent discovery of a new mechanism regulating natural transformation in streptococcus thermophilus suggested that this property might be more widespread among streptococci than previously thought. this suspicion has been confirmed by mashburn-warren and co-workers, who in the current issue of molecular microbiology report the discovery of a novel competence-inducing pheromone that is conserved in streptococcus mutans and a number of pyogenic streptococci.

TI  == a novel pheromone quorum-sensing system controls the development of natural competence in streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == in streptococcal species, the key step of competence development is the transcriptional induction of comx, which encodes the alternative sigma factor sigma(x), which positively regulates genes necessary for dna transformation. in streptococcus species belonging to the mitis and mutans groups, induction of comx relies on the activation of a three-component system consisting of a secreted pheromone, a histidine kinase, and a response regulator. in streptococcus thermophilus, a species belonging to the salivarius group, the oligopeptide transporter ami is essential for comx expression under competence-inducing conditions. this suggests a different regulation pathway of competence based on the production and reimportation of a signal peptide. the objective of our work was to identify the main actors involved in the early steps of comx induction in  s. thermophilus lmd-9. using a transcriptomic approach, four highly induced early competence operons were identified. among them, we found a rgg-like regulator (ster_0316) associated with a nonannotated gene encoding a 24-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide (shp0316). through genetic deletions, we showed that these two genes are essential for comx induction. moreover, addition to the medium of synthetic peptides derived from the c-terminal part of shp0316 restored comx induction and transformation of a shp0316-deficient strain. these peptides also induced competence in s. thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius strains that are poorly transformable or not transformable. altogether, our results show that  ster_0316 and shp0316, renamed comrs, are the two members of a novel quorum-sensing system responsible for comx induction in species from the salivarius group, which differs from the classical phosphorelay three-component system identified previously in streptococci.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == transcriptional analysis of the gdha gene in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == aims: to study the transcriptional analysis of glutamate dehydrogenase gene, involved in the amino acid conversion to aroma compound in streptococcus thermophilus. methods and results: analysis of the gdha gene nucleotide sequence  of s. thermophilus cnrz1066 revealed that the coding region is 1353 nucleotides long. the deduced amino acids sequence exhibits the putative gdh active site and  some conserved domains characteristic of family i of hexameric gdhs. phylogenetic analysis revealed that the gdh gene of s. thermophilus clustered with the orthologues of other streptococci such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus infantarius. studying the structural organization of the gdha locus the amino acid similarity of gdhs was higher than 87%, but the locus organization was not conserved. a dominant transcript of approximately 1.4  kbp was revealed by northern blot hybridization, suggesting that gdha mrna is monocystronic. primer extension showed that transcription start point of gdha was localized 43 bp upstream of the potential start codon (atg). conclusions: the gdha represents a monocistronic operon highly conserved in phylogenetic-related bacteria. significance and impact of the study: a deeper knowledge of gdh transcriptional mechanisms could lead to develop s. thermophilus industrial starter cultures with optimized aromatic properties.

TI  == antibacterial activity of yoghurt against viridans streptococci in vitro.
AB  == objective: yoghurt consumption leads to a selective decrease in the oral level of mutans streptococci. it is not clear whether this decrease is due to the bactericidal activity of yoghurt or other mechanisms. the present study investigated the differences in susceptibility to yoghurt between several strains of viridans streptococci. design: the sources of variation were minimised, at the expense of the external validity of the study, using culture collection strains.  each strain was tested separately on five occasions in planktonic form and logarithmic growth phase. two strains of each of the following streptococcus species were tested: mutans, sobrinus, gordonii, oralis, parasanguinis and sanguinis. one millilitre [10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)] of each strain was incubated (37 degrees c, 60min) with 9ml of fat-free plain yoghurt containing streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus (10(8) and 10(7)cfu/g, respectively) in gently vortexed tubes. survival rates were calculated every 15min by dividing the number of viable cells, obtained using conventional laboratory procedures, by the baseline number. results: survival rates were 8% (s. mutans 6519t), 12% (s. mutans 31738), 35% (s. oralis 25671) and >50% (all other species tested) after 15min, and 0.01% (s. mutans) and >10% (all other species tested) after 30min. overall, s. parasanguinis and s. sobrinus were the most resistant species. when heat-treated yoghurt (<10cfu/g bacteria and inactivated bacteriocins) was used, this antibacterial activity was not found. conclusion: in vitro, yoghurt with live bacteria showed selective anti-mutans activity, suggesting that the overall decrease in mutans streptococci in vivo could be due to a bactericidal effect on s. mutans but not on s. sobrinus.

TI  == genome sequence of streptococcus mutans bacteriophage m102.
AB  == bacteriophage m102 is a lytic phage specific for serotype c strains of streptococcus mutans, a causative agent of dental caries. in this study, the complete genome sequence of m102 was determined. the genome is 31,147 bp in size  and contains 41 orfs. most of the orfs encoding putative phage structural proteins show similarity to those from bacteriophages from streptococcus thermophilus. bioinformatic analysis indicated that the m102 genome contains an unusual lysis cassette, which encodes a holin and two lytic enzymes.

TI  == control of methionine synthesis and uptake by metr and homocysteine in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == metr (formerly smu.1225), a regulator of the lysr family, controls key genes for  methionine supply in streptococcus mutans. an s. mutans metr mutant is unable to  transport l-methionine and to grow in the absence of this amino acid. accordingly, metr activates transcription by binding to the promoter regions of two gene clusters and smu.1487, whose products are involved in methionine biosynthesis (metef and smu.1487) and uptake (atmbde). transcriptional activation by metr requires the presence of a 17-bp palindromic sequence, the met box. base  substitutions in the met box hinder the formation of a metr-dna complex and abolish metr-dependent activation, showing that met boxes correspond to metr recognition sites. activation by metr occurs in methionine-depleted medium and is rapidly triggered under nonactivating conditions by the addition of homocysteine. this intermediate of methionine biosynthesis increases the affinity of metr for dna in vitro and appears to be the metr coeffector in vivo. homocysteine plays a  crucial role in methionine metabolic gene regulation by controlling metr activity. a similar mechanism of homocysteine- and metr-dependent control of methionine biosynthetic genes operates in s. thermophilus. these data suggest a common mechanism for the regulation of the methionine supply in streptococci. however, some streptococcal species are unable to synthesize the homocysteine coeffector. this intriguing feature is discussed in the light of comparative genomics and streptococcal ecology.

TI  == gene gain and gene loss in streptococcus: is it driven by habitat?
AB  == bacterial genomes can evolve either by gene gain, gene loss, mutating existing genes, and/or by duplication of existing genes. recent studies have clearly demonstrated that the acquisition of new genes by lateral gene transfer (lgt) is  a predominant force in bacterial evolution. to better understand the significance of lgt, we employed a comparative genomics approach to model species-specific and intraspecies gene insertions/deletions (ins/del among 12 sequenced streptococcal  genomes using a maximum likelihood method. this study indicates that the rate of  gene ins/del is higher on the external branches and varies dramatically for each  species. we have analyzed here some of the experimentally characterized species-specific genes that have been acquired by lgt and conclude that at least  a portion of these genes have a role in adaptation.

TI  == food commensal microbes as a potentially important avenue in transmitting antibiotic resistance genes.
AB  == the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant (art) pathogens is a major threat to  public health. while the surfacing of art food-borne pathogens is alarming, the magnitude of the antibiotic resistance (ar) gene pool in food-borne commensal microbes is yet to be revealed. incidence of art commensals in selected retail food products was examined in this study. the presence of 10(2)-10(7) cfu of art  bacteria per gram of foods in many samples, particularly in ready-to-eat, 'healthy' food items, indicates that the art bacteria are abundant in the food chain. ar-encoding genes were detected in art isolates, and streptococcus thermophilus was found to be a major host for ar genes in cheese microbiota. lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc sp. isolates were also found carrying ar genes. the data indicate that food could be an important avenue for art bacterial evolution and dissemination. ar-encoding plasmids from several food-borne commensals were transmitted to streptococcus mutans via natural gene transformation under laboratory conditions, suggesting the possible transfer of ar genes from food commensals to human residential bacteria via horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == molecular characterization and functional analysis of the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase gene (soda) from streptococcus thermophilus ao54.
AB  == this report describes the isolation, sequencing, and functional analysis of the soda gene, encoding mn-superoxide dismutase, from streptococcus thermophilus ao54. the gene was found to encode a 201 amino acid polypeptide with 88 and 83% identity to soda from streptococcus mutans and streptococcus agalacticae, respectively. primer extension analysis revealed a transcriptional start site 27  nucleotides upstream of initiation codon. the gene was expressed in escherichia coli and was able to rescue the growth of a sodasodb mutant in a minimal-medium containing 10(-6)m paraquat. a soda mutant of s. thermophilus was constructed and found to be more sensitive to aerobic growth than its parent strain. supplementing the medium with mncl(2) improved the growth of the mutant, only under microaerophilic conditions. the results suggest that soda is essential for  the aerobic growth of s. thermophilus. in the absence of functional soda, manganese ions may provide partial protection against oxygen toxicity.

TI  == the icest1 element of streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  == the 34,734-bp element icest1 from streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. icest1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. six proteins of the putative conjugative system of icest1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon tn916 from enterococcus faecalis. a comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low g+c bacteria including bacillus subtilis, clostridium difficile, e. faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative  elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. these exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. we propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and  integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "integrative and conjugative elements" (ices), irrespective of the  integration specificity.

TI  == a randomized clinical trial of the effect of yoghurt on the human salivary microflora.
AB  == yoghurt is active against some human pathogens, so this experiment tested whether it is also active against the salivary microflora. a clinical trial was designed, with volunteers aged between 23 and 37 years. initially, for 8 weeks, they consumed neither yoghurt nor casein-free soybean ice cream (phase 1). they were then split randomly into test (yoghurt) and control (ice cream) groups and required to consume 125 g of these foods twice daily for 8 weeks (phase 2) and then to avoid them for the following 2 weeks (phase 3). many potential sources of microbial fluctuation were standardized. salivary samples were then collected at  regular intervals of 2 weeks. for each group and phase, the mean logarithms of the salivary counts for total viable flora, oral streptococci, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida were calculated. the prevalence of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus was also assessed. twenty test and 22 control participants completed the study. at phase 2, the mean for mutans streptococci was lower in the test than in the control group (3.6 vs. 4.0  log colony-forming units/ml; p=0.02). moreover, the mean had decreased in all test participants with high phase 1 means for lactobacilli as compared to only 36.4% of those with low phase 1 means (p=0.01). l. bulgaricus was transiently detected in three test participants during phase 2. these results suggest that yoghurt does have some activity against the salivary microflora, but this does not seem to be due to the installation of yoghurt microorganisms in the mouth.

AB  == the protein, hpr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts) in bacteria, was purified from streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. the purified preparation gave only one band  when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pi = 4.85). however, electrophoresis in tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by pep in the presence of enzyme i of the pts or by atp with the hpr kinase. homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained  by preparative electrophoresis. each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the  doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. the electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees c for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees c for several months. both hpr proteins catalyzed in vitro the pep-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with  a preparation of hpr containing both forms of the protein. both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from pep to the other specific pts proteins  known in s salivarius. rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. the presence of the 2 forms of hpr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of s salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. a doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (s mutans, s sobrinus, s sanguis, s thermophilus, s  bovis, s rattus) and also in l lactis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == bacterial cell walls from str. bovis, str. lactis, str. mutans, str. thermophilus, str. salivarius, and str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. s. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. it was also shown that cell  walls from s. epidermidis, b. megaterium, and m. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. a close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the ppd hypersensitivity. it was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.
