TI  == presence of zoonotic agents in engorged ticks and hedgehog faeces from erinaceus  europaeus in (sub) urban areas.
AB  == background: european hedgehogs (erinaceus europaeus) are hosts for ixodes hexagonus and i. ricinus ticks, which are vectors for zoonotic microorganisms. in addition, hedgehogs may carry several enteric zoonoses as well. it is unclear to  what extent a presence of pathogens in hedgehogs poses a risk to public health, as information on the presence of zoonotic agents in hedgehogs in urban areas is  relatively scarce. methods: engorged ticks and hedgehog faeces were collected from rehabilitating hedgehogs. ticks were screened individually for presence of borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, b. miyamotoi, anaplasma phagocytophilum, and candidatus neoehrlichia mikurensis using pcr-based assays. faecal samples were screened for presence of campylobacter, salmonella, giardia, cryptosporidium, and extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant-escherichia coli (esc)-resistant e. coli, using both culture-based and pcr-based methods. results: anaplasma phagocytophilum and borrelia genospecies b. afzelii, b. spielmanii, b. garinii, and b. burgdorferi sensu stricto were detected in both i. hexagonus and i. ricinus ticks. despite their widespread distribution in the netherlands, b. miyamotoi and candidatus n. mikurensis were not detected in collected ticks. analysis of hedgehog faecal samples revealed the presence of salmonella enterica  subspecies enterica and campylobacter jejuni. in addition, esc-resistant e. coli  were observed in high prevalence in faecal samples, but no shiga-toxin producing-e.coli were detected. finally, potentially zoonotic protozoan parasites were observed in hedgehog faecal samples as well, including giardia duodenalis assemblage a, cryptosporidium parvum subtypes iiaa17g1r1 and iica5g3, and c. hominis subtype iba10g2. conclusions: european hedgehogs in (sub)urban areas harbor a number of zoonotic agents, and therefore may contribute to the spread and transmission of zoonotic diseases. the relatively high prevalence of b. burgdorferi s.l. and a. phagocytophilum in engorged ticks, suggests that hedgehogs contribute to their enzootic cycles in (sub)urban areas. to what extent can hedgehogs maintain the enteric zoonotic agents in natural cycles, and the role of (spill-back from) humans remains to be investigated.

TI  == gastrointestinal infections and diarrheal disease in ghanaian infants and children: an outpatient case-control study.
AB  == introduction: diarrheal diseases are among the most frequent causes of morbidity  and mortality in children worldwide, especially in resource-poor areas. this case-control study assessed the associations between gastrointestinal infections  and diarrhea in children from rural ghana. methods: stool samples were collected  from 548 children with diarrhea and from 686 without gastrointestinal symptoms visiting a hospital from 2007-2008. samples were analyzed by microscopy and molecular methods. results: the organisms most frequently detected in symptomatic cases were giardia lamblia, shigella spp./ enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec), and campylobacter jejuni. infections with rotavirus (adjusted odds ratio  [aor] = 8.4; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 4.3-16.6), c. parvum/hominis (aor = 2.7; 95% ci: 1.4-5.2) and norovirus (aor = 2.0; 95%ci: 1.3-3.0) showed the strongest association with diarrhea. the highest attributable fractions (af) for  diarrhea were estimated for rotavirus (af = 14.3%; 95% ci: 10.9-17.5%), shigella  spp./eiec (af = 10.5%; 95% ci: 3.5-17.1%), and norovirus (af = 8.2%; 95% ci 3.2-12.9%). co-infections occurred frequently and most infections presented themselves independently of other infections. however, infections with e. dispar, c. jejuni, and norovirus were observed more often in the presence of g. lamblia.  conclusions: diarrheal diseases in children from a rural area in sub-saharan africa are mainly due to infections with rotavirus, shigella spp./eiec, and norovirus. these associations are strongly age-dependent, which should be considered when diagnosing causes of diarrhea. the presented results are informative for both clinicians treating gastrointestinal infections as well as public health experts designing control programs against diarrheal diseases.

TI  == case-control comparison of bacterial and protozoan microorganisms associated with gastroenteritis: application of molecular detection.
AB  == the introduction of molecular detection of infectious organisms has led to increased numbers of positive findings, as observed for pathogens causing gastroenteritis (ge). however, because little is known about the prevalence of these pathogens in the healthy asymptomatic population, the clinical value of these additional findings is unclear. a case-control study was carried out in a population of patients served by general practitioners in the netherlands. a total of 2710 fecal samples from case and matched control subjects were subjected to multiplex real-time pcr for the 11 most common bacterial and four protozoal causes of ge. of 1515 case samples, 818 (54%) were positive for one or more target organisms. a total of 49% of the controls were positive. higher positivity rates in cases compared to controls were observed for campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., clostridium difficile, enteroinvasive escherichia coli/shigella  spp., enterotoxigenic e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, atypical enteropathogenic e. coli (epec), cryptosporidium parvum/hominis, and giardia lamblia. however, dientamoeba fragilis and shiga-like toxigenic e. coli were detected significantly less frequent in cases than in controls, while no difference in prevalence was found for typical epec and enterohemorrhagic e. coli. the association between the presence of microorganisms and ge was the weakest in children aged 0 to 5 years. higher relative loads in cases further support causality. this was seen for campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., enterotoxigenic e. coli, and c. parvum/hominis, and for certain age categories of those infected with c. difficile, enteroaggregative e. coli, and atypical epec. for d. fragilis and shiga-like toxigenic e. coli/enterohemorrhagic e. coli, pathogen loads were lower in cases. application of molecular diagnostics in ge is rapid, sensitive and specific, but results should be interpreted with care, using clinical and additional background information.

TI  == occurrence of waterborne pathogens and escherichia coli at offshore drinking water intakes in lake ontario.
AB  == the occurrence of waterborne pathogens was investigated at three drinking water intakes located about 2 km offshore in lake ontario. water sampling was conducted over 3 years for campylobacter spp., cryptosporidium spp., giardia spp., cultivable enteric viruses, and water quality parameters. all pathogens were detected in the offshore source water for each water treatment plant (wtp1 to wtp3), although at relatively low frequencies and concentrations. giardia was the most common pathogen, occurring in 36% of water samples from the influent of wtp1 (n = 46), and with a maximum concentration of 0.70 cysts/liter in this influent.  cryptosporidium occurred as frequently as 15% in the wtp2 influent (n = 35), with a maximum concentration of 0.40 oocysts/liter in the wtp1 influent. the human bacteroidales hf183 dna marker was most common in the wtp1 influent (19%), and this was the only wtp where the cryptosporidium hominis genotype was detected. no water quality parameter was predictive of pathogen occurrence across all three wtp influents. escherichia coli was often below detection when pathogens were detected, and spikes in e. coli concentrations often did not coincide with pathogen occurrence. after summer rain events, river plumes had e. coli concentrations as high as 222 cfu/100 ml in surface waters 2 km offshore, without impacting drinking water intakes below the thermocline on the lake bottom. at times, prechlorination to control mussels at offshore intake cribs compromised the use of e. coli for "raw" water quality assessment, particularly for chlorine-resistant cryptosporidium. e. coli measured by standard methods did not  reliably predict pathogen occurrence at drinking water intakes in offshore ecosystems.

TI  == controlled study on enteropathogens in travellers returning from the tropics with and without diarrhoea.
AB  == diarrhoea is the most frequent health problem among travellers in the tropics. however, data on the spectrum and relevance of enteropathogens in international travellers with and without diarrhoea are limited. stool samples from 114 cases of diarrhoea in travellers returning from the tropics were collected for microbiological examination and pcr for norovirus genogroups i and ii, enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaec), and enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) producing heat-labile toxin (lt) and heat-stable toxin (st). travel and laboratory data of cases were compared with those of 56 travellers without diarrhoea. among cases, eaec was found in 45% of stool samples, followed by lt-etec (20%), st-etec (16%), blastocystis hominis (15%), campylobacter jejuni (12%), norovirus (11%), giardia lamblia (6%), shigella spp. (6%), and salmonella  spp., cryptosporidium spp., and cyclospora cayetanensis (3% each). however, only  for eaec, st-etec, blastocystis and campylobacter was the prevalence significantly higher among cases than among controls. co-infections were common:  61% for cases and 13% for controls. the most common travel destination was asia (54%), followed by africa (35%) and latin america (9%). the highest relative risk for diarrhoea was calculated for travellers to west africa, east africa, and south asia. in this study, eaec, lt-etec and st-etec were detected most frequently in cases of travellers' diarrhoea. although enteric infections with eaec, st-etec and campylobacter often cause diarrhoea, the pathogenetic relevance remains unclear for most of the other enteropathogens, because of significant prevalence rates also being seen in controls without diarrhoea and the high frequency of co-infections.

TI  == enteropathogens associated with cases of gastroenteritis in a rural population in jordan.
AB  == stool specimens were collected from 180 patients belonging to a population of recently settled bedouins in jordan who presented with acute or persistent diarrhoea and other symptoms, and from 100 non-diarrhoeal controls. all samples were examined for parasites and bacterial pathogens by culture and pcr. bacterial isolates were tested for their susceptibility to common antimicrobial agents. pathogens and potential enteropathogens were identified from 140 (77.8%) of the patients, with more than one pathogen being recovered from 67 (37.2%) patients. potentially pathogenic parasites were observed in 90 (50%) patients; those that were associated significantly with diarrhoea were giardia lamblia, blastocystis hominis, cryptosporidium spp., entamoeba histolytica and cyclospora cayetanensis. pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 72 (40%) patients, and, of these, 62.5% were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and 30.6% of these were multiresistant. diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli strains were found in 14.3% of the patients and 2.9% of the control subjects (not statistically significant). the most common enteropathogenic bacteria found were shigella spp., campylobacter jejuni and yersinia enterocolitica. unusual bacterial species were the predominant organisms recovered in a few cases and could represent a possible cause of diarrhoea. overall, there was a high endemicity of diarrhoeal disease in the area studied. risk factors that correlated significantly with contracting diarrhoea were socio-economic status, education, use of unchlorinated well or tank water, and a low level of personal hygiene.

TI  == enteropathogens associated with acute diarrhea in community and hospital patients in jakarta, indonesia.
AB  == the prevalence of bacteria, parasite and viral pathogens in 3875 patients with diarrhea in community and hospital settings from march 1997 through august 1999 in jakarta, indonesia was determined using routine bacteriology and molecular assay techniques. bacterial pathogens isolated from hospital patients were, in decreasing frequency, vibrio cholerae o1, shigella flexneri, salmonella spp. and  campylobacter jejuni, while s. flexneri, v. cholerae o1, salmonella spp. and c. jejuni were isolated from the community patients. v. cholerae o1 was isolated more frequently (p<0.005) from the hospital patients than the community patients. overall, bacterial pathogens were isolated from 538 of 3875 (14%) enrolled cases  of diarrhea. enterotoxigenic escherichia coli were detected in 218 (18%) of 1244  rectal swabs. a small percentage of enterohemorrhagic e. coli (1%) and of clostridium difficile (1.3%) was detected. parasitic examination of 389 samples resulted in 43 (11%) positives comprising ascaris lumbricoides (1.5%), blastocystis hominis (5.7%), giardia lamblia (0.8%), trichuris trichiura (2.1%) and endolimax nana (0.5%). rotavirus (37.5%), adenovirus (3.3%) and norwalk-like  virus (17.6%) were also detected. antimicrobial resistance was observed among some isolates. bacterial isolates were susceptible to quinolones, with the exception of some isolates of c. jejuni which were resistant to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and norfloxacin. data obtained from this community- and hospital-based study will enable the indonesian ministry of health to plan relevant studies on diarrheal diseases in the archipelago.

TI  == identification of enteric pathogens in hiv-positive patients with diarrhoea in northern india.
AB  == enteric pathogens associated with chronic diarrhoea in hiv-positive patients were studied. the study was conducted during january 1995-december 1998. stool specimens from all diarrhoea patients (n = 26) were examined microscopically for  ova and parasites using wet preparations and stained smears. stool samples from diarrhoea patients were also cultured on appropriate media to isolate enteric bacterial pathogens. of the 59 patients, 26 (44%) had prolonged diarrhoea for more than 4 weeks. enteric pathogens were detected in 19 (73%) of the 26 patients: 17 patients harboured a single pathogen, and 2 patients had mixed pathogens. the detection rate of emerging parasites, including isospora, cryptosporidium, blastocystis hominis, and strongyloides stercoralis as a single  agent, was significantly higher than conventional pathogens (50% vs 19.2%; p < 0.05). only one patient harboured both conventional and emerging pathogens (entamoeba histolytica and cryptosporidium). isospora belli was detected in 8 (31%) of the 26 diarrhoea patients: in 7 (27%) patients as a single agent and in  one patient with s. stercoralis. cryptosporidium was identified in 3 (11%) diarrhoea patients: in 2 (8%) patients as a single agent and in one patient with  e. histolytica, followed by b. hominis in 2 (8%) patients. e. histolytica was most commonly isolated (3/26; 11.5%), followed by giardia lamblia, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni (one patient each). parasitic pathogens were frequently associated with hiv-positive patients with diarrhoea in northern india. i. belli was the most frequent parasite isolated, followed by cryptosporidium. stools of all hiv-positive patients with diarrhoea should thoroughly be investigated to identify aetiologic agents for proper management.

TI  == enteropathogens in adult patients with diarrhea and healthy control subjects: a 1-year prospective study in a swedish clinic for infectious diseases.
AB  == a 1-year prospective study was conducted to identify enteropathogens in adults with diarrhea (n=851) and in healthy control subjects (n=203) by use of conventional laboratory methods. virulence factor genes for diarrheagenic escherichia coli were detected by polymerase chain reaction. enteropathogens were identified in 56% of patients and 16% of control subjects. the isolation rate was 65% for patients with symptoms for <1 week and for travelers; >1 pathogen was found in 11% of patients. the most frequent enteropathogens were campylobacter (13% of patients), clostridium difficile (13%), enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  (8%), salmonella (7%), shigella (4%), blastocystis hominis (4%), calicivirus (3%), rotavirus (3%), enteroaggregative e. coli (2%), aeromonas (2%), giardia intestinalis (2%), cryptosporidium (2%), and astrovirus (2%). less frequently isolated (< or =1% of patients) were verotoxigenic e. coli, enteropathogenic e. coli, enteroinvasive e. coli, entamoeba histolytica/entamoeba dispar, microsporidia, and adenovirus. fifty percent of the patients were hospitalized, and 43% needed intravenous fluids. the median duration of diarrhea was 14 days. clinical features were not helpful for predicting the etiology of diarrhea.

TI  == etiologies of acute, persistent, and dysenteric diarrheas in adults in bangui, central african republic, in relation to human immunodeficiency virus serostatus.
AB  == a study of the etiologies of diarrhea in adults in relation to their human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) serostatus and number of cd4+ cells was carried out  in the central african republic. in cases and controls, multi-parasitism was observed. salmonella spp. were identified mainly during acute diarrhea, with 50%  of the s. enteritidis isolated during the study being responsible for septicemia  and/or urinary tract infection in immunodeficient patients. enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) were the most frequently identified agent in hiv+ patients with persistent diarrhea; 42.8% of the patients with eaggec as sole pathogens had bloody diarrhea, and these strains were negative for the presence of a virulence plasmid. coccidia were found in those with acute and persistent diarrhea. blood was observed in 53.3% of infections involving coccidia as the sole pathogen. microsporidium spp. and blastocystis hominis were found only in hiv+ patients with persistent diarrhea. shigella spp., campylobacter spp., and entamoeba histolytica were found in hiv+ and hiv- dysenteric patients; bacteria resembling spirochetes that could not be cultivated were identified only in hiv+  cases with dysentery. shiga-like toxin-producing e. coli o157:h- was isolated from two cases with hemolytic-uremic syndrome. fungi were identified as the sole  pathogen in 6.4% of the hiv+ patients with persistent diarrhea. most of enteropathogenic bacteria identified were resistant to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, remained susceptible to ampicillin plus clavulanic acid, and were susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == enteropathogens associated with diarrhea among military personnel during operation bright star 96, in alexandria, egypt.
AB  == this study investigated the microbial causes of diarrheal disease among u.s. troops deployed near alexandria, egypt, during october 1995. bacterial causes associated with 19 cases of diarrhea included: enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), 42% (21% heat-stable, 11% heat-labile, and 11% heat-stable/ heat-labile producers); enteropathogenic e. coli (5.3%); and enteroadherent e. coli (42%). four cases of diarrhea were associated with enteroaggregative e. coli based on probe analysis for enteroaggregative heat-stable enterotoxin 1. protozoan causes  included; entamoeba histolytica (11%), e. hartmanni (5%), e. nana (5%), blastocystis hominis (5%), chilomastix mesnili (11%), dientamoeba fragilis (5%),  entamoeba coli (5%), and cryptosporidium (5%). shigella, aeromonas, plesiomonas,  vibrio, campylobacter, and salmonella were not detected. of the eight etec cases, one was colonization factor antigen (cfa)/i only, one was both cfa/i and cfa/iii, three were cfa/ii, two were cfa/iv, and two were cfa-negative. antibiograms of the etec and enteroadherent e. coli strains showed that all isolates were susceptible to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid but resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole.

TI  == differentiation of bacterial 16s rrna genes and intergenic regions and mycobacterium tuberculosis katg genes by structure-specific endonuclease cleavage.
AB  == we describe here a new approach for analyzing nucleic acid sequences using a structure-specific endonuclease, cleavase i. we have applied this technique to the detection and localization of mutations associated with isoniazid resistance  in mycobacterium tuberculosis and for differentiating bacterial genera, species and strains. the technique described here is based on the observation that single strands of dnas can assume defined conformations, which can be detected and cleaved by structure-specific endonucleases such as cleavase i. the patterns of fragments produced are characteristic of the sequences responsible for the structure, so that each dna has its own structural fingerprint. amplicons, containing either a single 5'-fluorescein or 5'-tetramethyl rhodamine label were  generated from a 620-bp segment of the katg gene of isoniazid-resistant and -sensitive m. tuberculosis, the 5' 350 bp of the 16s rrna genes of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella arizonae, shigella sonnei, shigella dysenteriae, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus, hominis, staphylococcus warneri, and staphylococcus aureus and an approximately 550-bp dna segment comprising the intergenic region between the 16s and 23s rrna genes of salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella  arizonae, shigella sonnei, and shigella dysenteriae serotypes 1, 2, and 8. changes in the structural fingerprints of dna fragments derived from the katg genes of isoniazid-resistant m. tuberculosis isolates were clearly identified and could be mapped to the site of the actual mutation relative to the labeled end. bland patterns which clearly differentiated bacteria to the level of genus and, in some cases, species were generated from the 16s genes. cleavase i analysis of  the intergenic regions of salmonella and shigella species differentiated genus, species, and serotypes. structural fingerprinting by digestion with cleavase i is a rapid, simple, and sensitive method for analyzing nucleic acid sequences and may find wide utility in microbial analysis.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

AB  == accurate data on the frequency of acute diarrheal illness and the distribution of pathogens are not available for several reasons, including the facts that only a  small fraction of cases come to the attention of physicians and that available diagnostic tests establish an etiology in only about half of these. in a survey of three groups of patients in a community (upper-middle class and lower class outpatients and hospitalized infants), a possible cause was found in fewer than 20 percent of outpatients, and rotavirus accounted for the majority. however, asymptomatic colonization with rotavirus is very common in early infancy, and demonstration of the antigen correlates with a causative role in diarrhea in only about one half of cases. data on cases of shigellosis over a 15-year period in dallas compared with the centers for disease control national data demonstrate that epidemiologic patterns in any given community can differ substantially from  the national data. day-care centers are important sources of giardia and shigella infections in the community. the epidemiologic roles of newly reported causes of  diarrhea (campylobacter laridis, blastocystis hominis, cryptosporidium species, and aeromonas hydrophila) are being explored. generalizations about etiology and  epidemiology of pathogens in diarrheal disease are invalid unless the population  group is defined socioeconomically and geographically.

TI  == polymicrobial aetiology of travellers' diarrhoea.
AB  == of 35 us peace corps volunteers in thailand, 20 (57%) had a total of 30 episodes  of diarrhoea during their first 6 weeks in the country. enteric pathogens were associated with 90% of the episodes. a single pathogen was identified in 17 (57%) episodes, 2-4 pathogens were identified in 10 (33%) episodes, and there were 15 symptomless infections. enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) was identified in 37% of these episodes, and various salmonella serotypes were isolated in 33%. infections with 9 other enteric pathogens were also identified: campylobacter jejuni (17%), plesiomonas shigelloides (13%), aeromonas hydrophila (10%), blastocystis hominis (7%), norwalk virus (7%), vibrio parahaemolyticus (3%), non-o1 vibrio cholerae (3%), vibrio fluvialis (3%), and rotavirus (3%). in total, 56 enteric infections were documented in 35 volunteers.
