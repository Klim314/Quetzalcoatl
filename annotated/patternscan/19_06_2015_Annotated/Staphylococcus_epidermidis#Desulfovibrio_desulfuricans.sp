TI  == combating bacterial colonization on metals via polymer coatings: relevance to marine and medical applications.
AB  == metals are widely used in engineering as well as medical applications. however, their surfaces are easily colonized by bacteria that form biofilms. among the numerous concerns with biofilm formation, biocorrosion is of particular importance in industry, because structural integrity may be compromised, leading  to technical failures. in the food industry and medical field, biofilms also pose health risks. to inhibit bacterial colonization, the surfaces of metals can be coated with a polymeric layer which is antiadhesive and/or bactericidal. this article describes polymers that have these desired properties and the methodologies for immobilizing them on metal surfaces of relevance to the marine  and medical fields. the focus is on polymer coatings that have a high degree of stability in aqueous medium and do not leach out. the efficacies of the different polymer coatings against bacteria commonly encountered in marine (desulfovibrio desulfuricans) and medical applications (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli) are demonstrated.
