TI  - New antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
AB  - Microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. Moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging. In search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. The antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth of the nosocomial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical E. faecalis, E. faecium, and S. aureus isolates. It also strongly reduced the growth of Legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of Escherichia coli in urine. We postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. Thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 LEADER surveillance program.
AB  - The 2013 LEADER surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against Gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the United States. A total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. The groups were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. The MIC90 value for each of the 6 pathogen groups was 1 mug/mL. Susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was 99.83%. Only 12 isolates (2 S. aureus, 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Streptococcus sanguinis, 5 Enterococcus faecium, and 1 Enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). Three of these (2 S. aureus and 1 E. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. The findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene as novel antibacterial agents.
AB  - Current antibacterial chemotherapeutics are facing an alarming increase in bacterial resistance pressuring the search for novel agents that would expand the available therapeutic arsenal against resistant bacterial pathogens. In line with these efforts, a series of 9 amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene were synthesized and, together with 18 previously synthesized analogs, evaluated for their relative DNA binding affinity, in vitro antibacterial activities and preliminary in vitro safety profile. Encouraging antibacterial activity of several subclasses of tested amidine derivatives against Gram-positive (including resistant MRSA, MRSE, VRE strains) and Gram-negative bacterial strains was observed. The bis-phenyl derivatives were the most antibacterially active, while compound 19 from bis-benzimidazole class exhibited the widest spectrum of activity (with MIC of 4, 2, 0.5 and </=0.25 mug/ml against laboratory strains of Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, respectively and 4-32 mug/ml against clinical isolates of sensitive and resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium) and also demonstrated the strongest DNA binding affinity (DeltaTm of 15.4 degrees C). Asymmetrically designed compounds and carboxamide-amidines were, in general, less active. Molecular docking indicated that the shape of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives and their ability to form multiple electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with DNA, corresponds to the binding modes of other minor-groove binders. Herein reported results encourage further investigation of this class of compounds as novel antibacterial DNA binding agents.
TI  - In-vitro screening of Malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial activity of Malaysian honey is still limited. In this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of Malaysian monofloral honey from Koompassia excelsa (Becc.) Taub (Tualang), Melaleuca cajuputi Powell (Gelam) and Durio zibethinus Murr. (Durian). Honey samples were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6518 and ATCC25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC12228, Enterococcus faecium LMG16192, Enterococcus faecalis LMG16216 and ATCC29212, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC14028 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC13883. RESULTS: Marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. Durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas Tualang and Gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). CONCLUSION: Present findings suggested Gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested Malaysian honey samples.
TI  - Vancomycin revisited - 60 years later.
AB  - Vancomycin is one of the older antibiotics that has been now in clinical use close to 60 years. Earlier on, vancomycin was associated with many side effects including vestibular and renal, most likely due to impurities contained in early vancomycin lots. Over the years, the impurities have been removed and the compound has now far less vestibular adverse effects, but still possesses renal toxicity if administered at higher doses rendering trough serum levels of >15 mcg/mL or if administered for prolonged periods of time. Vancomycin is effective against most Gram-positive cocci and bacilli with the exception of rare organisms as well as enterococci that became vancomycin resistant, mostly Enterococcus faecium. The major use of vancomycin today is for infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and amoxicillin-resistant enterococci. In its oral form, vancomycin is used to treat diarrhea caused by Clsotridium difficile. With S. aureus, there are only a handful of vancomycin-resistant strains. Nevertheless, a "vancomycin creep" that is slow upward trending of vancomycin MIC from <1 mcg/mL to higher values has been noted in several parts of the world, but not globally, and strains that have MIC's of 1.5-2 mcg/mL are associated with high therapeutic failure rates. This phenomenon has also been recently recognized in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). While vancomycin is relatively a safe agent adverse events include the "red man" syndrome, allergic reactions, and various bone marrow effects as well as nephrotoxicity. Vancomycin has been a very important tool in our therapeutic armamentarium that remained effective for many years, it is likely remain effective as long as resistance to vancomycin remains controlled.
TI  - Three-year study of health care-associated infections in a Turkish pediatric ward.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health care-associated infections (HCAIs) can cause an increase in  morbidity, mortality and costs, especially in developing countries. As information on the epidemiology of HCAIs in pediatric patientsinTurkey is limited, we decided to study the annual incidence and antibiotic resistance patterns in our pediatric ward at Marmara University Hospital. METHODOLOGY: All hospitalized patients in the pediatric ward were assessed with regard to HCAIs between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2010. Data was prospectively collected according to standard protocols of the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System (NosoLINE). RESULTS: A total of 16.5% of all hospitalized patients developed HCAIs in the three years studied. The most frequent HCAIs were urinary tract infections (UTI) (29.3%), bloodstream infections (27%) and pneumonias (21%). While the most frequent agent isolatedfrom UTI was Escherichia coli (26%), the most common agent in blood stream infections was Staphylococcus epidermidis (30.4%). Vancomycin resistance was found in 73.3% of all Enterococcus faecium strains. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was detected in 58.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Continual HCAI surveillance is important to determineits rate. Knowledge of the HCAI incidence can influence people's use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and encourage antibiotic rotation. Moreover, the knowledge of HCAI incidence may support the infection control programmes, including education and isolation methods which ultimately may help to reducethe rate of the HCAIs.
TI  - [Prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.
TI  - Lytic enzymes as selectivity means for label-free, microfluidic and impedimetric  detection of whole-cell bacteria using ALD-Al2O3 passivated microelectrodes.
AB  - Point-of-care (PoC) diagnostics for bacterial detection offer tremendous prospects for public health care improvement. However, such tools require the complex combination of the following performances: rapidity, selectivity, sensitivity, miniaturization and affordability. To meet these specifications, this paper presents a new selectivity method involving lysostaphin together with a CMOS-compatible impedance sensor for genus-specific bacterial detection. The method enables the sample matrix to be directly flown on the polydopamine-covered sensor surface without any pre-treatment, and considerably reduces the background noise. Experimental proof-of-concept, explored by simulations and confirmed through a setup combining simultaneous optical and electrical real-time monitoring, illustrates the selective and capacitive detection of Staphylococcus epidermidis in synthetic urine also containing Enterococcus faecium. While providing capabilities for miniaturization and system integration thanks to CMOS compatibility, the sensors show a detection limit of ca. 10(8) (CFU/mL).min in a 1.5 muL microfluidic chamber with an additional setup time of 50 min. The potentials, advantages and limitations of the method are also discussed.
TI  - [Identification of staphylococci directly from positive blood culture bottles by  MALDI-TOF MS system].
AB  - Bloodstream infections are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Staphylococcus species are the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood cultures in clinical microbiology laboratories. MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time- of- Flight Mass Spectrometry) system allows the identification of microorganisms directly from positive blood culture bottles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the MALDI-TOF MS system for the identification of staphylococci directly from the positive blood culture bottles which revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci by staining. A total of 96 positive blood culture bottles that yielded gram-positive cocci by Gram stain were evaluated. These blood cultures were obtained from 69 patients between December 2013-February 2014. Conventional methods and BD Phoenix automated bacterial identification system (Becton Dickinson, USA) were used for routine identification. The strains were also identified by real-time Taqman PCR (qPCR) which was considered as the reference method. In MALDI-TOF MS method, MALDI Sepsityper Kit was used for the bacterial identification and all measurements were carried out by using Microflex LT instrument and FlexControl 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics, USA). Of 96 culture bottles positive for gram-positive cocci, 90 were correctly identified as staphylococci at genus level with all the three study methods (qPCR, BD Phoenix, Bruker MALDI-TOF MS). The other six samples were identified as Enterococcus faecium (n= 4) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n= 2) by both Phoenix and the MALDI-TOF systems. Of the 90 samples, 87 were identified at the species level (15 S.aureus, 33 S.epidermidis, 29 S.hominis, 10 S.haemolyticus) and three at the genus level by the reference qPCR method. When comparing the results obtained by qPCR and Bruker MALDI-TOF MS, incompatibility was detected for three isolates. Those isolates were identified as S.hominis by qPCR, however two of them were identified as S.haemolyticus and one as S.epidermidis by MALDI-TOF MS. Compared with real-time Taqman PCR it was detected that Bruker MALDI TOF MS was identified 100% of S.aureus to the genus and species level and 100% and 96.6% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) to the genus and species level, respectively. In conclusion, it was thought that Bruker MALDI TOF MS system may allow rapid and reliable identification of S.aureus and CNS directly from positive blood culture bottles compared with the routine methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. METHODS: Microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. The presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (P </= .05). RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium (36%), Streptococcus epidermidis (36%), Eubacterium saburreum (28%), Parvimonas micra (28%), Streptococcus sanguis (28%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), Leptotrichia buccalis (28%), Enterococcus faecalis (28%), and Staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of Treponema socranskii (3%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). The highest mean levels were found for the following species: E. faecium, Dialister pneumosintes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Helicobacter pylori. There was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). A positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the levels of gram-negative and rod species (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting E. faecium and S. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. No correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of quaternary ammonium salt-type agents containing cholesterol and terpenes.
AB  - New quaternary ammonium salt-type compounds with lipophilic cholesterol and terpene moieties were synthesized. The compounds showed promising antibacterial and antimycobacterial activities. Those compounds containing the cholesterol moiety showed significant activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecium. On the contrary, the antimycobacterial activity increased with the presence of the terpene unit in the molecule.
TI  - Spiromastixones A-O, antibacterial chlorodepsidones from a deep-sea-derived Spiromastix sp. fungus.
AB  - Fifteen new depsidone-based analogues named spiromastixones A-O (1-15) were isolated from the fermentation broth of a deep-sea Spiromastix sp. fungus. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive NMR and mass spectroscopic analysis in association with chemical conversion. Spiromastixones A-O are classified into two subtypes based on the orientation of ring C relative to ring A, while the n-propyl substituents on rings A and C are rarely seen in natural products. Most analogues are substituted by various numbers of chlorine atoms. All compounds exhibited significant inhibition against Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus subtilis with MIC values ranging from 0.125 to 8.0 mug/mL. In addition, compounds 6-10 displayed potent inhibitory effects against methicillin-resistant bacterial strains of S. aureus (MRSA) and S. epidermidis (MRSE), while 10 also inhibited the growth of the vancomycin-resistant bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium (VRE). The structure-activity relationships are discussed.
TI  - Performance of Vitek 2 for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp.
AB  - Vitek 2 (bioMerieux, Inc., Durham, NC) is a widely used commercial antimicrobial  susceptibility testing system. We compared MIC results obtained by Vitek 2 to those obtained by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution (BMD) reference method for 134 staphylococcal and 84 enterococcal clinical isolates. Nineteen agents were evaluated, including all those available on Vitek 2 for testing staphylococci and enterococci. The resistance phenotypes tested included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 58), S. aureus with inducible clindamycin resistance (ICR) (n = 30), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant MRSA (n = 10), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (n = 37), high-level gentamicin-resistant Enterococcus (n = 15), linezolid-resistant Enterococcus (n = 5), and daptomycin-nonsusceptible Enterococcus faecalis (n = 6). For the staphylococci, there was 98.9% categorical agreement (CA). There was one very major error (VME) for gentamicin in a Staphylococcus hominis isolate, six VMEs for inducible clindamycin in S. aureus isolates, and two major errors (ME) for daptomycin in an S. aureus and a Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate. For enterococci, there was 97.3% CA. Two VMEs were observed for daptomycin in isolates of E. faecalis and 2 ME, 1 for high-level gentamicin resistance and 1 for nitrofurantoin, in E. faecium isolates. Overall, there was 98.3% CA and 99% essential agreement for the testing of staphylococci and enterococci by the Vitek 2. With the exception of detecting ICR in S. aureus, Vitek 2 performed reliably for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of staphylococci and enterococci.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - [Surveillance of bacterial distribution and drug resistance in inpatients with surgical infections: a single center study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bacterial distribution and drug resistance in patients with surgical infections, and provide the basis for the standardization treatment of the surgical infection. METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed from January 2008 to December 2011 surgical infection in our samples bacteria identification and drug sensitivity test results. RESULTS: A total of 3829 nonduplicate isolates from 3257 samples, Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 62.4% (the main microbes were P.aeruginosa, K. pneumonia and E.coli etc) and Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 37.6% (the main microbes were Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus). Incidence of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were on an obvious increase. For the performance of the high level of sensitive to Imipenem, Amikacin, Piperacillin and Tazobactam by E. coli and K. pneumonia. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii to cephalosporins, Carbapenems and Fluoroqinolones were higher resistant with Multidrug resistance. No vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant Enterococcus faecium were found. The prevalence of ESBL E.coli was 45.6%-61.5% and ESBL K.pneumoniae isolates were fluctuated. The methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA) isolates were relatively high (21.1%-55.8%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than the other Gram-positive cocci. Vancomycin for Staphylococcus performance was highly sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The main composition of surgical clinical infection pathogens are Gram-negative bacillus, and the emergency of resistance of bacteria to antibacterial drugs is a common phenomenon. The resistant rate shows ascendant trend; Drug resistance is significantly higher in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Antimicrobial resistance is a serious and challenging issue.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - Emergence of Enterococcus species in the infectious microorganisms cultured from  patients with endophthalmitis in South Korea.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the microorganisms in culture-proven endophthalmitis and  their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents commonly used in South Korea. METHODS: Medical records of consecutive patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at eight institutions between 1 January 2004 and 31 July 31 2010 were reviewed. Four categories of endophthalmitis were studied: postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and unspecified. Outcome measures were culture-proven infectious organisms, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and final visual acuity in the patients. RESULTS: A total of 93 microorganisms were identified from 103 patients during the study period. The positive culture rate was 59.2 % (103/174). The most common organisms identified were Enterococcus faecalis (in 20.8 % of patients, 20/96), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.8 %, 18/96), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (10.4 %, 10/96), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3 %, 6/96), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.3 %, 6/96). Two cases of Enterococcus faecium (2.1 %) were recognized. Overall, 70 of 96 (73.0 %) isolates were Gram-positive bacteria, 22 (23.0 %) were Gram-negative bacteria, and 4 (4.2 %) were fungi. The most common organisms resulting in reduced light perception were E. faecalis and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of E. faecalis in endophthalmitis is mainly caused by the high incidence of E. faecalis in postoperative endophthalmitis. This increase also impacts the final visual acuity of the patients.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Rapid detection of Gram-positive organisms by use of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  - Assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GP) in two pediatric hospitals. Positive BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood cultures with Gram-positive organisms were tested using the BC-GP in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. To test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 CFU per milliliter. A total of 249 Gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. The BC-GP correctly identified 14/15 cases of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with Streptococcus anginosus group as S. pneumoniae. The BC-GP detected a case of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus agalactiae. BC-GP's rapid accurate detection of Staphylococcus spp., E. faecium, and E. faecalis and its ability to ascertain mecA, vanA, and vanB status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining to optimal antibiotic use. False-positive S. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "Streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the BC-GP.
TI  - Multiplex identification of gram-positive bacteria and resistance determinants directly from positive blood culture broths: evaluation of an automated microarray-based nucleic acid test.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the Verigene Gram-Positive Blood Culture Test (BC-GP) test to identify 12 Gram-positive bacterial gene targets and three genetic resistance determinants directly from positive blood culture broths containing Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 1,252 blood cultures containing Gram-positive bacteria were prospectively collected and tested at five clinical centers between April, 2011 and January, 2012. An additional 387 contrived blood cultures containing uncommon targets (e.g., Listeria spp., S. lugdunensis, vanB-positive Enterococci) were included to fully evaluate the performance of the BC-GP test. Sensitivity and specificity for the 12 specific genus or species targets identified by the BC-GP test ranged from 92.6%-100% and 95.4%-100%, respectively. Identification of the mecA gene in 599 cultures containing S. aureus or S. epidermidis was 98.6% sensitive and 94.3% specific compared to cefoxitin disk method. Identification of the vanA gene in 81 cultures containing Enterococcus faecium or E. faecalis was 100% sensitive and specific. Approximately 7.5% (87/1,157) of single-organism cultures contained Gram-positive bacteria not present on the BC-GP test panel. In 95 cultures containing multiple organisms the BC-GP test was in 71.6% (68/95) agreement with culture results. Retrospective analysis of 107 separate blood cultures demonstrated that identification of methicillin resistant S. aureus and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. was completed an average of 41.8 to 42.4 h earlier using the BC-GP test compared to routine culture methods. The BC-GP test was unable to assign mecA to a specific organism in cultures containing more than one Staphylococcus isolate and does not identify common blood culture contaminants such as Micrococcus, Corynebacterium, and Bacillus. CONCLUSIONS: The BC-GP test is a multiplex test capable of detecting most leading causes of Gram-positive bacterial blood stream infections as well as genetic markers of methicillin and vancomycin resistance directly from positive blood cultures.
TI  - A new antimicrobial and anticancer peptide producing by the marine deep sediment  strain "Paenibacillus profundus" sp. nov. Sl 79.
AB  - A new linear glyceryl acid derived heptapeptide (1), together with known isocoumarin antibiotic, Y-05460M-A (2), were isolated from the culture of the deep sea sediment strain SI 79 classified as "Paenibacillus profundus" sp. nov. Their structures were determined by 1D- and 2D- NMR techniques and ESI-MS/MS experiments. HPLC analysis of the Marfey derivatives in comparison to their analogs of authentic amino acids revealed that all amino acids in peptide 1, with an exception of Val, have the D-configuration. The compound 1 showed inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecium as well as cytotoxic and moderate colony growth inhibitory activity against SK-MEL-28 cell line.
TI  - Evaluation of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test for rapid detection of bacteria and resistance determinants.
AB  - Rapid identification of pathogens from blood cultures can decrease lengths of stay and improve patient outcomes. We evaluated the accuracy of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) nucleic acid test for investigational use only (Nanosphere, Inc., Northbrook, IL) for the identification of Gram-positive bacteria from blood cultures. The detection of resistance genes (mecA in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and vanA or vanB in Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis) by the BC-GP assay also was assessed. A total of 186 positive blood cultures (in BacT/Alert FA bottles) with Gram-positive cocci observed with Gram staining were analyzed using the BC-GP assay. The BC-GP results were compared with the identification and susceptibility profiles obtained with routine methods in the clinical laboratory. Discordant results were arbitrated with additional biochemical, cefoxitin disk, and repeat BC-GP testing. The initial BC-GP organism identification was concordant with routine method results for 94.6% of the blood cultures. Only 40% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae identifications were correct. The detection of the mecA gene for 69 blood cultures with only S. aureus or S. epidermidis was concordant with susceptibility testing results. For 3 of 6 cultures with multiple Staphylococcus spp., mecA detection was reported but was correlated with oxacillin resistance in a species other than S. aureus or S. epidermidis. The detection of vanA agreed with susceptibility testing results for 45 of 46 cultures with E. faecalis or E. faecium. Comparison of the mean times to results for each organism group showed that BC-GP results were available 31 to 42 h earlier than phenotypic identifications and 41 to 50 h earlier than susceptibility results.
TI  - An international activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid: ZAAPS Program results for 2011.
AB  - Through a continuing resistance surveillance monitoring program, linezolid was shown to maintain its spectrum and potency against a collection of 8059 clinically relevant Gram-positive strains collected from patients at 79 medical centers in 33 countries and Hong Kong. Linezolid MIC90 values were 2 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, and the MIC90 value was 1 mug/mL for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci. Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing for linezolid demonstrated a 99.83% susceptibility rate for all organisms. All S. aureus were inhibited by </=2 mug/mL. Three (0.3%) of 928 strains of CoNS had a linezolid MIC of 4 mug/mL and contained the cfr resistance gene; 1 also had a mutation in L3. There were 14 linezolid-resistant strains detected from 7 countries (Brazil [5], France [1], Germany [2] Greece [2], Italy [2], Ireland [1], and Spain [1]) representing 5 species (E. faecium, S. capitis, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, S. lugdenensis). A mobile cfr gene was noted in 2 species having elevated linezolid MIC values; one was a S. haemolyticus isolate with a MIC at 4 mug/mL. Resistance rates were as follows for the 6 groups of organisms sampled in the 2011 ZAAPS Program: CoNS, 1.2%; enterococci, 0.39%; among S aureus, S. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, no resistance was detected. As the activities of commonly used antimicrobials continue to be compromised by evolving resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive pathogens, linezolid-resistant strains remain uncommon and without increasing occurrence.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Effect of Ottoman Viper (Montivipera xanthina (Gray, 1849)) Venom on Various Cancer Cells and on Microorganisms.
AB  - Cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects of Montivipera xanthina venom against LNCaP,  MCF-7, HT-29, Saos-2, Hep3B, Vero cells and antimicrobial activity against selected bacterial and fungal species: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli O157H7, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Enterococcus faecium DSM 13590, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. typhimirium CCM 5445, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6957 and Candida albicans ATCC 10239 were studied for evaluating the potential medical benefit of this snake venom. Cytotoxicity of venom was determined using MTT assay. Snake venom cytotoxicity was expressed as the venom dose that killed 50 % of the cells (IC50). The antimicrobial activity of venom was studied by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disc diffusion assay. MIC was determined using broth dilution method. The estimated IC50 values of venom varied from 3.8 to 12.7 or from 1.9 to 7.2 mug/ml after treatment with crude venom for 24 or 48 h for LNCaP, MCF-7, HT-29 and Saos-2 cells. There was no observable cytotoxic effect on Hep3B and Vero cells. Venom exhibited the most potent activity against C. albicans (MIC, 7.8 mug/ml and minimal fungicidal concentration, 62.5 mug/ml) and S. aureus (MIC, 31.25 mug/ml). This study is the first report showing the potential of M. xanthina venom as an alternative therapeutic approach due to its cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) polyphenols.
AB  - We investigated the antimicrobial properties of polyphenol-rich fractions derived from raw shelled and roasted salted pistachios. American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), food and clinical isolates, of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mirabilis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus), the yeasts Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis and the fungus Aspergillus niger were used. Pistachio extracts were active against Gram-positive bacteria with a bactericidal effect observed against L. monocytogenes (ATCC strains and food isolates), S. aureus and MRSA clinical isolates. Extracts from raw shelled pistachios were more active than those from roasted salted pistachios. The bactericidal activity of pistachio extracts could be used to help control the growth of some microorganisms in foods to improve safety and may find application as a topical treatment for S. aureus.
TI  - Verigene(R) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test.
AB  - Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and impose considerable costs on healthcare systems. A key predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with BSIs is the early initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial therapy. However, with conventional blood culture methods, the gold standard, there is a significant time delay of approximately 2-3 days before clinical results are available, with many patients receiving inappropriate and/or unnecessary antimicrobial therapy in the interim. During the past two decades, the use of in vitro assays that utilize nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns has led to a significant reduction in the time (hours vs. days with blood culture) to detection and identification of several of the causative pathogens of BSIs and, potentially, earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy. This review focuses on the properties and clinical use of one of these molecular diagnostic assays, the Verigene((R)) Gram-Positive Blood Culture Nucleic Acid Test (BC-GP), which detects many of the potentially pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria associated with BSIs, including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Listeria spp., and Enterococcus spp., and specific resistance markers (mecA, vanA, and vanB). Based on more than 1,600 samples, there was a high degree of agreement between BC-GP test results and those obtained using conventional blood culture and assay methods, irrespective of whether samples were fresh or frozen, and a high degree of agreement for identification of mecA-mediated meticillin resistance in S. aureus and S. epidermidis organisms and vanA- or vanB-mediated vancomycin resistance in E. faecalis and E. faecium organisms.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 5-halogenomethylsulfonyl- benzimidazole and benzotriazole derivatives.
AB  - A series of 5-halogenomethylsulfonylbenzimidazole and benzotriazole derivatives was synthesized as potential antibacterial agents. A new method of synthesis of benzimidazoles was developed. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were tested against a series of reference and clinical strains. The reference strains include Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. subtilis, B. cereus, E. hirae, M. luteus) and Gram-negative rods (E. coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, B. bronchiseptica). The clinical strains include six methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and two methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) S. aureus strains, one methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, three E. faecalis and two E. faecium strains. Compound with trifluoromethyl- substituent at C-2 position (4) displayed significant antibacterial activities comparable with nitrofurantoin against four strains, and higher against Micrococcus luteus. MIC values for clinical Staphylococci strains (MRSA) were 12.5-25 mug/mL; for Enterococcus strains these values were 50-100 mug/mL. MIC values for reference and clinical strains of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus group were similar, respectively.
TI  - Improving linezolid use decreases the incidence of resistance among Gram-positive microorganisms.
AB  - Surveillance studies have shown the emergence of infections with linezolid-resistant bacteria. The relationship between appropriate linezolid use and the spread of linezolid resistance among Gram-positive microorganisms in a single tertiary referral centre was evaluated. In an initial observational study, a prospective prescription-indication study was conducted on intensive care areas and haematology, neurosurgery, vascular surgery and nephrology wards during 2009. An intervention through follow-up feedback on audit results from May-June 2010 was then conducted. From July-December 2010, a second drug-use study of linezolid was conducted, with the same objectives and methodology. To assess the antimicrobial pressure of linezolid, an ecological study was conducted from 2006-2010 in the same hospital wards. Indications for linezolid in the initial study were considered suitable in 38.5% of cases, whilst in the second study the rate was 51.2% (33% increase). Linezolid consumption fell by 57% in the second half of 2010. A significant correlation was found between its inadequate use (DDD/1000 patient-days) and the incidence of linezolid-resistant strains/1000 patient-days (r=0.93; P=6.9e-024); 85% of the variability in the incidence of linezolid resistance was predicted by its inadequate use. Its partial correlations were significant for Enterococcus faecium (r=0.407; P=0.049), Staphylococcus epidermidis (r=0.874; P=2.3e-008) and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (r=0.406; P=0.049) but not Staphylococcus aureus (r=0.051; P=0.704). A relationship was found between appropriate linezolid use and the incidence of linezolid-resistant strains of E. faecium, S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus.
TI  - ZAAPS Program results for 2010: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from 75 medical centres in 24 countries.
AB  - The Zyvox(R) Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum (ZAAPS) Program monitors the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents for Gram-positive organisms in Latin America, Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific. For the 2010 Program a total of 6305 Gram-positive strains were collected from 75 medical centres on five continents (24 countries). Reference broth microdilution susceptibility tests were performed on organisms from the following groups: Staphylococcus aureus (2875), coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) (855), enterococci (787), Streptococcus pneumoniae (926), viridans group and other streptococci (325), and beta-haemolytic streptococci (507). Linezolid demonstrated a 99.81% susceptibility rate among 6305 strains tested from 24 nations. Of the resistant isolates, four linezolid-resistant strains of enterococci (two each for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) were found in four nations (China, Thailand, Germany, and Brazil). Eight CoNS (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis) isolates were observed to be resistant to linezolid (MIC, >/=8 mug/ml). Two strains from Mexico were determined to be from an ongoing epidemic, and investigations showed that isolates from Italy and Brazil were also from circulating resistant clones discovered in earlier years. MRSA rates varied by region and between nations, as did resistances to other potential therapeutic agent options frequently listed for MRSA therapy such as clindamycin, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In summary, the 2010 ZAAPS Program demonstrated that linezolid activity remains stable around the world with >99% susceptibility.
TI  - [Daptomycin for the treatment of gram-positive infections after cardiac surgery].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHOD: Surgical infection remains a main cause of death after heart surgery, despite advances in pharmacological therapy. Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, useful in gram-positive organisms resistant to standard treatment, including vancomycin. The aim of this study was to describe the use of daptomycin regarding efficacy, efficiency and safety in patients with gram-positive infections after heart surgery using a retrospective analysis on 49 adult patients. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin shows excellent in vitro and in vivo activity against gram-positive organisms, such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, especially MRSA. Daptomycin is also effective against increasing vancomycin-resistant or vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus.
TI  - [Changes of gingival groove microbiosis by orthodontic treatment].
AB  - Gingival groove and dental plaque microbiosis was studied for 6 months in patients receiving orthodontic treatment. The patients were divided in two groups according to the type of used toothbrushes (manual or electric). After fixation of orthodontic appliances the increase of S. epidermidis by simultaneous decrease of E. faecium was observed in both groups. This shift was overcome one month later. Electric toothbrush showed better effectiveness for dental hygiene in patients with fixed orthodontic appliances.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM), linezolid (LZD) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 microg/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. Cefpirome, carbapenems, VCM, teicoplanin (TEIC), LZD and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of E. faecalis strains and 1.2% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate to LZD. 17.1% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM was under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity. Carbapenems showed good activity against Clostridiales, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp., but one strain of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. And so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting continuously.
TI  - Volatile organic compound analysis by ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry for Gram-positive bacteria differentiation.
AB  - Approximately 50 % of all clinically proven infections in critically ill patients are caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The timely and appropriate treatment of these infections is vital in order to avoid negative outcomes. Hence, fast and reliable methods are needed for the early detection and identification of microorganisms. Recently, direct mass spectrometry-based analysis of volatile organic compounds emitted by microorganisms has been employed to study Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we report a feasibility study of ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry (IMR-MS) for in vitro growth detection and species differentiation of selected Gram-positive bacteria that are frequently isolated in blood culture samples, namely, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry was used to analyze the headspace above cultures containing Gram-positive bacteria incubated at 37 degrees C starting with 10(2) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Measurements to determine the presence of volatile organic compounds were performed 4, 8, and 24 h after incubation, respectively. The detection of microbial growth was accomplished already after 8 h in cultures containing E. faecalis. After 24 h of incubation, characteristic mass spectra were obtained for all species. Processing these mass spectra by hierarchic clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) enabled us to differentiate between bacterial species. IMR-MS in conjunction with a cumulative end-point model provides the means for rapid growth detection and differentiation of Gram-positive bacteria on the species level, typically within an analysis time of less than 3 min per sample.
TI  - [Analysis of distribution characteristics and drug resistance of 2748 strains of  pathogens isolated from burn patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide epidemiological data of the distribution characteristics and drug resistance of the pathogens isolated from burn patients in recent years for guiding rational use of antibiotics in clinic. METHODS: Totally 2748 strains of pathogens were isolated from 1977 specimens (blood, catheter, wound excretion, etc.) collected from 478 patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital from March 2003 to June 2011. After being identified by API strips, drug resistance of the 2748 isolated pathogens to 55 commonly-used antibiotics including gentamicin, tobramycin, piperacillin, amikacin, etc. was tested by K-B paper disk diffusion method. The WHONET 5.3 software was used to analyze the following subjects: the distribution of the pathogens with different types and different sources each year, the changes in drug-resistant rates of Gram negative bacilli, Gram positive cocci, and fungi to several antibiotics, and the changes in sensitive rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Candida albicans (CA) to several antibiotics. RESULTS: Among 2748 strains of pathogens, 1879 strains of Gram negative bacilli accounted for 68.38%, 628 strains of Gram positive cocci accounted for 22.85%, and 241 strains of fungi accounted for 8.77%. The isolation rate of strains from wound excretion ranked the first (1022 strains accounted for 37.19%), followed by those from respiratory tract (995 strains accounted for 36.21%) and blood (421 strains accounted for 15.32%). Strains isolated from other types of specimens were rare. Isolation rate of PA ranked the first (996 strains accounted for 36.24%), followed by SA (495 strains accounted for 18.01%) and AB (395 strains accounted for 14.37%). Isolation rate of AB showed a trend of increase year by year, but that of SA presented the opposite trend. Isolation rate of PA was quite stable. There were 484 strains of methicillin resistant SA among Staphylococci, accounting for 17.61%. Resistant rates of PA and AB to polymyxin B and polymyxin E were below 30.00%, and those of PA and AB to other antibiotics, such as the third generation cephalosporins, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, were from 57.91% to 100.00%. Resistant rate of AB to minocycline was 39.68%. From 2004 to 2011, sensitive rate of PA to quinolone antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year, but that of AB to minocycline, netilmicin, imipenem, meropenem, tobramycin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam presented the opposite trend. Resistant rates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and SA to teicoplanin and linezolid were less than 10.00%. Resistant rate of SA, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium to vancomycin was 0. Resistant rates of SA to quinupristin/dalfopristin, minocycline, fusidic acid, and compound sulfamethoxazole were low, respectively 0.82%, 9.35%, 2.21%, and 31.85%. Sensitive rates of SA to erythromycin, clindamycin, compound sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and minocycline showed an increasing trend year by year. Both infection rate and resistant rate of fungi were low. The resistant rates of CA to 5 kinds of antibiotics were less than 15.00%. The sensitive rate of CA to 5-flucytosine declined slightly, and those of CA to the other 4 antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year. CONCLUSIONS: The three dominant pathogens that cause infection in burn patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital in recent years are PA, SA, and AB in order. PA and AB are outstandingly multidrug-resistant among the isolated strains. AB might replace PA as the main pathogenic bacterium that cause the death of burn patients with infection.
TI  - Action of linezolid or vancomycin on biofilms in ventriculoperitoneal shunts in vitro.
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts used to treat hydrocephalus have an overall infection rate of about 10% of operations. The commonest causative bacteria are Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. Major difficulties are encountered with nonsurgical treatment due to biofilm development in the shunt tubing and inability to achieve sufficiently high CSF drug levels by intravenous administration. Recently, three cases of S. epidermidis CSF shunt infection have been treated by intravenous linezolid without surgical shunt removal, and we therefore investigated vancomycin and linezolid against biofilms of these bacteria in vitro. A continuous-perfusion model of shunt catheter biofilms was used to establish mature (1-week) biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis (both methicillin resistant [MRSA and MRSE]), Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. They were then "treated" with either vancomycin or linezolid in concentrations achievable in CSF for 14 days. The biofilms were then monitored for 1 week for eradication and for regrowth. Enterococcal biofilms were not eradicated by either vancomycin or linezolid. Staphylococcal biofilms were eradicated by both antibiotics after 2 days and did not regrow. No resistance was seen. Linezolid at concentrations achievable by intravenous or oral administration was able to eradicate biofilms of both S. epidermidis (MRSE) and S. aureus (MRSA). Neither vancomycin at concentrations achievable by intrathecal administration nor linezolid was able to eradicate enterococcal biofilms. It is hoped that these in vitro results will stimulate further clinical trials with linezolid, avoiding surgical shunt removal.
TI  - Reversal of antibiotic resistance in Gram-positive bacteria by the antihistaminic azelastine.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance represents a serious problem that complicates microbial infection. The use of 'helper compounds' capable of enhancing the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics is being investigated. Azelastine, a new generation antihistaminic, possesses certain antibacterial activity and is capable of inducing alteration in the bacterial membrane permeability. Hence, we hypothesized that it could reverse resistance to antibiotics. Azelastine significantly increased the antibacterial activity of eight antibiotics belonging to five different classes (beta-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and tetracyclines) against nine Gram-positive clinical isolates: five Staphylococcus aureus, two Staphylococcus epidermidis and two Enterococcus faecium, seven of which were multi-drug resistant, reversing their resistance to the tested antibiotics. The synergistic effects of azelastine with the studied antibiotics increased with raising the pH from 5 to 8. Antibiotics did not affect the ability of azelastine to alter the permeability of a liposomal artificial membrane model, an effect thought to be critical for the interaction with antibiotics. The findings of this study present azelastine as a potential 'helper compound' that could reverse the resistance of multi-drug resistant Gram-positive clinical isolates to antibiotics.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance dynamics and isolation rate of staphylococci and enterococci from patients of reconstructive surgery units].
AB  - The dynamics of isolation of staphylococci and enterococci from clinical material of patients and their antibiotic susceptibility within a 5-year period (2005-2009) was analysed. 5990 isolates were tested: 1250 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 3268 isolates of S. epidermidis, 1005 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and 467 isolates of E. faecium. Grampositive infections were shown to be prevailing within the last 2-3 years, the nosocomial epidermal staphylococci more and more replacing S. aureus (the ratio of S. epidermidis and S. aureus in 2009 was 3.3). The isolation rate of E. faecalis significantly increased (by 3.5 times) and the ratio of E. faecalis and E. faecium in 2009 was 4.3. The microflora composition with respect to the isolation source was analysed and its clinical significance was estimated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that oxacillin had its own specific niche, while antibiotics active against resistant grampositive cocci, such as rifampicin, fusidic acid, fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin), cefoxitin, as well as amoxicillin/clavulane in infections due to E. faecalis, might be considered as the drugs of choice. In the treatment of nosocomial infections, when the etiological role of MRSA or VRE is suspected or confirmed, the complex therapy should obligatory include the most active antibiotics (vancomycin or linezolid among them).
TI  - Serotypes and antibiotic resistance in Group B streptococcus isolated from patients at the Maternity Hospital, Kuwait.
AB  - A total of 143 group B streptococcus (GBS) isolates collected from mothers at the Maternity Hospital in Kuwait were investigated for their serotypes and antibiotic resistance, and screened by PCR for the carriage of genes for resistance to tetracycline (tetk, tetM, tetL, tetO), erythromycin (ermA, ermB, ermC, ermTR, ermM, mefA, mefE, msrA) and aminoglycosides (aph3, ant4, ant6). All isolates were serotyped using a latex agglutination test. Most of the isolates belonged to serotypes V (38.5 %), III (20.9 %), Ia (7.7 %) and II (11.2 %). Sixteen isolates (11.2 %) were nontypable. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime (MICs 0.016-0.094 microg ml(-1)) but were resistant to trimethoprim (92.3 %), tetracycline (89.5 %), minocycline (89.5 %), high-level kanamycin (76.9 %), chloramphenicol (30.0 %), erythromycin (12.6 %), clindamycin (7.0 %), high-level streptomycin (3.5 %) and ciprofloxacin (0.7 %). The tetracycline-resistant isolates contained tetM (94.5 %), tetO (3.9 %), tetL (1.6 %) and tetK (0.8 %). The erythromycin-resistant isolates contained ermB (61.1 %), ermTR (38.9 %), ermA (5.5 %), mefA (5.5 %) and mefE (11 %). All high-level kanamycin-resistant isolates contained aph3. One of the high-level streptomycin-resistant isolates contained ant6. Partial DNA sequencing of aph3 revealed sequences with 99 % similarity to aph3 found in Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that the GBS isolates could have acquired aph3 from other Gram-positive cocci. The high proportion of isolates with resistance to tetracycline, high-level kanamycin and trimethoprim, and the increase in the prevalence of erythromycin resistance, represents an emerging public health concern that needs further surveillance.
TI  - Synthetic 3-arylideneflavanones as inhibitors of the initial stages of biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of twenty two synthetic flavonoids is reported. Among  them three 3-arylideneflavanones, 2b, 2c, and 2i, were shown to be highly active against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis reference strains, with MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) values ranging from 4.68 microg/ml (14.3 microM) to 37.5 microg/ml (119.7 microM). The synergy of oxacillin and vancomycin with 2c, evaluated as fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was shown (against planktonic culture of S. aureus A3 and E. faecium 138/09 clinical strains). The presence of 2c in the culture medium diminished the initial adhesion of bacteria to an abiotic surface. Such an effect resulted in a decrease in biofilm formation during prolonged culture. Unfortunately, 2e failed to eradicate the S. aureus mature biofilm which was already preformed, however, decreased the number of live biofilm cells. The biofilm of E. faecalis was more susceptible to the action of 3-arylideneflavanone 2c than the S. aureus biofilm. The finding that 3-arylideneflavanones are lipophilic, cause bacterial aggregation, and influence the integrity of membranes making them permeable to SYTO 9/propidium iodide dyes may implicate the cytoplasmic membrane as a target site for these compounds activity.
TI  - Eight-year (2002-2009) summary of the linezolid (Zyvox(R) Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum; ZAAPS) program in European countries.
AB  - The linezolid surveillance network (ZAAPS program) has been monitoring linezolid  activity and susceptibility rates for eight years (2002-2009) in european medical centers. Samples from 12-24 sites annually in 11 countries were monitored by a central laboratory design using reference MIC methods with international and regional interpretations (EUCAST). A total of 13,404 gram-positive pathogens were tested from 6 pathogen groups. Linezolid remained without documented resistance from 2002 through 2005, but beginning in 2006 resistant strains emerged at very low rates among Staphylococcus aureus (G2576T mutant in ireland, 2007), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; usually Staphylococcus epidermidis, France and Italy in 2006-2009) and enterococci (Enterococcus faecium in Germany [2006, 2008, 2009] and E. faecalis in Sweden [2008], United Kingdom [2008] and Germany [2009]); all but one strain having a target mutation. A mobile cfr was detected in an italian CoNS strain (2008 and 2009), and clonal spread was noted for linezolid-resistant strains (PFGE results). Overall the linezolid susceptibility rates were >99.9, 99.7 and 99.6% for S. aureus, CoNS and enterococci, respectively; and all streptococcal strains were susceptible (MIC(90), 1 mg/l). In conclusion, the ZAAPS program surveillance confirmed high, sustained levels of linezolid activity from 2002-2009 and without evidence of MIC creep or escalating resistance in gram-positive pathogens across monitored european nations.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 micrcog/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. Ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, VCM, teicoplanin, linezolid(LZD) and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of E. faecalis strains or 3.5% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to LZD. 24.4% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM were under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity against C. difficile. Carbapenems showed good activity against Peptococcaceae, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp. However since several strains of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future.
TI  - Prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. Of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. The aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in Osogbo, Nigeria. The study was conducted between January and June 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in Osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. Appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of Enterococcus species at the Bacteriology Laboratory of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Osogbo using standard microbiological methods. There were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (HAI); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. Enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. Two species of Enterococcus were identified; Enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection (UTI) and surgical site infection (SSI) of 6 (85.7%) patients and Enterococcus faecium from UTI in 1 (14.3%) patient. Other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were Klebsiella spp 31.0%, Pseudomonas spp 20.7%, Staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, Escherichia coli 12.1%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and Serratia spp 1.7%. All the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with the VRE strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. Other Gram-positive and Gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except E. coli and Pseudomonas spp which were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. This limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. There is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.
TI  - Medical-grade honey enriched with antimicrobial peptides has enhanced activity against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - Honey has potent activity against both antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria, and is an interesting agent for topical antimicrobial application to wounds. As honey is diluted by wound exudate, rapid bactericidal activity up to high dilution is a prerequisite for its successful application. We investigated the kinetics of the killing of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by RS honey, the source for the production of Revamil(R) medical-grade honey, and we aimed to enhance the rapid bactericidal activity of RS honey by enrichment with its endogenous compounds or the addition of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). RS honey killed antibiotic-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, and Burkholderia cepacia within 2 h, but lacked such rapid activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli. It was not feasible to enhance the rapid activity of RS honey by enrichment with endogenous compounds, but RS honey enriched with 75 muM of the synthetic peptide Bactericidal Peptide 2 (BP2) showed rapid bactericidal activity against all species tested, including MRSA and ESBL E. coli, at up to 10-20-fold dilution. RS honey enriched with BP2 rapidly killed all bacteria tested and had a broader spectrum of bactericidal activity than either BP2 or honey alone.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of fluoroquinolone derivatives containing 3-(N'-alkoxycarbamimidoyl)-4-(alkoxyimino) pyrrolidines.
AB  - A series of novel 7-[3-(N'-alkoxycarbamimidoyl)-4-(alkoxyimino)pyrrolidin-1-yl] fluoroquinolone derivatives were designed, synthesized and characterized by (1)H NMR, MS and HRMS. These fluoroquinolones were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity. Most of them exhibit good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC: 0.06-4.00 mug/mL). The activity of compounds 33 and 43 against S. aureus including MRSA and S. epidermidis including MRSE (MIC: 0.06-0.125 mug/mL) is more than or comparable to the reference drugs levofloxacin and gemifloxacin. In addition, compound 33 is 32 and 16-32 fold more potent than both the reference drugs against Enterococcus faecium 08-7 and Klebsiella pneumoniae 09-22, respectively.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  - Non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. The purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. Overall, Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than Gram-positive bacteria. For the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia and Escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. The susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. Streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. Staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the Sa 78 and ATCC 6538 strains, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. Non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. Biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. Bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. A rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with P. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strain Sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. A 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. A 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated P. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. A statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated animals after the third day of the course. Wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. Overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - Synergistic effects between conventional antibiotics and 2-aminoimidazole-derived antibiofilm agents.
AB  - 2-aminoimidazoles are an emerging class of small molecules that possess the ability to inhibit and disperse biofilms across bacterial order, class, and phylum. Herein, we report the synergistic effect between a 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate and antibiotics toward dispersing preestablished biofilms, culminating with a 3-orders-of-magnitude increase of biofilm dispersion toward Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Furthermore, we document that the 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate will also resensitize multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria to the effects of conventional antibiotics, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
TI  - Speciation of Gram-positive bacteria in fresh and ambient-stored sub-tropical marine fish.
AB  - This study identified Gram-positive bacteria in three sub-tropical marine fish species; Pseudocaranx dentex (silver trevally), Pagrus auratus (snapper) and Mugil cephalus (sea mullet). It further elucidated the role played by fish habitat, fish body part and ambient storage on the composition of the Gram-positive bacteria. A total of 266 isolates of Gram-positive bacteria were identified by conventional biochemical methods, VITEK, PCR using genus- and species-specific primers and/or 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The isolates were found to fall into 13 genera and 30 species. In fresh fish, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus were the most frequent isolates. After ambient storage, S. epidermidis, S. xylosus and Bacillus megaterium were no longer present whereas S. warneri, B. sphaericus, Brevibacillus borstelensis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus uberis increased in frequency. Micrococcus luteus and S. warneri were the most prevalent isolates from P. dentex, while E. faecium and Strep. uberis were the most frequent isolates from P. auratus and M. cephalus. With respect to different parts of the fish body, E. faecium, Strep. uberis and B. sphaericus were the most frequent isolates from the muscles, E. faecium, Strep. uberis from the gills and M. luteus from the gut. This study showed a diversity of Gram-positive bacteria in sub-tropical marine fish; however, their abundance was affected by fish habitat, fish body part and ambient storage.
TI  - [Evolution in the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance].
AB  - Over the last decade the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has been a growing problem, especially in some geographic areas, making useless most of the classical antibiotic therapies. The rapid emergence of resistant bacteria is the result of different factors as the intrinsic microbial complexity, the growing attitude to travel of humans, animals and goods, the use of antibiotics outside hospitals, and the lack of precise therapeutic chooses for high risk group of patients. The antibiotic-resistance becomes certainly a serious problem when a resistant pathogen, and often multi-resistant today, is present in an infective site. In fact in a recent estimate of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about 90.000 deaths per year in the USA are attributable to bacterial infections and in particular to resistant pathogens. It appears clear that the clinic relevance of this problem is the decimation of the sensible germs of the normal flora that leads to the upper hand of the only resistant bacteria. The antibiotic therapy, in fact, select the resistance and each bacteria has developed a particular strategy to survive: mutations of the genetic content or acquisition of resistance genes from the external. Among the Gram positive bacteria, besides methicillin resistant Staphyloccocus aureus, there are other pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, some species of streptococci and multiresistant Corynebacterium. The CoNS, eg. S. epidermidis, S. hominis and S. haemolyticus, are recognized as new important nosocomial pathogens and are not only responsible of invasive infections but have become in few years resistant to oxacillin (more than 60%) and multiresistant. The unsuspected fragility of glycopeptides, which for 40 years have been the most important treatment against infections due to Gram-positive bacteria, has posed the need for new antimicrobial molecules. Among the therapeutic possible options there are linezolid, tygecyline and daptomycin, but new other molecules are appearing in the clinical use like ceftobiprole and dalbavancin.
TI  - Chemical synthesis and biological screening of 2-aminoimidazole-based bacterial and fungal antibiofilm agents.
AB  - A collection of 2-aminoimidazole/triazole amides has been synthesized and screened for antibiofilm activity. This class of small molecules was found to modulate the biofilm activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Rhodospirillum salexigens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Vibrio vulnificus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium as well as the yeast Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Furthermore, lead compounds were found to not lyse red blood cells at active concentrations.
TI  - Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum program: linezolid surveillance program results for 2008.
AB  - The seventh year of the Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against Gram-positive pathogens in Latin America, Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific region. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various Gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. Each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the United Kingdom, Japan, and China where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: S. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (748), enterococci (864), Streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). Eight linezolid-resistant (LZD-R) isolates were detected in 7 countries (Italy [2], France, China, Brazil, Sweden, Germany, and United Kingdom) among the enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis [3] and E. faecium [2]) and CoNS (3 Staphylococcus epidermidis). Five LZD-R isolates contained 23S rRNA mutations (G2576T or G2447T), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. One CoNS (Italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in Taiwan. All streptococci were linezolid susceptible (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL). In conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. Documented LZD-R remains rare (only 0.13% overall but highest for CoNS [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. Rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of MRSA varied by geographic region and between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.
TI  - Linezolid surveillance program results for 2008 (LEADER Program for 2008).
AB  - The LEADER Program was initiated in 2004 and monitors emerging linezolid resistance in sampled US medical centers. This report summarizes the data obtained in 2008, the 5th consecutive year. A total of 57 institutions participated in 2008 representing all 9 US census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6113 isolates, 101.9% compliance to protocol design). The organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were Staphylococcus aureus (3156), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 856), enterococci (901), Streptococcus pneumoniae (619), and viridans group (223) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (358); also, D-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with MIC(90) results ranging from 1 microg/mL (streptococci and CoNS) to 2 microg/mL (Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci). Only 0.36% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, a slight decrease from 0.45% and 0.44% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The nonsusceptible strains (22) were Staphylococcus aureus (3), CoNS (14), and Enterococcus faecium (5) each with defined target mutations (G2576T in 19 strains; T2504A in 1 strain), mobile cfr element (1 strain Staphylococcus epidermidis with an identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern to a cfr-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the same center in LEADER 2007), or an unknown (1 strain) mechanism. The mobile cfr resistance found in a Staphylococcus aureus strain in 2007 was not observed in 2008. In conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 5th year of this LEADER Program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.64% susceptibility levels). The nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable and the plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism that emerged in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains in 2007 showed no evidence of dissemination or increased prevalence. However, there was evidence of cfr persistence with the S. epidermidis strain. The LEADER Program continues to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect and monitor novel oxazolidinone resistance phenotypes and genotypes.
TI  - Aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit staphylococcal and enterococcal biofilm formation.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. Here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and E. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against HeLa cells. Preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.
TI  - A 2-aminobenzimidazole that inhibits and disperses gram-positive biofilms through a zinc-dependent mechanism.
AB  - A number of 2-aminobenzimidazole derivatives were synthesized and screened for their ability to inhibit and disperse bacterial biofilms. From these compounds, a lead 2-aminobenzimidazole was identified that both inhibited and dispersed MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms. Mechanistic studies showed that the activity is Zn(II)-dependent, potentially via a direct zinc-chelating mechanism.
TI  - Prevalence of resistance phenotypes and genotypes to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin antibiotics in Gram-positive cocci isolated in Tunisian Bone Marrow Transplant Center.
AB  - To investigate the prevalence of resistance to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics in Gram-positive cocci isolated in a Bone Marrow Transplant Center of Tunisia, we tested the antibiotic susceptibility of 172 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis and Enterococcus faecium to macrolide erythromycin and spiramycin, the lincosamide clindamycin and the streptogramin pristinamycin. These three groups of organisms were mostly resistant to macrolides and lincosamide, but were commonly susceptible to pristinamycin. The resistance phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant isolates were determined by the five-disc test with erythromycin, spiramycin, lincomycin, clindamycin and pristinamycin, which showed that most exhibited constitutive MLS resistance. In order to determine the prevalence of the resistance genotypes and the resistance mechanisms, the prevalence of the erythromycin resistance methylase (erm) (A), erm(B), erm(C), msr(A) and macrolide efflux (mef) (A) genes in the erythromycin-resistant isolates was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The resistance was due mainly to the presence of ermB in E. faecium (80%), ermC in S. epidermidis (53%) and mefA in S. mitis (65%).
TI  - Ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI), including those caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (PBP)2a, an MRSA-specific PBP that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. The high binding affinity of ceftaroline to PBP2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/mL) correlates well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for MRSA. Ceftaroline is active in vitro against Gram-positive cocci, including MRSA, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (not E. faecium). The broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or AmpC-derepressed Enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. Limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. Ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug) is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. For multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/mL and 21.0 microg/mL for first and last dose, respectively. Ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 L/kg (28.3 L), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. No drug accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through renal excretion (49.6%). Based on Monte Carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. Currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. A phase II study randomized 100 patients with cSSSI to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. Clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. Adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. In a phase III trial, 702 patients with cSSSI were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. Ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating cSSSI caused by both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens. Adverse event rates were similar between groups. Ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for cSSSI and CAP, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a bioactive lantibiotic produced by Staphylococcus warneri.
AB  - Lantibiotics are a group of potent antibacterial agents that contain unusual amino acids, such as the thioether amino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine, and the didehydroamino acids didehydroalanine and didehydro-aminobutyric acid. Here, we report on an antibacterial lantibiotic peptide named SWLP1 (Staphylococcus warneri lantibiotic peptide 1), which is secreted from Staphylococcus warneri (deposited with DSMZ, accession number DSM 16081). SWLP1 was purified from growth media. The purified peptide displays antibacterial activity against several species, including Staphylococcus epidermidis. The molecular mass of SWLP1 is 2998.9 Da as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The sequence and possible structure was elucidated by combining electrospray ionization mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry data of ethanethiol-treated and non-ethanethiol-treated tryptic fragments of the SWLP1. SWLP1 contains three thioether bridges, one didehydroalanine, and three didehydroaminobutyric acids. This peptide has the potential to be used in treatment of several Gram-positive bacterial infections.
TI  - [In vitro activity of linezolid/ertapenem combination in resistant gram-positive  bacteria].
AB  - The increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus infections has become a major therapeutic challenge and alternative therapy options are under consideration. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activity of linezolid combined with ertapenem against two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and two methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) strains isolated from clinical specimens. In vitro activity of linezolid/ertapenem combination at 1/2 x MIC (minimal Inhibitory Concentration), 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC concentrations for each of the isolates was determined by time-kill curve method. At 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC concentrations, additive effect was detected for MRSA (at 6 and 24 h) and VREF (at 6 h) strains. Synergism was observed between two antibiotics at 4 x MIC concentration against one of the MRSE strains at 6th hour. Additive effect was determined at 6th and 24th hours in this strain at 1 x MIC concentration. No synergism was present in the other MRSE strain but additive interaction was detected at 6 h (1/2 x MIC) and 24 h (1 x MIC). Although these results support the use of linezolid/ertapenem combination in infections caused by resistant gram-positive strains, further in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary.
TI  - Characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  - The present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a R. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. The bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis and Ent. faecium, and Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli) while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. The Lactobacillus plantarum and L. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. While L. plantarum CRL 1606 also inhibited red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. However, by using a MRS medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. The surface properties of Lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate ABO human erythrocytes, while the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. This paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of Lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. in marine environments from the West Coast of the USA.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the study was to determine if vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus  spp. [VRE] carrying vanA and/or vanB genes were present in public marine beaches and a fishing pier [2001-2003, 2008] from Washington and California [2008]. METHODS: PCR assays for the vanA and/or vanB genes with verification by DNA-DNA hybridization of the PCR products were used. Positive isolates were speciated using the BD BBL Crystal Identification and/or by sequencing the 16S ribosomal region. RESULTS: Eighteen (8%) of 227 isolates including Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus casseliflavus/gallinarum and a Staphylococcus epidermidis carrying vanA and/or vanB genes, from four of six Washington and one of two California sites, were identified. Selected VRE and the S. epidermidis were able to transfer their van genes to an E. faecalis recipient at frequencies ranging from 1.9 x 10(-6) to 6.7 x 10(-9). CONCLUSIONS: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. was isolated from five of the seven sites suggesting that other North America public beaches could be the reservoirs for VRE and should be assessed. SIGNIFICANCE & IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report of isolation and characterization of VRE strains (and a vanB Staphylococcus sp.) from North American environmental sources suggesting that public beaches may be a reservoir for possible transmission of VRE to beach visitors.
TI  - United States resistance surveillance results for linezolid (LEADER Program for 2007).
AB  - The LEADER Program (2007) monitors for emerging linezolid resistance in sampled US medical centers, initiated in 2004. For the current reported year, the number of sites participating was increased from 50 to 60 institutions representing all 9 US census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6305 isolates, 105.1% compliance to protocol design). The organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were Staphylococcus aureus (3318), coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS, 1020), enterococci (705), Streptococcus pneumoniae (622), and viridans group (249) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (391); also, D-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in S. aureus strains. Linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with MIC(90) results ranging from 1 microg/mL (streptococci and CoNS) to 2 microg/mL (S. aureus and enterococci). Only 0.44% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, compared with 0.45% in 2006. The nonsusceptible strains (23) were usually staphylococci (20) or Enterococcus faecium (8), each with defined target mutations (G2576T, 24 strains) or a novel mobile cfr element in staphylococci (2 strains). In conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 4th year of this LEADER Program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.56% susceptibility). Although the nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable, a new plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism emerged in S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains from Arizona and Ohio. The LEADER Program appears to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect novel resistance phenotypes and genotypes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the ornamental species Salvia corrugata, a potential new crop for extractive purposes.
AB  - As a part of our search for biologically active compounds from cultivated Salvia  spp. we investigated Salvia corrugata Vahl. The activity of two isolated icetaxane diterpene quinones, fruticuline A and demethylfruticuline A, was assessed against 46 bacterial pathogens, mostly resistant to several primary antibiotics. The MIC for all the inhibited Gram-positive pathogens tested showed a very narrow distribution and ranged from 32 to 64 mg/L, regardless of their resistance patterns to other antibiotics. Demethylfruticuline A was shown to be highly bactericidal (>3 log(10) CFU decrease within 24 h) against Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis and bacteriostatic against Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Fruticuline A manifested bacteriostatic activity against all tested strains. S. corrugata can be viewed as an interesting source for these diterpenes, which, if well tolerated in vivo, may represent new medical agents useful for the treatment of serious infections caused by resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Staphylococcus epidermidis: a differential trait of the fecal microbiota of breast-fed infants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast milk is an important source of staphylococci and other bacterial groups to the infant gut. The objective of this work was to analyse the bacterial diversity in feces of breast-fed infants and to compare it with that of formula-fed ones. A total of 23 women and their respective infants (16 breast-fed and 7 formula-fed) participated in the study. The 16 women and their infants provided a sample of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 7, 14, and 35. The samples were plated onto different culture media. Staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates were submitted to genetic profiling and to a characterization scheme, including detection of potential virulence traits and sensitivity to antibiotics. RESULTS: The feeding practice had a significant effect on bacterial counts. A total of 1,210 isolates (489 from milk, 531 from breast-fed and 190 from formula-fed infants) were identified. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant species in milk and feces of breast-fed infants while it was less prevalent in those of formula fed-infants. Enterococcus faecalis was the second predominant bacterial species among the fecal samples provided by the breast-fed infants but it was also present in all the samples from the formula-fed ones. The biofilm-related icaD gene and the mecA gene were only detected in a low number of the S. epidermidis strains. Several enterococcal isolates were also characterized and none of them contained the cylA or the vanABDEG antibiotic-resistance genes. All were sensitive to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: The presence of S. epidermidis is a differential trait of the fecal microbiota of breast-fed infants. Globally, the staphyloccal isolates obtained from milk and feces of breast-fed infants contain a low number of virulence determinants and are sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested.
TI  - Medical-grade honey kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria in vitro and eradicates skin colonization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance among microbes urgently necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents. Since ancient times, honey has been used successfully for treatment of infected wounds, because of its antibacterial activity. However, large variations in the in vitro antibacterial activity of various honeys have been reported and hamper its acceptance in modern medicine. METHODS: We assessed the in vitro bactericidal activity of Revamil (Bfactory), a medical-grade honey produced under controlled conditions, and assessed its efficacy for reduction of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers in a within-subject-controlled trial. RESULTS: With Bacillus subtilis as a test strain, we demonstrated that the variation in bactericidal activity of 11 batches of medical-grade honey was <2-fold. Antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were killed within 24 h by 10%-40% (vol/vol) honey. After 2 days of application of honey, the extent of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers was reduced 100-fold (P < .001), and the numbers of positive skin cultures were reduced by 76% (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Revamil is a promising topical antimicrobial agent for prevention or treatment of infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Development of multiple resistances to antibiotics in staphylococci, enterococci  and pneumococci became a health threat during the past 20 years, not only with respect to nosocomial infections. This resistance development is based on acquisition of resistance genes by predominant epidemic subpopulations (clonal complexes). Although emergence and spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is associated with a limited number of epidemic clones which have been widely disseminated, acquisition of SCCmec elements by susceptible ancestors has taken place at different times and at different locations. Among Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium, one clonal complex, which had acquired resistance genes at several occasions, is widely disseminated in hospitals. Also in Streptococcus pneumoniae, antibiotic resistance is preferentially associated with clonal lineages which have a capacity for spreading. They became, however, more rare after introduction of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of DX-619, a novel Des-F (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of DX-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in China. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials were determined by a CLSI recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were examined by the broth dilution method. Time-kill curves against representative isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. DX-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant Gram-positive cocci. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 against Enterobacteriaceae (except for Escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/L, which were comparable to other comparators. MBCs and time-kill curves showed that DX-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. There was no significant inoculum effect on MICs. But the activities of DX-619 against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic pH and human serum. DX-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including Gram-positive cocci, such as S. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
TI  - Decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  Part II: new insights.
AB  - The second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. A simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast Candida albicans, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Neisseria sicca, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Gram-positive bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of Geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. A similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. Measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. Counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. Reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. The area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the Wartburg law depending on exposure time. Qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Frequent detection of multidrug-resistant pneumonia-causing bacteria in the pneumonia lung tissues of patients with hematological malignancies.
AB  - Pneumonia is a critical issue during the agonal phase, and often becomes lethal in the absence of pathogen detection. Autopsy is a powerful tool for analyzing the cause of a patient's death, progression of the disease, and the therapeutic response. However, it is frequently limited to the identification of bacterial strains. To elucidate the pathogenesis during the agonal phase of pneumonia, intrapulmonary sputum was harvested by directly inserting a swab into a resected lung, and the bacterial composition was analyzed using both pathological and microbiological techniques from 15 patients with hematological malignancies, and the results were compared with those from 25 patients with other medical and surgical diseases. Among the 54 bacteria strains isolated from the 40 patients, multidrug-resistant strains were significantly more prevalent in hematological group than in other diseases (16/21 versus 11/33, P = .002). Enterococcus faecium was preferentially isolated from the hematological patients, whereas the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was predominantly found in the nonhematological group. Two coagulase-negative Staphylococcus epidermidis strains in hematological diseases may be diagnosed as causative bacteria of pneumonia by both bacterial and pathological techniques. Although the results of this study may not be directly applicable for clinical diagnosis, this approach has a potential to become not only a diagnostic method for bacterial pneumonia, but may be also useful for the analysis of multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - In vitro activity of novel rifamycins against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - We describe novel rifamycins that have improved activity, compared with rifampin, against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC(90)s of 0.008 and 0.0005 microg/ml, respectively. This enhanced antibacterial activity, along with their potential lack of drug-drug interactions, are considerations that suggest the potential of these novel rifamycins in combination therapy to treat serious Gram-positive infections.
TI  - LEADER surveillance program results for 2006: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from the United States (50 medical centers).
AB  - Surveillance for emerging linezolid resistance among commonly occurring Gram-positive pathogens in the United States began with the 2002 ZAAPS program and more recently (2004) expanded as the LEADER program. The 2006 LEADER program processed 5374 strains from 50 medical centers (100 per site) located within the 9 US census regions; species and number tested by broth microdilution (% linezolid susceptible) included Staphylococcus aureus (2913, >99.9), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNSs) (808, 98.4), enterococci (547, 97.4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (546, 100.0), viridans group streptococci (189, 100.0), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (371, 100.0). In addition to 1 linezolid-nonsusceptible S. aureus, 3 strains were daptomycin-nonsusceptible, 4 were quinupristin/dalfopristin-intermediate, 2 were vancomycin-intermediate (vancomycin MIC values, 4 mug/mL), and all were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Among the linezolid-resistant isolates (1 S. aureus, 13 CoNSs, 3 Enterococcus faecalis, and 10 Enterococcus faecium isolates), all but 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates had the G2567T mutation. Overall, 99.55% of the tested 2006 LEADER program isolates remained susceptible to linezolid at current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant Gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  - This study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. Overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.015-0.5mg/L, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and MR staphylococci. Tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci, with MICs for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) of 0.25 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, being more active than linezolid (MIC(90)=2 mg/L) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/L, respectively). Molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(M), erm(B) and erm(C) in Streptococcus agalactiae; tet(O), variably associated with different erm genes, in Streptococcus pyogenes; vanA, tet(M) and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecalis, and vanA and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecium. All the MRSA strains harboured SCCmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(K) with tet(M) genes. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. These results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a MIC(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/L both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of substituted phenyl-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinones against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - With the incidence of linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Staphylococcus aureus, modification of linezolid at the 5- and/or 3-positions led to the development of a series of 3-(methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinone analogues. These compounds were tested in vitro against six gram-positive standard organisms (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, S. albus, Streptococcus enteridis and S. nonhemolyticus). 5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinones bearing fluorine at 3'-position of phenyl ring showed activities against several gram-positive bacteria (MIC: 3.13-6.25 mug/mL). The position of methoxyl group on the phenyl ring of piperazine group affected antibacterial spectrum. 3-(4'- (para-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active against 5 gram-positive organisms except S. nonhemolyticus, whereas 3-(4'-(ortho-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active only against 2 gram-positive organisms, namely S. albus, S. enteridis.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Characterization of macrolide resistance in Gram-positive cocci from Colombian hospitals: a countrywide surveillance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The characterization of macrolide resistance in Gram-positive cocci recovered from Colombian hospitals. METHODS: The resistance profiles and mechanism of macrolide resistance were investigated in isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1679), Staphylococcus aureus (348), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (175), and Enterococcus spp (123). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for erythromycin (ERY) and clindamycin (CLI), detection of macrolide resistance genes, phenotypic characterization, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of macrolide-resistant pneumococci were performed. RESULTS: Resistance to ERY and CLI was 3.3% and 2.3% for S. pneumoniae, 58% and 57% for S. aureus (94% for both compounds in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)), and 78.6% and 60.7% in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. ERY resistance was 62% in Enterococcus faecalis and 82% in Enterococcus faecium. The MLS(B)-type accounted for 71% of S. pneumoniae and 100% of MRSA. The erm(A) gene was prevalent in MRSA, erm(B) in S. pneumoniae and enterococci, and erm(C) in CoNS isolates. Efflux pump genes (mef(A) genes) were mostly identified in S. pneumoniae (24%). The most common genotype amongst ERY-resistant pneumococci was the Spain(6B)-2 clone. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of macrolide resistance is low in Colombian pneumococci and high in MRSA (cMLS(B)-type).
TI  - Bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  - The most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 Italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. The most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). Overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. Three bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. Other prevalent bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, while Acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolates. 7% of S. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Although E. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among Enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. All the Gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=4 microg/ml. Almost 10% of Escherichia coli, 14% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of Serratia marcescens and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. Amikacin was the most active antibiotic against P. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. Finally, Acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). The results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in Italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital setting in Italy.
TI  - FT-IR microspectroscopy for early identification of some clinically relevant pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potentials and limitations of Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy as a tool to identify, at the level of microcolonies, pathogenic bacteria frequently isolated in the clinical environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1570 FT-IR spectra from 164 gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients were recorded from 6 to 10-h old microcolonies of 50-150 microm size. A classification of 100% was obtained for the most frequent gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium at the species level. An average accuracy of about 80% was reached with Gram negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae families; Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella spp., and Citrobacter koseri; and Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. Results were comparable with FT-IR measurements on dried suspensions from 18-h cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of young microcolonies is feasible with FT-IR microscopy with a very high accuracy for gram-positive bacteria. Some improvement in the transfer of microcolonies is necessary to increase the accuracy for gram-negative bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Combination of FT-IR microscopy and multivariate data analysis could be a complementary, rapid, and reliable tool for screening and discriminating, at species and subspecies level, micro-organisms of clinical, food-borne, or environmental origins.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of "androlla", a Spanish traditional pork sausage.
AB  - Counts of total aerobic mesophilic microflora, lactic acid bacteria, salt-tolerant microflora, Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, moulds and yeasts, and staphylococci, and some physico-chemical parameters (total solids, NaCl and nitrate contents and pH and aw values) were determined in 20 units of "androlla", a traditional dry-fermented sausage made in the NW of Spain. In general, high counts of all the investigated microbial groups were observed, with average values of 8.99 +/- 0.46 log cfu/g for the total aerobic mesophilic microflora, 9.11 +/- 0.16 log cfu/g for the lactic acid bacteria, 6.87 +/- 0.68 log cfu/g for the salt-tolerant microflora, 2.80+/-1.85 log cfu/g for the Enterobacteriaceae, 3.25 +/- 1.86 log cfu/g for the enterococci, 4.30 +/- 1.73 log cfu/g for the moulds and yeasts, and 3.62 +/- 0.60 log cfu/g for the staphylococci. From MRS agar, SPC agar + 7.5% NaCl, VRBG agar, and KAA agar, 10 colonies were randomly taken from each androlla unit and from each culture medium. A total of 200 strains per culture medium were then identified using the classical methods. Among the isolates from MRS agar, Lactobacillus sakei predominated, followed by Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus alimentarius and Lactobacillus plantarum. Of the 200 isolates obtained from SPC agar + 7.5% NaCl, only 56 strains belonged to the Staphylococcaceae or Micrococcaceae families. Among the Staphylococcaceae, Staphylococcus xylosus was the main species, followed by Staph. epidermidis; Staph. equorum, Staph. capitis and Staph. saprophyticus were isolated in very low proportions. Among the Micrococcaceae, Micrococcus luteus predominated, followed by Micrococcus lylae, Kocuria varians and Kocuria kristinae. Of the 150 isolates obtained from VRBG agar, Hafnia alvei was the main species, followed by Serratia liquefaciens and Enterobacter amnigenus; six isolates were identified as Salmonella. Among the 190 isolates obtained from KAA agar, 122 were considered enterococci; 20 isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecium, one as Enterococcus faecalis and 101 as Enterococcus inter faecalis-faecium.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin alone and in combination with various antimicrobials against Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The increasing prevalence of resistant Gram-positive cocci requires the need to search for more effective agents and synergistic combinations. Forty-two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), 30 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 36 Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) strains were studied. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined and synergy testing was performed by using E test for daptomycin, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin-clavulanate against staphylococci; for daptomycin, ampicillin, rifampin, and gentamicin against enterococci. Daptomycin in combination with ampicillin, rifampin, and gentamicin was tested against enterococci; daptomycin in combination with ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ticarcillin-clavulanate was tested against staphylococci. Interaction categories were defined by the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index. All strains of staphylococci and enterococci were susceptible to daptomycin. All three combinations showed synergy against more than 70% of the MRSA strains. Daptomycin in combination with ampicillin, rifampin, and gentamicin against enterococci showed synergies of 64.2%, 57.1% and 21.4%, respectively. This study indicates that daptomycin alone and combined with beta-lactams seems to be effective against MRSA, but further in vitro and in vivo studies on the subject are required before clinical use can be recommended.
TI  - Pacemaker-related endocarditis: clinical features and treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Removal of the entire infected system is the traditionally indicated management of pacemaker lead endocarditis (PLE), based on expert recommendations. Herein is described the present authors' experience with this condition. METHODS: Between 1987 and 2004, all consecutive patients with PLE treated at a tertiary referral university hospital and a community hospital were prospectively selected. Clinical features, management and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirteen cases of PLE were diagnosed. Surgery was performed in 10 cases, and medical treatment alone in three (due to advanced age in two cases and because of terminal colon cancer in one case). Four subjects died before discharge: three deaths occurred after surgery (one patient died due to refractory ventricular arrhythmia and two from persistent sepsis), and one unoperated patient died from sepsis and severe renal failure. No deaths or late surgeries were observed after a mean follow up period of 37 +/- 14 months. Both patients who survived hospitalization and underwent only medical treatment were free from late complications after 30 and 60 months follow up, respectively. CONCLUSION: Some patients with PLE present a good evolution without surgery, suggesting that surgical treatment is not mandatory in this situation. However, an indication for surgery may be similar to that for other cases of infective endocarditis.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid against key gram-positive organisms isolated in the united states: results of the LEADER 2004 surveillance program.
AB  - Since the approval of linezolid in 2000, sporadic reports of resistance have been given and a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has been gained. However, since these developments, an updated status of the in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive organisms from the United States has not been reported. The LEADER 2004 surveillance initiative was undertaken to obtain current and representative data on the activity of linezolid against key species, including isolates with significant resistance phenotypes. Organisms were isolated during 2004 and included 2,872 Staphylococcus aureus, 496 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS), 428 Enterococcus faecalis, 196 Enterococcus faecium, and 422 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. All S. aureus isolates (54.2% oxacillin resistant) were susceptible to linezolid (MIC90 = 2 microg/ml); MIC distributions were consistent, regardless of oxacillin or multidrug resistance status. For CNS, one nonsusceptible isolate was encountered (Staphylococcus epidermidis; MIC = 32 microg/ml), but overall, the MIC(90) (1 microg/ml) was lower than that obtained with S. aureus. For E. faecalis and E. faecium, 99.5% and 96.4% of isolates, respectively, were linezolid susceptible. Both species had an MIC90 of 2 microg/ml, and MIC distributions did not vary with the vancomycin susceptibility status of the populations analyzed. Linezolid nonsusceptibility was not encountered among the S. pneumoniae isolates. These findings indicate that linezolid nonsusceptibility has remained rare among staphylococci and uncommon and sporadic among enterococci. Nonetheless, careful and ongoing monitoring of the in vitro effectiveness of linezolid will be needed so that any changes to the current status may be detected as soon as possible.
TI  - The streptogramin antibiotics: update on their mechanism of action.
AB  - Antibiotics of the streptogramin class are an association of two types of chemically different compounds, group A molecules and group B molecules, acting in synergy. The combination of these molecules generally inhibits bacterial growth at a lower concentration than does either the group A or group B molecule alone and is often bactericidal against strains of bacteria for which each type of molecule alone is only bacteriostatic. The semisynthetic streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500), the first water-soluble member of this class, is under development for the treatment of severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and other organisms. The streptogramins block the translation of mRNA into protein. Both group A and group B molecules bind to the peptidyl-transferase domain of the bacterial ribosome. The group B molecule stimulates the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome and may interfere with the passage of the completed polypeptide away from the peptidyl-transferase centre. The group A molecule inhibits the elongation of the polypeptide chain by preventing both the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A site and the formation of the peptide bond. When the two types of molecule are used in combination, the binding of the group A molecule alters the conformation of the ribosome such that the affinity of the ribosome for the B molecule is increased. This accounts, in part or entirely, for the observed synergy. This synergy is unaffected by ribosomal modifications conferring resistance to the macrolides, lincosamides, and group B molecules alone.
TI  - [Microbiological external quality assurance program (MEQAP)--evaluation of results obtained in sanitary epidemiological laboratories in 2002].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some Gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. All laboratories engaged in this study received 3 strains: S. aureus (S. aureus SC+ CF+, resistant to methicillin., or S. aureus SC - CF+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis or S. haemolyticus or S. saprophyticus) and Enterococcus sp. (E. faecalis HLAR-positive or E. faecalis HLAR-negative or E. faecium or E. gallinarum). All these strains previously were identified in Department of Bacteriology of National Institute of Hygiene. Of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. Among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by E. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). The determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the NCCLS and national recommendations. Some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.
TI  - Bloodstream infection after umbilical cord blood transplantation using reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation for adult patients.
AB  - Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a significant problem after cord blood transplantation (CBT). However, little information has been reported on BSI after reduced-intensity CBT (RI-CBT). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 102 patients. The median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 17-79 years). Preparative regimens comprised fludarabine 125 to 150 mg/m 2 , melphalan 80 to 140 mg/m 2 , or busulfan 8 mg/kg and total body irradiation 2 to 8 Gy. Prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease comprised cyclosporin or tacrolimus. BSI developed within 100 days of RI-CBT in 32 patients. The cumulative incidence of BSI was 25% at day 30 and 32% at day 100. The median onset was day 15 (range, 1-98 days). Causative organisms included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 11), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), Enterococcus faecium (n = 4), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 4), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 4), and others (n = 7). Of the 32 patients with BSI, 25 (84%) died within 100 days after RI-CBT. BSI was the direct cause of death in 8 patients (25%). Univariate analysis failed to identify any significant risk factors. BSI clearly represents a significant and fatal complication after RI-CBT. Further studies are warranted to determine clinical characteristics, identify patients at high risk of BSI, and establish therapeutic strategies.
TI  - Trends in linezolid susceptibility patterns in 2002: report from the worldwide Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program.
AB  - Oxazolidinones have become reliable clinical and candidate antimicrobial agents to be utilized for infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive cocci, especially vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. However, mutational resistance of the ribosomal target has been described for several species. Longitudinal surveillance remains necessary to monitor for this evolving linezolid resistance pattern. A survey of linezolid and several comparison Gram-positive focused agents was initiated in 2002 (7971 strains, >99.0% compliance) for 54 participating sites in the United States, Canada, Europe (6 nations), Latin America (2 nations), and the Asia Pacific (2 nations). The 5 and 25 sites in Canada and the United States, respectively, submitted 200 strains each to a central laboratory for organism identification/confirmation and reference MIC processing. The 10 remaining nations had 200 strain samples from 1 to 4 separate institutions. Linezolid resistance (MIC >/= 8 microg/mL) was confirmed by alternative susceptibility testing methods (Etest, AB BIO Disk, Solna, Sweden; disk diffusion method) and target mutation characterization by PCR and sequence analysis. Linezolid activity against the 6 major organism groups did not vary between geographic areas. A total of 98.1% of linezolid MIC values were between 0.5 and 2 microg/mL, and only 0.5% of results were at 4 microg/mL, which included 32 Staphylococcus aureus (0.9%) and 5 (0.5%) enterococcal isolates. Linezolid resistance was detected in only 4 isolates (0.05%): 1 each Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, and a viridans group Streptococcus. All 4 isolates had a G2576U mutation in the 23S rRNA target. Linezolid activity as outlined by these Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum (ZAAPS) Program results demonstrate sustained, near complete activity against contemporary Gram-positive isolates on 4 monitored continents and in centers utilizing oxazolidinones. Rare linezolid-resistant strains were identified in the United States only (0.05% resistance overall).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of linezolid and vancomycin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model of gram-positive catheter-related bacteraemia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the activity of linezolid and vancomycin in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model to assess potential differences in activity against biofilm-embedded organisms. METHODS: Single-lumen central venous catheters colonized with biofilm-embedded Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) were treated with simulated clinical dosing regimens of linezolid 600 mg every 12 h or vancomycin 1 g every 12 h in a one-compartment in vitro pharmacodynamic model. Quantitative cultures were sampled through the catheter and peripheral ports over 48 h to dynamically assess changes in the burden of catheter colonization and organism seeding, respectively. At 24 and 48 h catheters were removed, sonicated and cultured for adherent organisms. RESULTS: Both linezolid and vancomycin suppressed bacterial growth on the catheter and release of S. aureus and S. epidermidis into the model compared with controls (P < 0.05), while linezolid also suppressed counts compared with control and vancomycin versus VRE. Neither agent completely eradicated bacterial colonization of the catheters. MICs for the isolates recovered from the model did not increase over time with linezolid or vancomycin exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of activity against biofilm-embedded organisms appeared to be the primary reason for microbiological failure of both drugs in the model.
TI  - Analysis of etiology and drug resistance of biliary infections.
AB  - The bile was collected from fro patients with biliary infections, with the bacterium isolated to study the sensitivity of each kind of the bacterium to several antibiotics in common use. Except G- bacterium, we also found some kinds of G+ bacterium in infection bile. G- bacterium were not sensitive to Clindamycin, G+ bacterium were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin. Escherichia coli, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to Ampicillin. G+ bacterium were not sensitive to Azactam. Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter cloacae were not sensitive to Ceftazidime. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not sensitive to Ceftriaxone Sodium. We didn't found any bacterium resistance Imipenem. The possibility of the existence of G+ bacterium as well as drug resistance should be considered n patients with biliary infections. The value of susceptibility test should be respected to avoid drug abuse of antibiotics.
TI  - Survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  - In 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  We assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS). Methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The most common gram-positive species was Enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). Enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (BLs), fluoroquinolones (FQs), and tetracyclines (TCs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. Escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. The proportion of FQ-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). All the ESBL-producing strains (ESBLs) possess resistance to FQs. Over 95% of Klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. The distribution of antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. Some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among Proteus species. No ESBL-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from Serratia marcescens. This survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of ESBL-producing or FQs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid & quinupristin/dalfopristin against Gram-positive  cocci.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Since the incidence of vancomycin- and methicillin-resistant Gram-positive infections continue to increase, novel antimicrobials such as linezolid and streptogramin may provide new options to treat patients. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro susceptibility of Enterococcus faecium resistant to glycopeptides, coagulase negative staphylococci and S. aureus resistant to methicillin isolated mainly from blood and also rectal swab cultures of patients against quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid. METHODS: The in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin for a total of 332 isolates of Gram-positive cocci [127 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 109 methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (71 S. epidermidis, 38 S. haemolyticus) and 96 vanA genotype vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium] was investigated by E test. RESULTS: All MRSA and MRCoNS isolates were susceptible to linezolid (MICs < 4.0 mg/l). Ninety per cent of VRE isolates were inhibited by linezolid at concentration of 2.0 mg/l and presented similar activities to quinupristin/dalfopristin. MICs for quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci were also low (MIC(90) = 1.0 mg/l for both MRSA and MRCoNS isolates). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrated that quinupristin/ dalfopristin and linezolid, have good in vitro activity against MRSA, MRCoNS and vancomycin resistant E. faecium in Turkey. These drugs could be promising therapeutic options in an era of rapidly growing antibiotic resistance in all parts of world.
TI  - Surveillance of linezolid resistance in Germany, 2001-2002.
AB  - A surveillance study was performed throughout Germany from November 2001 to June  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among Gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. Each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. Most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. Laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for MIC determination. Susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. Sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). Routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. The prevalence of linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in Staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in Enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in Enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in Streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid resistance was not detected in Streptococcus pneumoniae or in viridans group streptococci. Sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. Linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (MIC90, 1-2 mg/L). The prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in Germany. Organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an alternative method or in a reference laboratory.
TI  - A case of graft infection 10 years after ascending aorta replacement.
AB  - A 52-year-old man was admitted with anemia and slight fever, which he had for the last 2 months. He had undergone replacement of the ascending aorta for acute aortic dissection 10 years previously. Echocardiography demonstrated a flailing thin structure in the anterior wall of the ascending aorta corresponding to the proximal portion of the prosthetic graft. This abnormal echocardiographic finding led us to repeat blood cultivation. We finally detected Enterococcus facium and Staphylococcus epidermidis in his blood sample. We diagnosed this as a graft infection and prepared for surgical re-replacement of the infected graft. While he was waiting for the operation, an infectious aneurysm of a tibialis posterior artery ruptured and an emergency operation was done. Replacement of the infected ascending aorta graft was done thereafter. In surgery, 2-cm-long vegetation was found. It stuck to the graft wall near the former hole used for air removal in the first surgery. The patient recovered fully and left our hospital after 3 months of postoperative antibiotics therapy. This rare case of aortic graft infection long after the original replacement surgery suggests the importance of thorough echocardiographic investigation of prosthetic graft infection as a possible cause of fever of unknown origin.
TI  - Detection of the van alphabet and identification of enterococci and staphylococci at the species level by multiplex PCR.
AB  - A multiplex PCR assay was developed for detection of the six types of glycopeptide resistance characterized in enterococci and for identification of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis at the species level. Primers targeting the genes vanA, vanB, vanC, vanD, vanE, vanG, and ddl of E. faecium and E. faecalis and nuc of S. aureus and a chromosomal portion specific to S. epidermidis were designed to allow amplification of fragments with various sizes. This specific and sensitive technique allows detection of glycopeptide-resistant strains, in particular methicillin-resistant S. aureus, that may escape phenotype-based automated rapid methods.
TI  - An alcohol hand rub containing a synergistic combination of an emollient and preservatives: prolonged activity against transient pathogens.
AB  - A new alcohol-based hand antiseptic (Octoxy hand rub) containing a synergistic combination of an emollient (Octoxyglycerine) and preservatives was developed and evaluated for immediate and prolonged activity against transient bacteria. The in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial efficacy was compared with other alcohol hand rubs containing preservative/antimicrobial (Prevacare and Avagard). In vitro evaluation was carried out using a tube-dilution method and a pig-skin model. Rapid and prolonged efficacy in vivo was evaluated against Staphylococcus epidermidis on the hands of volunteers. Octoxy hand rub was 100% effective in rapidly killing pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in vitro. In volunteers, all three hand rubs gave a significant reduction in microbial count within 15s. Octoxy hand rub showed significantly higher efficacy against S. aureus and Escherichia coli than Avagard and Prevacare 15 min after application to the pig-skin model, and against S. epidermidis in both the pig-skin model and in volunteers. Use of Octoxy hand rub with broad-spectrum immediate and prolonged antimicrobial activity may be a very effective way of improving hand hygiene without exposing the hands to higher concentrations of antimicrobials.
TI  - In vitro testing of antimicrobial activity of bone cement.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish a reliable and cost-effective microplate proliferation assay for in vitro antimicrobial testing of bone cement samples. Cement samples devoid of antimicrobial agents, loaded with 2% gentamicin or with different concentrations of high-porosity silver, were incubated in a 96-well microplate with several staphylococcal, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecium isolates exhibiting different susceptibilities to gentamicin. After being rinsed, the samples were brought into a soy medium in which adherent cells on the cement surface either were killed by the antimicrobial surface or started to release clonal counterparts. The medium was monitored in real time by recording a time proliferation curve for each well. Microplate testing revealed no antibacterial effect of plain bone cement. The antibacterial activity of gentamicin-loaded bone cement was shown by the microplate test to depend on the gentamicin susceptibilities of the strains. The effect of high-porosity silver was dose dependent. Bactericidal activity against all tested strains was found for bone cement loaded with 1% high-porosity silver. The accuracy of this new proliferation assay was shown by the high correlation between the types of proliferation curves and antibiotic susceptibility. In contrast to routine agar diffusion testing, it assesses the dynamic response of microorganisms to antimicrobial agents in biomaterials and allows high-throughput screening and detection of antimicrobial properties of poorly water-soluble compounds like silver.
TI  - In vitro assessment of chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated polyurethane foam antimicrobial dressing using zone of inhibition assays.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an antimicrobial dressing consisting of hydrophilic polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate for activity against several antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates as well as American Type Culture Collection reference strains using zone of inhibition assays. METHODS: Sterile foam samples with chlorhexidine gluconate and untreated controls were transferred onto inoculated agar plates. Plates were incubated at 35 degrees C to 37 degrees C for 24 hours and examined for zones of inhibition around the foam samples. RESULTS: Polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate showed antimicrobial activity in vitro against all of the challenge organisms including antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates. CONCLUSION: The data from this in vitro study support the hypothesis that polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate has an antimicrobial effect against antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species, as well as Candida species.
TI  - [Antibacterial effectiveness of high-energetic extracorporeal shock waves: an in  vitro verification].
AB  - AIM: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is used for a multitude of different indications in modern orthopedics. Local bacterial infections, like infected pseudarthrosis, are still considered as contraindications. The goal of the present study was to determine the effect of ESWT on the growth of clinically relevant bacteria in orthopedic and trauma surgery. METHODS: Standardized suspensions of five bacterial strains of bone and implant-associated infections were treated with 4 000 impulses of high-energy shock waves with an energy flux density (ED) of 0.96 mJ/mm (2) and a frequency of 2 Hz. Subsequently, viable bacteria were quantified and compared with an untreated control. RESULTS: A highly significant antibacterial effect of the ESWT was demonstrated for all bacterial strains with a reduction of growth to values between 1.1 % and 29.7 % (p < 0.01). Reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis reacted with the highest sensitivity whereas Enterococcus faecium demonstrated the highest resistance towards high-energy shock waves. CONCLUSION: ESWT proved to exert a significant antibacterial effect on clinically relevant pathogens. Further investigations on energy flux density and impulse rates might contribute to an optimization of the bactericidal effectiveness. Infections as possible indications of the ESWT should therefore be assessed in further studies and the clinical relevance should be verified in an animal model.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Daptomycin in vitro susceptibility in European Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the activity of daptomycin, a novel  lipopeptide, against European Gram-positive isolates (n = 1539). The MIC(90)-values of daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus isolates was 0.25 mg/L, against Enterococcus faecalis 4 mg/L, against Enterococcus faecium 8 mg/L, 0.25 mg/L against Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 0.25mg/L against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Daptomycin was equally potent against antibiotic-susceptible and resistant strains within a particular species. Based on a breakpoint of 1 mg/L for S. aureus and group A streptococci, all isolates tested were susceptible to daptomycin. Based on a breakpoint of 4 mg/L for vancomcyin-susceptible E. faecalis 99.7% of these isolates were susceptible to daptomycin.
TI  - In vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial-coated vascular grafts.
AB  - The serious medical consequences and costly management of infections associated with vascular grafts have prompted an expanding interest in examining the preventive efficacy of antimicrobial-coated vascular grafts. The purpose of antimicrobial coating of vascular grafts is to reduce bacterial colonization of the device and, hopefully, the occurrence of clinical infection. In this study we demonstrated that expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts coated with minocycline and rifampin provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro, as reflected by zones of inhibition, against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We also showed in a rabbit model that subcutaneously placed minocycline/rifampin-coated vascular grafts have lower rates of staphylococcal device colonization (1/24 = 4% vs. 8/30 = 27%, p = 0.033) and device-related infection (0/24 = 0% vs. 6/30 = 20%, p = 0.028) than uncoated grafts. These promising results encourage the clinical evaluation of vascular grafts coated with minocycline and rifampin.
TI  - Algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  - We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including Staphylococcus spp., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of E. faecalis and E. faecium), Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific PCR algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the PCR results were compared to the culture results. Apart from-cross reactions between E. coli and Chryseomonas luteola and Enterococcus faecium and E. durans, the PCR assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. Regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the PCR algorithm within a few hours. However, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. The PCR algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in positive blood cultures.
TI  - [Nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first Ciproxan IV special investigation in 2001].
AB  - The parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in September 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. As a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX. This time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to CPFX with those to other antimicrobial drugs. Gram-positive bacteria were less susceptible to CPFX than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis to CPFX were comparable to those to cefozopran. Susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to CPFX did not differ among ampicillin (ABPC)-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: < 0.25 microgram/ml), ABPC-intermediate S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and ABPC-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) MIC90 of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with CPFX. Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to CPFX similarly to carbapenems and the MIC90 values of CPFX were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to CPFX among the antibacterial drugs examined and the MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. CPFX also showed the lowest MIC90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. When extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production and class B beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the Gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing ESBL and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class B beta-lactamase were found. The MIC range of CPFX to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (MIC of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) based on the NCCLS breakpoint. CPFX also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of Japan Society of Chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. Furthermore, susceptibilities of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we conducted in 1997. Thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of CPFX was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - Validation of the 'Marburg bone bank system' for thermodisinfection of allogenic  femoral head transplants using selected bacteria, fungi, and spores.
AB  - The Marburg Bone Bank System 'Lobator sd-2' is widely used to process human femoral heads removed during aseptic surgery by thermal disinfection. The inactivating capacity of the thermodisinfection system was validated in compliance with current standards using a newly developed femoral head model. The following micro-organisms, bacteria and fungi, taken from the American Type Culture Collection were investigated: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphyloccus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis including spores, Clostridium sporogenes, Mycobacterium terrae, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger spores. Highly enriched suspensions of these micro-organisms were applied to the centre of the femoral heads. The reduction in the number of micro-organisms was determined by counting the colony-forming units (cfu) before and after processing the spiked test device in the 'Lobator sd-2' system. Vegetative bacteria, fungi and fungal spores were completely inactivated (reduction factor >/=6 log(10)). The numbers of B. subtilis and C. sporogenes spores, both known to be heat-resistant, were reduced by one to two orders of magnitude. These bacteria serve as a model for spore forming pathogens which are not relevant in femoral heads from living donors. By processing human femoral heads from living donors by thermal disinfection using the Marburg Bone Banking system, a high level of safety is achieved regarding clinically relevant pathogens. To further increase the safety of the thermally treated femoral heads, we recommend that the medical history and present state of the donor, as well as the necessary serological tests should be taken into account.
TI  - In vitro studies of the pharmacodynamics of teicoplanin against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the basic pharmacodynamic properties of teicoplanin in  vitro for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium. METHODS: The following experiments were performed: (1) bacterial killing by teicoplanin at different concentrations; (2) bacterial killing by teicoplanin at 8 x MIC against the same strains with inocula of 5 x 10(3), 5 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(7) CFU/mL; (3) studies of the postantibiotic effect (PAE) and the postantibiotic sub-MIC effect (PASME) of teicoplanin; (4) studies of the killing by teicoplanin in an in vitro kinetic model following exposure to simulated human serum pharmacokinetic concentrations (6 mg/kg OD at steady state). RESULTS: Concentration-dependent killing was noted against S. epidermidis, with a > 4 log10 difference in CFUs between 2 x MIC and 64 x MIC at 24 h. Also, against S. aureus there was slight concentration-dependent killing, which, however, did not reach 2 log10 CFU/mL. Teicoplanin exerted a similar killing rate at all inocula for S. epidermidis, except for slower initial killing up to 6 h at the highest inoculum. In contrast, overall slower killing at all inocula was seen for S. aureus, where an inoculum effect was noted at the highest inoculum. For E. faecium, only a bacteriostatic effect was noted at all concentrations and inocula. No or very short PAEs were noted for the investigated strains. However, when the strains in the postantibiotic phase were exposed to 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 x MIC of teicoplanin (PASME), substantial prolongation of the PAEs was seen. Although no significant killing was achieved in our kinetic model for any of the strains, regrowth of S. epidermidis was noted first after 8 h, despite a T > MIC24 of only 5% (1.2 h), illustrating the long post-MIC effect for this strain. For S. aureus, T > MIC was 38%, and regrowth occurred later than for S. epidermidis. Neither killing nor regrowth was seen for E. faecium with a T > MIC24 of 27%. CONCLUSION: Teicoplanin exerted a concentration-dependent bactericidal effect against S. epidermidis, a less notable one against S. aureus, and a bacteriostatic effect against E. faecium. A reduced killing rate with increasing inocula was seen for S. aureus and also for S. epidermidis at the highest inoculum. No or very short PAEs were noted for the investigated strains, but were substantially prolonged with the addition of subinhibitory concentrations. When human pharmacokinetics was simulated (6 mg/kg OD at steady state) in the kinetic model, no net bactericidal effect was noted for any of the strains at 24 h.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of linezolid and five other antimicrobials against  nosocomial isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - The activity of linezolid in comparison to vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, clindamycin and gentamicin was tested against 60 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 60 strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from patients with nosocomial infections and 24 strains of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolated from feces of hospitalized patients. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All tested strains were sensitive to linezolid and specifically all methicillin-resistant S. aureus had MIC range 0.25-3.00, MIC50 = 0.75, MIC90 = 1.5, all methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis had MIC range 0.125-1.5, MIC50 = 0.5, MIC90 = 1 and all vancomycin-resistant E. faecium had MIC range 0.5-1.5, MIC50 = 1, MIC90 = 1. Linezolid is the first of a novel antimicrobial class, the oxazolidinones, which is a promising treatment for serious Gram-positive infections, including multiresistant strains.
TI  - Daptomycin against multiple drug-resistant staphylococcus and enterococcus isolates in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model with simulated endocardial vegetations.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic that exhibits bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria. In pursuit of potential clinical dosing regimens for endocarditis, we evaluated two, once-daily daptomycin regimens against multiple, drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Daptomycin susceptibility was determined in the absence and presence of physiologic concentrations of albumin. An in vitro pharmacodynamic model with simulated endocardial vegetations incorporating protein was used to simulate regimens of daptomycin at 6 and 8 mg/kg/day and vancomycin at 1 g every 12 h against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA-67 and 494) and S. epidermidis (MRSE-R227 and R617), glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus and S. epidermidis (GISA-992 and GISE-12333), and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREF-SF12047 and 12366). Bacterial quantification occurred over 72 h. Daptomycin MIC results for study isolates in the absence or presence of albumin ranged from 0.125 to 4 and 1 to 8, respectively. Both daptomycin regimens achieved greater than 99.9% kill by 8 h and demonstrated greater bacterial reduction than vancomycin against all tested isolates at 24, 48, and 72 h (p < 0.05). Undetectable limits of bacterial quantification was achieved and maintained by 8 mg/kg/day against MRSA-494 and 67, GISA-992, and VREF-590 for the study duration. Although slight regrowth was noted only for 6 mg/kg/day against MRSA-67, 99.9% kill was maintained throughout the study period without development of resistance. Pharmacodynamic profiles and drug exposure of daptomycin at 6 mg/kg/day corresponds to previously reported AUC/MIC requirements. These results suggest that 6 and 8 mg/kg/day of daptomycin represent potential regimens for further clinical evaluation in drug-resistant Gram-positive endocarditis.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - Microbial quality and direct PCR identification of lactic acid bacteria and nonpathogenic Staphylococci from artisanal low-acid sausages.
AB  - Detection of six species of lactic acid bacteria and six species of gram-positive catalase-positive cocci from low-acid fermented sausages (fuets and chorizos) was assessed by species-specific PCR. Without enrichment, Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus curvatus were detected in 11.8% of the samples, and Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus xylosus were detected in 17.6%. Enriched samples allowed the detection of L. sakei and S. xylosus in all of the samples (100%) and of Enterococcus faecium in 11.8% of the sausages. The percentages of L. curvatus, L. plantarum, Staphylococcus carnosus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis varied depending on the sausage type. L. curvatus was detected in 80% of fuets and in 57% of chorizos. L. plantarum was found in 50% of fuets and 100% of chorizos. S. epidermidis was detected in only 11.8% of fuets, and S. carnosus was detected in only 5.9% of chorizos. Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus warneri, and Staphylococcus simulans were not detected in any sausage type. From a microbiological point of view, 70.6% of the samples could be considered of high quality, as they had low counts of Enterobacteriaceae and did not contain any of the food-borne pathogens assayed.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the C-2 side chain. In agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with a MIC(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. Furthermore, SM-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the MIC. SM-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of MRSA in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The MICs of SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. These drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against Enterococcus faecium, and the MIC(90) s for ampicillin-resistant E. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. However, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of SM-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an E. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in CFU at four times the MIC after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. In addition, SM-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the E. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the MICs (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. Among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - [Surveillance on gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections or community acquired infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the drug-resistance rates of gram-positive cocci isolated from patients with hospital acquired infection (HAI) or community acquired infection (CAI) in 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in China. METHODS: According to the previous protocol, from July 1(st) 2000 to June 30(th) 2001, a total of 2401 pathogenic strains were isolated from 13 hospitals. Among them, 805 strains of gram-positive cocci were collected for in vitro susceptibility test using international standard plate dilution method. According to the criteria of guidelines of NCCLS (2001), MIC(50) and MIC(90) were detected to represent the antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and R%, I%, and S%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of the bacteria to the compounds tested. RESULTS: The detectable rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 37.4% (89/238) and 33.8% (51/151) respectively. Among a total of 238 strains of S. aureus, 139 were isolated from patients with CAI and 37 were from HAI patients, the rate of MRSA from HAI patients (89.2%, 33/37) was significantly higher than that of MRSA from CAI patients (30.2%, 42/139) (P < 0.01). The total resistant rate of penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) was 26.7% (8/30), including a R% of 3.3% (1/30) and an I% of 23.3% (7/30). 331 strains of Enterococcus were isolated, including 178 strains from the study wards and 153 strains from other wards. The ratio of number of strains of E. faecalis to E. faecium was 6.8:1 (286/42). The rate of ampicillin resistant E. faecium (AREF) was 73.8% (31/42), significantly higher than the rate of ampicillin resistant E. faecalis (16.4%, 47/286). Neither strains of S. aureus nor strains of coagulase negative Staphylococcus were found resistant to vancomycin. No strains of Enterococcus were found resistant to vancomycin, the intermediate rates of E. faecalis and E. faecium to vancomycin were 3.5% (10/286) and 9.5% (4/42) respectively. All strains of Enterococcus were found 100% susceptible to teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: The resistance patterns of Gram-positive cocci including MRSA, PRSP, and AREF are similar to the results of the 1998 - 1999 surveillance. No strain of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, including VRSA and VISA or vancomycin resistant enterococcus, VRE is found in this study.
TI  - Linezolid resistance since 2001: SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials has demonstrated remarkable activity against gram-positive cocci. Linezolid has proven to be a first-line therapeutic option for vancomycin-resistant strains. Linezolid clinical trial results and subsequent published case reports cite rare resistance emerging in patients receiving prolonged therapy. OBJECTIVE: To report the initial linezolid-resistant organisms from cases obtained through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, after screening >40,000 gram-positive cocci without resistance between 1998 and 2000. METHODS: During 2001-2002, 8 resistant strains (from 8 different patients) located in 6 states from 7 different participating SENTRY institutions in the US were identified among bloodstream, respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infection isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus oralis. Resistance was detected by reference broth microdilution methods and confirmed by identical results using Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) and the standardized disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disk diffusion tests showed elevated MICs (> or =8 microg/mL) and small inhibitory zone diameters (< or =15 mm) for all strains to both linezolid and the investigational oxazolidinone AZD2563. Vancomycin resistance was detected in 2 of the 8 linezolid-resistant strains. All enterococci and the viridans-group streptococcus (S. oralis) strain showed resistance to erythromycin. E. faecium strains were resistant to penicillins, but susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Only 3 of the patients had previously received the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid resistance remains rare, with only 8 isolates among 9833 (0.08%) monitored isolates identified between January 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002. Resistance, however, was no longer limited to enterococci. Clinical laboratories should test linezolid more widely to detect emerging resistance, especially for patients receiving oxazolidinone therapy. Longitudinal surveillance programs are warranted to detect a trend in the development of resistance, determine the molecular mechanism of resistance, and recommend alternative therapies or epidemiologic interventions.
TI  - Treatment of life-threatening multiresistant staphylococcal and enterococcal infections in patients with end-stage renal failure with quinupristin/dalfopristin: preliminary report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Life-threatening infections with multiresistant gram-positive bacteria are increasing. Treatment with quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q-D) has turned out to be effective against such resistant pathogens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on treatment of six patients on dialysis (four with additional liver injury) and of one renal graft recipient with normal renal function who had severe infections caused by multiresistant Staphylococus epidermidis (1/7), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (4/7) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (2/7). RESULTS: Six out of seven patients were cured by therapy with Q-D in adjusted doses lasting for 10 to 34 days. Pharmacokinetics of Q-D and its metabolites were determined and remained within the therapeutic range, despite a modest increase of all compounds at the presumed steady state. The concentrations of the metabolites of Q-D were clearly lower than the parent drugs, including those of quinupristin-conjugated derivatives, which has not been reported previously. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that: a) neither quinupristin nor dalfopristin or its metabolites accumulated despite the long duration of treatment; b) no adjustment of the standard dosage regimen (three times 7.5 mg/kg/day) is necessary in end-stage renal disease.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against isolates from complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from  patients with complicated urinary tract infections (CUTIs) between 1988 and 2000. Imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting Gram-negative rods. Resistant strains (MIC>16 mg/l) were observed in Staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterococcus avium (8%), Serratia marcescens (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over the period. Resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. These results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - In vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and cefepime, alone and in combination with various antimicrobials, against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  - Use of combinations of antimicrobials that together achieve synergistic activities against targeted microorganisms is one potential strategy for overcoming bacterial resistance. As the incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci increases, the importance of devising additional synergistic drug combinations for these bacteria is magnified. We evaluated a number of antimicrobial combinations, with a focus on quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D), cefepime, and linezolid, using a previously described in vitro pharmacodynamic model. The combination of Q-D with either linezolid or vancomycin, as well as the combination of cefepime-vancomycin, resulted in enhanced killing (> or =2-log(10) increase in killing versus the most-active single agent) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 494. An improved effect (<2 log(10) kill increase in kill) against MRSA 494 was noted for cefepime plus either Q-D or linezolid, as well as linezolid-vancomycin. Similar relationships were observed for a methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolate (isolate 1199). Against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis R444, enhanced killing was achieved with the combination of cefepime-linezolid, while improvement was noted for vancomycin with either cefepime or linezolid. The combination of cefepime and vancomycin also achieved enhanced killing against a glycopeptide-intermediate-susceptible S. aureus isolate (isolate 992). The combination of linezolid and doxycycline achieved an enhanced effect against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VREFc) and E. faecium. Q-D plus ampicillin or linezolid resulted in similar enhancement of activity against the VREFc isolate. The results of this study suggest a number of novel antimicrobial combinations that may be useful against staphylococci and enterococci. Combination regimens including cefepime, Q-D, and/or linezolid warrant further investigation for the treatment of refractive infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Comparative activity of linezolid against staphylococci and enterococci isolated  in Italy.
AB  - The activity of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, was tested against 862 Gram-positive cocci isolated in Italy and compared with the activities of 12 antibiotics. Overall, MIC90s for linezolid (2-4 mg/L) indicated an in vitro activity comparable to that of vancomycin in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (4 mg/L), S. epidermidis (2 mg/L) and methicillin-susceptible strains. Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to linezolid (MIC90 2-4 mg/L), glycopeptides and beta-lactams. In E. faecium, only glycopeptides (MIC90 2 mg/L) and linezolid (MIC90 2 mg/L) were active. Linezolid was the only drug active against two strains of Enterococcus showing a VanA phenotype. Owing to its antibacterial profile, linezolid represents a promising drug for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - Clinical experience of quinupristin-dalfopristin for the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive infections.
AB  - Data regarding clinical administration, outcomes, and costs of quinupristin-dalfopristin treatment in 48 patients with serious gram-positive infections in a large teaching hospital were analyzed retrospectively. Thirty-six patients had vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) infections, 10 had methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) infections, and 2 were treated empirically Overall, 67% of the patients were clinically cured, and 56% had bacteriologic eradication; overall response rate was 48%. Patients with VREF bacteremia had the highest clinical cure (82%) and bacteriologic eradication (73%) rates. Mortality rate was 31%, but 6 of 15 patients who died were treated successfully with quinupristin-dalfopristin. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter among patients who lived versus those who died (p<0.05). Similarly, the mean hospital cost/patient was significantly lower in patients who lived than in those who died ($35,244 vs $122,922). Quinupristin-dalfopristin is effective in the treatment of both VREF and MRSA or MRSE infections in patients who fail to respond to, or are intolerant of, vancomycin.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant peritonitis associated with peritoneal dialysis: a cause for concern.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peritonitis resulting from peritoneal dialysis (PD) remains a serious cause of morbidity and even mortality among dialysis patients. AIM: To highlight the danger of antibiotic resistance in patients on dialysis who have received multiple courses of antibiotics. METHODS: Two cases are reported in which the patients developed peritonitis resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-drug resistance is a growing danger. It is imperative to use the most appropriate antibiotics in the proper dosage. If infections persist, early removal of the catheters is essential. The use of antibiotics in PD patients needs to be limited. Sensitivity patterns of the cultured organisms must be monitored regularly as the lack of vigilance may help accelerate the development of the so-called 'super bug' resistant to all antibiotics.
TI  - Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the new VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API Staph for staphylococci and the API 20 Strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of S. aureus, 96.5% of S. agalactiae, 96.9% of S. pneumoniae, 92.7% of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). More than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for S. aureus, from 90 to 100% for CNS, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - Typing and subtyping of 83 clinical isolates purified from surgically implanted silicone feeding tubes by random amplified polymorphic DNA amplification.
AB  - In this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices) were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. The tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. Classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus. Both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of Bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of Bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of Bacillus pumilus, 3 isolates of Enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of Enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of Enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates of Escherichia coli, 8 isolates of Lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Amplified DNA fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. A total of 62 distinct RAPD types were categorized from the five genera studied. Typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus in three patient pairs. Genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. tested by Etest.
AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 22 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecium strains, 23 Enterococcus avium strains, 27 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 22 Streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 Streptococcus agalactiae strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of everninomicin were determined by Etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline. The Etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (MIC, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. The antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against MRSA, with an MIC50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 0.5 microg/ml. Against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.
TI  - Clinical experience with linezolid in the treatment of resistant gram-positive infections.
AB  - This study presents our clinical experience with linezolid in 19 patients with serious resistant gram-positive infections enrolled as part of the compassionate study. In this prospective, non-randomized, noncomparative study, 19 patients were enrolled as part of the National Compassionate Study Protocol conducted by Pharmacia-Upjohn. At the time of this writing, these patients had not been published in the literature. All of the patients had to have documented evidence of serious gram-positive infections in normally sterile sites and should have been unable to tolerate available antimicrobial therapy or be unresponsive to available drugs. Clinical characteristics, laboratory values, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were obtained. Patients were followed both short-term and long-term after completion of therapy. Nineteen patients were enrolled: 13 females and 6 males. The average age was 63 years. The average length of therapy with linezolid was 22 days. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was treated in eight patients, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) in two patients, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) in eight patients, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in two patients. Co-infecting organisms include Enterococcus species colonization in six patients, Pseudomonas species in one patient, Serratia marcenens in one patient, and Candida albicans in one patient. Sterile sites that were infected included bone and joint (wounds and septic joints) in six patients, gastrointestinal system (hepatobiliary, liver abscess, Crohn's) in five patients, genitourinary (kidney and urine) in two patients, blood in five patients, respiratory in one patient, and aortic valve in 1 patient. Linezolid was given at 600 mg IV every 12 hours with a mean length of therapy of 22 days. Surgical drainage was used in combination with linezolid in 11 of the patients. Seventy nine percent of these patients achieved clinical and microbiologic cure, and none of the deaths reported in this series were related to the drug. Adverse events included skin rash in one patient, mild bone marrow suppression in two patients, and mild elevation in liver function tests in two patients. No life-threatening adverse events were noted. It appears that linezolid, along with surgical intervention (when necessary), appears to be an effective treatment option for resistant gram-positive infections. Long-term studies evaluating the possible resistance rates are necessary.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - Post-antibiotic growth suppression of linezolid against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro post-antibiotic effects (PAEs) of eight different concentrations of  linezolid against Gram-positive cocci were investigated and the results analysed using the sigmoid E(max) model for mathematically modelling the PAE. Mean maximal linezolid PAEs against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 2.2, 1.8, 2.8, 2.0 and 3.0 h, respectively. Resistance to methicillin (for the staphylococci), vancomycin (for the enterococci) and penicillin (for the pneumococci) had no effect on the duration of the PAE. Results of PAE testing support twice-daily dosing of linezolid in humans.
TI  - Resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  - We studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. No spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for Staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for Staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for Enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for Enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for Streptococcus pneumoniae). Population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. Assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. Stable S. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. The daptomycin MICs for these isolates were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. Many mutants with high MICs (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of S. aureus small colony variants. The voltage component (Delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. In vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. For other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. These results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.
TI  - In vitro activities of RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. In a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), RWJ-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)) of 2 microg/ml. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, RWJ-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an MIC(90) of 2 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was active against S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (RWJ-54428 MIC range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). RWJ-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). For ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), RWJ-54428 had an MIC(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. The potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; RWJ-54428 MICs ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. RWJ-54428 was more active than penicillin G and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). RWJ-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). This survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to RWJ-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
TI  - Determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  - There are many skin antiseptics commercially available. Although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. To date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. An 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems. Freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. A bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. Several micro-organisms were investigated: - Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant Ent. faecium (VRE), S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (PCMX, active compound of Dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. Results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained in suspension and glass-carrier tests. The bactericidal activity of the biocides depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. All biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against Ent. faecalis and VRE. The antibacterial activity of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. In the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of P. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). PCMX, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. Chlorhexidine tested against P. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. These results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.
TI  - Ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the World Health Organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated for a number of years. To assess the accuracy of data submitted to the World Health Organization by users of the WHONET software, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the United States, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing as part of the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. Most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as Enterobacter cloacae. Although only a small subset of laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing S. aureus ATCC 25923 and S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. The narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. Thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.
TI  - Evaluation of gemifloxacin (SB-265805, LB20304a): in vitro activity against over  6000 gram-positive pathogens from diverse geographic areas.
AB  - Gemifloxacin (GEMI), formerly SB-265805 and LB20304, is a newer fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum activity against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens. The present investigation extended earlier observations by sampling an additional 6790 gram-positive organisms from more than 50 medical centres on three continents. The reference broth microdilution method with recommended medium supplements was used throughout. Selected results (number strains tested; MIC90 for GEMI/trovafloxacin in mg/l; % < or = 1 mg/l for GEMI/trovafloxacin) were: Staphylococcus aureus (3672; 2/2; 86/85), S. epidermidis (404; 1/>4; 92/71), Enterococcus faecalis (630; 4/>4; 76/66), E. faecium (216; > 4/>4; 15/11), Streptococcus pneumoniae (300; 0.06/0.25; 100/97), beta-haemolytic streptococci (150; 0.06/0.25; 100/100) and viridans group streptococci (150; 0.12/0.25; 99/97). Gemifloxacin appeared equal or superior to trovafloxacin in its overall gram-positive spectrum of activity pending a choice of the susceptible breakpoint concentration. Continued in vitro, pharmacodynamic and clinical investigations of gemifloxacin appear warranted.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin against Staphylococci and Enterococci, including vancomycin- intermediate and -resistant strains.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was compared with those of vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin against a variety (n = 203) of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis (MRSA and MRSE, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA). Overall, daptomycin was more active against all organisms tested, except Enterococcus faecium and VISA, against which its activity was similar to that of quinupristin-dalfopristin. In time-kill studies with MRSA, MRSE, VRE, and VISA, daptomycin demonstrated greater bactericidal activity than all other drugs tested, killing > or =3 log CFU/ml by 8 h. Daptomycin may be a potential alternative drug therapy for multidrug-resistant gram-positive organisms and warrants further investigation.
TI  - Macrolide resistance genes in Enterococcus spp.
AB  - Seventy-eight isolates of different Enterococcus species (E. faecalis, n = 27; E. faecium, n = 23; E. durans, n = 8; E. avium, n = 6; E. hirae, n = 9; E. gallinarum, n = 3; and E. casseliflavus, n = 2) with a variety of erythromycin resistance phenotypes were examined for the presence of macrolide resistance genes (ermA, ermB, ermC, ermTR, mefA/E, and msrA). Positive PCR amplifications of ermB were obtained for 39 of 40 highly erythromycin-resistant Enterococcus isolates (MICs, >128 microg/ml) of different species; the remaining highly resistant E. faecium isolate was positive for PCR amplification of ermA but was negative for PCR amplification of the ermB and ermC genes. For all enterococcal strains for which erythromycin MICs were < or =32 microg/ml PCRs were negative for erm methylase genes. For all E. faecium isolates PCR amplified products of the expected size of 400 bp were obtained when msrA primers were used, with the results being independent of the erythromycin resistance phenotype. All the other enterococcal species gave negative results by msrA PCRs. Sequencing of the msrA PCR products from either erythromycin-susceptible, low-level-resistant, or highly resistant E. faecium strains showed that the amplicons did not correspond to the msrA gene described for Staphylococcus epidermidis but corresponded to a new putative efflux determinant, which showed 62% identity with the msrA gene at the DNA level and 72% similarity at the amino acid level. This new gene was named msrC.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of mefloquine and a series of related compounds.
AB  - Mefloquine was found to have bactericidal activity against methicillin- and fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and gentamicin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. The MICs were 16 microg/ml, and the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were 16 to 32 microg/ml. These concentrations cannot be achieved in serum. Mefloquine was active at a more achievable concentration against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with MICs of 0.2 to 1.5 microg/ml. Mefloquine was not active against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. In an attempt to find more active derivatives, 400 mefloquine-related compounds were selected from the chemical inventory of The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. We identified a series of compounds containing a piperidine methanol group attached to pyridine, quinoline, and benzylquinoline ring systems. These had activities similar to that of mefloquine against S. pneumoniae but were far more active against other gram-positive bacteria (MICs for staphylococci, 0.8 to 6.3 microg/ml). They had activities similar to that of amphotericin B against Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans. Combinations of the compounds with gentamicin and vancomycin were additive against staphylococci and pneumococci. The MIC and MBC of gentamicin were decreased by four- to eightfold when this drug was combined with limiting dilutions of the compounds. There was no antagonism with other antimicrobial drugs. The compounds were rapidly bactericidal. They appear to act by disrupting cell membranes. Combinations of the compounds with aminoglycoside antibiotics may have potential for therapeutic use.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in Gram-positive pathogens isolated in the UK from October 1996 to January 1997 and October 1997 to January 1998.
AB  - Rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 Teaching, nine Associate Teaching and nine District General hospitals) in the UK were compared. Combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in Teaching hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for Associate Teaching and District General hospitals rates fell (Associate Teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; District General 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). Using conventional methodology to determine MICs, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for Staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for Staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for Staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. For Streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). For Enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year 1, 15.1% year 2, P = 0.0388). For Enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin and rifampicin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide Gram-positive spectrum.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against Gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. We compared the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. The susceptibility of 37 Staphylococcus aureus (14 MS, 23 MR), 26 Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 MS, 10 MR), 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Group A Streptococcus pyogenes, 15 Streptococcus agalactiae, 10 Enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 Enterococcus faecium (9 van A) was evaluated. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all Gram-positive species tested, including met-R S. aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), met-R S. epidermidis (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), S. pneumoniae (MIC < or = 1 mg/l), ery-R and ery-S streptococci (MIC < or = 1 mg/l). The strains of E. faecalis were generally less susceptible. Time-kill studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x MIC concentration showed a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. A post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x MIC concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. A prolonged PAE was obtained for S. pneumoniae (8 h), S. pyogenes (9 h) and S. agalactiae (7 h), while the shortest PAE was seen for E. faecalis and E. faecium (about 4 h).
TI  - The in-vitro activity of HMR 3647, a new ketolide antimicrobial agent.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, was investigated in comparison with those of erythromycin A, roxithromycin, clarithromycin (14-membered ring macrolides), amoxycillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin against 719 recent clinical Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic isolates and type cultures. HMR 3647 generally demonstrated greater activity than the other compounds with MIC90s of < or =0.5 mg/L, except for Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC90 > 128 mg/L), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 = 2 mg/L), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 = 2 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 1 mg/L) and the anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 = 2 mg/L) and Clostridium difficile (MIC90 = 1 mg/L). In general, an increase in the size of the inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu on selected strains had little effect on the MICs of HMR 3647. Additionally, the in-vitro activity of HMR 3647 was not affected by the presence of either 20 or 70% (v/v) human serum. The antichlamydial activity of HMR 3647 was generally greater than that of commonly used antichlamydial antimicrobials.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in staphylococci and enterococci in 10 Portuguese hospitals in 1996 and 1997. POSGAR. Portuguese Study Group of Antimicrobial Resistance.
AB  - During a 2-year period, 10 Portuguese hospitals located throughout the country studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinically relevant staphylococci and enterococci. Of more than 12,000 Staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, two main patterns were found, methicillin-sensitive organisms most of them resistant only to penicillin but a few to other antimicrobials and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains (prevalence 48.2%) resistant to most of the antimicrobials tested and uniformly susceptible to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 71% of S. epidermidis (approximately 5,000 isolates tested) and 84% S. haemolyticus (approximately 1,000 isolates tested) were also resistant to methicillin as well as most other antimicrobials except vancomycin. Most of the 5,000 Enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin, in contrast to 650 E. faecium isolates, 70% of which were resistant to ampicillin and 20% to vancomycin and all other antibiotics. A high prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance occurred in both Enterococcus species. This survey showed that resistance profiles of staphylococci and enterococci hospital isolates have not changed in the last 5 years in Portugal, with the exception of the rise in vancomycin resistance in E. faecium. The high prevalence of methicillin resistance in S. aureus and in the CNS remains an issue of medical concern.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin tested against 1676 strains of ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-positive cocci isolated from patient infections in North and South America.
AB  - Gatifloxacin (formerly AM-115) is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum against Gram-positive cocci and some anaerobes. To assess this new agent's activity, a collection of 1,676 Gram-positive cocci were selected for resistance to ciprofloxacin (> or = 4 micrograms/mL) and tested against gatifloxacin and 18 other compounds by reference broth microdilution methods. The strains (approximately 23,000 total isolates from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program) were from significant blood stream, respiratory tract, wound, and urinary tract infections in patients in North (38 hospitals) and South (10 hospitals) America. Against Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, gatifloxacin inhibited only 16% and 10% of strains compared with 12% and 5% for recently released trovafloxacin, respectively. Among Staphylococcus aureus (90% oxacillin-resistant) strains, gatifloxacin was more active (67% susceptible at < or = 4 micrograms/mL) than trovafloxacin (59%) or sparfloxacin (4%). Gatifloxacin had a wider spectrum than trovafloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci especially S. epidermidis, 2% versus 58% resistance. The glycopeptides, chloramphenicol and rifampin were most active. Against all genus/species groups with more than 100 sample strains (1,566), high-level resistance to gatifloxacin and trovafloxacin (> 4 micrograms/mL) was not significantly different (41.7% versus 39.1%; p > 0.05). Emerging resistance to the fluoroquinolones remains a clinical problem among Gram-positive species, and gatifloxacin seems to be active in vitro against many of these contemporary strains isolated in the Americas.
TI  - Role of antimicrobial-impregnated polymer and Teflon in the prevention of biliary stent blockage.
AB  - Biliary stent blockage and microbial colonization is a common complication associated with polyurethane stents used for the relief of bile-duct obstruction caused by benign or malignant disease. In an attempt to overcome this problem the application of a 'Teflon' (polytetrafluoroethylene) stent and an antimicrobial benzalkonium chloride (BZC) impregnated polymer were investigated. The effects of these materials on microbial colonization were compared to a polyurethane stent in vitro in broth or bile. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of BZC for three commonly isolated biliary stent pathogens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterobacter cloacae were also determined. All the isolates were sensitive to BZC. The growth kinetics of the three organisms in broth and in human pooled bile were similar. Adherence to the BZC impregnated polymer was significantly reduced as compared to the polyurethane and Teflon stents (P < 0.05) in nutrient broth. In bile, fewer organisms attached to the Teflon as compared with the polyurethane stent (P < 0.05) for all organisms. For two of the three test organisms there was less bacterial adherence to the Teflon than to the BZC impregnated polymer. The Teflon and antimicrobial stent materials studied may prevent biliary stent blockage resulting from microbial colonization.
TI  - Detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16S rRNA gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. The use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. One hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (n = 2), Streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), Streptococcus mitis (n = 3), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), Micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). Eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected bacterial DNA in nine of 11 blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for PCR; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the conventional identification of the cultured isolates. Bacterial DNA was detected in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures, 18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. The species presumptively identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing were as follows: Pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), Acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); Escherichia spp. (n = 3); Moraxella spp. (n = 3); Staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); Neisseria spp. (n = 1); and Bacillus spp. (n = 1). The results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.
TI  - The influence of bile on antimicrobial activity in vitro.
AB  
TI  - Evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
AB  - This report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in Q/D worldwide Phase III comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. Q/D was highly active, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) < or = 1.0 microg/mL against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. Q/D was active (MICs < or = 1 microg/mL) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. Q/D was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant S. aureus strains (MIC90=1 microg/mL), as was vancomycin (MIC90=2 microg/mL), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (MIC90=32 vs 1 microg/mL). Given its spectrum of activity, Q/D may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities and postantibiotic effects of the oxazolidinone compounds eperezolid (PNU-100592) and linezolid (PNU-100766) versus vancomycin against Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - The activities of the oxazolidinone antibacterial agents eperezolid (PNU-100592)  and linezolid (PNU-100766) were compared with that of vancomycin against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 200), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 100), and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (n = 50). Eperezolid and linezolid demonstrated good in vitro inhibitory activity, regardless of methicillin susceptibility for staphylococci (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90] range, 1 to 4 microg/ml) or vancomycin susceptibility for enterococci (MIC90 range, 1 to 4 microg/ml). In time-kill studies, eperezolid and linezolid were bacteriostatic in action. A postantibiotic effect of 0.8+/-0.5 h was demonstrated for both eperezolid and linezolid against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and E. faecium.
TI  - In-vitro selection of resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin in Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis compared with Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were studied for their ability to develop resistance by two selection methods, one in broth and one on agar. The MICs for enterococci after exposure to vancomycin ranged from 0.5 mg/L to 4 mg/L, and those after exposure to teicoplanin ranged from 0.25 mg/L to 1 mg/L. No significant increases occurred for E. faecalis, whilst two isolates of E. faecium showed increases of up to eight-fold (from 0.125 mg/L to 1 mg/L). Vancomycin MICs ranged from 1 mg/L to 4 mg/L and teicoplanin MICs reached 32 mg/L for S. epidermidis. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of SmaI-digested whole chromosomal DNA was performed to compare the genomic DNA of glycopeptide-exposed and wild-type strains. In-vitro exposure to vancomycin did not alter MICs significantly except in one S. epidermidis isolate for which the MIC reached 4 mg/L, whereas the teicoplanin-exposed cultures of S. epidermidis showed increases of up to 64 times the original MIC. Comparable results were achieved with the two selection methods.
TI  - [Comparative antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  - RP 59,500 (Quinupristin-Dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. The components of RP 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). Susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci. RP 59,500 was active against a wide range of Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. RP 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus agalactiae and Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium strains which are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. No cross-resistance was observed between RP 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. The effect of human serum on the MIC of RP 59,500 was studied with strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The presence of 20% (V/V) serum had little or no effect on the MIC, although 50% (V/V) serum increased MICs by 4-8 folds. Laboratory-induced resistance to RP 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. Population analysis was performed on RP 59,500 and the reference macrolides against S. aureus ATCC 25,923 strain. Although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with EM, CAM, AZM and RXM, no RP 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - The lantibiotic mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan biosynthesis at the level of transglycosylation.
AB  - The lantibiotic mersacidin has been previously reported to interfere with bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis, [Brotz, H., Bierbaum, G., Markus, A., Molitor, E. & Sahl, H.-G. (1995) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39, 714-719]. Here, we focus on the target reaction and describe a mersacidin-induced accumulation of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide, indicating that inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis occurs after the formation of cytoplasmic precursors. In vitro studies involving a wall-membrane particulate fraction of Bacillus megaterium KM demonstrated that mersacidin did not prevent the synthesis of lipid II [undecaprenyl-diphosphoryl-N-acetylmuramoyl-(pentapeptide)-N-ac ety lglucosamine] but specifically the subsequent conversion of this intermediate into polymeric nascent glycan strands by transglycosylation. Comparison with other inhibitors of transglycosylation shows that the effective concentration of mersacidin in vitro is in the range of that of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin but 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the competitive enzyme inhibitor moenomycin. The analogy to the glycopeptides may hint at an interaction of mersacidin with the peptidoglycan precursor rather than with the enzyme. Unlike vancomycin however, mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan formation from UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide and is active against Enterococcus faecium expressing the vanA resistance gene cluster. This indicates that the molecular target site of mersacidin differs from that of vancomycin and that no cross-resistance exists between the two antibiotics.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new water-soluble streptogramin antimicrobial agent comprising quinupristin and dalfopristin in a ratio of 30:70. The in-vitro spectrum of activity includes most multi-resistant Gram-positive aerobes, important Gram-negative aerobes, Gram-positive anaerobes and intracellular bacteria that are causal agents of respiratory, blood and cutaneous infections. Of particular note, quinupristin/dalfopristin is active against multidrug-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium, and against penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The combination is also active against staphylococci showing both constitutive and inducible erythromycin resistance. Bactericidal activity and a prolonged post-antibiotic effect have also been noted for quinupristin/dalfopristin against Gram-positive cocci. Gram-negative bacteria susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin include Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella spp. and Mycoplasma spp. Overall, the spectrum of antibacterial activity indicates a potential role for this combination in the treatment of difficult-to-treat Gram-positive infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Since this activity extends to Gram-negative respiratory bacteria, quinupristin/dalfopristin may also find a role in the treatment of atypical, as well as typical, pneumonia.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. Rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to RP 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. In studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and RP 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference MIC and MBC tests. No significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/RP 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and Streptococcus ssp. Enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but E. faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Pediococcus ssp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The log phase inoculum was preferred for MBC and kill-curve tests with this combination. The 30:70 ratio in vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. Quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant Gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.
TI  - In-vitro pharmacodynamic studies of piperacillin/tazobactam with gentamicin and ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Six isolates each of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus  epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter spp., Serratia spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. (total 60 strains) were studied against the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam plus gentamicin or ciprofloxacin at physiological concentrations by the microtitre chequerboard method incorporating simultaneous time-kill curves. Tazobactam was fixed at 4 mg/L. Gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam was a synergic combination against 28 strains at 2 h, 51 at 5 h and 54 at 24 h as assessed by time-kill curves and synergic or additive (FBC index < or = 1) against all 60 strains at 24 h by chequerboards. The corresponding figures for ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam were seven, 26, 52 and 58 respectively. Antagonism (FBC index > or = 4) was demonstrated for one strain to each combination at 24 h. There were no significant differences between FIC indices and FBC indices for each antibiotic combination. Gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 47 strains by 2 h, 56 by 5 h and 59 by 24 h. Ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 22 strains by 2 h, 36 by 5 h and 56 by 24 h. In conclusion both antibiotic combinations at physiological concentrations were synergic or additive at 24 h for the majority of strains tested although notably gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave faster kill. Antagonism was rarely seen. Both combinations are likely to prove beneficial for treatment of serious infections.
TI  - Semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from LY264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic LY264826 with N-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. Six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. For Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, the MICs of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for LY264826. For E. faecium and E. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the MICs were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. The compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. The MICs for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. Against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis MICs ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. The spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. The compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with MICs of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. In in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. Overall, these new glycopeptides, such as LY307599 and LY333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
TI  - In vivo activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The Upjohn oxazolidinones, U-100592 and U-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. In several mouse models of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, U-100592 and U-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ED50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ED50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. Similarly, both compounds were active versus a Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. U-100592 and U-100766 effectively cured an Enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ED50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. Both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with ED50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. In soft tissue infection models with S. aureus and E. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. U-100766 was also very active versus the Bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ED50 = 46.3 mg/kg). In combination-therapy studies, both U-100592 and U-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic S. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic S. aureus-Escherichia coli infection. U-100592 and U-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.
TI  - [Multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  Portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  - In 1994, Microbiology Laboratories of ten Portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. From 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were Staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples significant numbers of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. were isolated. Escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A great variation in resistance values of P. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. Resistance to methicillin in S. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an average of 47%, and it was even higher with S. epidermidis (c.3000) and S. haemolyticus (c.650). Only vancomycin was always active against these strains. In E. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. E. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. Vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  - Oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. U-100592 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and U-100766 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. MICs were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective MICs of U-100592 and U-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; Moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; Listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and Bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. Most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. Enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (VanA, VanB, and VanC resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and M. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. The presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. Time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. The spontaneous mutation frequencies of S. aureus ATCC 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for U-100592 and U-100766, respectively. Serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. Thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to glycopeptides comparison of 3  test methods.
AB  - The significance of grampositive bacteria, especially staphylococci and enterococci, as nosocomial pathogens has increased in the last decade. Furthermore, resistance to commonly used antibiotics like beta-lactams has also become more common and even resistance to glycopeptides has been observed. We evaluated the susceptibility of 150 staphylococcal clinical isolates (52 S. epidermidis, 52 S. haemolyticus, 10 S. saprophyticus, 10 S. hominis, 4 S. warneri, 4 S. simulans, 4 S. capitis and 14 S. aureus) and of 50 enterococci (49 E. faecalis, 1 E. faecium) to the glycopeptides, vancomycin and teicoplanin. The data from the agar dilution test used as reference method were compared with the results from the E test and the agar disk diffusion test. Concerning vancomycin, no resistance among all the staphylococcal isolates was observed whereas one single enterococcal strain (E. faecium) proved to be resistant. The overall resistance of staphylococcal isolates against teicoplanin was about 10.7% (15 S. haemolyticus, 1 S. epidermidis) being mainly due to the high proportion of S. haemolyticus strains (52 out of 150) among the staphylococcal isolates. Teicoplanin resistance among the enterococci was not detected. For vancomycin, a very close correlation between the MICs from the agar dilution test and the E test was noticed. As concerns teicoplanin, the MICs from the E-test were usually somewhat lower than those obtained by the agar dilution test. No correlation was found between the MICs of resistant and intermediate staphylococcal strains and the results from the teicoplanin agar disk diffusion test. For routine teicoplanin susceptibility testing of staphylococci, the determination of the MIC (e.g., by the E test) is much more reliable for detecting resistant strains than the agar disk diffusion test.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. CS-940 activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of MICs inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (MIC90S) of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90S, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml). CS-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. CS-940 was also very active against Streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which MIC90S were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for Enterococcus faecium, however, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. CS-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. This compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.
TI  - In vitro activity of the semisynthetic glycopeptide amide MDL 63,246.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the semisynthetic glycopeptide amide MDL 63,246 against  293 U.S. clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci was determined by the broth microdilution method. When compared with teicoplanin, MDL 63,246 had improved activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis (MICs that inhibited 90% strains tested [MIC90s], 0.25 versus 8 micrograms/ml, respectively). Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90s, 1 versus 32 micrograms/ml, respectively), and VanA Enterococcus faecium (MIC90s, 32 versus > or = 1,024 micrograms/ml, respectively).
TI  - [The present and future problems of resistance in staphylococci, streptococci and M. tuberculosis].
AB  - Mechanisms of resistance of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Neisseria meningitidis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics are presented and discussed. The resistance to methicillin-oxacillin in S. aureus and S. epidermidis is chromosomally-mediated by sequence of DNA, namely by gene mecA. This gene codes altered PBP-2A protein. Strains of S.pneumoniae contain PBP-1A, PBP-2B and PBP-2X proteins. They cause resistance to many beta-lactam antibiotics. Resistance to vankomycin, respectively to teikoplanin in strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium is coded by transferable vanA and vanB genes. Strains of N. meningitidis produce mostly the altered PBP-2 protein. The increase of resistance in strains of M. tuberculosis is also significant.
TI  - Everninomicin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic: its antimicrobial activity, post-antibiotic effect and synergistic bactericidal activity.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin (SCH) 27899) in comparison with two glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) and six beta-lactam agents was evaluated against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria. Everninomicin showed the highest activity against the species tested and MICs90% of everninomicin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium difficile were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs90% of everninomicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 0.78 microgram/ml. Laboratory induced resistance to everninomicin in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis occurred in a stepwise manner and at a very slow rate. Post-antibiotic effect against strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis were 1.8 and 2.6 h, respectively, and a little longer than that of vancomycin. Adherence to glass surface of an MRSA strain was strongly repressed by the addition of sub MIC of everninomicin in combination with fosfomycin.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - [Method of DNA extraction and mecA, femA and PBP2' in multi-drug resistant bacterial strains].
AB  - Recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. At first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of DNA extraction. N-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract DNA from E. faecalis, E. faecium and S. aureus, respectively. After achromopeptidase extraction, the mecA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in clinically isolated MRSA (95 strains), MSSA (66), MRSE (methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 37), MSSE (methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis, 1), S haemolyticus(5), S.hominis(1) and others (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus, total 45). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The positive rates were 95% (MRSA), 1.5% (MSSA), and 97% (MRSE). The mecA gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant S.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive S.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.hominis. The mecA gene was not detected in 45 non-Staphylococcal strains. MecA and femA gene by PCR and PBP 2' by IRMA were further detected in newly isolated MRSA (20 strains), MSSA(20), MRSE(14), MSSE(1) and S.simulans(2). Complete correlation between MPIPC susceptibility and mecA were found. The femA gene was positive in 39/40 of S. aureus, and 0/14 of S.epidermidis, 2/3 of S.simulans. PBP2' were positive in 20/20 of MRSA, 0/20 of MSSA, 14/14 of MRSE, 0/1 of MSSE, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive S.simulans. In conclusion, diagnoses of MRSA by simultaneous detection of mecA and femA gene as well as PBP2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.
TI  - [Determination of the susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to plycopeptides by the E-test method].
AB  - E-test was evaluated by comparison with the reference agar dilution method on 15  enterococci and 15 staphylococci with variable resistance to glycopeptides and isolated from clinical samples: 15 enterococci with 3 glycopeptide-resistant (2 E. facalis and 1 E. faecium), 1 glycopeptide intermediate E. gallinarum and 11 glycopeptide-sensible E. faecalis; 15 staphylococci with 4 teicoplanine-resistant (1 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 2 S. hominis), 3 teicoplanin-intermediate (1 S. epidermidis, 2 S. haemolyticus) and 8 teicoplanin sensible strains (6 S. aureus, 1 S. epidermidis and 1 S. hominis). Repeatability (10 determinations by strain) and exactitude were tested for all strains. Our data shows very good results for repeatability and exactitude with the reference method except in the case of coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanin. Some technical problems appear in our experience: for staphylococci, a 48 h incubation is necessary to detect teicoplanin-intermediate strains but 24 h is sufficient for enterococci. E-test is expensive, require a strict methodology, but is a good method to detect glycopeptide resistance for staphylococci and enterococci except for coagulase negative staphylococci and teicoplanine.
TI  - [Chlorhexidine digluconate/chlorocresol combination. In vitro study of interactions observed against potential cutaneous strains].
AB  - The interaction type of chlorhexidine digluconate/chlorocresol association (foaming solution DC 102/1, Laboratoires Pierre Fabre Medicament) have been studied according to the chess-board method, on microplate, by determining MBC (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) (or MFC (Minimal Fungicidal Concentrations)) adjusted to T 72-150 AFNOR norm (dilution-neutralization, contact 5 mn) and computation of FBC (or FFC) Index. Trials were carried out against 18 hospital strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, Candida albicans) and against 4 strains of the AF-NOR norm. MBC of chlorhexidine, against Staphylococci were included between 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, and between 25 and 200 micrograms/ml against the others strains. MBC of chlorocresol were included between 800 and 3,200 micrograms/ml. Against the 22 tested strains, 18 synergistic interactions (FBC Index < or = 0.75) were observed, with 4 to 8 reducing factor for chlorhexidine, and > or = 2 for chlorocresol. No antagonism was noted (maximal FBC Index = 1).
TI  - Anaerobic facultative bacteria isolated from the gut of rabbits fed different diets.
AB  - Anaerobic facultative bacteria colonizing the intestinal tract of conventional rabbits fed three different diets (standard pellet, hay and pellet/hay mixture) were enumerated in brain heart infusion agar. Colony counts recovered from homogenized samples of small intestine, caecum and rectum differed with reference to the diet given. Among anaerobic groups, identified from rabbit fed pellet/hay mixture, Enterococci (E. faecalis, E. avium, E. faecium and E. durans) represented the predominant flora. Enterobacters (E. cloacae and E. aerogenes) accounted for about 10 to 25% of the bacteria in the rectum and colon respectively, whereas Staphylococci (S. intermedius, S. epidermidis and S. lentus) represented 11% of the bacteria isolated from colon.
TI  - The activity of metal compounds against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of two metal compounds, JM-1397 (OsO2[xylyl]2) and JM-2469 (AuCl[S2CPEt3]). Both inhibited methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at concentrations of 0.5-2 micrograms/ml, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) of 1 microgram/ml for JM-1397 and 0.5 microgram/ml for JM-2469. Similar concentrations inhibited methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus). JM-2469 inhibited group A, B, C, F, and G beta-hemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci at 1-8 micrograms/ml (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) but Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml. JM-1397 had MICs for these organisms of greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides, and Clostridium species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.12-4 micrograms/ml (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). MICs of both compounds for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. were greater than 64 micrograms/ml. These studies show that osmium and gold compounds have potential as topical agents against Gram-positive and anaerobic species.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef and cefazolin in combination with vancomycin.
AB  - 207 clinical isolates from strains of patients from the University Children's Hospital of Kiel were investigated for their in vitro activity with the agar dilution method against flomoxef and cefazolin (alone and partially in combination with vancomycin). Staphylococci were also tested with other cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, cefotetan and latamoxef). Flomoxef and cefazolin always acted more vigorously on staphylococci than the other cephalosporins. Resistance of Staphylococcus aureus strains against flomoxef and cefazolin did not occur but was found in 15 and 5 of 98 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, respectively. Enterococcus faecalis strains were always resistant against both drugs; Streptococcus faecium strains were only moderately sensitive. Combined testing of flomoxef or cefazolin with vancomycin showed synergism in almost all staphylococcal strains. Synergism was stronger when S. epidermidis strains were only weakly sensitive to or resistant against flomoxef and cefazolin in comparison to highly sensitive strains. Flomoxef (or cefazolin) acted synergistically in combination with vancomycin on E. faecalis and S. faecium with the exception of two strains of E. faecalis which showed an additive effect of both drugs.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin) against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY146032 was compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against gram-positive cocci. MICs of LY146032 were lowest for Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (0.25 mg/l). For methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus the MICs were 1 mg/l, for Enterococcus faecalis 2 mg/l and for Enterococcus faecium 4 mg/l. The activity of LY146032 was in general higher than that of vancomycin. Time-kill studies showed LY146032 had higher bactericidal activity than vancomycin against a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain, and bactericidal activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - Drug resistance in Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus faecium and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from laboratory animals.
AB  - A total of 1,278 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 688 of Str. faecium and 796 of Staphylococcus epidermidis were collected from laboratory animals of 20 colonies in 1980, and tested for their resistance to 20 drugs. Thirteen percent of Str. faecalis, 12% of Str. faecium and 25% of Staph. epidermidis were drug resistant. Multiple drug resistant organisms were frequently detected in laboratory animal colonies where antibiotic treatment had been undertaken. TC-resistant streptococci and EM-resistant Staph. epidermidis were distributed in about half of the colonies regardless of the history of antibiotic usage.
TI  - Drug resistance of organisms isolated from feces of laboratory mice and rats.
AB  - A total of 248 strains of EScherichia coli, 132 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 137 of Streptococcus faecalis and 89 of STr. faecium were collected from feces of 40 mice and 36 rats of 8 colonies in 1978, and drug resistance were examined by an agar dieution method using 23 antibiotics. The results indicated a positive relation between use of antibiotics and appearance of multiple drug resistant organisms.
