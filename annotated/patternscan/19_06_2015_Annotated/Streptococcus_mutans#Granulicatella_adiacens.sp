TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of children and adolescents receiving orthodontic treatment.
AB  == purpose: this case-controlled study examined clinical and microbiological parameters in brazilian children and adolescents receiving orthodontic treatment  using fixed orthodontic appliances or removable orthodontic appliances. methods:  the plaque index, gingival index, number of decayed, missing and filled teeth, and probing pocket depth was measured on each fully erupted tooth in 30 patients  treated with fixed orthodontic appliances and an equal number of age and sex-matched control subjects. the same parameters were also measured in 18 patients treated with removable orthodontic appliances and an equal number of age and sex-matched control subjects. in the patients treated with fixed orthodontic  appliances, subgingival plaque samples were collected from four teeth with orthodontic brackets and from four teeth with orthodontic bands. in the patients  with removable appliances, subgingival plaque samples were collected from clasped maxillary permanent first molar teeth and from four unclasped permanent teeth. samples of unstimulated whole saliva and samples from the dorsal surface of the tongue were also obtained from each subject. each sample was analyzed for the presence of 19 target bacteria by dot blot. a subset of samples was examined by direct amplification of bacterial nucleic acids. results: compared to their respective age and sex-matched controls, whole mouth means for plaque index and gingival index were significantly elevated in both the fixed and removable orthodontic groups. there was no difference in the dmft. subjects with fixed orthodontic appliances had a higher prevalence of each of the target species except for l. fermentum, neisseriaceae and s. mutans. the prevalence of a. naeslundii and streptococcus sp. was significantly higher on teeth with orthodontic brackets alone compared to teeth with both orthodontic bands and brackets. subjects with removable orthodontic appliances had a higher prevalence  of a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, l. fermentum, neisseriaceae, and spirochetes. the prevalence of neisseriaceae was significantly higher on unclasped teeth compared to clasped teeth. there was no difference between sample sites for the target bacteria except for a. actinomycetemcomitans  that was detected less frequently in saliva. orthodontic patients demonstrated higher proportions of gram negative species by direct amplification of nucleic acids including species frequently associated with periodontal disease as well as rarely cultivable or non-cultivable species such as abiotrophia defectiva, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, lautropia sp., terrahaemophilus aromaticivorans, and tm7 bacterium.
