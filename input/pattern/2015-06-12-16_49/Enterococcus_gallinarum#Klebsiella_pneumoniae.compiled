TI  - Analysis of bacterial diversity during the fermentation of inyu, a high-temperature fermented soy sauce, using nested PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and the plate count method.
AB  - The diversity of bacteria associated with the fermentation of inyu, also known as black soy sauce, was studied through the nested PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of samples collected from the fermentation stages of the inyu production process. The DGGE profiles targeted the bacterial 16S rDNA and revealed the presence of Citrobacter farmeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pantoea agglomerans, Salmonella enterica, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus sciuri and Weissella confusa. The bacterial compositions of 4 fermented samples were further elucidated using the plate count method. The bacteria isolated from the koji-making stage exhibited the highest diversity; Brachybacterium rhamnosum, E. hormaechei, K. pneumoniae, Kurthia gibsonii, Pantoea dispersa, Staphylococcus gallinarum, Staphylococcus kloosii and S. sciuri were identified. Koji collected during the preincubation stage presented the largest cell counts, and E. hormaechei, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and Enterobacter pulveris were identified. In brine samples aged for 7 and 31 days, the majority of the bacteria isolated belonged to 4 Bacillus species, but 4 Staphylococcus species and Delftia tsuruhatensis were also detected. This study demonstrates the benefits of using a combined approach to obtain a more complete picture of microbial populations and provides useful information for the control or development of bacterial flora during inyu fermentation.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - The selective inhibition of nitric oxide production in the avian macrophage cell  line HD11.
AB  - The production of reactive nitrogen, nitric oxide (NO), has previously been demonstrated to be a major mechanism by which the innate immune system defends against microbial invasion. The induction of many antimicrobial mechanisms is regulated by numerous components during the transduction of the signal from the cell surface to the cell nucleus where response genes are upregulated. Toll-like cell surface receptor activation often leads to sequential modulation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK), mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK), degradation of I kappa B (IkappaB) regulatory molecules which, in turn, release the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) family proteins for translocation into the nucleus and subsequent gene transcription. The purpose of this study was to investigate components of the upstream signal transduction pathway induced by bacterial and viral-like stimulation of NO for antimicrobial defense by the transformed chicken macrophage cell line, HD11. We quantified the production of nitrite by chicken macrophages after exposure to selective pharmacological inhibitors of specific signal transduction components prior to stimulation by polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), formalin-fixed Enterococcus gallinarum (EG) or formalin-fixed Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP). We found that NO production induced by dsRNA or bacteria was reduced in a dose dependent manner by specific inhibitors of PTK, p38 MAPK, IkappaB, and NF-kappaB. Inhibition efficacy varied dependent on stimulation by bacterial or viral-like ligands. In general, NO production induced by bacterial stimulation was most effectively reduced by inhibition of p38 MAPK and least effectively reduced by inhibition of IkappaB. NF-kappaB and IkappaB inhibition affected NO production induced by dsRNA more than that induced by bacterial stimulation.
