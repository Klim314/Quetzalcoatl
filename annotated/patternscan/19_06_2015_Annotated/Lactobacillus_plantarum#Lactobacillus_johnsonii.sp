TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == the antimicrobial effects of selenium nanoparticle-enriched probiotics and their  fermented broth against candida albicans.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria are considered important probiotics for prevention of some infections. the aim of this work was to investigate the effect of selenium dioxide on the antifungal activity of lactobacillus plantarum and l.  johnsonii against candida albicans. methods: lactobacillus plantarum and l. johnsonii cells, grown in the presence and absence of selenium dioxide, and their cell-free spent culture media were tested for antifungal activity against c. albicans atcc 14053 by a hole-plate diffusion method and a time-kill assay. results: both l. plantarum and l. johnsonii reduced selenium dioxide to cell-associated elemental selenium nanoparticles. the cell-free spent culture media, from both lactobacillus species that had been grown with selenium dioxide  for 48 h, showed enhanced antifungal activity against c. albicans. enhanced antifungal activity of cell biomass against c. albicans was also observed in cultures grown with selenium dioxide. conclusions: selenium dioxide-treated lactobacillus spp. or their cell-free spent broth inhibited the growth of c. albicans and should be investigated for possible use in anti-candida probiotic formulations in future.

TI  == probiotic screening and safety evaluation of lactobacillus strains from plants, artisanal goat cheese, human stools, and breast milk.
AB  == the aim of this study was to select autochthonous strains of lactobacillus from stools of healthy infants and adults, human milk, artisanal goat cheese, and fruits and vegetables according to their probiotic properties and safety. from 421 strains of lactobacillus isolated, 102 (24.2%) were shown to be tolerant to gastric ph and bile salts; they were used to determine their anti-helicobacter pylori (agar diffusion assay), antioxidant (oxygen radical absorption capacity),  and anti-inflammatory (inhibition of interleukin-8 release by tumor necrosis factor-alpha-stimulated ht-29 cells) activities as well as their ability to adhere to intestinal (caco-2) and gastric (ags) epithelial cells. results obtained were compared with three commercial probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum 299v, and l. johnsonii ncc533. the five strains most efficient according to these activities were subsequently identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene, their susceptibility to antibiotics was determined, and their safety evaluated in mice. one strain of l. plantarum was discarded due to the higher prevalence of liver bacterial translocation observed in the animals fed this strain. in conclusion, four autochthonous strains of l. rhamnosus were finally selected with probiotic properties and safety allowing their eventual use in human studies. these results contribute to increase the diversity of probiotic strains available for the development of nutraceuticals and functional foods.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == persistence of orally administered lactobacillus strains in the gut of infant mice.
AB  == the present study tested the persistence of orally administered bacteria in the gut of suckling mice. we used three bacterial strains: one strain of lactobacillus johnsonii (designated strain ms1) that was previously isolated from the mouse stomach, and two strains of l. plantarum, (strain no. 14 and jcm 1149(t)). we detected l. johnsonii ms1, but neither strain of l. plantarum, in the gut 7 days after administration when the organisms were administered on days  0, 1, 3 or 7 of neonatal life. none of the strains was detected in the gut 7 days after the administration on days 14 or 28 of neonatal life. l. johnsonii ms1 and  l. plantarum jcm 1149(t) exhibited similar levels of in vitro association with gut tissues, with both strains showing association that was significantly higher  than that of l. plantarum no. 14. in a separate experiment, the number of total bacteria and lactobacilli in the gut, as estimated by real-time quantitative pcr, was significantly higher in 14- and 21-day-old mice than in 0- and 7-day-old mice. in addition, the number of total bacteria was higher in 21-day-old mice than in 14-day-old mice, and the number of lactobacilli was higher in 7-day-old mice than in 0-day-old mice. these results suggest that gut persistence of administered bacteria in infant mice is species- or strain-specific and is affected by the development of indigenous microbiota. in addition, gut persistence of administered bacteria may not always depend on the tissue association capacity.

TI  == group-specific comparison of four lactobacilli isolated from human sources using  differential blast analysis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been used in fermentation processes for centuries. more recent applications including the use of lab as probiotics have significantly increased industrial interest. here we present a comparative genomic analysis of four completely sequenced lactobacillus strains, isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract, versus 25 lactic acid bacterial genomes present in the public database at the time of analysis. lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus johnsonii ncc533, lactobacillus gasseri atcc33323, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1are all considered probiotic and widely used in industrial applications. using differential blast analysis (dba), each genome was compared to the respective remaining three other lactobacillus and 25 other lab genomes. dba highlighted strain-specific genes that were not represented in any other lab used in this analysis and also identified group-specific genes shared within lactobacilli. initial comparative analyses highlighted a significant number of genes involved in cell adhesion, stress responses, dna repair and modification, and metabolic capabilities. furthermore, the range of the recently  identified potential autonomous units (paus) was broadened significantly, indicating the possibility of distinct families within this genetic element. based on in silico results obtained for the model organism l. acidophilus ncfm, dba proved to be a valuable tool to identify new key genetic regions for functional genomics and also suggested re-classification of previously annotated  genes.

TI  == an in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  == a method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. the novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic lactobacillus strains. only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. the application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic lactobacillus strains  belonging to lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus vaginalis species. even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up  makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == diversity of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. these species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.

TI  == functional and probiotic attributes of an indigenous isolate of lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == background: probiotic microorganisms favorably alter the intestinal microflora balance, promote intestinal integrity and mobility, inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria and increase resistance to infection. probiotics are increasingly used in nutraceuticals, functional foods or in microbial interference treatment. however, the effectiveness of probiotic organism is considered to be population-specific due to variation in gut microflora, food habits and specific  host-microbial interactions. most of the probiotic strains available in the market are of western or european origin, and a strong need for exploring new indigenous probiotic organisms is felt. methods and findings: an indigenous isolate lp9 identified as lactobacillus plantarum by molecular-typing methods was studied extensively for its functional and probiotic attributes, viz., acid and bile salt tolerance, cell surface hydrophobicity, autoaggregation and caco-2 cell-binding as well as antibacterial and antioxidative activities. lp9 isolate could survive 2 h incubation at ph 1.5-2.0 and toxicity of 1.5-2.0% oxgall bile.  lp9 could deconjugate major bile salts like glycocholate and deoxytaurocholate, indicating its potential to cause hypocholesterolemia. the isolate exhibited cell-surface hydrophobicity of approximately 37% and autoaggregation of approximately 31%. presence of putative probiotic marker genes like mucus-binding protein (mub), fibronectin-binding protein (fbp) and bile salt hydrolase (bsh) were confirmed by pcr. presence of these genes suggested the possibility of specific interaction and colonization potential of lp9 isolate in the gut, which  was also suggested by a good adhesion ratio of 7.4+/-1.3% with caco-2 cell line.  the isolate demonstrated higher free radical scavenging activity than standard probiotics l. johnsonii la1 and l. acidophilus la7. lp9 also exhibited antibacterial activity against e. coli, l. monocytogenes, s. typhi, s. aureus and b. cereus. conclusion: the indigenous lactobacillus plantarum lp9 exhibited high  resistance against low ph and bile and possessed antibacterial, antioxidative and cholesterol lowering properties with a potential for exploitation in the development of indigenous functional food or nutraceuticals.

TI  == peptidoglycan from lactobacilli inhibits interleukin-12 production by macrophages induced by lactobacillus casei through toll-like receptor 2-dependent and independent mechanisms.
AB  == we previously showed that lactobacillus strains having a rigid cell wall resistant to intracellular digestion can stimulate macrophages to induce large a  quantity of interleukin-12 (il-12). in this study, we examined the influence of lactobacilli and bacterial cell wall components on il-12 production by macrophages that was induced by lactobacillus casei, which has a rigid cell wall. easily digestible lactobacilli such as lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus  plantarum or their intact cell walls (icws) weakly or very weakly induced il-12 production by macrophages, and inhibitedl. casei-induced il-12 production. while  the icw of l. casei was resistant to intracellular digestion and did not inhibit  l. casei-induced il-12 production, its polysaccharide-depleted icw, i.e. intact peptidoglycan, was sensitive to intracellular digestion and inhibited l. casei-induced il-12 production. furthermore, the peptidoglycans of l. johnsonii,  l. plantarum and staphylococcus aureus also inhibited l. casei-induced il-12 production. peptidoglycans from lactobacilli suppressed l. casei-induced expression of il-12p40 but not il-12p35 mrna. inhibition of il-12 production by peptidoglycan was mitigated in toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2)-deficient macrophages  compared with the inhibition in wild-type macrophages. a derivative of the minimal structural unit of peptidoglycan (6-o-stearoyl-muramyl dipeptide) recognized by nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (nod2) could also suppress l. casei-induced il-12 production. these findings demonstrate that easily digestible bacteria and peptidoglycan suppress il-12 production through pattern recognition receptors such as tlr2 and nod2. il-12 production in the gut  may be negatively regulated by the simultaneous inhibitory actions of various resident bacteria that are susceptible to intracellular digestion.

TI  == adhesion of the probiotic strains enterococcus mundtii st4sa and lactobacillus plantarum 423 to caco-2 cells under conditions simulating the intestinal tract, and in the presence of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicaments.
AB  == adhesion of enterococcus mundtii st4sa and lactobacillus plantarum 423 to caco-2  (human carcinoma epithelial) cells was visualized by fluorescent staining. both strains showed good adhesion compared to l. casei mb1, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1 and l. rhamnosus gg. no correlation was found between hydrophobicity, aggregation and adhesion to caco-2 cells. presence of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicaments reduced adhesion of bacterial strains to caco-2 cells. proteins sensitive to pepsin, trypsin and pronase are involved in the adhesion of e. mundtii st4sa and l. plantarum 423 to caco-2 cells. adhesion of listeria monocytogenes scotta to caco-2 cells was not prevented by e. mundtii st4sa and l. plantarum 423. cell-free culture supernatants of strains st4sa and 423, containing the antimicrobial peptides plantaricin 423 and peptide st4sa, prevented the invasion of l. monocytogenes scotta into caco-2 cells.

TI  == complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid plca36 isolated from lactobacillus casei  zhang.
AB  == the complete 36,487 bp sequence of plasmid plca36 from lactobacillus casei zhang  was determined. plca36 contains 44 predicted coding regions, and to 23 of them functions could be assigned. for the first time, we identified a relbe toxin-antitoxin (ta) locus in a lactobacillus genus, perhaps indicating a potential role for plca36 in host survival under extreme nutritional stress. a region encoding a cluster of conjugation genes (tra) was also identified. the cluster showed high similarity and co-linearity with tra regions of pwcfs103 and  pmrc01 from lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis, respectively. comparative gene analysis revealed that plasmids from the genus lactobacillus may have contributed to the environmental adaptation mainly by providing carbohydrate and amino acid transporters. in addition, two chromosome-encoded relbe systems in lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus gasseri were identified.

TI  == the lactobacillus plantarum strain aca-dc287 isolated from a greek cheese demonstrates antagonistic activity in vitro and in vivo against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of  the xynotyri cheese isolate lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc287 using a set of in vitro and in vivo assays. methods and results: the co-culture of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain sl1344 results in the killing of the pathogen. the killing activity was produced mainly  by non-lactic acid molecule(s) that were present in the cell-free culture supernatant of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287. the culture of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 inhibited the penetration of s. typhimurium sl1344 into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. in conventional mice infected with s. typhimurium sl1344, the intake of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 results in a decrease in the levels of salmonella associated with intestinal tissues or those  present in the intestinal contents. in germ-free mice, the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 colonized the gastrointestinal tract. conclusions: the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 strain exerts anti-salmonella activity similar that of the established probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota yit9029 and lactobacillus johnsonii la1. significance and impact of the study: the observation that a selected cheese lactobacillus strain exerted antibacterial activity that was similar to those of probiotic lactobacillus strains, is of interest for the use of this strain as an adjunct strain for the production of health-giving cheeses.

TI  == diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  == we determined the maximum ph that allows growth (phmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. high alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. curvatus,  l. pentosus, and l. plantarum that originated from plant material, with phmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. among these, l. casei nric 1917 and l. paracasei subsp. tolerans nric 1940 showed the highest phmax, at 8.9. digestive tract isolates of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. dairy isolates of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and l. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with phmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. measurement of the internal ph of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (deltaph) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-ph ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. thus, the reversed deltaph did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. however, the deltaph contributed to alkali tolerance, as the phmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates deltaph. although neutral external-ph values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance,  substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a ph range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. the major species used in dairy manufacturing are lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and leuconostoc. traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. the appearance of the genomes of lactococcus lactis, bidifobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, 2  strains of streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of lab. moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different lab in  the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum for oral peptide delivery.
AB  == aims: to evaluate strains of lactobacilli for their ability to persist and secrete heterologous protein in the oral cavity. methods and results: four different strains of common oral lactobacilli, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus murinus and lactobacillus plantarum, were  transformed with the plasmid pkth2121, which contains a secretion cassette for beta-lactamase. lactobacilli isolated from the mouth of host mice were also transformed with pkth2121 for later feeding. lactococcus lactis, transformed with pkth2121, was also fed to mice as a negative control. all transformed isolates were fed to c57black mice in varying schedules. the number of transformed bacteria persisting in the mouth was reported as a percentage of total oral bacteria recovered by swabbing. conclusions: the transformed l. lactis, l. brevis, l. johnsonii, l. murinus, and the endogenous murine lactobacillus strain  failed to persist in the mouth. transformed l. plantarum, however, persisted in the mouth and comprised up to 25% of the total lactobacilli at 18 h and 10% at 24 h after feeding. l. plantarum recovered after feeding retained its ability to secrete beta-lactamase into culture medium efficiently. beta-lactamase activity could be detected in oral secretions at 8 h after feedings. after repeated feedings, however, the l. plantarum containing pkth2121 gradually lost its ability to persist after feedings. this experiment demonstrates that l. plantarum can transiently colonize the oral mucosa in large numbers, while continuously secreting foreign proteins, raising the possibility of using lactobacilli as a vector for delivery of oral mucosal peptides.

TI  == adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains.
AB  == five lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from african traditionally fermented milk products or children's  feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. the relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to ht29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the l. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to ht29 cells. four l. plantarum and two l. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to ht29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. the two l. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the  intestinal pathogens listeria monocytogenes scott a, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028. the l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with ht29 cells in a strain-dependent way. these two potential probiotic strains  also significantly increased interleukin-8 (il-8) chemokine production by ht29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as il-1, il-6, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), did not occur. altogether, our results suggested that l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii bfe 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.

AB  == the adhesion abilities of 11 strains of lactobacillus were determined in vitro using the ipec-j2 cell line as a model system. bacteria cultures included the probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri atcc 55730, l. johnsonii ncc 533 and l. reuteri dsm 12246, and new isolates of lactobacillus ssp. adhesion was quantified by scintillation counting of radiolabelled bound bacteria. the highest adhesion of 38%, was determined for l. reuteri dsm 12246 followed by l. plantarum q47 with an adhesion level of 24%. other strains showed moderate to low binding of less than 16%. competitive adhesion experiments on ipec-j2 cells demonstrated  that strongly adhesive strains, as l. reuteri dsm 12246 and l. plantarum q47, significantly reduced the attachment of the less adhesive strains, such as l. rhamnosus gg and l. johnsonii ncc 533, both under condition of co-incubation and  in displacement assays, indicating that bacteria may share the same binding sites for attachment to intestinal cells. furthermore, it was revealed that calcium ions significantly increased the binding of tested lactobacilli to ipec-j2 cells; and therefore, added calcium may be useful in enhancing the adhesion of normally  weakly adhesive probiotic cultures. in contrast, no significant change in adhesion of lactobacilli was observed in the presence of mg and zn ions. displacement assays performed with pathogenic e. coli o138 showed that all tested lactobacillus strains reduced the attachment of e. coli o138 to ipec-j2 by more than 2-fold both in the presence and the absence of calcium ions. the strains of  lactobacillus did not differ significantly in the extent of their inhibition of e. coli o138 adhesion, indicating that the reduced adhesion of e. coli o138 was due to steric hindrance of the binding sites rather than to specific interactions.

TI  == diversity of the genus lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. the authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii and l. sakei. this paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested  that l. salivarius was closer to l. plantarum than to l. sakei, which was closest to enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16s rrna gene relatedness. a total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. a lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising l. salivarius-l. plantarum; l. sakei; e. faecalis; and l. acidophilus-l. johnsonii.  the extreme divergence of the lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.

TI  == lactobacillus spp. with in vitro probiotic properties from human faeces and traditional fermented products.
AB  == lactobacillus strains from traditional african fermented milk products, as well as human intestinal isolates were identified and investigated in vitro for their  technological and functional characteristics as potential new probiotic strains.  to test survival under gastrointestinal conditions, first the protective effect of milk and the effects of medium composition, lysozyme, pepsin, and ph of the medium on bacterial viability were assessed in vitro using the plackett-burman statistical model and the commercially used l. johnsonii la1 probiotic strain. the use of either an artificial gastric electrolyte solution or mrs did not play  a significant role in the viability of the cultures, while lysozyme, acidic conditions (ph 2.5), pepsin and the presence of milk significantly influenced the survival of the strain. therefore, these parameters were selected as important test variables in a model stomach passage survival trial. five strains identified as l. plantarum and two identified as l. johnsonii showed good survival under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. these selected strains also showed antimicrobial activity, probably due to production of organic acids. all strains  exhibited bile salt hydrolase activity, while only the l. plantarum strains showed beta-galactosidase activity.

TI  == comparative and functional analysis of the rrna-operons and their trna gene complement in different lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the complete genome sequences of the lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, and lactobacillus johnsonii were used to compare location, sequence, organisation, and regulation of the ribosomal rna (rrn) operons. all rrn operons of the examined lab diverge from the origin of replication, which is compatible with their efficient expression. all operons show a common organisation of 5'-16s-23s-5s-3' structure, but differ in the number, location and specificity of the trna genes. in the 16s-23s intergenic spacer region, two of the five rrn operons of lb. plantarum and three of the six  of lb. johnsonii contain trna-ala and trna-ile genes, while l. lactis has a trna-ala gene in all six operons. the number of trna genes following the 5s rrna  gene ranges up to 14, 16, and 21 for l. lactis, lb. johnsonii and lb. plantarum,  respectively. the trna gene complements are similar to each other and to those of other bacteria. micro-heterogeneity was found within the rrna structural genes and spacer regions of each strain. in the rrn operon promoter regions of lb. plantarum and l. lactis marked differences were found, while the promoter regions of lb. johnsonii showed a similar tandem promoter structure in all operons. the rrn promoters of l. lactis show either a single or a tandem promoter structure. all promoters of lb. plantarum contain two or three -10 and -35 regions, of which either zero to two were followed by an up-element. the lb. plantarum rrna, rrnb,  and rrnc promoter regions display similarity to the rrn promoter structure of esherichia coli. differences in regulation between the five lb. plantarum promoters were studied using a low copy promoter-probe plasmid. taking copy number and growth rate into account, a differential expression over time was shown. although all five lb. plantarum rrn promoters are significantly different, this study shows that their activity was very similar under the circumstances tested. an active promoter was also identified within the lb. plantarum rrnc operon preceding a cluster of 17 trna genes.

TI  == kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other  inhibitory compounds.
AB  == six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion  of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the  antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.

TI  == [inhibitory activity of vaginal lactobacillus bacteria on yeasts causing vulvovaginal candidiasis].
AB  == growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of lactobacillus on candida. the aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. the majority of strains belonged  to l. acidophilus: l. acidophilus sensu stricto, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  johnsonii as well as l. fermentum and l. plantarum species. culture supernatants  of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their  inhibitory activity against the growth of candida albicans and c. glabrata. the results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against c. albicans was demonstrated by l. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. on the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-h2o2 producing l. plantarum supernatants. growth of c. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of lactobacillus. comparison of activity of live active cultures of lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure h2o2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. this suggests that mixtures of lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.

TI  == the complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus johnsonii reveal extensive differences in chromosome organization and gene content.
AB  == the first comprehensive comparative analysis of lactobacilli was done by comparing the genomes of lactobacillus plantarum (3.3 mb) and lactobacillus johnsonii (2.0 mb). l. johnsonii is predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract, while l. plantarum is also found on plants and plant-derived material, and is used in a variety of industrial fermentations. the l. plantarum and l. johnsonii chromosomes have only 28 regions with conservation of gene order, totalling about 0.75 mb; these regions are not co-linear, indicating major chromosomal rearrangements. metabolic reconstruction indicates many differences between l. johnsonii and l. plantarum: numerous enzymes involved in sugar metabolism and in biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids and cofactors are lacking in l. johnsonii. major differences were seen in the number  and types of putative extracellular proteins, which are of interest because of their possible role in host-microbe interactions. the differences between l. plantarum and l. johnsonii, both in genome organization and gene content, are exceptionally large for two bacteria of the same genus, emphasizing the difficulty in taxonomic classification of lactobacilli.

TI  == identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ecm) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. methods and results: ecm molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota and l. johnsonii la1) as well as by l. casei l.c., lactobacillus sp. 2i3 and by l. plantarum lp. the other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. significance and impact of the study: some  animal strains (at least l. casei l.c. and lactobacillus sp. 2i3) are comparable  with the commercially used strains with respect to their ecm binding ability. as  this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.

TI  == new integration vector using a cellulase gene as a screening marker for lactobacillus.
AB  == the new integration vector for lactobacillus, pjc4, was developed using the extracellular endoglucanase a gene (cela) of clostridium thermocellum as a screening marker. pjc4 was transformed into four lactobacillus species, lb. johnsonii, lb. gasseri, lb. bulgaricus, and lb. plantarum. in each species, the pjc4 integrants were easily and accurately detected by the appearance of a clear  halo on a cellulase screening plate without any false transformants. polymerase chain reaction and southern hybridization indicated that all transformants with clear halos contained pjc4 in their chromosomal dnas. the cela gene could be a useful screening marker for other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

TI  == positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.
