TI  - Evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility of Bacteroides, Prevotella and Fusobacterium species isolated from patients of the N. N. Blokhin Cancer Research Center, Moscow, Russia.
AB  - In total 122 non-duplicate Bacteroides, Prevotella and Fusobacterium spp isolated from cancer patients between 2004 and 2014 were involved in this study. Most of the strains belonged to the B. fragilis group (55%), followed by Prevotella strains (34.4%) and Fusobacterium spp (10.6%). The species identification was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and they were identified on species level with a log (score) >2.0. The most common isolates were B. fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus and B. vulgatus. Among Prevotella species, the most frequently isolated species were P. buccae, P. buccalis, P. oris, P. denticola and P. nigrescens, and most of the Fusobacterium spp. were F. nucleatum. Susceptibilities of the strains were determined by the E-test methodology. The percentage of the susceptibility of B. fragilis group isolates were: metronidazole (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 97%; imipenem (MIC </=2 mug/ml), 95.5%; amoxicillin/clavulanate (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 95.5% and clindamycin (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 77.6%. Three B. fragilis isolates proved to be multidrug-resistant (parallel resistance to imipenem, amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole or clindamycin was observed). All Prevotella strains tested were susceptible to imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate, whereas 78.6% of the pigmented Prevotella species and 46.4% of the non-pigmented species were resistant to penicillin (MIC >0.5 mug/ml). The susceptibility to metronidazole and clindamycin were 93% and 88%, respectively. All Fusobacterium strains were sensitive to all tested antibiotics, including penicillin.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. METHODS: Samples were collected from the root canals using #15 Hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization techniques. RESULTS: The mean number of species per sample was 22. Enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), Campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), Leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), Neisseria mucosa (87.5%), Prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), Eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), Streptococcus anginosus (75%), and Veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. The species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), E. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), E. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), N. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), V. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), C. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), Treponema socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), Porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), Micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), Prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). Most of these species were also found in high proportions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria cultured from the tongue dorsum of subjects with oral malodor.
AB  - The bacteria on the dorsum of the tongue are the most frequent cause of oral malodor; however, the bacterial flora of the tongue has not been well defined. Although recent studies have used DNA probes to detect the presence of certain periodontal pathogens, cultural studies have been limited because of the complexity of the flora of the tongue dorsum. The purpose of this study was to grow and to identify maximum numbers of capnophylic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic micro-organisms by culturing tongue samples on to several selective and non-selective media. The most frequently isolated species included Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Collinsella aerofaciens, Eubacterium group, Actinomyces spp., Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented Prevotella spp. and Selenomonas spp. Reported for the first time are Actinomyces turicensis, Collinsella aerofaciens, Eubacterium saburreum, E. timidum, Prevotella tannerae, Campylobacter concisus, Campylobacter mucosalis, Leptotrichia buccalis, Selenomonas flueggei, and Centipeda periodontii. Species not previously reported in studies that used only molecular techniques were identified in the present study.
TI  - Gingival crevice microbiota from Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG). Subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in Eastern China. Samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. The analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (Fusobacterium nucleatum/Fusobacterium periodonticum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Tannerella forsythensis, and Capnocytophaga sp.), Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces gerencseriae were much more prevalent in the NUG group. Quantitatively, most taxa, including P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. Only P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, P. gingivalis, S. sputigena, A. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the NUG group. The present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in NUG-associated plaque are of prime importance.
TI  - Culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients.
AB  - Renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. In this study, a culture-independent 16S rRNA-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. Similarly sized amplicons encompassing the V6 to V8 region of the 16S rRNA were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) (WAVE System). Artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. We evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and DHPLC generated peak profiles. However, for culture-negative specimens, DHPLC facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. DNA sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. Thus, in PCR-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as Corynebacterium urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including Anaerococcus lactolyticus, Bacteroides vulgatus, Dialister invisus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus iners, Leptotrichia amnionii, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella ruminicola, Rahnella aquatilis, and Streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. The method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both DHPLC-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. A detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.
TI  - Correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult Sudanese.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult Sudanese. Whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 Sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). Levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. There were significantly ( P< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( P< or =0.01) lower percentages with Treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. The detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for Selenomonas sputigena, S. anginosus, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. salivarius and significantly lower for Porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( P< or =0.01). Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( P< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. This study indicates that the levels of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, S. sanguis, and S. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and subgingival plaque.
TI  - Evaluation of the Rapid ID 32A system for identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Rapid ID 32A system (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) for the identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group. METHODS: Five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-B. fragilis group anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli were tested in the Rapid ID 32A system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The Rapid ID 32A system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. A further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by the manufacturer. Fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. Three isolates of Prevotella were not identified by the system. Of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: The Rapid ID 32A system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-B. fragilis group, anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. There was poor discrimination between Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. necrophorum, between Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Porphyromonas endodontalis, and between Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella oralis. The need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.
TI  - beta-Lactamase producing bacteria in adult periodontitis.
AB  - In 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. In addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Peptostreptococcus micros, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides forsythus and Campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (DrySlide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. Isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. Based on the non-selective plates, six of 23 P. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 B. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 F. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. The beta-lactamase positive species Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella buccae, Prevotella buccalis and Actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-Lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range < 0.01-15%). Comparison of the DrySlide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-Lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). It was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a common feature. However, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. The majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found among species of the Prevotella genus.
TI  - New findings on the microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  - The predominant microbial flora associated with adult periodontitis was investigated in 21 patients aged 20-40 years. Microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque were cultured on selective and non-selective media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Ten species or groups out of a total of 31 were found to comprise the predominant cultivable flora: diphtheroids, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, coagulase-negative staphylococci, 'Streptococcus milleri'-group, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, the Prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex, P. intermedia, P. oralis and unidentified Prevotella spp. Two species previously reported at periodontitis sites, namely P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, were not isolated, whereas Prevotella species accounted for the majority of isolates in this investigation. The large proportion of non-pigmented Prevotella species, P. asaccharolytica and B. ureolyticus that were found have not generally been reported previously. The role of these microorganisms and also coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids and the 'Streptococcus milleri'-group requires further investigation in adult periodontitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
