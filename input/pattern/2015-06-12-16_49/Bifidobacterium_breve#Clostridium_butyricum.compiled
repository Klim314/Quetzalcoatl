TI  - Glucose but Not Polypeptone Reduces the Effect of Probiotic Preparations to Stimulate Carbohydrate Breakdown and Reduce Net Ammonia Production by Pig Cecal Bacteria In Vitro.
AB  - Probiotic preparations are used to prevent or treat diarrhea. Probiotic preparations increase the in vitro breakdown of carbohydrates and decrease that of protein by mixed cecal bacteria in the absence of readily fermentable materials. Diarrhea can increase the influx of readily digestible materials into the large intestine. Therefore, we compared production of organic acids and ammonia in batch cultures using pig cecal contents with or without probiotic preparations (Clostridium butyricum, Lactobacillus casei plus Bifidobacterium breve, or L. casei plus Enterococcus faecalis) and with or without readily fermentable substrates (glucose or polypeptone). Effects of additional substrates appeared earlier than those of probiotic preparations. Both probiotic preparations and glucose increased the production of most short-chain fatty acids and lactic acid but decreased those of ammonia and isovaleric acid. Effects of probiotic preparations and glucose were not additive. Effects of different preparations were alike. Polypeptone increased the production of ammonia and isovaleric acid independent of probiotic preparations. Effects of probiotics and glucose may be to provide either energy or carbon to the microbial ecosystem. Effects of glucose were probably mediated through their direct utilization by indigenous bacteria.
TI  - Increased growth of Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium by germinated barley foodstuff, accompanied by enhanced butyrate production in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Germinated barley foodstuff (GBF) derived from the aleurone and scutellum fractions of germinated barley mainly consists of low-lignified hemicellulose and glutamine-rich protein. GBF improves the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and defecation, through the bacterial production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially butyrate. In this study we investigated the mechanism of production of butyrate by microflora in humans and in vitro. Daily administration of 9 g GBF for 14 successive days significantly increased fecal butyrate content. Fecal Bifidobacterium and Eubacterium were also significantly increased by GBF administration in healthy volunteers. Ten anaerobic micro-organisms selected from intestinal microflora were cultured in vitro in the medium containing GBF as a sole carbon source (GBF medium). After a 3-day incubation, 7 strains (Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Bacteroides ovatus, Clostridium butyricum, and Eubacterium limosum) lowered the medium pH producing SCFA. Eubacterium grown together with Bifidobacterium in GBF medium efficiently produced butyrate. On the other hand, GBF changed the intestinal microflora and increased probiotics such as Bifidobacterium in the intestinal tract. As a result, butyrate was produced by the mutual action of Eubacterium and Bifidobacterium. This butyrate is considered to enhance the proliferation of colonic epithelial cells.
TI  - Degradation and fermentation of alpha-gluco-oligosaccharides by bacterial strains from human colon: in vitro and in vivo studies in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  - The ability of several human gut bacteria to break down alpha-1,2 and alpha-1,6 glycosidic linkages in alpha-gluco-oligosaccharides (GOS) was investigated in vitro in substrate utilization tests. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bifidobacterium breve and Clostridium butyricum, which are usually found in the infant gut and have been associated with both beneficial and deleterious effects on health, were studied. Alpha-Gluco-oligosaccharide degradation was compared in vitro and in vivo in gnotobiotic rats associated with these organisms, inoculated alone or in combination. Oligomer breakdown and short chain fatty acid and gas production indicated hydrolysis and fermentation of the substrate. In vitro and in vivo, Cl. butyricum was the least efficient in utilizing GOS, whereas Bact. thetaiotaomicron was the most efficient. Kinetic studies on GOS hydrolysis in pH-regulated fermenters showed that alpha-1,2 glucosidic bonds, which characterize the substrate, were more resistant than alpha-1,6 linkages. Adaptation of gnotobiotic rats to a diet containing 2% (w/w) GOS significantly increased the hydrolysis of alpha-1,2 glucosidic bonds. Combination of bacteria in trixenic rats improved GOS degradation and inhibited Cl. butyricum metabolism. This inhibition was confirmed in pH-regulated fermenters containing GOS as the principal carbon source. The association of beneficial bacteria and GOS may therefore have a potential health-promoting effect in human neonates.
TI  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. Of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). The Bifidobacterium spp. most frequently isolated from the three groups of infants were B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum. The bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were B. fragilis and B. vulgatus. The most common Clostridium sp. in the three groups of infants was C. perfringens. The type of milk did not select for species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Clostridium, except for Clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and Clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. The species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.
