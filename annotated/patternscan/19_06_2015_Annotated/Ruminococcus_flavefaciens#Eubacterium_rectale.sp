TI  == rrna-based analysis to monitor succession of faecal bacterial communities in holstein calves.
AB  == aims: to quantitatively analyse the faecal bacterial communities of holstein calves and track their succession up to 12 weeks of age. methods and results: faecal samples obtained from four female holstein calves were analysed by the rna-based, sequence-specific rrna cleavage method. twelve scissor probes covering major rumen bacterial groups were used, detecting c. 60-90% of the total 16s rrnas. at 1 week of age, 16s rrnas from members of the bacteroides-prevotella group (40.0% of the total 16s rrnas), faecalibacterium (21.7%), the clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group (16.7%) and the atopobium cluster (10.9%) were detected at high levels. throughout the 12-week period, rrnas of the bacteroides-prevotella and the cl. coccoides-eu. rectale groups constituted the major fraction of microbiota (c. 50-70% of the total). the relative abundances of the atopobium cluster, faecalibacterium, and some probiotic bacteria (such as those of the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium) decreased as the animal aged. instead, an uncultivated rumen bacterial group, as well as ruminococcus flavefaciens and fibrobacter emerged at the detectable levels (1-2%) in the faeces sampled at a postweaning age. in addition, certain bacterial groups that were not covered by the probe suite increased as the animals aged. conclusions: young calves undergo dynamic changes in their intestinal bacterial community during the first 12 weeks of life. as young ruminants undergo metabolic and physiological development in their digestive tracts in the transition from a monogastric to a ruminant animal at an early age, the intestinal bacterial community may reflect such development. significance and impact of the study: the succession of the bacterial communities in the faeces of calves was quantitatively monitored in the present study for the first time. the approach used here was demonstrated to be a useful means for determining the populations of predominant faecal bacterial groups in a variety of calf experiments in response to diet, stress and disease.

TI  == detection of possible ai-2-mediated quorum sensing system in commensal intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the vibrio harveyi strain bb170-autoinducer bioassay was used to detect possible  quorum sensing autoinducer-2 molecule (ai-2) in culture fluids of commensal intestinal bacteria. culture fluids of bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium proteoclasticum, escherichia coli, eubacterium rectale, lachnospira multipara, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, roseburia intestinalis, ruminococcus albus and ruminococcus flavefaciens contained ai-2-like molecules. the pcr bands from some  of the tested strains could be also amplified using primers designed for the luxs gene. these findings suggest that ai-2 is present in the gastrointestinal tract;  however, it has not yet been proved whether it is used for bacterial cell-to-cell communication.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.
