TI  == development and pyrosequencing analysis of an in-vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == background: dental caries and periodontal disease are the commonest bacterial diseases of man and can result in tooth loss. the principal method of prevention  is the mechanical removal of dental plaque augmented by active agents incorporated into toothpastes and mouthrinses. in-vitro assays that include complex oral bacterial biofilms are required to accurately predict the efficacy of novel active agents in vivo. the aim of this study was to develop an oral biofilm model using the calgary biofilm device (cbd) seeded with a natural saliva inoculum and analysed by next generation sequencing. the specific objectives were to determine the reproducibility and stability of the model by comparing the composition of the biofilms over time derived from (i) the same volunteers at different time points, and (ii) different panels of volunteers. results: pyrosequencing yielded 280,093 sequences with a mean length of 432 bases after filtering. a mean of 320 and 250 otus were detected in pooled saliva and biofilm  samples, respectively. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots based on community membership and structure showed that replicate biofilm samples were highly similar and clustered together. in addition, there were no significant differences between biofilms derived from the same panel at different times using analysis of molecular variance (amova). there were significant differences between biofilms from different panels (amova, p < 0.002). pcoa revealed that there was a shift in biofilm composition between seven and 14 days (amova, p < 0.001). veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica/dispar/parvula and peptostreptococcus stomatis were the predominant otus detected in seven-day biofilms, whilst prevotella oralis, v. parvula and streptococcus constellatus were predominant in 14-day biofilms. conclusions: diverse oral biofilms were successfully grown and maintained using the cbd. biofilms derived from the same panel of volunteers were highly reproducible. this model could be used to screen  both antimicrobial-containing oral care products and also novel approaches aiming to modify plaque composition, such as pre- or probiotics.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == assessment of the microbiota in root canals of human primary teeth by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo the prevalence of microorganisms in root canals of human primary teeth, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. methods: fifty-five root canals of primary teeth with irreversible pulpitis (group 1) and 51 root canals of teeth with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis (group 2) were selected. microbiological samples were collected and submitted to checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using 34 genomic dna probes. the  results were analyzed statistically by mann-whitney u-test at a 5% significance level. results: the most prevalent species in group 1 were: (1) campylobacter rectus (87%); (2) gemella morbilorum (78%); (3) streptococcus gordonii (71%); (4) capnocytophaga ochracea (69%); (5) treponema denticola (58%); and (6) streptococcus intermedius (49%). the most prevalent species in group 2 were: (1)  c. rectus (90%); (2) t. denticola (88%); (3) s. intermedius (77%); (4) g. morbilorum (73%); (5) streptococcus oralis (67%); (6) c. ochracea (63%); (7) s. gordonii (55%); (8) streptococcus mitis (51%); and (9) leptotrichia buccalis (51%). except for peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces israelii, the most prevalent bacterial strains in the root canals with apical periodontitis were also those found in larger numbers (p<.05). groups 1 and 2 differed significantly (p<.05) regarding the total number of bacterial cells detected in the root canal  samples, with group 2 showing remarkably larger bacterial cell numbers. conclusions: root canals of primary teeth have a great bacterial diversity, characterizing a polymicrobial endodontic infection with presence of: (1) anaerobic and facultative micro organisms; (2) black-pigmented rods; and (3) streptococci. a large number of anaerobic species were detected in teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis, and a significantly smaller number of bacterial cells were found in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.

TI  == microorganisms in root carious lesions in adults.
AB  == purpose: root caries is emerging as a significant problem in the middle aged and  elderly subjects because of the improving general health conditions, and medical  and technological advances. the purpose of this investigation was to assess the prevalence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as yeasts of candida genus in root carious lesions in middle-aged and older adults. material and methods: specimens of root carious lesions were collected from 78 adults for bacteriological and mycological studies. standard procedures of culture, isolation, and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and fungi were used in the study. results: the analysis of results was performed independently in two age groups of adults, i.e. 52 subjects aged 35-44 years (middle age) and 26-aged 55-72 years (older age). there were 120 bacterial strains isolated from root carious lesions in middle-aged subjects, 63 (52.5%) strains belonged to 5 genera of aerobic bacteria and 57 (47.5%)--to 7 genera of anaerobic bacteria (p > 0.05). while in the second group, 85 strains were isolated, 54 (63.5%)--6 genera  of aerobic bacteria and 31 (36.5%)--4 genera of anaerobic bacteria (p = 0.0004).  there were no differences between the isolation rate of a various species in both examined groups, except for streptococcus spp., s. oralis, micrococcus spp., neisseria spp. and veillonella spp., which statistically significantly most frequent occurred in elderly (p < 0.05). the yeasts of candida genus of 4 species (c. albicans, c. lusitaniae, c. pelliculosa, and c. pulcherrima) were isolated from middle-aged subjects (32.7%) with the comparable rate to older adults (30.8%; only c. albicans) (p > 0.05). among all isolated microorganisms, candida  spp., were comprised about 10% in both examined groups (p > 0.05). conclusions: aerobic gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp.) as well  as anaerobic ones (peptostreptococcus spp.), and candida albicans were occurred most frequently in root carious lesions in middle-aged and older adults.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  == interactions between enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. the aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions  between e. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella oralis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus anginosus. intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. all e.  faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with f. nucleatum; e. faecalis did not coaggregate with p. anaerobius or s. anginosus. one strain, e. faecalis e1, coaggregated with p. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. coaggregation interactions between e. faecalis and f. nucleatum observed in this study suggest  a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. method and materials: the agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the  antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices activ point (chlorhexidine; roeko) and calcium hydroxide plus point (roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative  oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. the efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (wilcoxon's  signed rank test). results: activ point produced significantly larger inhibition  zones (p < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. conclusion: the chlorhexidine slow-release device (activ point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.

TI  == is pre-term labour associated with periodontitis in a danish maternity ward?
AB  == objectives: to reveal differences in periodontal status and presence of subgingival bacteria in a scandinavian population of women with pre-term birth compared with women who delivered at term. materials and methods: twenty-one women with pre-term labour (before week 35) and 33 women with term labour (between weeks 38 and 41) were included in this case-control study. periodontal measurements included plaque index (pli), probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop). inter-proximal distances from the cemento-enamel junction (cej) to the marginal bone crest (mbc) were measured on bitewing radiographs. in 31 patients (16 cases and 15 controls) the subgingival plaque was analysed using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization. results: differences between the two examined groups were found related to "twin births" (p=0.0064) and "smokers" (p=0.03). none of the periodontal measurements showed any association. significant differences were found concerning presence of tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga ochracea but when defining sites with >10(5) bacteria as heavily colonized, no statistical difference was found between the two groups. conclusion: a relation between pre-term birth and periodontitis was not revealed in the present study.

TI  == apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  == in six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species streptococcus milleri, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, prevotella oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of enterococcus faecalis. all strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. after 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. from 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. the two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and  the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. the chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. the facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. the five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.

TI  == effects of selected immunouppressive drugs on prostaglandin release, protein synthesis and cell proliferation in human gingival fibroblasts and on the growth  of plaque bacteria.
AB  == background: immunosuppressants play an essential role in transplantation therapy. in view of the side effects, e.g. gingival overgrowth, the present in vitro study was performed in order to investigate the effect of selected immunosuppressants on metabolic activities of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, the effect on the growth of six oral microorganisms was investigated. methods: human gingival fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of azathioprine (aza), cyclosporin a (csa), tacrolimus (tac) or mycophenolatmofetil (myc). pge subset 2 release was determined by means of a specific competitive enzyme immunoassay, using monoclonal antibodies specific for pge subset 2 (clone e2r1). the protein content was measured spectrophotometrically. a redox indicator system was employed to assess the proliferation activity. in an additional trial the growth of six strains of oral bacteria (a. viscosus t14v, s. oralis h1, s. mutans 10449, c. gingivalis dr2001, a. actinomycetemcomitans y4, and m. micros 33270) in the presence of the immunosuppressants was measured. results: in comparison with the  controls, the pge subset 2 release was increased by 39.3% following incubation with aza, and by 77.0% with csa. the protein concentrations (1 g immunosuppressant / ml medium) were reduced by 26.0% for aza and 17.0% for myc. furthermore, a drug-dependent inhibition in the cell proliferation rate was noted after an incubation period of 6 hours (aza 70.7%, csa 78.2%, myc 69.8%, tac 64.0%). the most pronounced growth-inhibiting effects were observed for csa at values ranging from 21.0% (s. mutans 10449) to 48.6% (a. viscosus t14v) growth inhibition. conclusions: the present study with common immunsuppresants demonstrated both a medication- and dose-dependent alteration in the metabolic activity of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, growth-inhibitory effects on the selected bacterial strains could be observed.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  == we devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. in this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (af(50)) of s. constellatus and p. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (ld(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: af(50)of p. oralis and f. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their ld(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. ld(50)of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. we conclude  that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.

AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  == thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. all 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent  extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection)  with free flap reconstruction. a total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial translocation was found more  often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional  lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). as the gingival carcinoma group includes more t4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved  nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. oral streptococci (streptococcus intermedius, strep. constellatus, strep. oralis, strep. mitis, strep. sanguis, strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. aerobic enteric bacteria (enterococcus, escherichia, klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. among the anaerobic bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer  might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain  the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.

TI  == microbiota of successful osseointegrated dental implants.
AB  == background: the long-term survival of dental implants depends, in part, on control of bacterial infection in the peri-implant region. periodontal pathogens  colonized implants symptomatic through infection, whereas the microbiota of successful implants was similar to that of periodontal health. this study examined the impact on the peri-implant microbiota of crown restorations; implant type; length of time of loading; history of implant or periodontal infections; and whether implants replaced single or multiple teeth. it was of particular interest to evaluate implant colonization by species in a newly described red complex of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus. methods: this study sampled 43 partially edentulous subjects with successfully osseointegrated titanium root-form dental implants. eighty-one (81)  non-submerged and 20 submerged asymptomatic implants, 83 crowned, and 36 uncrowned teeth were sampled from peri-implant or subgingival sites. the microbiota of samples was evaluated using whole genomic dna probes in a checkerboard assay to 23 subgingival species. results: implants were colonized principally by oral streptococci, capnocytophagae, veillonella parvula, peptostreptococcus micros, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the periodontal species,  p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and campylobacter rectus were detected in a few subjects. the microbiota around crowned implants and crowned teeth was similar. streptococcus oralis, p. intermedia, and selenomonas noxia were elevated in samples from uncrowned teeth compared to crowned teeth and implants. microbial complexity increased as loading time increased, but colonization by periodontal pathogens, including red complex  species, was higher in subjects with previous periodontal disease. no differences were observed in the microbiota of 1- and 2-stage implants, or between implants supporting single or multiple restorations. conclusions: while presence of crowns had only a minor impact on the peri-implant microbiota, microbial changes were observed the longer the implants had been in function and in those patients with  a history of periodontal or peri-implant infections. a history of periodontitis had a greater impact on the peri-implant microbiota than implant loading time. the major influence on the peri-implant microbiota was, however, the microbiota on remaining teeth. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus, red complex periodontal pathogens, colonized several implants, although all implants were successfully osseointegrated.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological profile of healthy, gingivitis and putative active periodontal subjects.
AB  == thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate pd measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. microbial samples were taken from  11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. standard deviations of replicate pd measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with pd change. baseline and follow-up distributions of pd changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. sites from 2 subjects showed pd increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. species associated with putative active subjects included actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, selenomonas noxia and prevotella nigrescens. streptococcus sanguis, s. gordonii and peptostreptococcus micros were associated  with inactive subjects. s. gordonii and s. oralis were associated with health, whereas p. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. elevated serum antibodies were detected to a. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. the predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.

TI  == associations of endodontic symptoms and signs with particular combinations of specific bacteria.
AB  == significant associations have been reported between (a) specific bacterial species isolated from root canals and (b) between individual bacterial species and endodontic symptoms and signs. the prime objective of this study was to determine whether particular combinations of specific bacteria are associated with individual endodontic symptoms and signs. seventy root canals were investigated microbiologically taking care to maintain the viability of obligate  anaerobes, which accounted for 64% of the total species isolated, including peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella oralis, eubacterium aerofaciens, eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella  buccae and prevotella intermedia. significant associations were found between individual clinical features and the following pairs of species: (a) pain (37 cases) and peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella spp., peptostreptococcus spp./prevotella melaninogenica, pstr. micros/prev. melaninogenica (all p < 0.01); (b) swelling (23 cases) and pstr. micros/prevotella spp. (p < 0.01); (c) 'wet' canal (57 cases) and prevotella spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.01), peptostreptococcus spp./eubacterium spp. (p < 0.05). thus data from this investigation suggests that statistically significant associations exist between  individual endodontic symptoms and signs and particular combinations of specific  bacteria.

TI  == changes in root canal microbiota during the development of rat periapical lesions.
AB  == periapical lesions are reproducibly induced in rats by pulp exposure and infection from the oral cavity. lesions expand rapidly between day 7 and day 15-20 (active phase), with slowed expansion thereafter. in the present study we characterized the root canal microbiota present during the active phase of lesion development in this system. the mandibular first molars of sprague-dawley rats were exposed on day 0. the teeth were extracted after 7 days (n = 10 animals) and 15 days (n = 10), and the microbiota present in roots was isolated and characterized. the number of colonies isolated per tooth was similar on day 7 (1.53 +/- 0.64 colony-forming units x 10(3)) and day 15 (1.49 +/- 0.37 colony-forming units x 10(3)). no colonies were isolated from unexposed control teeth. anaerobic bacteria increased significantly between day 7 (24.3 +/- 5.7%) and day 15 (47.3 +/- 7.5%), and the proportion of gram-negative organisms increased from day 7 (24.3 +/- 6.1) to day 15 (46.9 +/- 6.8). the predominant bacteria included, on day 7: streptococcus and bacteroides species; on day 15: species of streptococcus, bacteroides, prevotella, neisseria and peptostreptococcus. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus rattus, bacteroides pneumosintes and bacteroides ureolyticus were frequently isolated at both points. although approximately the same mean number of different species (approximately 3.5) was isolated per tooth on both day 7 and 15, the overall diversity of the isolates increased on day 15.(abstract truncated at 250  words)

TI  == immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  == although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the  species in question are not adequately known. the aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of b lymphocytes. it was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in b lymphocytes. the polyclonal activation of b cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in gram-negative anaerobes. furthermore, all of the tested species excluding bacteroides oralis were poor t cell mitogens. these findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. it thus seems plausible that a battery of complex  immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.

TI  == the endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  == the microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. a  total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then prevotella melaninogenica (formerly bacteroides melaninogenicus), enterococcus faecalis and  prevotella oralis (formerly bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. highly significant associations were discovered between four  pairs of species, viz p. melaninogenica with p. micros, p. melaninogenica with p. oralis, prevotella corporis with streptococcus morbillorum and actinomyces odontolyticus with e. faecalis.

TI  == [bacteriological examination of infections in the field of oral surgery].
AB  == etiology of bacterial infections in the field of oral surgery was studied. a total of 270 samples collected from patients with encapsulated abscess in their oral cavities was examined and bacteria were isolated from the 244 samples (90.4%). the following results were found; 1) organisms more than one from one sample were frequently isolated from cases with parodontitis, pericoronitis and gnathitis. isolation of anaerobic bacteria was common (54.2%). 2) streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga species were the most common isolates among aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. 3) peptostreptococcus micros and eubacterium lentum were most frequent isolates among gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. among gram-negative bacteria, oral group  bacteroides, especially bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides buccae and bacteroides oralis were most prominent. 4) isolation frequency of bacteria (both species and strains) was high from samples obtained from patients before antibiotic chemotherapy. 5) most strains were sensitive to midecamycin acetate and josamycin. minimum inhibitory concentration of 80% isolates (mic80) against these antibiotics was 0.39 microgram/ml.

TI  == bacteriology of dental abscesses of endodontic origin.
AB  == aspirates have been cultured from 10 dental abscesses of endodontic origin, all of which had penetrated beyond the bony alveolus to produce fluctuant swelling. sampling was by syringe aspiration. strict anaerobic techniques, including the use of an anaerobic chamber, were used for serial dilution and plating. randomly  selected colonies (100) from each culture were purified, characterized, and identified. seventy percent of the bacterial isolates were either strict anaerobes or microaerophilic. one abscess yielded a pure culture of a viridans streptococcus, streptococcus milleri. streptococcus intermedius dominated the flora in a second abscess. the common oral streptococcus, streptococcus sanguis,  constituted only 2% of the isolates from one additional infection. fusobacterium  nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus, other bacteroides including b. oralis and b. ruminicola, anaerobic diphtheroids, peptostreptococcus micros, and staphylococcus epidermis were other predominant isolates.

TI  == circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  == root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, actinomyces bovis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides oralis in various combinations. after 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. in 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (ha), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of b. oralis in all five monkeys. agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of b. oralis in titers between  1:40 and 1:320. a marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of igm-class. the study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  == aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. all aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients.  anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only  organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. there were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 bacteroides sp. (including 23 b. melaninogenicus, 5 b. oralis and 4 b. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic gram-positive cocci (including 10 peptostreptococcus sp., 4 peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 fusobacterium sp.; and 3 clostridium sp. there  were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 haemophilus sp. and 3 s. aureus. beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). these were all isolates of s. aureus (3), 8 of 23 b. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 b. oralis (40%). our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.
