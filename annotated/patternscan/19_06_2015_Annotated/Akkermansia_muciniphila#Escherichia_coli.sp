TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == akkermansia muciniphila adheres to enterocytes and strengthens the integrity of the epithelial cell layer.
AB  == akkermansia muciniphila is a gram-negative mucin-degrading bacterium that resides in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals. a. muciniphila has been linked with intestinal health and improved metabolic status in obese and type 2 diabetic subjects. specifically, a. muciniphila has been shown to reduce high-fat-diet-induced endotoxemia, which develops as a result of an impaired gut  barrier. despite the accumulating evidence of the health-promoting effects of a.  muciniphila, the mechanisms of interaction of the bacterium with the host have received little attention. in this study, we used several in vitro models to investigate the adhesion of a. muciniphila to the intestinal epithelium and its interaction with the host mucosa. we found that a. muciniphila adheres strongly to the caco-2 and ht-29 human colonic cell lines but not to human colonic mucus.  in addition, a. muciniphila showed binding to the extracellular matrix protein laminin but not to collagen i or iv, fibronectin, or fetuin. importantly, a. muciniphila improved enterocyte monolayer integrity, as shown by a significant increase in the transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) of cocultures of caco-2 cells with the bacterium. further, a. muciniphila induced interleukin 8 (il-8) production by enterocytes at cell concentrations 100-fold higher than those for escherichia coli, suggesting a very low level of proinflammatory activity in the epithelium. in conclusion, our results demonstrate that a. muciniphila adheres to the intestinal epithelium and strengthens enterocyte monolayer integrity in vitro, suggesting an ability to fortify an impaired gut barrier. these results support earlier associative in vivo studies and provide insights into the interaction of a. muciniphila with the host.

TI  == tracking heavy water (d2o) incorporation for identifying and sorting active microbial cells.
AB  == microbial communities are essential to the function of virtually all ecosystems and eukaryotes, including humans. however, it is still a major challenge to identify microbial cells active under natural conditions in complex systems. in this study, we developed a new method to identify and sort active microbes on the single-cell level in complex samples using stable isotope probing with heavy water (d2o) combined with raman microspectroscopy. incorporation of d2o-derived d into the biomass of autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria and archaea could be unambiguously detected via c-d signature peaks in single-cell raman spectra, and  the obtained labeling pattern was confirmed by nanoscale-resolution secondary ion ms. in fast-growing escherichia coli cells, label detection was already possible  after 20 min. for functional analyses of microbial communities, the detection of  d incorporation from d2o in individual microbial cells via raman microspectroscopy can be directly combined with fish for the identification of active microbes. applying this approach to mouse cecal microbiota revealed that the host-compound foragers akkermansia muciniphila and bacteroides acidifaciens exhibited distinctive response patterns to amendments of mucin and sugars. by raman-based cell sorting of active (deuterated) cells with optical tweezers and subsequent multiple displacement amplification and dna sequencing, novel cecal microbes stimulated by mucin and/or glucosamine were identified, demonstrating the potential of the nondestructive d2o-raman approach for targeted sorting of microbial cells with defined functional properties for single-cell genomics.

TI  == intestinal dysbiosis: novel mechanisms by which gut microbes trigger and prevent  disease.
AB  == new research has identified specific intestinal colonizing microbes that can have significant influence on health and disease. evidence is reviewed supporting an association between fusobacterium nucleatum and colon cancer and for a protective role of faecalibacterium prausnitzii in inflammatory bowel disease, of escherichia coli nissle 1917 in acute intestinal inflammation, of bifidobacterium infantis in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, and of akkermansia muciniphila in obesity and diabetes. these novel bacteria are clinically relevant and present opportunities for more focused diagnosis of colon cancer and prevention of common diseases.

TI  == extracellular vesicles derived from gut microbiota, especially akkermansia muciniphila, protect the progression of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis.
AB  == gut microbiota play an important part in the pathogenesis of mucosal inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). however, owing to the complexity of the gut microbiota, our understanding of the roles of commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the maintenance of immune homeostasis in the gut is evolving only slowly. here, we evaluated the role of gut microbiota and their secreting extracellular vesicles (ev) in the development of mucosal inflammation  in the gut. experimental ibd model was established by oral application of dextran sulfate sodium (dss) to c57bl/6 mice. the composition of gut microbiota and bacteria-derived ev in stools was evaluated by metagenome sequencing using bacterial common primer of 16s rdna. metagenomics in the ibd mouse model showed that the change in stool ev composition was more drastic, compared to the change  of bacterial composition. oral dss application decreased the composition of ev from akkermansia muciniphila and bacteroides acidifaciens in stools, whereas increased ev from tm7 phylum, especially from species dq777900_s and aj400239_s.  in vitro pretreatment of a. muciniphila-derived ev ameliorated the production of  a pro-inflammatory cytokine il-6 from colon epithelial cells induced by escherichia coli ev. additionally, oral application of a. muciniphila ev also protected dss-induced ibd phenotypes, such as body weight loss, colon length, and inflammatory cell infiltration of colon wall. our data provides insight into the  role of gut microbiota-derived ev in regulation of intestinal immunity and homeostasis, and a. muciniphila-derived ev have protective effects in the development of dss-induced colitis.

TI  == comparison of bacterial quantities in left and right colon biopsies and faeces.
AB  == aim: to compare quantities of predominant and pathogenic bacteria in mucosal and  faecal samples. methods: twenty patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy with endoscopically and histologically normal mucosa were recruited to the study, 14 subjects of which also supplied faecal (f) samples between 15 d to 105 d post colonoscopy. mucosal biopsies were taken from each subject from the midportion of the ascending colon (right side samples, rm) and the sigmoid (left side samples,  lm). predominant intestinal and mucosal bacteria including clostridial 16s rrna gene clusters iv and xivab, bacteroidetes, enterobacteriaceae, bifidobacterium spp., akkermansia muciniphila (a. muciniphila), veillonella spp., collinsella spp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii (f. prausnitzii) and putative pathogens such as escherichia coli (e. coli), clostridium difficile (c. difficile), helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) were analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). host dna was quantified from the mucosal samples with human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene targeting qpcr. paired t tests and the pearson correlation were applied for statistical analysis. results: the most prominent bacterial groups were clostridial groups iv and xiva+b and bacteroidetes and bacterial species f. prausnitzii in both sample types. h. pylori and s. aureus were not detected and c. difficile was detected in only one mucosal sample and three faecal samples. e. coli was detected in less than half of the mucosal samples at both sites, but was present in all faecal samples. all detected bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae,  were present at higher levels in the faeces than in the mucosa, but the different locations in the colon presented comparable quantities (rm, lm and f followed by  p(1) for rm vs f, p(2) for lm vs f and p(3) for rm vs lm: 4.17 +/- 0.60 log(10)/g, 4.16 +/- 0.56 log(10)/g, 5.88 +/- 1.92 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.011, p(2) = 0.0069, p(3) = 0.9778 for a. muciniphila; 6.25 +/- 1.3 log(10)/g, 6.09 +/- 0.81 log(10)/g, 8.84 +/- 1.38 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) = 0.0002, p(3) = 0.6893 for bacteroidetes; 5.27 +/- 1.68 log(10)/g, 5.38 +/- 2.06 log(10)/g, 8.20 +/- 1.14 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.7535 for bifidobacterium spp.; 6.44 +/- 1.15 log(10)/g, 6.07 +/-1.45 log(10)/g, 9.74 +/-1.13 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001, p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.637 for clostridium cluster iv; 6.65 +/- 1.23 log(10)/g, 6.57 +/- 1.52 log(10)/g, 9.13 +/- 0.96 log(10)/g, p(1) < 0.0001,  p(2) </= 0.0001, p(3) = 0.9317 for clostridium cluster xiva; 4.57 +/- 1.44 log(10)/g, 4.63 +/- 1.34 log(10)/g, 7.05 +/- 2.48 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.012, p(2) = 0.0357, p(3) = 0.7973 for collinsella spp.; 7.66 +/- 1.50 log(10)/g, 7.60 +/- 1.05 log(10)/g, 10.02 +/- 2.02 log(10)/g, p(1) </= 0.0001, p(2) = 0.0013, p(3) =  0.9919 for f. prausnitzsii; 6.17 +/- 1.3 log(10)/g, 5.85 +/- 0.93 log(10)/g, 7.25 +/- 1.01 log(10)/g, p(1) = 0.0243, p(2) = 0.0319, p(3) = 0.6982 for veillonella spp.; 4.68 +/- 1.21 log(10)/g, 4.71 +/- 0.83 log(10)/g, 5.70 +/- 2.00 log(10)/g,  p(1) = 0.1927, p(2) = 0.0605, p(3) = 0.6476 for enterobacteriaceae). the bifidobacterium spp. counts correlated significantly between mucosal sites and mucosal and faecal samples (pearson correlation coefficients 0.62, p = 0.040 and  0.81, p = 0.005 between the right mucosal sample and faeces and the left mucosal  sample and faeces, respectively). conclusion: non-invasive faecal samples do not  reflect bacterial counts on the mucosa at the individual level, except for bifidobacteria often analysed in probiotic intervention studies.

TI  == functional metagenomics reveals novel salt tolerance loci from the human gut microbiome.
AB  == metagenomics is a powerful tool that allows for the culture-independent analysis  of complex microbial communities. one of the most complex and dense microbial ecosystems known is that of the human distal colon, with cell densities reaching  up to 10(12) per gram of faeces. with the majority of species as yet uncultured,  there are an enormous number of novel genes awaiting discovery. in the current study, we conducted a functional screen of a metagenomic library of the human gut microbiota for potential salt-tolerant clones. using transposon mutagenesis, three genes were identified from a single clone exhibiting high levels of identity to a species from the genus collinsella (closest relative being collinsella aerofaciens) (colaer_01955, colaer_01957 and colaer_01981), a high g+c, gram-positive member of the actinobacteria commonly found in the human gut.  the encoded proteins exhibit a strong similarity to gale, murb and mazg. furthermore, pyrosequencing and bioinformatic analysis of two additional fosmid clones revealed the presence of an additional gale and mazg gene, with the highest level of genetic identity to akkermansia muciniphila and eggerthella sp.  yy7918, respectively. cloning and heterologous expression of the genes in the osmosensitive strain, escherichia coli mkh13, resulted in increased salt tolerance of the transformed cells. it is hoped that the identification of atypical salt tolerance genes will help to further elucidate novel salt tolerance mechanisms, and will assist our increased understanding how resident bacteria cope with the osmolarity of the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == gut microbiota composition is associated with body weight, weight gain and biochemical parameters in pregnant women.
AB  == obesity is associated with complications during pregnancy and increased health risks in the newborn. the objective of the present study was to establish possible relationships between gut microbiota, body weight, weight gain and biochemical parameters in pregnant women. fifty pregnant women were classified according to their bmi in normal-weight (n 34) and overweight (n 16) groups. gut  microbiota composition was analysed by quantitative real-time pcr in faeces and biochemical parameters in plasma at 24 weeks of pregnancy. reduced numbers of bifidobacterium and bacteroides and increased numbers of staphylococcus, enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli were detected in overweight compared with normal-weight pregnant women. e. coli numbers were higher in women with excessive weight gain than in women with normal weight gain during pregnancy, while bifidobacterium and akkermansia muciniphila showed an opposite trend. in the whole population, increased total bacteria and staphylococcus numbers were related to increased plasma cholesterol levels. increased bacteroides numbers were related to increased hdl-cholesterol and folic acid levels, and reduced tag  levels. increased bifidobacterium numbers were related to increased folic acid levels. increased enterobacteriaceae and e. coli numbers were related to increased ferritin and reduced transferrin, while bifidobacterium levels showed the opposite trend. therefore, gut microbiota composition is related to body weight, weight gain and metabolic biomarkers during pregnancy, which might be of  relevance to the management of the health of women and infants.
