TI  - Nisin-induced expression of a recombinant antihypertensive peptide in dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve the process for the production of milk-derived antihypertensive peptides, including a 12-residue peptide (FFVAPFPECVGK) from alphaS1-casein. RESULTS: A synthetic gene encoding this peptide was cloned within the pediocin operon, replacing the nucleic acid sequence encoding the mature pediocin peptide (papA) and resulting in a translational fusion between the pediocin leader peptide and the 12-residue hypotensive (C-12) peptide. The recombinant operon was subsequently cloned immediately downstream of the nisA promoter to allow for inducible gene expression within Streptococcus thermophilus ST128, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ML3 and Lactobacillus casei C2. RT-PCR was used to confirm recombinant gene expression in complex medium; and SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the pediocin secretion machinery, encoded by papC and papD, allowed for secretion of the recombinant peptide from both L. lactis ML3 and L. casei C2 in a chemically defined medium. CONCLUSION: The use of a nisin as a "food-grade" inducer molecule, and generally-regarded-as-safe LAB species suggests that this system could be used for the production of functional food ingredients.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  - The water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical Italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving Brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable LAB isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. Samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of Brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculineC. The LAB were characterized by Gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of CO2 from glucose. The diversity of LAB was evaluated by RAPD-PCR (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction), 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and by Vitek 2 system. Twenty LAB strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different clusters, and identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus helveticus. Enterococcus species were dominant and citrate-positive. Only the strains of L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and L. fermentum produced CO2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while L. casei was only citrate positive. This is the first report which elucidates the LAB diversity involved in Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. Furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the LAB species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.
TI  - Molecular characterization of Lactobacillus plantarum DMDL 9010, a strain with efficient nitrite degradation capacity.
AB  - Nitrites commonly found in food, especially in fermented vegetables, are potential carcinogens. Therefore, limiting nitrites in food is critically important for food safety. A Lactobacillus strain (Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010) was previously isolated from fermented vegetables by our group, and is not yet fully characterized. A number of phenotypical and genotypical approaches were employed to characterize Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010. Its nitrite degradation capacity was compared with four other Lactobacillus strains, including Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 719, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricu 1.83, Streptococcus thermophilus 1.204, and lactobacillus plantarum 8140, on MRS medium. Compared to these four Lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 had a significantly higher nitrite degradation capacity (P<0.001). Based on 16S rDNA sequencing and sequence comparison, Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 was identified as either Lactobacillus plantarum or Lactobacillus pentosus. To further identify this strain, the flanking regions (922 bp and 806 bp upstream and downstream, respectively) of the L-lactate dehydrogenase 1 (L-ldh1) gene were amplified and sequenced. Lactobacillus sp. DMDL 9010 had 98.92 and 76.98% sequence identity in the upstream region with L. plantarum WCFS1 and L. pentosus IG1, respectively, suggesting that Lactobacillu sp. DMDL 9010 is an L. plantarum strain. It was therefore named L. plantarum DMDL 9010. Our study provides a platform for genetic engineering of L. plantarum DMDL 9010, in order to further improve its nitrite degradation capacity.
TI  - Immunoreactivity of lactic acid-treated mare's milk after simulated digestion.
AB  - The similarity of mare's milk to breast milk makes it an interesting substrate for the creation of dairy beverages. The aim of this study was to determine the immunoreactivity of the digested mare's milk products carried out by lactic acid fermentation with Lactobacillus casei LCY, Streptococcus thermophilus MK10 and Bifidobacterium animalis Bi30. Simulation of digestion with saliva, pepsin and pancreatin/bile salts was carried out. The immunoreactivity of the milk proteins was assessed by competitive ELISA. The separation of proteins was studied using a tricine SDS-PAGE method. It has been demonstrated that lactic acid fermentation significantly decreases the immunoreactivity of beta-lactoglobulin, beta-casein, kappa-casein and bovine serum albumin. The level of reduction was connected to the type of bacterial strain. The simulated digestion processes caused the decline of immunoreactivity, and the decreases obtained in the experiment were as follows: lactoferrin: 95%, beta-lactoglobulin: 94%, beta-casein: 93%, alpha-lactalbumin: 82%, alpha-casein: 82%, bovine serum albumin: 76% and kappa-casein: 37%. The results of the study indicated that microbial fermentation with tested strains is a valuable method for reducing the immunoreactivity of mare's milk proteins. However, further studies with other bacterial strains are needed to gain a higher level of elimination or total reduction of mare's milk immunoreactivity to possibly introduce fermented mare's milk into the diet of patients with immune-mediated digestive problems.
TI  - Probiotics for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is common in intensive care units (ICUs). Some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of VAP. Several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing VAP in ICUs. We aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of VAP. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing VAP. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 8), MEDLINE (1948 to September week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (2010 to September 2014). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding RCTs that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent VAP. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight RCTs, with 1083 participants. All studies compared a form of probiotic (Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; Lactobacillus plantarum; Synbiotic 2000FORTE; Ergyphilus; combination Bifidobacterium longum + Lactobacillus bulgaricus + Streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). The analysis of all RCTs showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of VAP (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). However, the aggregated results were uncertain for ICU mortality (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of ICU stay (mean difference (MD) -1.60, 95% CI -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (MD -6.15, 95% CI -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). Antibiotics for VAP were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (MD -3.00, 95% CI -6.04 to 0.04). However, the CI of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. There were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.The overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'Risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. The study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.To explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. However, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of VAP. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of VAP. However, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of VAP increased the uncertainty in this finding. The available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in ICU or hospital mortality with probiotic use. Three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no clear evidence of a difference. The results of this meta-analysis do not provide sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics for the prevention of VAP in ICU patients.
TI  - Microbial ecology dynamics reveal a succession in the core microbiota involved in the ripening of pasta filata caciocavallo pugliese cheese.
AB  - Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA targeting RNA, community-level physiological profiles made with Biolog EcoPlates, proteolysis, and volatile component (VOC) analyses were mainly used to characterize the manufacture and ripening of the pasta filata cheese Caciocavallo Pugliese. Plate counts revealed that cheese manufacture affected the microbial ecology. The results agreed with those from culture-independent approaches. As shown by urea-PAGE, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), and free-amino-acid (FAA) analyses, the extent of secondary proteolysis mainly increased after 30 to 45 days of ripening. VOCs and volatile free fatty acids (VFFA) were identified by a purge-and-trap method (PT) and solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. Except for aldehydes, the levels of most of VOCs and VFFA mainly increased from 30 to 45 days onwards. As shown through pyrosequencing analysis, raw cows' milk was contaminated by Firmicutes (53%), Proteobacteria (39%), Bacteroidetes (7.8%), Actinobacteria (0.06%), and Fusobacteria (0.03%), with heterogeneity at the genus level. The primary starter Streptococcus thermophilus dominated the curd population. Other genera occurred at low incidence or sporadically. The microbial dynamics reflected on the overall physiological diversity. At 30 days, a microbial succession was clearly highlighted. The relative abundance of Streptococcus sp. and especially St. thermophilus decreased, while that of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sp., and especially Lactobacillus paracasei increased consistently. Despite the lower relative abundance compared to St. thermophilus, mesophilic lactobacilli were the only organisms positively correlated with the concentration of FAAs, area of hydrophilic peptide peaks, and several VOCs (e.g., alcohols, ketones, esters and all furans). This study showed that a core microbiota was naturally selected during middle ripening, which seemed to be the main factor responsible for cheese ripening.
TI  - Synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  - AIM: Infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. Results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. In a randomised clinical trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. METHODS: Fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion CFU of: Lactobacillus casei, L. rhamnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, L. acidophilus, B. infantis, L. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (Protexin Healthcare, Somerset, UK), or placebo daily for 30 days. Parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. The primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). RESULTS: The treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (P < 0.005). At day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (P < 0.01). Symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (P < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, P = 0.24). We encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. CONCLUSION: This synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus FOS) significantly improved colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.
TI  - Probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. Little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. Six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (pH, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees C), as well as sensory preference among them. Decreases in pH (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. Only the yogurt with S. thermophilus, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and L. reuteri differed in firmness. No differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. Syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. No changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. Counts of S. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. Counts of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. Probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/mL for 3 wk. Probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of L. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/mL for 35 d, of L. casei for 7d, and of L. reuteri for 14 d. We found no significant sensory preference among the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. However, the yogurt and fermented milk made with L. casei were better accepted. This study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal Travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in the Vlasic mountain region of central Bosnia and Herzegovina near the town of Travnik over a four season period. These three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. Preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-PCR with a (GTG)5 primer and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 LAB isolates obtained from all the examined samples. Fifteen species were identified as follows: Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus italicus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus mitis. A wide genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the Lc. lactis strains. In all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. Forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the total LAB isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.
TI  - [Identification of lactic acid bacteria in commercial yogurt and their antibiotic resistance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in commercial yogurts and investigate their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: LABs were cultured from 5 yogurt brands and the isolates were identified at the species level by 16S rRNA sequence. Genotyping was performed by repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR). The sensitivity to 7 antibiotics was tested for all LAB isolates by Kirby-Bauer paper diffusion (K-B method). Meanwhile, 9 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including erythromycin resistance genes (ermA and ermB) and tetracycline resistance genes (tetM, tetK, tetS, tetQ, tetO, tetL and tetW), were detected by PCR amplification in the identified LAB isolates. The PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. RESULTS: Total 100 LABs were isolated, including 23 Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 26 Lactobacillus casei, 30 Streptococcus thermophilus, 5 Lactobacillus acidophilus, 6 Lactobacillus plantarum, and 10 Lactobacillus paracasei. The drug susceptibility test shows that all 100 isolates were resistant to gentamicin and streptomycin, 42 isolates were resistant to vancomycin, and on the contrary all were sensitive to cefalexin, erythromycin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline. Moreover, 5 ARGs were found in the 28 sequencing confirmed isolates, ermB gene was detected in 8 isolates, tet K in 4 isolates, tetL in 2 isolates, tetM in 4 isolates, tetO in 2 isolates. erm A, tet S, tet Q and tet W genes were not detected in the isolates. Antibiotic resistance genes were found in 53.57% (15/28) sequenced isolates, 2 -3 antibiotic resistance genes were detected in 4 isolates of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. CONCLUSIONS: Some LABs were not labeled in commercial yogurt products. Antibiotic resistance genes tend to be found in the starter culture of L. delbrueckii ssp. Bulgaricus and S. thermophilus. All the LAB isolates were sensitive to erythromycin and tetracycline, even though some carried erythromycin and/or tetracycline resistance genes. We proved again that LAB could carry antibiotic resistance gene(s) though it is sensitive to antibiotics.
TI  - Viability of probiotic Lactobacillus casei in yoghurt: defining the best processing step to its addition.
AB  - Probiotics are live microorganisms capable of producing beneficial effects on its host when consumed in adequate amounts. To exert these effects, foods must contain probiotic microorganisms in populations above 10(6) CFU/g or mL throughout its shelf life. One of the strategies to ensure high population of probiotics in fermented milk is to add them during or after the fermentation process separately from the starter cultures. The objective of this study was to investigate the behavior of the probiotic microorganism Lactobacillus casei added to yoghurt in different stages of production. Yoghurts with L. casei were produced at different stages: before addition of starter (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), added together with this culture and at the end of fermentation. Yoghurt without probiotic added was produced as a control. The products were stored at 4 degrees C and analyzed after 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of storage. In these periods, the populations ofprobiotic and starter cultures were enumerated and the parameters pH and acidity were analyzed. The results were evaluated using analysis of variance and Tukey's test, both at 5% significance level. L. casei remained viable in populations of more than 10(8) CFU / g during 21 days of storage, which is suitable to define the formulations as probiotics. When the different stages of the addition of probiotics in yoghurts were evaluated there was no statistical difference between the formulations (p < 0.05) for populations of L. casei except for the first day of storage.
TI  - Genetic engineering techniques for lactic acid bacteria: construction of a stable shuttle vector and expression vector for beta-glucuronidase.
AB  - The shuttle vector, pUL6erm, was constructed by using a replicon from pL2, a multiple cloning site, colE1 ori, the ori of Gram-negative bacteria from vector pUC19, and the erythromycin resistance gene from pVA838 as a selection marker. pUL6erm could be transformed easily and maintained stably in Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus casei. Transformation assays of pUL6erm indicated that it had a narrow host range. beta-Glucuronidase was induced in the presence of 0.3 M NaCl and 50 mM glutamate and expressed at 2.4 U mg(-1) with the expression vector (pUL6erm-gadR-GUS) constructed based on pUL6erm carrying beta-glucuronidase gene wuth a chloride-inducible (gadR) expression cassette using Pgad as promoter. Therefore, pUL6erm and pUL6erm-gadR-GUS might be a safe and useful genetic tool for the improvement of lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-CRP, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-CRP, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. METHODS: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. Subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. The multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: Lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) CFU), L. casei (7 x 10(9) CFU), L. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) CFU), L. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) CFU), Bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) CFU), B. longum (7 x 10(9) CFU), Streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) CFU), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-CRP, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (GSH). RESULTS: Between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in FPG (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). Although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. We observed a significant increase in HOMA-IR (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). Mean changes in serum hs-CRP were significantly different between the two groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group, p = 0.02). Probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma GSH levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in FPG and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-CRP and an increase in plasma total GSH.
TI  - Significant effect of Ca2+ on improving the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has been extensively investigated due to its highly practical significance. Reconstituted skim milk (RSM) has been found to be one of the most effective protectant wall materials for microencapsulating microorganisms during convective drying, such as spray drying. In addition to proteins and carbohydrate, RSM is rich in calcium. It is not clear which component is critical in the RSM protection mechanism. This study investigated the independent effect of calcium. Ca(2+) was added to lactose solution to examine its influence on the heat resistance of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ZY, Lactobacillus casei Zhang, Lactobacillus plantarum P8 and Streptococcus thermophilus ND03. The results showed that certain Ca(2+) concentrations enhanced the heat resistance of the LAB strains to different extents, that is produced higher survival and shorter regrowth lag times of the bacterial cells. In some cases, the improvements were dramatic. More scientifically insightful and more intensive instrumental study of the Ca(2+) behavior around and in the cells should be carried out in the near future. In the meantime, this work may lead to the development of more cost-effective wall materials with Ca(2+) added as a prime factor.
TI  - Effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: A bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients may be modulated by probiotics. We assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic IBS symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating IBS symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), where appropriate. The random-effects model was employed in cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. RESULTS: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. Probiotics improved pain scores if they contained Bifidobacterium breve (SMD, - 0.34; 95% CI, - 0.66; -0.02), Bifidobacterium longum (SMD, -0.48; 95% CI, - 0.91; -0.06), or Lactobacillus acidophilus (SMD, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.61; -0.01) species. Distension scores were improved by probiotics containing B. breve (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.77; -0.13), Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.00; -0.06) species. All probiotic species tested improved flatulence: B. breve (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.75;- 0.10), B. infantis, L. casei, L. plantarum (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -1.07; -0.13), B. longum, L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (SMD, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.01; -0.21). There was not a clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for IBS patients, and the effects on each IBS symptom are likely species-specific. Future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.
TI  - Increasing antioxidant activity of procyanidin extracts from the pericarp of Litchi chinensis processing waste by two probiotic bacteria bioconversions.
AB  - Litchi chinensis pericarp from litchi processing waste is an important plant source of A-type procyanidins, which were considered a natural dietary supplement because of their high biological activity in vivo. Litchi pericarp oligomeric procyanidins (LPOPCs) did not selectively modify the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus casei -01 at concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL, and it was demonstrated that the two strains could transform procyanidins during their log period of growth by two different pathways. S. thermophilus was able to metabolize procyanidin A2 to its isomer, and L. casei could decompose flavan-3-ols into 3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, m-coumaric acid, and p-coumaric acid. The total antioxidant capability (T-AOC) of LPOPCs before and after microbial incubation was estimated, and the results suggested that probiotic bacteria bioconversion is a feasible and efficient method to convert litchi pericarp procyanidins to a more effective antioxidant agent.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - The effect of NaCl substitution with KCl on Akawi cheese: chemical composition, proteolysis, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity, probiotic survival, texture profile, and sensory properties.
AB  - The effect of partial substitution of NaCl with KCl on Akawi cheese with probiotic bacteria was investigated during 30 d of storage at 4 degrees C. Chemical composition, the survival of probiotic and lactic acid bacteria, proteolytic activity, and texture profile analysis were analyzed and sensory analysis was carried out to determine the effects of substitution. No significant differences were observed in moisture, protein, fat, and ash contents among the experimental Akawi cheeses at the same storage period. Significant differences were observed in water-soluble nitrogen and phosphotungstic-soluble nitrogen between experimental cheeses at the same of storage period. No significant difference was observed in the growth of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus between experimental cheeses at the same storage period. However, the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus was significantly affected among experimental cheeses. A significant difference was observed in soluble Ca among experimental cheeses at the same storage period. In general, no significant differences existed in hardness and adhesiveness among experimental cheeses at the same storage period. No significant differences existed in sensory attributes, including creaminess, bitterness, saltiness, sour-acid, and vinegar taste among experimental Akawi cheeses at the same storage period.
TI  - Incorporation of Lactobacillus casei in Iranian ultrafiltered Feta cheese made by partial replacement of NaCl with KCl.
AB  - Probiotic Iranian ultrafiltered Feta cheese was produced from ultrafiltration of  milk with a volumetric concentration factor of 4.5:1. The heat-treated retentates were inoculated with 10(7) cfu of Lactobacillus casei LAFTI L26/mL. A mesophilic-thermophilic mixed culture of Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and Streptococcus thermophilus was also used. Three percent (wt/wt) salt with different ratios of NaCl:KCl (100% NaCl, 50% NaCl:50% KCl, 75% NaCl:25% KCl, and 25% NaCl:75% KCl) were used in cheese formulation. The viability of L. casei was determined in treatments during the ripening period (90d at 5 degrees C) within 15-d intervals. The pH, titratable acidity, and redox potential changes were monitored throughout the mentioned period. The mean pH drop rate, mean acidity increase rate, and mean redox potential increase rate were calculated at the end of the storage period. Also, total nitrogen, water-soluble nitrogen, lactic acid, and acetic acid concentrations, and syneresis and sensory characteristics of the product were measured during the mentioned period every 30d. The maximum viability of L. casei was observed within d 15 to 30 of the ripening period in the treatment containing the lowest amount of sodium. Addition of KCl enhanced syneresis. Cheeses with NaCl alone and with only 25% replacement by KCl have the highest sensory acceptability.
TI  - Isolation and identification of cultivable lactic acid bacteria in traditional yak milk products of Gansu Province in China.
AB  - Various traditional fermented yak milk and raw milk foods could be considered as  an abundant resource for obtaining novel lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with unique properties. Eighty-eight samples of yak milk products were collected from Gansu Province in China. Three hundred and nineteen strains of LAB isolated from these samples were identified by phenotypic methods, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technology. Among the isolates, one hundred and sixty-four isolates (51.41% of the total) were classified under Lactobacilli, and one hundred and fifty-five (48.59%) belonged to cocci. All the isolates were classified to six genera (Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus, Enterococcus and Weissella) and twenty-one species. Lactobacillus helveticus (87 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (49 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (39 strains), Lactobacillus casei (31 strains) and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (19 strains) were considered as the predominant populations in the yak milk products. The results showed that there were abundant genus and species LAB existing in yak milk products in Gansu Province in China. The obtained LAB pure cultures may be a valuable source for further starter selection.
TI  - Diversity in growth and protein degradation by dairy relevant lactic acid bacteria species in reconstituted whey.
AB  - The high nutritional value of whey makes it an interesting substrate for the development of fermented foods. The aim of this work was to evaluate the growth and proteolytic activity of sixty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria in whey to further formulate a starter culture for the development of fermented whey-based beverages. Fermentations were performed at 37 degrees C for 24 h in 10 and 16% (w/v) reconstituted whey powder. Cultivable populations, pH, and proteolytic activity (o-phthaldialdehyde test) were determined at 6 and 24 h incubation. Hydrolysis of whey proteins was analysed by Tricine SDS-PAGE. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to evaluate the behaviour of strains. Forty-six percent of the strains grew between 1 and 2 Deltalog CFU/ml while 19% grew less than 0.9 Deltalog CFU/ml in both reconstituted whey solutions. Regarding the proteolytic activity, most of the lactobacilli released amino acids and small peptides during the first 6 h incubation while streptococci consumed the amino acids initially present in whey to sustain growth. Whey proteins were degraded by the studied strains although to different extents. Special attention was paid to the main allergenic whey protein, beta-lactoglobulin, which was degraded the most by Lactobacillus acidophilus CRL 636 and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CRL 656. The strain variability observed and the PCA applied in this study allowed selecting appropriate strains able to improve the nutritional characteristics (through amino group release and protein degradation) and storage (decrease in pH) of whey.
TI  - Rapid and accurate bacterial identification in probiotics and yoghurts by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
AB  - Probiotic food is manufactured by adding probiotic strains simultaneously with starter cultures in fermentation tanks. Here, we investigate the accuracy and feasibility of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for bacterial identification at the species level in probiotic food and yoghurts. Probiotic food and yoghurts were cultured in Columbia and Lactobacillus specific agar and tested by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for the detection and quantification of Lactobacillus sp. Bacterial identification was performed by MALDI-TOF analysis and by amplification and sequencing of tuf and 16S rDNA genes. We tested 13 probiotic food and yoghurts and we identified by qPCR that they presented 10(6) to 10(7) copies of Lactobacillus spp. DNA/g. All products contained very large numbers of living bacteria varying from 10(6) to 10(9) colony forming units/g. These bacteria were identified as Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium animalis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus thermophilus. MALDI-TOF MS presented 92% specificity compared to the molecular assays. In one product we found L. lactis, instead of Bifidus spp. which was mentioned on the label and for another L. delbrueckii and S. thermophilus instead of Bifidus spp. MALDI-TOF MS allows a rapid and accurate bacterial identification at the species level in probiotic food and yoghurts. Although the safety and functionality of probiotics are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified. Practical Application: MALDI-TOF MS is rapid and specific for the identification of bacteria in probiotic food and yoghurts. Although the safety and functionality of probiotics are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified.
TI  - [Development of pulsed field gel electrophoresis and application for characterization and identification of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) method for molecular typing of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) and to apply it in identification and characterization of both bacteria isolated from yoghurt collected from Beijing supermarket. METHODS: The five most useful restriction enzymes including Apa I, Not I, Sfi I, Xba I and Sma I were chosen to cut DNA of 52 strains of Lactobacillus, S. thermophilus as well as associated standard bacteria strains. The endonucleases and electrophoresis conditions for PFGE analysis were optimized and applied in molecular typing of Lactobacillus and S.thermophilus isolates. Cluster analysis based on the PFGE data was conducted. The identification results of PFGE were compared with those obtained in biochemical and 16s ribosomal RNA PCR identification tests. RESULTS: Not I was suitable for L. bulgaricus, L. fermentum and L. delbrueckii digestion. While Apa I was an appropriate endonuclease for S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus and L. casei digestion. The results of molecular typing indicated that 24 strains of L.bulgaricus and 15 strains of S. thermophilus were grouped into 8 types by PFGE method, respectively. While 7 strains of L.acidophilus were grouped into 3 types and 2 strains of L. delbrueckii were grouped into 2 different PFGE types. CONCLUSION: The results of PFGE analysis are in compliance with those of 16s rRNA PCR and biochemical identification. The PFGE method developed in this study is suitable for molecular characterization of both Lactobacillus and S. thermophilus.
TI  - Manufacture of Fior di Latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - This work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to Fior di Latte (high-moisture cow milk Mozzarella) cheese. First, 18 probiotic strains belonging to Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus reuteri were screened. Resistance to heating (65 or 55 degrees C for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. Adaptation at 42 degrees C for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees C for 10 min of all probiotic lactobacilli. Heat-adapted L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus SP5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees C of 227.4 min) and L. paracasei BGP1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees C of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for the manufacture of Fior di Latte cheese. Two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (Streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. As determined by random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR and 16S rRNA gene analyses, the cell density of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus SP5 and L. paracasei BGP1 in chemically or biologically acidified Fior di Latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. Microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus SP5 and L. paracasei BGP1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of Fior di Latte cheeses.
TI  - The fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in Danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR.
AB  - The purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in Danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rDNA and cDNA. Furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on survival of added Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua and Staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR. A high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. Bacteria belonging to the genera Brevibacterium, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Weissella, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus were also detected in both 16S rDNA and cDNA obtained from raw milk and cheeses. E. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both DNA and RNA extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. Growth of E. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of raw milk. Growth of L. innocua and S. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all cheeses at different stages of ripening. The use of 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.
TI  - Probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  - Probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. Diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. This review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or Clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. Rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. For prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. Probiotics tested were Lactobacillus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus (not GG), and Lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. The evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. In the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of India, again with modest efficacy. Previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. More recently, a large trial in Poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for Lactobacillus GG. The prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both in children and in adults. Most commonly used probiotics were Lactobacillus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium ssp, Streptococcus ssp, and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. In general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii. Evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. As for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. The vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly Lactobacillus GG and S. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. Such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day. The effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.
TI  - Utilization of UF-permeate for production of beta-galactosidase by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Four lactobacilli strains (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacilus casei and Lactobacillus reuteri) were grown in MRS broth and three lactococci strains (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. Lactis and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetilactis) were grown in M17 broth. L. reuteri and S. thermophilus were chosen on the basis of the best mean beta-galactosidase activity of 10.44 and 10.01 U/ml respectively, for further studies on permeate-based medium. The maximum production of beta-galactosidase by L. reuteri was achieved at lactose concentration of 6%, initial pH 5.0-7.5, ammonium phosphate as nitrogen source at a concentration of 0.66 g N/L and incubation temperature at 30 degrees C/24 hrs to give 6.31 U/ml. While in case of S. thermophilus, maximum beta-galactosidase production was achieved at 10% lactose concentration of permeate medium, supplemented with phosphate buffer ratio of 0.5:0.5 (KH2PO4:K2HPO4, g/L), at initial pH 6.0-6.5, ammonium phosphate (0.66g N/L) as nitrogen source and incubation temperature 35 degrees C for 24 hrs to give 7.85 U/ml.
TI  - Effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  - Food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. This study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape seed extract (GSE) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a GSE fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (GSE-M). On the other hand, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the GSE fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (GSE-O) fraction. Within bifidobacteria, Bifidobacterium lactis BB12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas Bifidobacterium breve 26M2 and Bifidobacterium bifidum HDD541 reached maximum growth in presence of GSE-O and GSE-M fractions. Metabolism of flavan-3-ols by LAB and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. The results revealed that only L. plantarum IFPL935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. An unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in L. plantarum IFPL935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.
TI  - Selective and differential enumerations of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium spp. in yoghurt--a review.
AB  - Yoghurt is increasingly being used as a carrier of probiotic bacteria for their potential health benefits. To meet with a recommended level of >/=10(6) viable cells/g of a product, assessment of viability of probiotic bacteria in market preparations is crucial. This requires a working method for selective enumeration of these probiotic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria in yoghurt such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. casei and Bifidobacterium. This chapter presents an overview of media that could be used for differential and selective enumerations of yoghurt bacteria. De Man Rogosa Sharpe agar containing fructose (MRSF), MRS agar pH 5.2 (MRS 5.2), reinforced clostridial prussian blue agar at pH 5.0 (RCPB 5.0) or reinforced clostridial agar at pH 5.3 (RCA 5.3) are suitable for enumeration of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus when the incubation is carried out at 45 degrees C for 72h. S. thermophilus (ST) agar and M17 are recommended for selective enumeration of S. thermophilus. Selective enumeration of Lb. acidophilus in mixed culture could be made in Rogosa agar added with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (X-Glu) or MRS containing maltose (MRSM) and incubation in a 20% CO2 atmosphere. Lb. casei could be selectively enumerated on specially formulated Lb. casei (LC) agar from products containing yoghurt starter bacteria (S. thermophilus and Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), Lb. acidophilus, Bifidobacterium spp. and Lb. casei. Bifidobacterium could be enumerated on MRS agar supplemented with nalidixic acid, paromomycin, neomycin sulphate and lithium chloride (MRS-NPNL) under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72h.
TI  - Characterization of the cysK2-ctl1-cysE2 gene cluster involved in sulfur metabolism in Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The up- and downstream regions of ctl1 and ctl2 that encode a cystathionine lyase were analyzed in various Lactobacillus casei strains. ctl1 and ctl2 were found to be part of a gene cluster encoding two other open reading frames. One of the two open reading frames precedes ctl1 and encodes a putative cysteine synthase. The other open reading frame lies downstream of ctl1 and encodes a putative serine acetyltransferase. The gene cluster is not present in the publicly available genome sequences of L. casei ATCC 334, BL23 and Zhang. Apparently, the gene cluster was acquired by a horizontal gene transfer event and can also be found in other lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of the gene cluster. Additionally, an mass spectrometry-based selected reaction monitoring method was developed for quantifying Ctl1 in a cell-free extract of lactic acid bacteria. The gene cluster cysK2-ctl1-cysE2 was expressed as single transcript, and expression was down-regulated by cysteine. In addition, cystathionine lyase activity present in cell-free extracts disappeared when L. casei was grown in the presence of cysteine. Whereas the transcript and the gene product of ctl1 protein were found in all studied ctl1(+)L. casei strains, only the transcript but not the protein or cystathionine lyase activity was detected in L. helveticus FAM2888, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus ATCC 11842 and S. thermophilus FAM17014, which actually possess a homolog of the cysK2-ctl1-cysE2 gene cluster.
TI  - Bioconversion of ovine scotta into lactic acid with pure and mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Scotta is the main by-product in the making of ricotta cheese. It is widely produced in southern Europe and particularly in Italy where it represents a serious environmental pollutant due to its high lactose content. With the aim of evaluating whether scotta bioconversion into lactic acid can be considered as an alternative to its disposal, besides providing it with an added value, here the growth, fermentative performances, and lactic acid productions of pure and mixed cultures of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus were evaluated on ovine scotta-based media, without and with the addition of nutritional supplements. The outcomes indicate that ovine scotta can be utilized for the biotechnological production of lactic acid with yields up to 92%, comparable to those obtained on cheese-whey. Indeed, the addition of nutritional supplements generally improves the fermentative performances of lactic acid bacteria leading to about 2 g l(-1) h(-1) of lactic acid. Moreover, the use of mixed cultures for scotta bioconversion reduces the need for nutritional supplements, with no detrimental effects on the productive parameters compared to pure cultures. Finally, by using L. casei and S. thermophilus in pure and mixed cultures, up to 99% optically pure L: -lactic acid can be obtained.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in Mongolia.
AB  - Spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in Mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in Mongolia. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/mL. Fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of LAB, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. In total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and M17 agar. Each isolate was considered to be presumptive LAB based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multiplex PCR assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. All isolates from Mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as Enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), Enterococcus durans (3 strains), Lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), Lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), Lactobacillus casei (16 strains), Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), Lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), Lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), Lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), Lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), Leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), Streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and Weissella cibaria (1 strain). The predominant LAB were Strep. thermophilus and Lb. helveticus, which were isolated from all sampling sites. The results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of Mongolia have complex compositions of LAB species. Such diversity of LAB provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.
TI  - Typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR to assess genetic diversity.
AB  - The recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. The current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified DNA, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. We have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactococcus lactis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. Initially, purified DNA and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. The conditions that were found to be optimal 8 muM of 10-mer primers, 3 muM magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. The RAPD genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) PFU mL(-1) were highly reproducible. Clustering by the Pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar DNA restriction pattern were indistinguishable. The results support the use of RAPD-PCR for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of their genetic diversity bypassing tedious DNA purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.
TI  - Comparison of culture-dependent and -independent methods for bacterial community  monitoring during Montasio cheese manufacturing.
AB  - The microbial community in milk is of great importance in the manufacture of traditional cheeses produced using raw milk and natural cultures. During milk curdling and cheese ripening, complex interactions occur in the microbial community, and accurate identification of the microorganisms involved provides essential information for understanding their role in these processes and in flavor production. Recent improvements in molecular biological methods have led to their application to food matrices, and thereby opened new perspectives for the study of microbial communities in fermented foods. In this study, a description of microbial community composition during the manufacture and ripening of Montasio cheese was provided. A combined approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods was applied. Culture-dependent identification was compared with 16S clone libraries sequencing data obtained from both DNA and reverse-transcribed RNA (cDNA) amplification and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays developed to detect and quantify specific bacterial species/genera (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp.). S. thermophilus was the predominant LAB species throughout the entire ripening period of Montasio cheese. The culture-independent method demonstrates the relevant presence of Pseudomonas spp. and Lactococcus piscium at the beginning of ripening. The culture-dependent approach and the two culture-independent approaches produced complementary information, together generating a general view of cheese microbial ecology.
TI  - Effects of multistrain probiotic-containing yogurt on second-line triple therapy  for Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The adjuvant effects of probiotic-containing yogurt on second-line triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection have not been evaluated. METHODS: A total of 337 patients with persistent H. pylori infection, after first-line triple therapy, were randomly assigned to receive either triple therapy with (yogurt group, n=151) or without (control group, n=186) Will yogurt. Triple therapy consisted of 400 mg moxifloxacin q.d., 1000 mg amoxicillin b.i.d., and 20 mg esomeprazole b.i.d. for 14 days. Will yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus. H. pylori eradication was evaluated by the (13)C-urea breath test, histology, or the rapid urease test. RESULTS: The eradication rates by intention-to-treat analysis were 66.7% and 68.9% in the control and yogurt groups, respectively (P=0.667). The eradication rates by per-protocol analysis were 78.5% and 86% in the control and the yogurt groups, respectively (P=0.110). The adverse event rates were 25.3% and 28.5% in the control group and yogurt group, respectively (P=0.508). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of yogurt containing probiotics to moxifloxacin-containing second-line treatment neither improved H. pylori eradication rates nor reduced the adverse events of treatment.
TI  - FTIR-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Greek Graviera cheese.
AB  - This study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (Fourier Transformed Infra-Red [FTIR] spectroscopy) and molecular (RFLP and SSCP analysis of 16S rRNA genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) flora present in traditional Greek Graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. A total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of TSAYE (incubated at 30 degrees C), M-17 (22 degrees C) and M-17 (42 degrees C) agar media were clustered by FTIR and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by all methods. Based on their FTIR spectra, 282 isolates were LAB grouped in 28 clusters. The LAB species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), Lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), Streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), Enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and Lactococcus lactis (0.7%). Also, Staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), Corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and Brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from TSAYE. Comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the LAB species identified. The present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid FTIR screening of 10-fold more isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant LAB species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of probiotics from yoghourt in Beijing].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To carry out isolation and the viable plate count of probiotics from yoghourt. To investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of strains to penicillin, gentamicin, ampicillin, vancomycin, clindamycin and erythromycin. METHODS: Probiotics were recovered and counted from yoghourt by plate count method. The recovered isolates were characterized by Gram's stain, biochemical test, antimicrobial susceptibility test. RESULTS: MRS medium and (36 +/- 1) degrees C were the optimum condition of culture. In total, 52 probiotic isolates were recovered from 31 yoghourt products, 12 (38.7%) products showed a lower probiotic quantity than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml of the national stantard, and 19 (61.3%) products were higher than 1 x 10(6) cfu/ml. Gram's stain showed that 37 isolates were gram positive bacilli and 15 isolates were positive coccus. These 52 isolates were grouped into six species by biochemical method, including L. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. All 52 isolates were susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin, one isolate was resistant to both clindamycin and erythromycin, four isolates were resistant to vancomycin. CONCLUSION: Most of yoghourt products contained sufficient viable probiotics as required by the national standard. A small quantity of isolates were resistant to some antimicrobials and multi -drug resistant isolates were also found.
TI  - Two strains of nonstarter lactobacilli increased the production of flavor compounds in soft cheeses.
AB  - The contribution to flavor generation and secondary proteolysis of 2 strains of mesophilic lactobacilli isolated from cheese was studied. Miniature soft cheeses (200 g) were produced with or without the inclusion of a culture of Lactobacillus plantarum I91 or Lactobacillus casei I90 in the starter composed of Streptococcus thermophilus. During ripening, cheeses containing the added lactobacilli showed an increased content of total free amino acids, but this increase was only significant in cheeses with Lb. plantarum I91. In addition, free amino acid profiles were modified by selective increases of some amino acids, such as Asp, Ser, Arg, Leu, and Phe. Cheeses inoculated with Lb. plantarum I91 or Lb. casei I90 were also characterized by a significantly higher concentration of diacetyl, a key flavor compound, and an increased content of acetoin. Results suggest an increase in the catabolism of either citrate or aspartate, with the production of the derived aroma compounds. Overall, aspartate content increased in both lactobacilli-added cheeses, whereas citrate was more or less constant, suggesting that aspartate could be the source of increased diacetyl and acetoin. A triangle aroma test showed that the addition of the lactobacilli strains significantly changed the sensory attributes of cheeses. At least 11 of 12 panelists commented that the aroma of cheeses with adjuncts was more buttery than that of control cheeses, which is desirable in most soft cheeses. Both Lb. plantarum I91 and Lb. casei I90 performed well as adjunct cultures by influencing cheese aroma development and cheese proteolysis.
TI  - [Identification of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a PCR method for identifying the 16S rRNA of Lactobacillus  and Streptococcus thermophilus at the species level. METHODS: Optimizing the method for DNA extraction and the conditions for PCR amplification. Joining the PCR amplification products from 16S rRNA to plasmid puc18-T and detecting the sequence. RESULTS: All 50 isolates recovered from yoghourt products were characterized by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and 7 groups were identified as L. bulgaricus (24 strains), S. thermophilus (12 strains), L. acidophilus (7 strains), L. casei (3 strains), L. delbrueckii (2 strains), L. fermentum (1 strain) and S. lutetiensis (1 strain). CONCLUSION: 16S rRNA PCR method developed in this research is a sensitive and reliable method for the identification of both Lactobacillus and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of Castelmagno PDO cheese.
AB  - The diversity, dynamics and activity of Castelmagno PDO cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the Grana Valley (northwest Italy), during the wintertime. Samples of milk, curd and cheese (core and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. In particular, DNA and RNA directly extracted from the matrices were studied by PCR-Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-DGGE. Culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species Streptococcus thermophilus and S. agalactiae. Then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with Lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of Castelmagno PDO ripening. At this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from Lactobacillus plantarum and Lb. casei. Culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of L. lactis, actively involved in both Castelmagno PDO manufacturing and ripening. Despite Lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a DGGE band referred to this microorganism was detected, at RNA level, in samples from ripened cheeses. On the other hand, Lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. Due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of Castelmagno PDO cheese.
TI  - Microbial stability and safety of traditional Greek Graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  - The microflora of four batches of traditional Greek Graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. The cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known LAB bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by PCR. All batches were safe according to the European Union regulatory criteria for Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. The cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few Streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and Leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. Enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and Enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant LAB from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. Sixteen E. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. In accordance, enterocin B gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin P gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin A, B, P, 31, L50A, and L50B genes. Plantaricin A gene was also amplified from all cheeses. Mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. Thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional Graviera cheese products, with LAB bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.
TI  - Decrease in frequency of liquid stool in enterally fed critically ill patients given the multispecies probiotic VSL#3: a pilot trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diarrhea has adverse consequences for critically ill patients, health care staff, and health care costs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of the multispecies probiotic VSL#3 in reducing the mean number of episodes of liquid stool in enterally fed critically ill patients. METHODS: A single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study was done in a 6-bed intensive care unit in a 330-bed public hospital in Australia. A total of 45 adults (20 intervention, 25 control) who required enteral nutrition for more than 72 hours were given VSL#3 or a placebo twice daily. The frequency (mean number of episodes per patient per day) and weight (grams per day) were determined for both liquid stool and liquid and loose (unformed) stool. RESULTS: The 2 groups of patients had no demographic or clinical differences. Patients received enteral nutrition for a mean of 8.5 days (SD, 5.4) and were studied for a mean of 11.9 days (SD, 5.6). Compared with the control group, the intervention group had a significant reduction in the frequency of liquid stools (incidence rate ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.93; P = .03). Smaller but still significant differences also occurred between the groups in both the frequency of episodes and the weight of liquid and loose (unformed) stool. CONCLUSION: VSL#3 was effective in reducing the frequency of liquid stool in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition. Probiotics possibly can minimize diarrhea in critically ill tube-fed patients, but more controlled clinical trials are needed.
TI  - Pategras cheese as a suitable carrier for six probiotic cultures.
AB  - The viability of five single-strain and one three-strain probiotic cultures was assessed during Pategras cheese ripening. Probiotics were inoculated into cheese-milk after a pre-incubation step - intended to improve their survival - or directly as a lyophilised culture; control cheeses without probiotics were also obtained. pH of probiotic and control cheeses was similar, except in probiotic cheeses containing the strain Lb. acidophilus B or the mixed culture. In these cases, the probiotic cheeses were more acid than their respective control cheeses. All the probiotics tested maintained counts above 107 cfu/g during the shelf-life settled for the product. Strains of the Lb. casei group: Lb. paracasei, Lb. casei and Lb. rhamnosus reached and kept the highest cell concentration during cheese ripening, followed by Lb. acidophilus and bifidobacteria. The direct addition of the probiotic cultures was more efficient than their inoculation after a pre-incubation step, for all the probiotics assayed. We have provided evidence that support the use of Pategras cheese as a performing food-based vehicle for probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of a novel LysM domain from Lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The endolysin Lyb5, from Lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phiPYB5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria. Sequence analysis revealed that the C terminus of the endolysin Lyb5 (Ly5C) contained three putative lysin motif (LysM) repeat regions, implying that Ly5C was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. To investigate the potential of Ly5C for surface display, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was fused to Ly5C at its N or C terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. After being mixed with various cells in vitro, GFP was successfully displayed on the surfaces of Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lb. brevis, Lb. plantarum, Lb. fermentum, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus cells. Increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated L. lactis and Lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for Ly5C. Moreover, the pH and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of GFP-Ly5C, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. All results suggested that Ly5C was a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (LAB). To demonstrate the applicability of the Ly5C-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) from Paenibacillus sp. strain K1, replacing GFP, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of LAB cells via Ly5C. The success in surface display of GFP and beta-Gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in LAB.
TI  - Nisin-induced expression of pediocin in dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To test whether a single vector, nisin-controlled expression (NICE) system  could be used to regulate expression of the pediocin operon in Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus casei. METHODS AND RESULTS: The intact pediocin operon was cloned immediately into pMSP3535 downstream of the nisA promoter (PnisA). The resulting vector, pRSNPed, was electrotransformed into Strep. thermophilus ST128, L. lactis subsp. lactis ML3 and Lact. casei C2. Presence of the intact vector was confirmed by PCR, resulting in the amplification of a 0.8-kb DNA fragment, and inhibition zones were observed for all lactic acid bacteria (LAB) transformants following induction with 50 ng ml(-1) nisin, when Listeria monocytogenes Scott A was used as the target bacterium. Using L. monocytogenes NR30 as target, the L. lactis transformants produced hazy zones of inhibition, while the Lact. casei transformants produced clear zones of inhibition. Zones of inhibition were not observed when the Strep. thermophilus transformants were tested against NR30. CONCLUSIONS: The LAB hosts were able to produce enough pediocin to inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes Scott A; the growth of L. monocytogenes NR30 was effectively inhibited only by the Lact. casei transformants. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that the NICE system has been used to express the intact pediocin operon in these LAB hosts. This system could allow for the in situ production of pediocin in fermented dairy foods supplemented with nisin to prevent listeria contamination.
TI  - Effect of probiotic supplementation on immunoglobulins, isoagglutinins and antibody response in children of low socio-economic status.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antigen exposure is one of the major exogenous factors modulating human immunocompetence acquisition. Decline in family size and improvements in public health and hygiene in developed countries, may deprive the immune system of appropriate antigen input by diminishing infectious stimuli. Probiotics are a large group of microorganisms defined by their beneficial effects on human health and with stimulating effects on different functions of the immune system. AIM OF THE STUDY: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if probiotics maintain their immune-stimulating effects in a population of 162 children with a high index of natural exposure to microorganisms. Children were to ingest for at least 4 months one of two products, low-fat milk fermented by Streptococcus thermophilus (control product) or low-fat milk fermented by S. thermophilus and Lactobacillus casei, with Lactobacillus acidophilus, oligofructose and inulin added after the fermentation process (test product). According to their age, children were vaccinated with DTP-Hib vaccine or a 23-valent anti-pneumococcal vaccine. RESULTS: Final analysis of results was done in 70 children in each group, showing that the rate of immunoglobulin and isoagglutinin acquisition was similar in both groups. There was no difference between groups in antibody levels neither before nor after vaccination. Days of fever and number of episodes of infection were not statistically different in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of standard fermented milk with additional probiotics was not of benefit. The high natural rate of early microbial exposure in infants and children from a population of low socio-economic status living in a "less hygienic environment" may account for the absence of an additional immune-stimulating effect by supplementary probiotics.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tarhana, a traditional Turkish fermented food.
AB  - Tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in Turkey. The aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated during processing of Tarhana. Samples were collected from eight different regions of Turkey. In order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of Tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. A total of 226 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from MRS, M17 and SBM (Slanetz and Bartley Medium). The isolates were grouped and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-PCR fingerprinting [(GTG)(5) primer], multiplex PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. Pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of the isolates, 19% were identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as Lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as Enterococcus faecium, 7% as Pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as Weissella cibaria, 2% as Lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as Leuconostoc citreum, 1% as Lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as Lactobacillus casei. The different production sites investigated all had individual LAB profiles, but with P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. The main source of P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.
TI  - Production of exopolysaccharides by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  - This work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the EPS-producing strains in milk. The strains belong to the species Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. The molar mass distribution of EPS fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some EPS from bacteria of food origin. In general, we detected an association between the EPS size distribution and the EPS-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial EPS tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. The main monosaccharide components of the EPS under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the galactose ratio in our human bacterial EPS. All EPS-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. The lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the EPS-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. With respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, L. plantarum H2 and L. rhamnosus E41 and E43R were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive control. Therefore, these human EPS-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. This is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of EPS isolated from human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Fermented goats' milk produced with selected multiple starters as a potentially functional food.
AB  - A screening among five lactic acid bacteria, used alone or in combination, led to select a mixed starter (Streptococcus thermophilus CR12, Lactobacillus casei LC01, Lactobacillus helveticus PR4, Lactobacillus plantarum 1288) capable to produce a fermented goats' milk containing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides. The fermented milk was characterized by cell counts of lactic acid bacteria not lower than 7.0 log cfu g(-1), even after 45 days of storage at 4 degrees C. Fermentation of goats' milk resulted in the production of ca. 28 mg kg(-1) of GABA. Furthermore the fermented goats' milk had an in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity of ca. 73%. Prolonged cold storage did not significantly affect both the concentration of GABA and the ACE-inhibitory activity. Moreover, the taurine content did not significantly vary during both fermentation and the entire storage period.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a strain-dependent cystathionine beta/gamma-lyase in Lactobacillus casei potentially involved in cysteine biosynthesis.
AB  - The trans-sulfuration pathways allow the interconversion of cysteine and methionine with the intermediary formation of cystathionine and homocysteine. The genome database of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 334 provides evidence that this species cannot synthesize cysteine from methionine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. However, several L. casei strains use methionine as the sole sulfur source, which implies that these strains can convert methionine to cysteine. Cystathionine synthases and lyases play a crucial role in the trans-sulfuration pathway. By applying proteomic techniques, we have identified a protein in cell-free extracts of L. casei, which showed high homology to a gene product encoded in the genome of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus helveticus but not in the genome of L. casei ATCC 334. The presence of the gene was only found in strains able to grow on methionine as the sole sulfur source. Moreover, two gene variants were identified. Both gene variants were cloned and expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzymes exhibited cystathionine lyase activity in vitro and also cleaved cysteine, homocysteine and methionine releasing volatile sulfur compounds.
TI  - Functionality of exopolysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria in an in vitro gastric system.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate whether slime-exopolysaccharides (EPS) or capsular-polysaccharide (CPS) production could protect the polymer-producing strains Streptococcus thermophilus CRL 1190 and Lactobacillus casei CRL 87 against the harsh conditions of an in vitro gastric system (GS). EPS stability on the GS was studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: An in vitro GS model containing human saliva and gastric juice was standardized. Polymer functionality on the cell viability and metabolic activity of the EPS-producing strains in the GS acidic conditions was evaluated. Two isogenic EPS/CPS deficient mutants were used for comparison. EPS or CPS conferred no significant protection on the cell viability of the studied strains after passage through the GS conditions. However, the phospho- and beta-galactosidase activities of the EPS(+) strains were higher than those of the EPS(-). Cytoplasmic alterations in the wild-type and mutant strains and partial degradation of both EPS were detected. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of EPS/CPS protected the metabolic activity of the assayed LAB strains, but had no effect on survival at low pH. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The presence of EPS/CPS as well as polymer resistance to the harsh conditions of the human GS could impact positively in probiotic strains to exert their properties in the host.
TI  - Potential of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria to induce a Th1 immune profile.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) might switch the Th2 biased immune response in allergic patients towards a balanced Th1/Th2 immune profile, leading to amelioration of allergy. To select strains of LAB that could be of potential application for foods in controlling allergy, 35 bacterial strains were screened in vitro using murine splenocytes and peritoneal exudate cells (PECs). Streptococcus thermophilus AHU1838 (FERM AP-21009), and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. casei AHU1839 (FERM AP-21010) enhanced the secretion of Th1 cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-12 (IL-12). The two strains of LAB also up-regulated the expression of CD40, and CD86 in dendritic cells (DCs), and activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). These two strains could therefore be used in producing fermented food products that can enhance the Th1 immune profile which is important in ameliorating allergy.
TI  - The effects of probiotics on PPI-triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate whether the addition of probiotics to proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy increases the likelihood of successful Helicobacter pylori eradication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty-seven H. pylori-infected patients were randomized into a triple-plus-yogurt group (yogurt group, n = 168) or a triple-only group (control group, n = 179). Triple therapy consisted of PPI b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. for 7 days. Yogurt group received triple therapy for 1 week and one bottle of Will yogurt per day for at 3 weeks, starting on the first day of triple therapy. Will yogurt (a Korean brand) contains Lactobacillus acidophilus HY2177, Lactobacillus casei HY2743, Bifidobacterium longum HY8001, and Streptococcus thermophilus B-1. (13)C-urea breath test was performed at least 4 weeks after completion of triple therapy. Eradication rates, compliances, and adverse events were compared. RESULTS: By intention-to treat analysis the H. pylori eradication rates in the yogurt group 79.2% (133 of 168) was similar to that in the control group 72.1% (129 of 179) (p = .124). However, by per-protocol (PP) analysis, the eradication rate in the yogurt group, 87.5% (133 of 152) was higher than that in the control group, 78.7% (129 of 164) (p = .037). Common adverse events were metallic taste (11.8%) and diarrhea (8.6%). The frequency of adverse effects in the yogurt group 41.1% (69/168) were higher than in the control group, 26.3% (47 of 179) (p = .003). However, most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity, and the severities of adverse effects were similar in both groups (p = .401). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of Will yogurt to triple therapy did not reduce the side-effects of triple therapy. But it increased the H. pylori eradication rate by PP analysis, encouraging more research in this field.
TI  - Microbiological, chemical, and sensory characteristics of Swiss cheese manufactured with adjunct Lactobacillus strains using a low cooking temperature.
AB  - The effect of nonstarter Lactobacillus adjunct cultures on the microbial, chemical, and sensory characteristics of Swiss cheese manufactured using the "kosher make procedure" was investigated. The kosher make procedure, which uses a lower cooking temperature than traditional Swiss cheese making, is used by many American cheese manufacturers to allow for kosher-certified whey. Cheeses were manufactured using a commercial starter culture combination and 1 of 3 non-starter Lactobacillus strains previously isolated from Swiss cheeses, Lactobacillus casei A26, L. casei B21, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus H2, as an adjunct. Control cheeses lacked the adjunct culture. Cheeses were analyzed during ripening for microbial and chemical composition. Adjunct strain L. casei A26, which utilized citrate most readily in laboratory medium, dominated the Lactobacillus population within 30 d, faster than the other adjunct cultures. There were no significant differences in Propionibacterium counts, Streptococcus thermophilus counts, protein, fat, moisture, salt, and pH among the cheeses. Free amino acid concentration ranged from 5 to 7 mmol/100 g of cheese at 90 d of ripening and was adjunct strain dependent. Lactic, acetic, and propionic acid concentrations were not significantly different among the cheeses after a 90-d ripening period; however differences in propionic acid concentrations were apparent at 60 d, with the cheeses made with L. casei adjuncts containing less propionic acid. Citric acid was depleted by the end of warm room ripening in cheeses manufactured with adjunct L. casei strains, but not with adjunct L. rhamnosus. Cheeses made with L. casei A26 were most similar to the control cheeses in diacetyl and butyric/isobutyric acid abundance as evaluated by electronic nose during the first 3 mo of ripening. The 4 cheese types differed in their descriptive sensory profiles at 8 mo of age, indicating an adjunct strain-dependent effect on particular flavor attributes. Adjunct Lactobacillus spp. affected the flavor profile and concentration of some flavor compounds in Swiss cheeses produced with the kosher make procedure. Use of adjunct Lactobacillus cultures provides Swiss cheese makers using a low cooking temperature with a means to control the dominant Lactobacillus strain during ripening, reduce citrate concentration, and modify cheese flavor.
TI  - Proteolytic profiles and angiotensin-I converting enzyme and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - This study was conducted to examine the growth, proteolytic profiles as well as angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory potentials of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Two strains each of yogurt bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus-1275 and 285, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus-1092 and 1368), and probiotics (L. acidophilus-4461 and 33200, and L. casei-2607 and 15286, and 1 strain of Bifidobacterium longum 5022), were cultivated in reconstituted skim milk (RSM) at 37 degrees C and their proteolytic profiles and ACE as well as alpha-glu inhibitory activities were determined. Among all the strains of lactic acid bacteria studied, yogurt bacteria grew very well, with the exception of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368 which showed a slower growth during the initial 3 h of incubation. The growth pattern corresponded well with the decrease in pH for the organisms. All the organisms showed an increase in proteolysis with time. The variations in proteolytic capabilities translated into corresponding variations in ACE inhibitory potential of these organisms. Bifidobacterium longum 5022 showed the highest ACE inhibitory potential followed by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368, L. casei 15286, S. thermophilus 1275, and L. acidophilus 4461. Organisms with high intracellular enzymatic activities grew well. Also, aminopeptidases of strains of L. acidophilus 4461 and S. thermophilus 1275 that could better utilize proline containing substrates showed enhanced ACE inhibitory potential. Lactic acid bacteria possessed the ability to inhibit alpha-glu activity, which endowed them an antidiabetic property as well.
TI  - Effect of wild strains used as starter cultures and adjunct cultures on the volatile compounds of the Pecorino Siciliano cheese.
AB  - The effect of six wild strains on the volatile profile of the PS cheese was investigated and compared to that generated from industrial starters generally used to produce PS cheese. All cheeses were subjected to microbiological, physicochemical, and volatile compounds analyses. The DGGE of the 16S rDNA analysis was also applied. The volatile compounds generated during ripening were studied through the SPME and the GC-MS methods. No difference was detected between the experimental and control cheeses throughout chemical and microbiological analyses, while the DGGE results showed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus in all cheeses, and the dominance of Enterococcus durans, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus casei in most of the experimental cheeses. Moreover, the presence of Lactococcus lactis species as in the control and in the experimental P2 and P4 cheeses was also revealed. The SPME results showed more pronounced volatile compounds in the experimental cheese samples than in the control ones.
TI  - Probiotic Crescenza cheese containing Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus manufactured with high-pressure homogenized milk.
AB  - High-pressure homogenization (HPH) is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional thermal treatment of food preservation and diversification. Its effectiveness on the deactivation of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in model systems and real food is well documented. To evaluate the potential of milk treated by HPH for the production of Crescenza cheese with commercial probiotic lactobacilli added, 4 types of cheeses were made: HPH (from HPH-treated milk), P (from pasteurized milk), HPH-P (HPH-treated milk plus probiotics), and P-P (pasteurized milk plus probiotics) cheeses. A strain of Streptococcus thermophilus was used as starter culture for cheese production. Compositional, microbiological, physicochemical, and organoleptic analyses were carried out at 1, 5, 8, and 12 d of refrigerated storage (4 degrees C). According to results obtained, no significant differences among the 4 cheese types were observed for gross composition (protein, fat, moisture) and pH. Differently, the HPH treatment of milk increased the cheese yield about 1% and positively affected the viability during the refrigerated storage of the probiotic bacteria. In fact, after 12 d of storage, the Lactobacillus paracasei A13 cell loads were 8 log cfu/ g, whereas Lactobacillus acidophilus H5 exhibited, in P-P cheese, a cell load decrease of about 1 log cfu/g with respect to the HPH-P cheese. The hyperbaric treatment had a significant positive effect on free fatty acids release and cheese proteolysis. Also, probiotic cultures affected proteolytic and lipolytic cheese patterns. No significant differences were found for the sensory descriptors salty and creamy among HPH and P cheeses as well as for acid, piquant, sweet, milky, salty, creamy, and overall acceptance among HPH, HPH-P, and P-P Crescenza cheeses.
TI  - Effect of Versagel on the growth and metabolic activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the influence of a protein-based fat replacer, Versagel added at 1% and 2% (w/v) to reconstituted skim milk (RSM), on the growth and metabolic activities of selected strains of yogurt starters (Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) as well as probiotic organisms (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum) was examined. Addition of Versagel resulted in significantly improved growth of S. thermophilus and B. longum but inhibited that of L. casei, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. This is also reflected in the extent of reduction of pH in RSM with added Versagel by these organisms. Among the biochemical activities, proteolytic activity of all the organisms except B. longum was adversely affected by the presence of Versagel, although the angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory activities were improved. Versagel at 1% level influenced the growth, while ACE inhibitory and alpha-glu inhibitory activities of the organisms were better at 2% level.
TI  - Synbiotic synthesis of oligosaccharides during milk fermentation by addition of leuconostoc starter and sugars.
AB  - Synthesis of oligosaccharides during milk fermentation was attempted by inoculating Leuconostoc citreum with Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus as starters. Dextransucrase of Ln. citreum worked as a catalyst for the transglycosylation reaction of sugars; sucrose was added as the glucose donor, and lactose or maltose acted as the acceptor compound for the reaction. When 4% sucrose was added in milk, glucosyl-lactose was synthesized (about 1%, w/v) after 1-2 days of fermentation at 15 or 25 degrees C. Alternatively, when sucrose and maltose (2% each, w/v) were added, panose (about 1%, w/v) and other isomaltooligosaccharides were made in a day at 15-35 degrees C. Growth patterns of lactobacilli and streptococci starters were not affected by the coculture of leuconostoc starter, but the rate of acid synthesis was slightly slowed at every temperature. Addition of sugars in milk did not give any adverse effect on the lactate fermentation. Accordingly, the use of leuconostoc starter and addition of sugars in milk allowed the production of oligosaccharides-containing fermented milk, and application of this method will facilitate the extensive development of synbiotic lactate foods.
TI  - Probiotic, as well as conventional yogurt, can enhance the stimulated production  of proinflammatory cytokines.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria have been shown to stimulate the secretion of cytokines by lymphocytes and monocytes in a strain-dependent manner. Therefore, in this study, the effect of a daily intake of probiotic yogurt on cytokine production in young healthy women was compared with that of a conventional product. METHODS: For 2 weeks each, subjects consumed 100 g, then 200 g of either a probiotic or a conventional, commercially available yogurt, both containing Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus with additional Lactobacillus casei DN 114 001 in the probiotic product. Cytokine production in blood culture following stimulation with phytohaemmaglutinin and lipopolysaccharide was measured using Cytometric Bead Array and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Stimulated production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha increased significantly following consumption of conventional or probiotic yogurt (+63% and +24% compared with baseline, respectively, P < 0.001). There was also a significantly higher production of interleukin (IL)-1beta in the conventional (+40%, P = 0.006) and of interferon gamma in the probiotic group (+108%, P < 0.05). IL-10 decreased following consumption of the probiotic product, but increased significantly after intake cessation (+129%, P < 0.001). No significant differences in cytokine responses between the conventional and the probiotic yogurt were observed. CONCLUSION: Both conventional and probiotic yogurt enhanced the stimulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
TI  - Characterisation of pSMA23, a 3.5 kbp plasmid of Lactobacillus casei, and application for heterologous expression in Lactobacillus.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid pSMA23 isolated from Lactobacillus casei A23 was determined. Plasmid pSMA23 is a 3497bp circular molecule with a G+C content of 38.18%. Four putative open reading frames were identified. Based on homology, two orfs were identified as genes encoding replication initiation (Rep) and mobilisation (Mob) protein, respectively. Various regulatory regions like promoters, ribosome binding site (RBS), transcriptional terminators were deduced from the sequences of rep and mob. The origin of replication (dso) was predicted. Shuttle vectors pL142 and pL157 were constructed for Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus using rep gene and ori of pSMA23 for replication in Lactobacillus, the ori of the commercial vector pBluescript SkII+ for replication in E. coli, and the erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance genes of pE194 and pC194, respectively, as selection markers. Transformants of E. coli and Lactobacillus were obtained on media containing erythromycin and chloramphenicol, respectively, suggesting expression of the ermC and cat194 genes in both organisms. The shsp gene of plasmid pSt04 of Streptococcus thermophilus encoding a small heat shock protein and the Lactobacillus plantarum cbh gene encoding conjugated bile salts hydrolase were cloned and successfully expressed in the heterologous host Lb. casei LK1 with the aid of pSMA23-derived vectors.
TI  - The effect of daily consumption of probiotic and conventional yoghurt on oxidant  and anti-oxidant parameters in plasma of young healthy women.
AB  - In recent years there has been increasing interest in the potential beneficial effects of probiotic bacteria, particularly concerning their immune-modulating effects. Considering the involvement of free radicals in immunological processes, we tried to verify and compare the effects of probiotic (Lactobacillus casei) and conventional yoghurt on antioxidant and oxidant parameters in plasma of humans. In this study female volunteers consumed 100 g/day of probiotic (n = 17) or conventional yoghurt (n = 16) for two weeks (T1-T2) and 200 g/day for another two weeks (T2-T3). A wash-out phase lasting two weeks followed. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), albumin, and bilirubin were determined photometrically, uric acid was determined by enzymatic methods, and vitamin E, carotenoids, malondialdehyde (MDA), and conjugated dienes (CD) were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the period of continuous yoghurt intake (T1-T3), mean concentrations of the antioxidants vitamin E, lycopene, and zeaxanthin decreased significantly (p < 0.01) in the probiotic and in the control group. The average concentrations of lutein, beta-carotene, albumin, uric acid, and bilirubin decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the probiotic group, only. These alterations led to a significant (p < 0.001) decrease of the average TAC values during the period T1-T3 in both tested groups. In the interval of daily yoghurt consumption (T1-T3) the mean plasma levels of oxidant parameters MDA and CD increased significantly in the probiotic (MDA: p < 0.01; CD: p < 0.001) and the control group (CD: p < 0.01). The average activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) was quite constant throughout the study in both groups. The mean activities of GSH-Px and catalase decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in the probiotic group, only after consuming yoghurt daily for four weeks (T1-T3). Although several parameters changed significantly during the study, no significant differences were observed between both investigated groups. Therefore, the results indicate a possible influence of both probiotic and conventional yoghurt on the plasma levels of antioxidant and oxidant parameters.
TI  - Use of probiotic Lactobacillus preparation to prevent diarrhoea associated with antibiotics: randomised double blind placebo controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of a probiotic drink containing Lactobacillus for the prevention of any diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use and that caused by Clostridium difficile. DESIGN: Randomised double blind placebo controlled study. PARTICIPANTS: 135 hospital patients (mean age 74) taking antibiotics. Exclusions included diarrhoea on admission, bowel pathology that could result in diarrhoea, antibiotic use in the previous four weeks, severe illness, immunosuppression, bowel surgery, artificial heart valves, and history of rheumatic heart disease or infective endocarditis. INTERVENTION: Consumption of a 100 g (97 ml) drink containing Lactobacillus casei, L bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus twice a day during a course of antibiotics and for one week after the course finished. The placebo group received a longlife sterile milkshake. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOME: occurrence of antibiotic associated diarrhoea. Secondary outcome: presence of C difficile toxin and diarrhoea. RESULTS: 7/57 (12%) of the probiotic group developed diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use compared with 19/56 (34%) in the placebo group (P=0.007). Logistic regression to control for other factors gave an odds ratio 0.25 (95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.85) for use of the probiotic, with low albumin and sodium also increasing the risk of diarrhoea. The absolute risk reduction was 21.6% (6.6% to 36.6%), and the number needed to treat was 5 (3 to 15). No one in the probiotic group and 9/53 (17%) in the placebo group had diarrhoea caused by C difficile (P=0.001). The absolute risk reduction was 17% (7% to 27%), and the number needed to treat was 6 (4 to 14). CONCLUSION: Consumption of a probiotic drink containing L casei, L bulgaricus, and S thermophilus can reduce the incidence of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and C difficile associated diarrhoea. This has the potential to decrease morbidity, healthcare costs, and mortality if used routinely in patients aged over 50. TRIAL REGISTRATION: National Research Register N0016106821.
TI  - Conjugated linoleic acid conversion by dairy bacteria cultured in MRS broth and buffalo milk.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate strains of Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria and Streptococci for their ability to produce conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) from free linoleic acid (LA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight dairy bacteria tolerant to LA were grown in MRS broth containing LA (200 microg ml(-1)) and CLA was assessed. Seven bacteria were able to form CLA after 24 h of incubation, varying percentage conversion between 17% and 36%. Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Streptococcus thermophilus showed the highest LA conversion and were inoculated into buffalo milk supplemented with different concentration of LA. The production of CLA at 200 microg ml(-1) of LA was two- or threefold in milk than MRS broth. All evaluated strains were able to produce CLA from high LA levels (1000 microg ml(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: The most tolerant strain to LA was Lact. casei. Lacttobacillus rhamnosus produced the maximum level of CLA at high LA concentrations (800 microg ml(-1)). The selected bacteria may be considered as adjunct cultures to be included on dairy fermented products manufacture. Low concentration of LA must be added to the medium to enhance CLA formation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The production of CLA by strains using milks from regional farms as medium offer a possible mechanism to enhance this beneficial compound in dairy products and those the possibility to develop functional foods.
TI  - Spotlight on VSL#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, and B. infantis), and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. Data from noncomparative trials suggest that VSL#3 has clinical potential in the treatment of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. In addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that VSL#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown VSL#3 is effective in preventing the onset of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. Treatment guidelines from the US and the UK include VSL#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. In general, VSL#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. Large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of VSL#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium spp. isolated from dairy and pharmaceutical products.
AB  - The outlines of antibiotic resistance of some probiotic microorganisms were studied. This study was conducted with the double purpose of verifying their ability to survive if they are taken simultaneously with an antibiotic therapy and to increase the selective properties of suitable media for the isolation of samples containing mixed bacterial populations. We isolated from commercial dairy and pharmaceutical products, 34 strains declared as probiotics, belonging to the genera Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and 21 strains of starter culture bacteria. All the microorganisms have been compared by electrophoresis of the soluble proteins for the purpose of identifying them. A Multiplex-PCR with genus- and species-specific primers was used to detect for Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis presence. All bifidobacteria were B. animalis subsp. lactis except one Bifidobacterium longum. Sometimes the identification showed that the used strain was not the one indicated on the label. The lactobacilli were Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. The streptococci were all Streptococcus thermophilus. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 24 common antibiotic substances has been valued by the broth microdilution method. All tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, erytromycin, novobiocin, penicillin G, rifampicin (MIC(90) ranging from 0.01 to 4 microg/ml); resistant to aztreonam, cycloserin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin B and spectinomycin (MIC(90) ranging from 64 to >1000 microg/ml). The susceptibility to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, lincomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin was variable and depending on the species.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the one humped camel milk  produced in Morocco.
AB  - One hundred and twenty (120) strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were enumerated and isolated from raw dromedary milk in Morocco using various cultured media. Strains isolated were characterized by phenotypic, physiological and biochemical properties. Results showed that high counts of LAB were found. Presumptive lactobacilli counts ranged from 2.5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive lactococci levels varied from 5x10(2) to 6x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive streptococci counts varied from 4.2x10(2) to 8x10(7)cfu/ml, presumptive leuconostoc levels ranged from 5.4x10(2) to 5.4x10(7)cfu/ml. Results showed also that Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were the predominant genera with 37.5% and 25.8%, respectively. The dominated species found were Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (17.5%), Lactobacillus helveticus (10%), Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (9.20%), Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (5.80%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (5%). This is the first report on the characterization of LAB strains isolated from the one humped camel milk produced in Morocco.
TI  - Nonstarter lactobacilli isolated from soft and semihard Argentinean cheeses: genetic characterization and resistance to biological barriers.
AB  - Nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from Argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. Lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and soft cheeses made with multistrain Streptococcus thermophilus starters. Lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) CFU/g and then reached 10(7) CFU/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always above 10(9) CFU/g. A total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. Species identity was determined by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific PCR assays. Genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR analysis. The Lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species L. casei, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, and L. perolens. All the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. After incubation in gastric solution (pH 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. The strains were able to grow in the presence of bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. The nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). Some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. It was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.
TI  - [Intake of fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 and its effect on gut flora].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the gut flora in infants who received fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei and Streptococcus termophilus and its effect on secretory immunoglobulin levels. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An experimental, randomized, prospective, parallel group study was carried out. Thirty-five infants were included (18 in the treatment group and 17 in the control group) with a mean age of 2 years (SD: 0.6 years; range: 1-3 years). The experimental group received both fermented milk (0.5 l/day) containing L. casei and S. termophilus for 6 weeks and standard cow's milk for the following 6 weeks. The control group received standard cow's milk (0.5 l/day) for 12 weeks. Secretory IgA levels in saliva were evaluated in the experimental group at the start of the study (baseline levels) and 6 weeks later. In both groups, stools were collected to study gut flora at 0, 6 and 12 week. RESULTS: Secretory IgA levels significantly increased (p =0.0063) from a mean baseline value of 2.5 mg/dl to a mean of 3.4 mg/dl at 6 weeks. Gram-negative aerobic flora were decreased in the experimental group after 6 weeks compared with the control group (p =0.0203). The number of infants with Lactobacillus spp in their gut flora was greater in the experimental group than in the control group at week 6 and this difference was statistically significant (p =0.028) at week 12. Conclusion The present study provides evidence of L. casei survival in the gastrointestinal tract and of its effect of increasing secretory IgA.
TI  - VSL#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  - VSL#3 (VSL#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve and B. infantis) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.

TI  - Bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  - Probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. The mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (LA) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from LA by certain bacterial strains. In this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of CLA was assessed. Incubation of probiotic bacteria (VSL3, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. plantarum, Bifidobacterium breve, B. infantis, B. longum, and Streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of LA yielded CLA production as measured by gas chromatography. Conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced CLA, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells, as assessed by MTT assay and DNA laddering, respectively. Western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of PPARgamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with LA alone. Incubation of murine feces with LA after administering VSL3 yielded 100-fold more CLA than feces collected prior to VSL3 feeding. This study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  - Effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  - Fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. In this study, three sourdough yeasts, Candida milleri CBS 8195, Saccharomyces cerevisiae TS 146, and Torulaspora delbrueckii TS 207; a control, baker's yeast S. cerevisiae ALKO 743; and four Lactobacillus spp., L. acidophilus TSB 262, L. brevis TSB 307, L. plantarum TSB 304, and L. sanfranciscensis TSB 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. The microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. Total folate contents were determined using Lactobacillus rhamnosus (ATCC 7469) as the growth indicator organism. The microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. Yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. Strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, L. casei, L. curvatus, L. fermentum, L. helveticus, Pediococcus spp., and Streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. Although the four Lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal. It was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. Fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. Two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as Enterobacter cowanii and Pantoea agglomerans.
TI  - Effect of fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria in the prevention of an enteroinvasive Escherichia coli infection in mice.
AB  - This study investigated the protective capacity of the oral administration of fermented milk containing the probiotic strains; Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, against enteroinvasive Escherichia coli infection in a murine (BALB/ c mice) model. Mice were fed for 2, 5 or 7 consecutive days with fermented milk diluted to a concentration of viable Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus of 10(7) cfu/ml. Phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages and the number of IgA+ cells in small and large intestine were determined at the end of the feeding periods. For the preventive effect against Esch. coli, animals were fed for 5 days (selected dose). Mice were challenged with an infective dose of enteroinvasive Esch. coli of 10(8) cfu/mouse. The colonization of liver and spleen and the secretory IgA specific for the pathogen in the intestinal fluid were determined (ELISA test). Results showed that the unspecific immune response enhanced itself after 5 consecutive days of the administration of this fermented milk (increase in the percentage of phagocytosis and number of IgA+ cells in the small intestine). Treated animals showed less Esch. coli colonization of liver than control mice and a higher secretory anti-Esch. coli IgA in the intestinal fluids. These results suggest that the protection against enteroinvasive Esch. coli infection observed for the fermented milk containing probiotic bacteria may be associated with an enhance of the intestinal mucosa immunity.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effect of probiotic cultures on two different yogurt brands over a known population of Staphylococcus aureus and the production of thermonuclease].
AB  - The effect of probiotic cultures over known populations of Staphylococcus aureus  inoculated in yogurt was studied; also the production and stability of its thermonuclease during yogurt storage was evaluated. In three different occasions, two different yogurt brands, one with additional probiotic cultures (Lactobacillus casei and L. acidophilus), were inoculated with known populations of S. aureus in high and low concentration (10(9) CFU/g and 10(7) CFU/g), respectively. These samples were stored for 28 days at 5 degrees C. Every four days the count of lactic bacteria, S. aureus and pH were evaluated, according to the methodology described in the Compendium of Methods for the Microbiological Examination of Foods, Vanderzant & Splittstoesser. The presence of thermonuclease was determined using petrifilm for S. aureus from 3M company. The pH and lactic bacteria population were constant during the testing period. Yogurt with additional probiotic cultures (high and low concentration) lowered the population of S. aureus to non detectable levels in 8 days; but, S. aureus could be cultured from yogurt without probiotics even after 24 days of incubation. Same time, the presence of thermonuclease was positive in all tests; it was not affected by probiotics. The presence of thermonuclease is related to the production of S. aureus enterotoxin. This work emphasizes again the beneficial effects of probiotic cultures in yogurt over bacteria and the importance of keeping hygienic practices in order to avoid the contamination of food with S. aureus and the eventual production of its enterotoxin, since it is not affected by probiotics.
TI  - Molecular quantification of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk products using real-time quantitative PCR.
AB  - Real-time quantitative PCR assays were developed for the absolute quantification  of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. acidophilus and L. johnsonii) in fermented milk products. The results of molecular quantification and classic bacterial enumeration did not differ significantly with respect to S. thermophilus and the species of the L. casei group which were detected in the six commercial fermented products tested, thus showing that DNA extraction was efficient and that genomic DNA solutions were free of PCR inhibitors. For L. delbrueckii, the results of bacterial enumeration were generally lower by a factor 10 to 100 than those of PCR quantification, suggesting a loss of viability during storage of the dairy products at 1-8 degrees C for most of the strains in this species. Real-time quantitative assays enabled identification of the species of lactic acid bacterial strains initially present in commercial fermented milk products and their accurate quantification with a detection threshold of 10(3) cells per ml of product.
TI  - In vitro antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli isolated from commercial products containing active lactobacilli.
AB  - To survey the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of some commercially available Lactobacillus, we collected four commercial products that contain active Lactobacillus. We incubated individual product and identified these colonies by the methods of API50 CH test kit and RAPID ID 32A kit. Strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei were collected. By agar dilution method, each identified strain was inoculated to Brucella blood agar-MIC plates. Each plate contained one of the following antibiotics with different concentrations: amoxicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, vancomycin, erythromycin, rifampin, tetracyclin and penicillin G, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, cefmetazole, metronidazole, ampicillin/sulbactum, cefoxtin, etc. After incubation, the growth condition of each Brucella blood agar-MIC plate was observed and the breakpoint of each antibiotic to different Lactobacillus products determined. The MICs of amoxicillin, ampicillin/sulbactum and penicillin-G to all identified strains were < or =2 microg/ml and those of vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, cefmetazole and cefoxtin for L. casei were >32 microg/ml. L. casei was more resistant to all the testing antibiotics than the other strains. According to the MICs of the above antibiotics, proper active lactobacillus products could be chosen to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the pediatric field.
TI  - Comparison of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences for the identification of Lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  - Comparative analysis of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase gene (fbp) sequences was evaluated for the differentiation of reference and clinical strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The sequences of 1,971 nucleotides of the fbp gene were determined on both DNA strands for 21 L. rhamnosus strains, representing reference, probiotic, and clinical strains. No PCR amplification of the fbp gene was observed for other species of the Lactobacillus casei complex (L. casei and L. zeae) or strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis of the fbp putative amino acid sequences of L. rhamnosus strains by the neighbor-joining method showed clear distinct positions of this species. The phylogenetic tree, derived from fbp nucleotide sequences, showed four clear divisions between strains of L. rhamnosus. From a taxonomic point of view, our results confirm for the first time that fbp gene sequences have high discriminating power for strains of L. rhamnosus that are difficult to differentiate.
TI  - Two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy FA from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy FA. Two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. Two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of Pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(S)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(S)-OH 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10,13-OH 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including L. casei subsp. casei, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. lactis subsp. cremoris, and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-OH 18:1). Seven strains of L. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-OH 18:0) through 10-OH 18:1. Linoleic acid at 2 g/L was converted by L. acidophilus IFO13951T to 1.3 g of 13(S)-OH 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-OH 18:0 in 7 d. Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei JCM 1111 produced 10-OH 18:1 in 91% yield, and L. plantarum JCM 8341, 10-OH 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/L) under optimal conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of 13(S)-OH 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria, and of 10,13-OH 18:0 by any bacteria.
TI  - Selective enumeration of Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and propionibacteria.
AB  - Nineteen bacteriological media were evaluated to assess their suitability to selectively enumerate Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and propionibacteria. Bacteriological media evaluated included Streptococcus thermophilus agar, pH modified MRS agar, MRS-vancomycine agar, MRS-bile agar, MRS-NaCl agar, MRS-lithium chloride agar, MRS-NNLP (nalidixic acid, neomycin sulfate, lithium chloride and paramomycine sulfate) agar, reinforced clostridial agar, sugar-based (such as maltose, galactose, sorbitol, manitol, esculin) media, sodium lactate agar, arabinose agar, raffinose agar, xylose agar, and L. casei agar. Incubations were carried out under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 27, 30, 37, 43, and 45 degrees C for 24, 72 h, and 7 to 9 d. S. thermophilus agar and aerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 h were suitable for S. thermophilus. L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus could be enumerated using MRS agar (pH 4.58 or pH 5.20) and under anaerobic incubation at 45 degrees C for 72 h. MRS-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 43 degrees C for 72 h were suitable to enumerate L. rhamnosus. MRS-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72 h were selective for L. casei. To estimate the counts of L. casei by subtraction method, counts of L. rhamnosus on MRS-vancomycine agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h under anaerobic incubation could be subtracted from total counts of L. casei and L. rhamnosus enumerated on MRS-vancomycine agar at 37 degrees C for 72 h under anaerobic incubation. L. acidophilus could be enumerated using MRS-agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h or Basal agar-maltose agar at 43 degrees C for 72 h or BA-sorbitol agar at 37 degrees C for 72 h, under anaerobic incubation. Bifidobacteria could be enumerated on MRS-NNLP agar under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C for 72 h. Propionibacteria could be enumerated on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees C for 7 to 9 d. A subtraction method was most suitable for counting propionibacteria in the presence of other lactic acid bacteria from a product. For this method, counts of lactic bacteria at d 3 on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees C were subtracted from counts at d 7 of lactic bacteria and propionibacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. There are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. However, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. This study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. Disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and MBCs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. Standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. The results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. A concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The MICs for Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. No activity was detected against Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers for amplification of priming  glycosyltransferase genes of the exopolysaccharide locus in strains of the Lactobacillus casei group.
AB  - A primer design strategy named CODEHOP (consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer) for amplification of distantly related sequences was used to detect the priming glycosyltransferase (GT) gene in strains of the Lactobacillus casei group. Each hybrid primer consisted of a short 3' degenerate core based on four highly conserved amino acids and a longer 5' consensus clamp region based on six sequences of the priming GT gene products from exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing bacteria. The hybrid primers were used to detect the priming GT gene of 44 commercial isolates and reference strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. casei, Lactobacillus zeae, and Streptococcus thermophilus. The priming GT gene was detected in the genome of both non-EPS-producing (EPS(-)) and EPS-producing (EPS(+)) strains of L. rhamnosus. The sequences of the cloned PCR products were similar to those of the priming GT gene of various gram-negative and gram-positive EPS(+) bacteria. Specific primers designed from the L. rhamnosus RW-9595M GT gene were used to sequence the end of the priming GT gene in selected EPS(+) strains of L. rhamnosus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Lactobacillus spp. form a distinctive group apart from other lactic acid bacteria for which GT genes have been characterized to date. Moreover, the sequences show a divergence existing among strains of L. rhamnosus with respect to the terminal region of the priming GT gene. Thus, the PCR approach with consensus-degenerate hybrid primers designed with CODEHOP is a practical approach for the detection of similar genes containing conserved motifs in different bacterial genomes.
TI  - Influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  - Intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. The stimulus of the mucosal immunity is not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. In previous works we have demonstrated that some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. Taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis on the IgA secreting cells associated to bronchus. As shown before, oral immunostimulation with LAB induced an increase of the IgA* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. In this study it is also showed that the LAB assayed, with exception of L. acidophilus, were able to enhance IgA+ cells at bronchial level, being also this effect dose dependent. The increment induced by some LAB in the number of IgA+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be very important to prevent bronchus diseases.
TI  - Cell wall attachment of a widely distributed peptidoglycan binding domain is hindered by cell wall constituents.
AB  - The C-terminal region (cA) of the major autolysin AcmA of Lactococcus lactis contains three highly similar repeated regions of 45 amino acid residues (LysM domains), which are separated by nonhomologous sequences. The cA domain could be deleted without destroying the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme in vitro. This AcmA derivative was capable neither of binding to lactococcal cells nor of lysing these cells while separation of the producer cells was incomplete. The cA domain and a chimeric protein consisting of cA fused to the C terminus of MSA2, a malaria parasite surface antigen, bound to lactococcal cells specifically via cA. The fusion protein also bound to many other Gram-positive bacteria. By chemical treatment of purified cell walls of L. lactis and Bacillus subtilis, peptidoglycan was identified as the cell wall component interacting with cA. Immunofluorescence studies showed that binding is on specific locations on the surface of L. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus, B. subtilis, Lactobacillus sake, and Lactobacillus casei cells. Based on these studies, we propose that LysM-type repeats bind to peptidoglycan and that binding is hindered by other cell wall constituents, resulting in localized binding of AcmA. Lipoteichoic acid is a candidate hindering component. For L. lactis SK110, it is shown that lipoteichoic acids are not uniformly distributed over the cell surface and are mainly present at sites where no MSA2cA binding is observed.
TI  - Intestinal pathway of internalisation of lactic acid bacteria and gut mucosal immunostimulation.
AB  - The induction of the gut mucosal immune response is dependent on the antigen interacting with the M cells of Peyer's patches and with the immune cells associated with this lymphoid organ. In previous studies we showed that the mucosal immunostimulation by LAB varied depending upon the strain being studied. Some of them increased the inflammatory immune response and others enhanced the level of secretory antibody (S-IgA). Our aim was to determine the pathway of the internalisation of LAB strains in the intestine, to provide a basis for understing the different behaviour exhibited by them. The presence of LAB on Peyer's patches or in the immune cells associated with the villi of small intestine was determined using fluorescein-labelled bacteria and by transmission electron microscopy. Mice were dosed orally by intubation, with 10<sup>1</sup> cells of labelled single strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. For electron microscopy studies unlabelled bacteria were used. Histological preparations of the small and large intestine were performed 1 hour after administration of the bacteria. Fluorescent bacteria of L. casei and S. thermophilus were found only in Peyer's patches while L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus were observed in Peyer's patches and in the small intestine. L. acidophilus was also found in the large intestine. We confirmed these findings by electron microscopy. We determined that for L. casei the pathway of internalisation was via the M and FAE cells of Peyer's patches, while for S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus the interaction with the immune cells of Peyer's patches was through the follicle associated epithelium (FAE). L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus also interacted with the epithelial cells of the small intestine and L. acidophilus with epithelial cells of the large intestine. These results suggest that the different effects of LAB on the mucosal immunostimulation, are related to the different pathways of gut internalisation used to take contact with the immune cells associated with the lamina propria intestinal.
TI  - Feasibility studies to control acute diarrhoea in children by feeding fermented milk preparations Actimel and Indian Dahi.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study feasibility of diarrhoea control in children (6 months to 5 y of age) by feeding fermented milk preparations. The design used was a randomized controlled clinical trial and the study was carried out at the Delhi University College Hospital providing tertiary care, and a nearby community centre Nand Nagri, a resettlement colony in East Delhi. Children suffering from acute diarrhoea (75 patients from the hospital and 75 from the community) were allocated to three groups by double-blind technique. Group 1 was given a fermented milk, Actimel, containing 10(8) of each Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus per gram. Group 2 was given Indian Dahi (Lf 40) containing 10(8) of each Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus lactis cremoris and Leuconostac mesenteroides cremoris per gram. Group 3 was given ultra-heat-treated yoghurt preparation (no live bacteria). Actimel was also used as a starter to prepare the curd in order to study the preventive effect of diarrhoea in children in a community. In the hospital study Indian Dahi and Actimel administration reduced mean duration of diarrhoea by 0.3 and 0.6 day (P<0.001), respectively. The corresponding figures in the community study were 0.2 and 0.5 day (P<0.05), respectively. The families using Actimel as a starter showed a reduction in diarrhoeal morbidity episodes by 40% of the children tested in a 3 month follow-up. In conclusion, Actimel, fermented milk containing Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, and Indian Dahi can significantly reduce the duration of diarrhoea in children; the former preparation being superior.
TI  - Interaction of lactic acid bacteria with the gut immune system.
AB  - Health claims of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) used in functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are based on the capacity of these microorganisms to stimulate the host immune system. In this study, the antigenic effect of LAB (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) on the gut immune system of BALB/c mice was evaluated. A dose-dependent increase of the Bcl2 protein was observed with all LAB assayed. Furthermore, the analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the lamina propria of gut showed that TNFalpha and INFgamma values, determined in macrophages cultured from Peyer patches, were enhanced for all the LAB assayed. An important increase of interleukins IL-10 and IL-4 was observed mainly in mice fed with Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus or Lactobacillus casei, while a significant induction of IL-2 and IL-12 was only observed with L. acidophilus (P<0.01). These effects were dose dependent. The role of produced cytokines in the balance Th1/Th2 was determined by a systemic antibody response against parenterally injected ovoalbumin. L. casei, L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and L. acidophilus enhanced the IgG1 response favouring Th2 balance, while L. acidophilus also increased the IgG2a response inducing Th1 balance. S. thermophilus did not influence the balance Th1/Th2. Our studies showed that lactic acid bacteria induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles showing different adjuvant capacity among them. Thus, selection of probiotic strain with immunological properties must be well defined to influence cytokine expression that favour the claimed immune response.
TI  - The dilemma of phage taxonomy illustrated by comparative genomics of Sfi21-like Siphoviridae in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The complete genome sequences of two dairy phages, Streptococcus thermophilus phage 7201 and Lactobacillus casei phage A2, are reported. Comparative genomics reveals that both phages are members of the recently proposed Sfi21-like genus of Siphoviridae, a widely distributed phage type in low-GC-content gram-positive bacteria. Graded relatedness, the hallmark of evolving biological systems, was observed when different Sfi21-like phages were compared. Across the structural module, the graded relatedness was represented by a high level of DNA sequence similarity or protein sequence similarity, or a shared gene map in the absence of sequence relatedness. This varying range of relatedness was found within Sfi21-like phages from a single species as demonstrated by the different prophages harbored by Lactococcus lactis strain IL1403. A systematic dot plot analysis with 11 complete L. lactis phage genome sequences revealed a clear separation of all temperate phages from two classes of virulent phages. The temperate lactococcal phages share DNA sequence homology in a patchwise fashion over the nonstructural gene cluster. With respect to structural genes, four DNA homology groups could be defined within temperate L. lactis phages. Closely related structural modules for all four DNA homology groups were detected in phages from Streptococcus or Listeria, suggesting that they represent distinct evolutionary lineages that have not uniquely evolved in L. lactis. It seems reasonable to base phage taxonomy on data from comparative genomics. However, the peculiar modular nature of phage evolution creates ambiguities in the definition of phage taxa by comparative genomics. For example, depending on the module on which the classification is based, temperate lactococcal phages can be classified as a single phage species, as four distinct phage species, or as two if not three different phage genera. We propose to base phage taxonomy on comparative genomics of a single structural gene module (head or tail genes). This partially phylogeny-based taxonomical system still mirrors some aspects of the current International Committee on Taxonomy in Virology classification system. In this system the currently sequenced lactococcal phages would be grouped into five genera: c2-, sk1, Sfi11-, r1t-, and Sfi21-like phages.
TI  - The evaluation of mixtures of yeast and potato extracts in growth media for biomass production of lactic cultures.
AB  - The effectiveness of yeast extracts (YE) and potato extracts (PE) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (AS). Two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using ODmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) Eleven lots from the same PE-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. The ODmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. The growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% PE than in base medium containing 100% YE for both ODmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in PE. In AS assays, highest OD values for Lactobacillus casei EQ28, Lactobacillus rhamnosus R-011, Lactobacillus plantarum EQ12, and Streptococcus thermophilus R-083 were obtained with a mixture of PE and YE. Fermentations (2 L) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of AS to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. In these fermentations, replacement of 50% YE with PE was shown to enable good growth of S. thermophilus. With L. rhamnosus R-011, a high correlation (R2 = 0.95) was found between ODmax data obtained in the AS assays and that of the 2-L bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. However, AS was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. The relationship was still good for ODmax between AS data and that of the bioreactor data with L. rhamnosus R-011 in industrial LBS medium (R2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the S. thermophilus R-083 on Rosell #43 industrial medium (R2 = 0.33). Since PE cost 40% less than YE, there are strong economic advantages in considering such a partial replacement of YE by PE.
TI  - Evolution of carbohydrate fraction in carbonated fermented milks as affected by beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains.
AB  - The influence of carbonation on the evolution of lactose, galactose and glucose in fermented milks with added probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and/or Bifidobacterium bifidum) was evaluated and related to beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains. During incubation and first days of refrigeration, lactose hydrolysis resulting in the liberation of galactose and glucose occurred in CT (Streptococcus thermophilus/Lb. casei), AT (Str. thermophilus/Lb. acidophilus) and ABT fermented milks (Str. thermophilus/Lb. acidophilus/Bifid. bifidum). Levels of galactose were higher than those of glucose and could be related to the preferential consumption of glucose by actively growing bacteria. Through the incubation, lactose and monosaccharide levels were not affected by milk carbonation. However, during refrigerated storage the presence of this gas was associated with slightly lower content of lactose and higher levels of galactose and glucose in AT and ABT products but not in CT fermented milks. Through the refrigeration galactose was moderately utilised by Lb. acidophilus in AT products whereas the presence of Bifid. bifidum seems to prevent the consumption of this sugar in ABT fermented milks. Glucose remained constant, with minor variations in CT products but a continuous increase of this sugar occurred in carbonated AT and ABT fermented milks during storage. Beta-galactosidase activity displayed by Str. thermophilus strains was similar at pH 6.5 (initial pH of non-carbonated samples) and pH 6.3 (initial pH of carbonated samples) whereas Lb. acidophilus LaA3 showed greater beta-galactosidase activity at pH 6.3 than at higher pH values. Thus, the enhanced metabolic activity of Lb. acidophilus caused by the low initial pH of carbonated milk also promoted higher cellular beta-galactosidase activity that could have released greater amounts of galactose and glucose from lactose in AT and ABT fermented milks through the refrigerated period. In CT fermented milks, similar beta-galactosidase activity levels of Str. thermophilus at pH 6.5 and 6.3 together with the absence of beta-galactosidase activity in Lb. casei could explain the lack of differences on glucose and galactose content between carbonated and non-carbonated samples.
TI  - Interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria used for fermented  dairy products.
AB  - Interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria were investigated to establish adequate combinations of strains to manufacture probiotic dairy products. For this aim, a total of 48 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. The detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized by growth kinetics. A variety of interactions was demonstrated. Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit S. thermophilus strains. Among probiotic cultures, Lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (Lb. casei and Bifidobacterium). In general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. The study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). The possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and their survival in the products during cold storage.
TI  - Lack of therapeutic effect of a specially designed yogurt for the eradication of  Helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current antibiotic treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection is often associated with frequent adverse effects and resistance to antibiotics. Alternative treatment methods to control H. pylori infection are needed. Some specific strains of lactic acid bacteria (probiotics) in dairy products are known to inhibit the growth of H. pylori in vitro. A clinical trial was conducted to see the efficacy of a specially designed yogurt product containing specific probiotics on the eradication of H. pylori. METHOD: The yogurt was prepared using three Lactobacillus spp. (L. acidophilus and L. casei) and one commercial starter culture (L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus). All these cultures were previously evaluated, and found to have strong in vitro inhibitory effects on the growth of H. pylori. Twenty-seven asymptomatic women positive for H. pylori on gastric biopsy and 13C urea breath test were recruited, and administered 175 ml of the yogurt three times a day for 30 days. The 13C urea breath test was administered again, one month after stopping the yogurt treatment to detect the presence of H. pylori. RESULTS: In 26 of 27 subjects, the urea breath test values remained positive, indicating that the consumption of the yogurt had no effect on the eradication of H. pylori. CONCLUSION: Although the designed fermented milk containing lactobacilli is very effective in the inhibition of H. pylori growth in vitro, eradication of this infection in humans is difficult to achieve by consuming this product.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in kefir grains and kefir made from them.
AB  - In an investigation of the changes in the microflora along the pathway: kefir grains (A)-->kefir made from kefir grains (B)-->kefir made from kefir as inoculum (C), the following species of lactic acid bacteria (83-90%) of the microbial count in the grains) were identified: Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and Lactobacillus brevis. Yeasts (10-17%) identified were Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida inconspicua and Candida maris. In the microbial population of kefir grains and kefir made from them the homofermentative lactic streptococci (52-65% and 79-86%, respectively) predominated. Within the group of lactobacilli, the homofermentative thermophilic species L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and L. helveticus (70-87% of the isolated bacilli) predominated. Along the pathway A-->B-->C, the streptococcal proportion in the total kefir microflora increased by 26-30% whereas the lactobacilli decreased by 13-23%. K. marxianus var. lactis was permanently present in kefir grains and kefirs, whereas the dominant lactose-negative yeast in the total yeast flora of the kefir grains dramatically decreased in kefir C.
TI  - Specific IgA to lactic acid bacteria in feces of children consuming milk fermented by yoghurt symbiosis and Lactobacillus casei (Danone strain DN 114 001).
AB  - An immunoreactive role of lactic acid bacteria established in animals has seldom  been investigated in humans. In a large-scale clinical study, children from day-care centers received either yoghurt (Y), milk fermented by yoghurt symbiosis and Lactobacillus casei (DN 114 001) (YC), or gelified milk (GM) as diet supplements during two 30-day supplementation periods separated by one 30-day period without supplementation. Feces samples were collected before, during, and after the 2nd supplementation period. Proteins were extracted in a buffer containing enzymatic inhibitors. IgA levels were assessed and adjusted to the weight of feces samples. Specific IgA to lactic acid bacteria strains (Streptococcus thermophilus 8901A, 8902A; Lactobacillus bulgaricus; Lactobacillus casei) present in Y and YC were assayed in ELISA and adjusted to individual IgA levels. Mean levels of fecal IgA were within reported ranges for pediatric populations of similar age. IgA levels decreased significantly but transiently in children receiving Y, and increased significantly in children receiving GM, but did not vary in the group of children who were given YC. Specific IgA to the 4 strains tested increased significantly during the supplementation period only in the group of children receiving GM, while it was transient and not significant in children receiving YC. No variation was noted in children given Y Specific IgA to lactic acid bacteria can be assayed in feces. Supplementation with fermented milks might induce a mucosal tolerance to environmental flora.
TI  - Evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  - The development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. Initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. Fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of partial 16S rRNA genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to Streptococcus thermophilus or Saccharococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus fermentum. The middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. Lactobacillus casei or Lactobacillus paracasei, L. fermentum, and Lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by DGGE during this stage. Bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of residual maltooligosaccharides. By 70 h, two new PCR bands were detected on DGGE gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. The bacteria were phylogenetically related to Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in Japan. These were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as MRS. Their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.
TI  - Thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  - This study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (TLC) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. When the chromatogram was sprayed with the indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. Succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. In addition, these organic acids showed different R(f) values. The total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. The proposed TLC method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five Bifidobacterium species. (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (Lactobacillus casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and S. lactis). Both spots of lactic acid and acetic acid were detected on all the TLC plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. The five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. Accordingly, the proposed TLC method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of Bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.
TI  - Influence of a probiotic yoghurt on the status of vitamins B(1), B(2) and B(6) in the healthy adult human.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The main reason for this study was to determine whether yoghurt  bacteria, being rich in some water-soluble vitamins, release them or utilize vitamins from their surroundings. Our study was trying to determine for the first time, if the viable bacteria of probiotic yoghurt are able to influence the parameters of the B-vitamin (B(1), B(2), B(6)) status of the healthy adult human. METHODS: The test yoghurt was commercially available probiotic yoghurt prepared with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus acidophilus, enriched with Lactobacillus casei GG. Different chemical forms of all investigated B-vitamins were determined by HPLC methods. In order to determine the influence of the yoghurt flora, each of 12 subjects consumed four yoghurt portions 125 g each ( = 500 g) a day, containing thermally inactivated cultures during the first 2-week period and yoghurt without heat treatment during the second 2-week period. RESULTS: The heat treatment of the probiotic yoghurt caused negligible changes in vitamin contents. The plasma levels of thiamin decreased significantly (p < 0.01) after the first 2-week period and kept on decreasing during the second 2-week period. A similar trend was found in the urinary excretion. The plasma levels of the B(2)-vitamers were different. The flavin adenine dinucleotide concentrations increased significantly (p < 0.01) after the consumption of heat-treated yoghurt and decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after the following 2 weeks, in which the subjects received the untreated yoghurt. In contrast, the flavin mononucleotide plasma levels decreased during the first 2-week period and increased during the second part of the study, but the change was not statistically significant. The free riboflavin concentrations in plasma and urine showed a continuous but not significant increase. The concentrations of pyridoxal-5-phosphate in plasma increased after the consumption of yoghurt with the inactivated bacteria and decreased in the second part of the study. However, the differences were not significant. The excretion of thiamin, B(2)- and B(6)-vitamers in the faeces did not significantly change throughout the study period (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our observations show that the bacterial flora of the examined yoghurt does not influence the vitamin B(1), B(2) and B(6) status of man. It seems likely that even lactobacilli of the 'probiotic' type which are vitamin B consumers can decrease the bioavailability of these vitamins for man. Obviously a thermal death of the cells did not induce a release of physiologically active vitamins.
TI  - Gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. The interaction of LAB with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the LAB. We studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of LAB such as Lactobacillus casei, L. acidophilus, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus. We determined if the LAB assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. We demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of IgA producing cells associated to the lamina propria of small intestine. This effect was dose dependent. The increase in IgA+ producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the CD4+ T cell number, indicating that some LAB assayed only induced clonal expansion of B cells triggered to produce IgA. Most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. CD8+ T cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of L. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. This fact would mean that LAB are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. We demonstrated the importance in the selection of LAB to be used as gut mucosal adjuvant. The different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the LAB can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. The immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.
TI  - Viability of probiotic (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in Argentinian Fresco cheese.
AB  - We evaluated the suitability of Argentinian Fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. We used cultures of Bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), Bifidobacterium longum (two strains), Bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), Lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and Lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. Probiotic, lactic starter (Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms, yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. Furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (pH 2 and 3) of Fresco cheese. The results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and L. acidophilus had a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. Both combinations of bifidobacteria and L. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for L. casei). On the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, L. acidophilus, and L. casei tested adapted well to the Fresco cheese environment. When a cheese homogenate at pH 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. At pH 2, the cell viability was more affected; B. bifidum was the most resistant organism. This study showed that the Argentinian Fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  - The proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses. Indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. The consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. The present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified Robbins device. Exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of Bifidobacterium infantis 420 or Enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. However, suspensions of Lactobacillus fermentum B54, L. rhamnosus 744 or L. lactis cremoris SK11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. Suspensions of L. casei Shirota and Streptococcus thermophilus B significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. The reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of L. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Effect of administration of fermented milk containing whey protein concentrate to rats and healthy men on serum lipids and blood pressure.
AB  - The effect of fermented milk supplemented with whey protein concentrate on the serum lipid level of rats was investigated. The serum total cholesterol level for the group fed fermented milk with both Lactobacillus casei TMC0409 and Streptococcus thermophilus TMC 1543 was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.05) in rats. Furthermore, the effect of the longterm intake of this fermented milk on the serum lipid level of twenty healthy adult men was investigated. During the 8-wk study, the volunteers consumed 200 ml of fermented milk or placebo in the morning and evening. Blood samples were drawn for analysis three times, just before taking the experimental diet, and after 4 wk and 8 wk of consumption. After 8 wk, the high density lipoprotein cholesterol level for the fermented milk group showed a significant rise after 4 wk (P<0.05), whereas that of the placebo group showed no change even after 4 wk (P>0.05). The triglyceride level for the fermented milk group lowered significantly after 4 wk (<0.05), whereas that of the placebo group showed no change even after 4 wk (P>0.05). The atherogenic index [(total cholesterol - high density lipoprotein cholesterol)/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol] for the fermented milk group decreased significantly from 4.24 to 3.52 (P<0.05). The systolic blood pressure lowered significantly by the intake of fermented milk (P<0.05) On the other hand, such effect was not observed in the placebo group (P>0.05). These results indicate potential of the development of fermented milk with multiple therapeutic effects.
TI  - Modulating immune responses with probiotic bacteria.
AB  - For many years, probiotic bacteria have been known to confer health benefits to the consumer. One possible mechanism for this may be the ability of probiotic bacteria to modulate immune responses. Oral administration of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) has been found to enhance innate immunity by stimulating the activity of splenic NK cells. Oral feeding with killed LcS was able to stimulate the production of Th1 cytokines, resulting in repressed production of IgE antibodies against Ovalbumin in experimental mice. The ability to switch mucosal immune responses towards Th1 with probiotic bacteria provides a strategy for treatment of allergic disorders. Growth of Meth A tumour cells in the lungs was also inhibited by intrapleural injection of LcS. Oral administration of other probiotic bacteria, such as Streptococcus thermophilus (St), Lactobacillus fermentum (Lf) and yeast (Y), elicited different immune responses. Mice that were prefed yeast or Lf followed by feeding with ovalbumin (OVA) responded better to vaccination with OVA than mice not given either probiotic or OVA or mice that had been prefed only OVA. However, antibody responses were significantly suppressed in response to vaccination with OVA in mice that had been prefed yeast followed by yeast and OVA as well as mice prefed Lf followed by Lf and OVA. Prefeeding St followed by OVA feeding enhanced cellular immune responses against ovalbumin. In contrast, mice prefed St followed by St + OVA were hyporesponsive against OVA. While antigen feeding alone appears to prime for an immune response, cofeeding antigen with probiotic bacteria can suppress both antibody and cellular immune responses and may provide an efficacious protocol to attenuate autoimmune diseases, such as experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, by jointly dosing with myelin basic protein and probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide induction in murine macrophages by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. Based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. Specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. gasseri, L. helveticus, L. reuteri, and Streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (NO) production were examined in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. A similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and Peyer's patch cells. Both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) IL-6, and NO. Pronounced enhancement of IL-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and Peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. Based on the results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and NO, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.
TI  - Starter culture activity in refrigerated fermented soymilk.
AB  - The refrigerated shelf life of soymilk fermented with single cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum, L. casei, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium longum was evaluated. During storage at 4 degrees C for 28 days, the stability of the microflora differed markedly among the starter cultures. After 28 days, the average numbers of S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus decreased by two log cycles to 6.0 x 10(7) CFU/ml, whereas those of L. casei increased gradually by more than two log cycles to 4.6 x 10(9) CFU/ml. Numbers of B. longum and L. fermentum remained moderately high (8.7 x 10(8) CFU/ml and 3.7 x 10(8) CFU/ml, respectively) even after 28 days of storage. S. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and L. casei continued to metabolize sucrose during the storage period, but the pattern of consumption was different among the strains. The other starter cultures did not seem to have significant activity (P > 0.05) on the residual sugars. In most cases, L(+)-lactate predominated.
TI  - Study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. Antigens administered orally can interact with M cells of Peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. We have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance the gut inflammatory immune response. The aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. We studied IgA+ and IgM+ B cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and CD4+ T cells and IgA anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by oral administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. plantarum, Lb. rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. The increase in the IgA+ B cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the IgA cycle by interaction with M cells from Peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. The IgM+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from IgM+ to IgA+. The increase in the CD4+ cells suggests interaction of Peyer's patches and enhancement of the B- and T-cell migration. The anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. We demonstrated that Lb. casei and Lb. plantarum were able to interact with Peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in IgA-, CD4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. Lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. Although Lb. rhamnosus and Strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. Lactococcus lactis and Lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of IgA+ cells entering the IgA cycle but not CD4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated B lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. We did not determine specific antibodies against Lc. lactis or Lb. bulgaricus.
TI  - Effects of lactic acid bacteria ingestion of basal cytokine mRNA and immunoglobulin levels in the mouse.
AB  - An increasing number of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations containing lactic acid bacteria are being promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. However, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes remain undefined. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that basal gastrointestinal immune status in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. The specific objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of repeated oral exposure to viable and nonviable lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, and Streptococcus thermophilus) in mice on basal cytokine mRNA expression in mucosal (Peyer's patches), systemic (spleen), and lymphoid tissue and on immunoglobulin levels. The results indicated that oral exposure to 10(9) CFU/day for up to 14 days did not significantly affect basal interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or interleukin-6 mRNA expression or total serum and intestinal immunoglobulins.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria growth promoters from Spirulina platensis.
AB  - Spirulina has been used for many years as human food because of its high protein  content and nutritional value. Some strains also produce bioactive substances that may inhibit or promote microbial growth. Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus were grown in rich media, MRS and RM, as well as in minimal saline medium with and without addition of extracellular products obtained from a late log phase culture of Spirulina platensis in Zarrouk medium. In both MRS and RM media, the extracellular products significantly promote the growth of the lactic acid bacteria assayed. This stimulatory effect was observed in media with pH adjusted to 5.3, 6.3 and 7.0. No effect was observed in minimal saline medium.
TI  - The association of yogurt starters with Lactobacillus casei DN 114.001 in fermented milk alters the composition and metabolism of intestinal microflora in germ-free rats and in human flora-associated rats.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the effects of milk and of various fermented milks on the composition and metabolic activities of the intestinal microflora. Groups of eight rats were fed for 6 wk a diet containing 30% nonfermented milk (M), yogurt (Y), milk fermented with Lactobacillus casei (LcFM) or milk fermented with the association of L. casei DN 114.001 and yogurt starters (LcYFM). In the first study, the survival of the lactic acid bacteria from the fermented milks was assessed by bacterial enumeration in feces of germ-free rats (GF rats) fed milk or fermented milks. The metabolic activities of the lactic acid bacteria were studied in these rats by the measurement of glycolytic activities and products of bacterial fermentation, i.e., acetate and lactate (isoforms L and D). In a second study, the effects of fermented milks on the composition and metabolism [gas, glycolytic activities, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), alcohol and ammonia] of human flora were studied using human flora-associated rats (HF rats). In GF rats, the survival of L. casei in the feces did not differ between those fed the LcFM and LcYFM diets. L. bulgaricus was detected in the feces of the rats fed Y, whereas Streptoccus thermophilus was found in the feces of the LcYFM group. In HF rats, fecal concentration of Bifidobacteria was greater in the LcFM group than in the others. beta-Glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) activity was lower in rats fed LcFM and Y than in those fed M and LcYFM, whereas beta-galactosidase (3.2.1.23), alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1 20) and beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) activities were higher in the LcYFM group compared with the others. Methane excretion was higher in rats fed Y than in other groups. Cecal SCFA concentrations did not differ in LcFM, Y and M groups, but total SCFA, acetate, propionate and butyrate were significantly greater in the LcYFM group. These results suggest that milk fermented with the combination of L. casei and yogurt starters leads to specific effects that are different from the simple addition of the effects found with yogurt and milk fermented with L. casei. These specific effects are potentially beneficial to human health.
TI  - Pharmaceutical probiotics for the treatment of anaerobic and other infections.
AB  - Pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. The overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. Anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. Gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,Clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus casei GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecium. Vaginitis has been experimentally studied using L. acidophilus and L. casei GG. The efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. Requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.
TI  - The effect of cations on the hydrolysis of lactose and the transferase reactions  catalysed by beta-galactosidase from six strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - beta-Galactosidases from Lactobacillus delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056, Lb. casei 20094, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 7962, Streptococcus thermophilus TS2, Pediococcus pentosaceus PE39 and Bifidobacterium bifidum 1901 were partially purified. The rate of hydrolysis of lactose given by the predominant beta-galactosidase activity from each of the bacteria studied was in all cases enhanced by Mg2+, while the effect of K+ and Na+ differed from strain to strain. The beta-galactosidases from all strains also catalysed trans-galactosylation reactions. The types of oligosaccharides produced appeared to be very similar in each case, but the rates of their production differed. All the beta-galactosidases were also capable of hydrolysing galactosyl-lactose although, unlike the other bacteria studied, Lb. delbruekii subsp. bulgaricus 20056 and Lc. lactis subsp. lactis 7962 were unable to utilise galactosyl-lactose as a carbon source for growth.
TI  - Detection and localization of peptidases in Lactococcus lactis with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies against peptidases of Lactococcus lactis were isolated and  characterized: PEPN1-4 against a lysyl aminopeptidase PepN, PEPT1-5 against a tripeptidase PepT and PEPD1-3 against a dipeptidase PepD. These monoclonal antibodies reacted specifically with their respective antigens in crude cell extracts of Lc. lactis subspp. cremoris and lactis. A number of monoclonal antibodies cross reacted with proteins of other (lactic acid) bacteria. PEPT1, 2, 4 and 5 cross reacted weakly with a 35 kDa protein in Lactobacillus delbrueckii, while PEPT1 and PEPT2 reacted with proteins in the cell-free extract of Streptococcus thermophilus and Clostridium fervidus. Of the four isolated monoclonal antibodies against PEPN, only PEPN3 cross reacted weakly with a 90 kDa protein in Escherichia coli cell-free extract, and the other three antibody species against PEPN3 cross reacted with 80 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii, and Str. bovis, but not of Esch. coli. Of the three monoclonal antibodies against PepD, only PEPD1 and PEPD2 cross reacted with 40 kDa proteins of Lb. casei, Lb. delbrueckii and Str. bovis. All PEPN, PEPD and PEPT antibodies reacted with components in cell-free extracts of eleven different Lc. lactis strains, indicating that the peptidases of these strains were very similar to those of Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris WG2. However, Lc. lactis subsp. hordniae appeared to differ from the other Lc. lactis subspecies since only PEPT1, 2 and 5 reacted with a protein in the cell-free extract. Immunogold labelling of Lc. lactis WG2 with the isolated monoclonal antibodies revealed that PepN, PepD and PepT were located intracellularly. The intracellular location of these peptidases is discussed in relation to the supply of essential amino acids and peptides.
TI  - Modulation of proliferation, second messenger levels, and morphotype expression of the rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 by fermented milk.
AB  - Trophic effects of milk fermented with Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Bifidobacterium sp., or the combination of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (yogurt) were studied on the IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cell line. Incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine, mitochondrial dehydrogenase activities, cyclic AMP production, and differentiation of levels of the IEC-6 strain were evaluated between the 15th and 30th passage in culture. All fermented and unfermented milks enhanced trophic responses of IEC-6 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with the corresponding milks, supernatant fractions were more effective in stimulating mitochondrial dehydrogenase response. Fermented milk supernatants were also more effective than the corresponding unfermented fractions. Increases in DNA synthesis and cyclic AMP confirmed the activation observed with mitochondrial dehydrogenase. Yogurt induced the more trophic response with an increased number of the more differentiated cell morphotype. Fermentation with L. casei also demonstrated an important trophic adaptation of IEC-6 cells. Milk processing by lactic acid bacteria enhanced trophic and proliferation responses of intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6. These results suggested that IEC-6 cells could represent an accurate and easy in vitro model for testing the trophic quality of various nutrients and for an optimization of physiological digestive functions.
TI  - Antagonism of lactic acid bacteria towards Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia  coli on agar plates and in milk.
AB  - The antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei and Streptococcus thermophilus) on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was evaluated on MRS agar with the deferred and cross-streaking techniques, and in milk with the plate counting method. All LAB were repressive to S aureus and E coli on the agar medium. However, their suppressive activity was significantly reduced when the agar medium was buffered to pH 7.2. In normal milk, L acidophilus strains A and B, S thermophilus and its combinations with L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 6032 were inhibitory to S aureus, while in mastitic milk, only S thermophilus and its combinations showed inhibition. L acidophilus A and L bulgaricus 34104 were repressive to E coli growth in normal milk. S thermophilus and its combinations were inhibitory to E coli in both the normal and mastitic milk samples. These results indicate that the antagonistic activity of LAB on pathogenic bacteria varied with the type of media in which the tests were done, and that testing of in vitro antagonism in milk would be more informative than that in artificial media for in vivo tests concerning the possible roles of competitive microbiological ecology in mastitis control.
TI  - Development of RAPD protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  - A protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments has been developed. Using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic DNA. Different conditions of DNA release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. This RAPD protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. helveticus, Lact. casei, Lact. reuteri, Lact. plantarum, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria in the treatment of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis.
AB  - We compared different lactic acid bacteria for their effect on the immune response to rotavirus in children with acute rotavirus gastroenteritis. After initial oral rehydration, 49 children aged 6 to 35 months with rotavirus gastroenteritis randomly received either Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei strain GG (LGG), L. casei subsp. rhamnosus (Lactophilus), or a combination of Streptococcus thermophilus and L. delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus (Yalacta) twice daily for 5 days. Serum antibodies to rotavirus, total number of immunoglobulin-secreting cells (ISC), and specific antibody-secreting cells (sASC) to rotavirus were measured at the acute stage and at convalescence. The mean (SD) duration of diarrhea was 1.8 (0.8) days in children who received LGG, 2.8 (1.2) days in those receiving Lactophilus, and 2.6 (1.4) days in those receiving Yalacta (F = 3.3, p = 0.04). The ISC response was comparable in the three study groups, but the rotavirus-specific immune responses were different. LGG therapy was associated with an enhancement of IgA sASC to rotavirus and serum IgA antibody level at convalescent stage. We conclude that certain strains of lactic acid bacteria, particularly LGG, promote serum and intestinal immune responses to rotavirus, and thus may be important in establishing immunity against rotavirus reinfections.
TI  - Absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - To investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. The production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by HPLC analysis in growing cultures. Resting whole cells from a positive control strain, Eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mM cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at pH 7.3. However, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. In growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by E. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. None of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequencing of L-lactate dehydrogenase gene from Streptococcus thermophilus M-192.
AB  - The gene encoding L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was cloned from an industrial dairy strain of Streptococcus thermophilus M-192 using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The enzyme was deduced to have 328 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 35,428 and found to have high sequence similarity to LDHs from other lactic acid bacteria (89.0% to Streptococcus mutans, 76.3% to Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 67% to Lactobacillus casei, and 60% to Lactobacillus plantarum). The gene contained a promoter-like sequence similar to the Escherichia coli promoter consensus, and expression of the S. thermophilus LDH gene was observed in E. coli cells.
TI  - Construction and characterization of shuttle plasmids for lactic acid bacteria and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The chimeric plasmid pBN183 was first constructed in Escherichia coli by ligating the BamHI-digested E. coli plasmid pBR322 and a Bg/II-linearized streptococcal plasmid, pNZ18. The pBN183 transformed E. coli to ApR at a frequency of (8.2 +/- 1.2) x 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/microgram DNA. Electrotransformation of Streptococcus thermophilus with pBN183 yielded CmR, ApS clones at a frequency of (2.6 +/- 0.3) x 10(1) CFU/microgram DNA. Plasmid screening with pBN183-transformed S. thermophilus clones revealed that ca. 70% of these transformants contained deleted plasmids. Plasmid pBN183A, a pBN183 deletion mutant lacking one copy of a tandemly arranged, highly homologous DNA sequence, was isolated for further study. It transformed E. coli to ApR and S. thermophilus to CmR with frequencies of (4.8 +/- 0.1) x 10(5) and (8.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(2) CFU/microgram DNA, respectively. Screening of S. thermophilus transformants did not show the presence of deleted plasmids. Based on the structure of pBN183A, a new shuttle plasmid, pDBN183, was constructed from pBN183 by removal of the small (1.2 kb) Sa/I fragment. Transformation frequencies of pDBN183 were (5.0 +/- 1.3) x 10(5) and (4.6 +/- 0.2) x 10(2) CFU/microgram DNA with E. coli and S. thermophilus, respectively. In contrast to the parent pBN183, only 17% of the pDBN183-transformed S. thermophilus contained deleted plasmids. Plasmid copy numbers of the three vectors in E. coli were estimated at 17-18 per chromosome. The three plasmids conferred ApR and CmR to E. coli, but only CmR to S. thermophilus. The insertion of a Streptomyces cholesterol oxidase gene (choA) into pDBN183 did not affect the plasmid's stability in Lactobacillus casei, but resulted in deletion of the recombinant DNA in S. thermophilus.
TI  - Diffusion of lactose in kappa-carrageenan/locust bean gum gel beads with or without entrapped growing lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Effective diffusion coefficients (De) of lactose in kappa-carrageenan (2.75% wt/wt)/locust bean gum (0.25% wt/wt) (LBG) gel beads (1.5-2.0-mm diameter)with or without entrapped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were determined at 40 degrees C. The effects of lactose concentration, bacteria strain (Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei) and cell content at various steps of the fermentation process (after immobilization, pre-incubation of the beads and successive fermentations) were measured on De as a first step for process modelling. Results were obtained from transiend concentration changes n well-stirred lactose solutions in which the beads were suspended. A mathematical model of unsteady-state diffusion in a sphere was used, and De was obtained from the best fit of the experimental data. Diffusivity of lactose in cell-tree beads was significantly lower than in pure water mainly because of the obstruction effect of the polymer chains and the hydration region. Furthermore, effective diffusivity and equilibrium partition factor were independent of lactose concentration in the range from 12.5 to 50 g/L. No significant difference was found for De (effective diffusivity) and Kp (partition) coefficients between beads entrapping S. thermophilus (approximately 5 x 10(9) CFU/mL) and cell-free beads. On the other hand higher cell counts obtained with L. casei (close to 1.8 x 10(11) CFU/mL) increased mass transfer resistance resulting in lower effective diffusivities and Kp. Finally, the effects of the type of bacteria and their distribution in the beads on the diffusivity were also discussed.
TI  - [Adjuvant activity of lactic bacteria: perspectives for its use in oral vaccines].
AB  - The effect of the oral and subcutaneous administration of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus on humoral antibody production and delayed type hypersensitivity response against sheep red blood cells (SRBC) was studied. The species of the genus Lactobacillus proved to be more effective in both cases, effects being stronger when working with viable bacteria than with non-viable cells. The stimulation of primary cellular and humoral immune responses reached optimal activity with a dose of 6 x 10(9) cells. The plaque-forming cells (PFC) and the circulating antibody titers to the SRBC antigen obtained in the groups treated with lactobacilli were 2 to 3 times higher than those of the non-treated control group. In mice fed with the different lactic acid bacteria circulating antibody against these microorganisms failed to be detected, but when they were administered by subcutaneous route a strong response to antilactic acid bacteria was stimulated. S. thermophilus was not effective in increasing the immune response. These results suggest that the lactobacilli by oral route, exert a strong adjuvant activity which is responsible for the enhanced host immune responses obtained. In this respect, lactobacilli could be considered as the most promising oral adjuvant.
TI  - Adherence of specific yogurt micro-organisms to human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
AB  - Yogurt lactic-acid-bacteria (LAB) consisting of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were evaluated for their capacity to bind to human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). These micro-organisms adhere to human T lymphocytes, and bind to B lymphocytes, in high and low frequencies, respectively. In addition, a quantitative analysis of LAB binding to PBL was carried out using the same parameters previously applied to a Salmonella model. The effect of yogurt LAB on the natural anti-bacterial activity exerted by PBL was examined. Lymphocyte pretreatment with bacteria did not affect such functions. These findings are discussed in the light of the well known ability of yogurt LAB to modulate the immune response.
TI  - Fermentation of aqueous plant seed extracts by lactic Acid bacteria.
AB  - The effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), peanut (Arachis hypogea), soybean (Glycine max), and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) were studied. The bacteria investigated were Lactobacillus helveticus, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. During fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, pH, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees C. Maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, pH, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. The maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in pH. Change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. Color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. In the extracts inoculated simultaneously with L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, a synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased pH in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. Fermented extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.
