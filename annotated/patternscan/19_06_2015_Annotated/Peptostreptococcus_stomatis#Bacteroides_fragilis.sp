TI  == prospective study of bacteremia and complications with eus fna of rectal and perirectal lesions.
AB  == background & aims: recent studies showed that endoscopic ultrasound (eus)-guided  fine-needle aspiration (fna) is a low-risk procedure for causing bacteremia and infectious complications when sampling solid lesions of the upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract. as a result, antibiotics are not recommended for prophylaxis against endocarditis. our aim was to prospectively evaluate the risk  of bacteremia and other infectious complications in patients undergoing eus fna of lower gi tract lesions. methods: patients referred for eus fna of lower gi tract lesions were considered for enrollment. patients were excluded if there was an indication for preprocedure antibiotic administration based on american society for gastrointestinal endoscopy guidelines, had taken antibiotics within the prior 7 days, or if they had a cystic lesion. blood cultures were obtained immediately before the procedure, after flexible sigmoidoscopy/radial eus, and 15 minutes after eus fna. results: one hundred patients underwent a total of 471 fnas (mean, 4.7 fnas/patient; range, 1-10 fnas/patient). blood cultures were positive in 6 patients. cultures from 4 patients (4.0%, 95% confidence interval,  1.6%-9.8%) grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n = 2), peptostreptococcus stomatis (n = 1), or moraxella (n = 1), which were considered contaminants. two patients (2.0%, 95% confidence interval, 0.6%-7%) developed bacteremia: bacteroides fragilis (n = 1) and gemella morbillorum (n = 1). no signs or symptoms of infection developed in any patient. conclusions: eus fna of solid lesions in the lower gi tract should be considered a low-risk procedure for infectious complications that does not warrant prophylactic administration of antibiotics for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis.
