TI  == uncovering major genomic features of essential genes in bacteria and a methanogenic archaea.
AB  == identification of essential genes is critical to understand the physiology of a species, propose novel drug targets and uncover minimal gene sets required for life. although essential gene sets of several organisms have been determined using large-scale mutagenesis techniques, systematic studies addressing their conservation, genomic context and functions remain scant. here we integrate 17 essential gene sets from genome-wide in vitro screenings and three gene collections required for growth in vivo, encompassing 15 bacteria and one archaea. we refine and generalize important theories proposed using escherichia coli. essential genes are typically monogenic and more conserved than nonessential genes. genes required in vivo are less conserved than those essential in vitro, suggesting that more divergent strategies are deployed when the organism is stressed by the host immune system and unstable nutrient availability. we identified essential analogous pathways that would probably be missed by orthology-based essentiality prediction strategies. for example, streptococcus sanguinis carries horizontally-transferred isoprenoid biosynthesis  genes that are widespread in archaea. genes specifically essential in mycobacterium tuberculosis and burkholderia pseudomallei are reported as potential drug targets. moreover, essential genes are not only preferentially located in operons, but also occupy the first position therein, supporting the influence of their regulatory regions in driving transcription of whole operons.  finally, these important genomic features are shared between bacteria and at least one archaea, suggesting that high order properties of gene essentiality and genome architecture were probably present in the last universal common ancestor or evolved independently in the prokaryotic domains. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == effects of streptococcus sanguinis bacteriocin on cell surface hydrophobicity, membrane permeability, and ultrastructure of candida thallus.
AB  == candida albicans (c.a) and candida tropicalis (c.t) were treated with streptococcus sanguinis bacteriocin (s.s bacteriocin), respectively; the bacteriostatic dynamics of s.s bacteriocin, their effects on cell surface hydrophobicity, leakage of inorganic phosphorus and macromolecular substance, cytosolic calcium concentration, and ultrastructure changes of candida thallus were detected and analyzed. the results showed that inhibitory effect of s.s bacteriocin on c.a and c.t reached peak level at 24 h, the cell-surface hydrophobicity decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after s.s bacteriocin treatment, and there was leakage of cytoplasmic inorganic phosphorus and macromolecular substance from c.a and c.t; cytosolic calcium concentration decreased greatly. after 24 h treatment by s.s bacteriocin, depressive deformity  and defect could be found in the cell surface of c.a and c.t; the thallus displayed irregular forms: c.a was shrunken, there was unclear margins abutting upon cell wall and cell membrane, nucleus disappeared, and cytoplasm was inhomogeneous; likewise, c.t was first plasmolysis, and then the cytoplasm was shrunk, the ultrastructure of cell wall and cell membrane was continuously damaged, and the nucleus was karyolysis. it was illustrated that s.s bacteriocin  had similar antifungal effect on c.a and c.t; their cell surface hydrophobicity,  membrane permeability, and ultrastructure were changed significantly on exposure  to s.s bacteriocin.

TI  == a study of the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  == objective: to explore the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella intermedia, lactobacillus acidophilus, and candida albicans. methods: the bacteria were cultured on brain heart infusion (bhi) agar and bhi blood agar, and bacterial colonies were collected for further amplification in liquid medium. bacterial suspensions in physiological saline were equally divided into three parts for bacteria counting, fluorescence spectrometry detection, and fluorescence microscope examination. results: the optimal excitation wavelength of the bacteria was 350 nm; their characteristic fluorescence peak position was at 436 +/- 4 nm. there was a significant linear correlation between fluorescence  intensity and bacterial concentration. the mean optical density (mod) of s. mutans and l. acidophilus cultivated in bhi blood was significantly higher than that cultivated in bhi agar (110 +/- 10 vs. 57 +/- 20; 94 +/- 16 vs. 31 +/- 12, respectively, p < 0.05). the mod of s. sanguis, a. viscosus, and p. intermedia cultivated in bhi blood agar was higher than that cultivated in bhi agar (37 +/-  12 vs. 36 +/- 11; 43 +/- 17 vs. 38 +/- 6; 86 +/- 21 vs. 72 +/- 8, respectively, p > 0.05); the opposite was observed for c. albicans. conclusion: at 350 nm excitation wavelength, 436 +/- 4 nm is an indicator for detecting six cariogenic  bacteria. the fluorescence energy, q, is a valuable index reflecting bacterial concentration under fluorescence spectrometry detection. exogenous fluorescence groups have greater influence on fluorescence intensity and little influence on fluorescence peak position detection.

TI  == novel antimicrobial peptide specifically active against porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, the major etiologic agent of chronic periodontitis, produces a broad spectrum of virulence factors, including outer membrane vesicles, lipopolysaccharides, hemolysins and proteinases. antimicrobial peptides (amps) including bacteriocins have been found to inhibit the growth of p. gingivalis; however, these peptides are relatively large molecules. hence, it is  difficult to synthesize them by a scale-up production. therefore, this study aimed to synthesize a shorter amp that was still active against p. gingivalis. a  peptide that contained three cationic amino acids (arg, his and lys), two anionic amino acids (glu and asp), hydrophobic amino acids residues (leu, ile, val, ala and pro) and hydrophilic residues (ser and gly) was obtained and named pep-7. its bioactivity and stability were tested after various treatments. the mechanism of  action of pep-7 and its toxicity to human red blood cells were investigated. the  pep-7 inhibited two pathogenic p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and p. gingivalis atcc 53978 (wp50) strains at a minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of 1.7 microm, but was ineffective against other oral microorganisms (p. intermedia, tannerella  forsythensis, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguinis). from transmission electron microscopy studies, pep-7 caused pore formation at the poles of the cytoplasmic membranes of p. gingivalis. a concentration of pep-7 at  four times that of its mbc induced some hemolysis but only at 0.3 %. the pep-7 was heat stable under pressure (autoclave at 110 and 121 degrees c) and possessed activity over a ph range of 6.8-8.5. it was not toxic to periodontal cells over a range of 70.8-4.4 mum and did not induce toxic pro-inflammatory cytokines. the pep-7 showed selective activity against porphyromonas sp. by altering the permeability barriers of p. gingivalis. the pep-7 was not mutagenic in vitro. this work highlighted the potential for the use of this synthetic pep-7 against p. gingivalis.

TI  == the oral mucosal and salivary microbial community of behcet's syndrome and recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
AB  == background: behcet's syndrome (bs) is a multisystem immune-related disease of unknown etiology. recurrent aphthous stomatitis (ras) is characterized by the presence of idiopathic oral ulceration without extraoral manifestation. the interplay between the oral microbial communities and the immune response could play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of both bs and ras. objective: to investigate the salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities in  bs and ras. methods: purified microbial dna isolated from saliva samples (54 bs,  25 healthy controls [hc], and 8 ras) were examined by the human oral microbe identification microarray. cultivable salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities from ulcer and non-ulcer sites were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis. mycobacterium spp. were detected in saliva and in ulcer and non-ulcer oral mucosal brush biopsies following culture on lowenstein-jensen slopes and mycobacterial growth indicator  tubes. results: there was increased colonization with rothia denticariosa of the  non-ulcer sites of bs and ras patients (p<0.05). ulcer sites in bs were highly colonized with streptococcus salivarius compared to those of ras (p<0.05), and with streptococcus sanguinis compared to hc (p<0.0001). oral mucosa of hc were more highly colonized with neisseria and veillonella compared to all studied groups (p<0.0001). conclusions: despite the uncertainty whether the reported differences in the oral mucosal microbial community of bs and ras are of causative or reactive nature, it is envisaged that restoring the balance of the oral microbial community of the ulcer sites may be used in the future as a new treatment modality for oral ulceration.

TI  == association of oral streptococci community dynamics with severe early childhood caries as assessed by pcr-dgge targeting the rnpb gene.
AB  == this study sought to investigate the possible association between the dynamics of oral streptococci community profiles and severe early childhood caries (s-ecc) development, compared to caries-free (cf) controls. supragingival plaque samples  were evaluated from 8 to 32-month-old children who had been previously assessed for overall profiles of their oral microbial community. twelve children were in each group. bacterial genomic dna was extracted and used to amplify the rnpb-specific primers for streptococci; the products were then subjected to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and sequence analysis. we observed that the mean values for species richness (n) and diversity of oral streptococci  (h') were significantly lower in the s-ecc group than in the cf group (n = 11.25  +/- 4.14 vs. 14.92 +/- 2.84; h'= 1.41 +/- 0.29 vs. 1.64 +/- 0.18) at 32 months of age (p< 0.05).significantly higher detection rates of streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii were found in the cf group than in the s-ecc group at 32 months of age (p< 0.05). cluster analysis of dgge profiles showed that most of the clusters were constructed from one individual over time.these results suggest that the onset of s-ecc is accompanied by reduced diversity of oral streptococci; the detection rates of streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii have negative correlations with s-ecc; there are high levels ofintra-individual similarity for the oral streptococci community over time. abbreviations: s-ecc, severe early childhood caries; cf, caries-free; dgge, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.

TI  == essential genes in the core genome of the human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus, gas) remains a major public health burden worldwide, infecting over 750 million people leading to over 500,000 deaths annually. gas pathogenesis is complex, involving genetically distinct gas  strains and multiple infection sites. to overcome fastidious genetic manipulations and accelerate pathogenesis investigations in gas, we developed a mariner-based system (krmit) for en masse monitoring of complex mutant pools by transposon sequencing (tn-seq). highly saturated transposant libraries (krmit insertions in ca. every 25 nucleotides) were generated in two distinct gas clinical isolates, a serotype m1t1 invasive strain 5448 and a nephritogenic serotype m49 strain nz131, and analyzed using a bayesian statistical model to predict gas essential genes, identifying sets of 227 and 241 of those genes in 5448 and nz131, respectively. a large proportion of gas essential genes corresponded to key cellular processes and metabolic pathways, and 177 were found conserved within the gas core genome established from 20 available gas genomes. selected essential genes were validated using conditional-expression mutants. finally, comparison to previous essentiality analyses in s. sanguinis and s. pneumoniae revealed significant overlaps, providing valuable insights for the development of new antimicrobials to treat infections by gas and other pathogenic streptococci.

TI  == interleukin-6 and microrna profiles induced by oral bacteria in human atheroma derived and healthy smooth muscle cells.
AB  == background: atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease with possible contributions from bacterial antigens. we aimed to investigate the role of oral bacteria as inducers of inflammatory cascades in smooth muscle cells from carotid endarterectomy patients (athsmcs) and healthy controls (hsmcs). findings: inactivated streptococcus mitis, s. sanguinis, s. gorgonii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were used to stimulate inflammation in hsmcs and athsmcs. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfalpha) was used as a positive control in all stimulations. interleukin-6 (il-6) levels were  determined from cell culture supernatants and microrna expression profiles from cells after 24 h of bacterial stimulation. genome wide expression (gwe) analyses  were performed after 5 h stimulation. all studied bacteria induced pro inflammatory il-6 production in both smcs. the most powerful inducer of il-6 was  a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.001). of the 84 studied mirnas, expression of 9 mirnas differed significantly (p </= 0.001) between hsmcs and athsmcs stimulated  with inactivated bacteria or tnfalpha. the data was divided into two groups: high il-6 producers (a. actinomytectemcomititans and tnfalpha) and low il-6 producers  (streptococcal strains and p. gingivalis). the expression of 4 mirnas (mir-181-5p, -186-5p, -28-5p and -155-5p) differed statistically significantly (p < 0.001) between healthy hsmcs and athsmcs in the low il-6 producer group. according to multidimensional scaling, two gene expression clusters were seen: one in hsmcs and one athsmcs. conclusions: our results suggest that inactivated oral bacteria induce inflammation that is differently regulated in healthy and atherosclerotic smcs.

AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == proteome analysis identifies the dpr protein of streptococcus mutans as an important factor in the presence of early streptococcal colonizers of tooth surfaces.
AB  == oral streptococci are primary colonizers of tooth surfaces and streptococcus mutans is the principal causative agent of dental caries in humans. a number of proteins are involved in the formation of monospecies biofilms by s. mutans. this study analyzed the protein expression profiles of s. mutans biofilms formed in the presence or absence of s. gordonii, a pioneer colonizer of the tooth surface, by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de). after identifying s. mutans proteins by mass spectrometric analysis, their expression in the presence of s. gordonii was analyzed. s. mutans was inoculated with or without s. gordonii dl1.  the two species were compartmentalized using 0.2-mul anopore membranes. the biofilms on polystyrene plates were harvested, and the solubilized proteins were  separated by 2-de. when s. mutans biofilms were formed in the presence of s. gordonii, the peroxide resistance protein dpr of the former showed 4.3-fold increased expression compared to biofilms that developed in the absence of the pioneer colonizer. in addition, we performed a competition assay using s. mutans  antioxidant protein mutants together with s. gordonii and other initial colonizers. growth of the dpr-knockout s. mutans mutant was significantly inhibited by s. gordonii, as well as by s. sanguinis. furthermore, a cell viability assay revealed that the viability of the dpr-defective mutant was significantly attenuated compared to the wild-type strain when co-cultured with s. gordonii. therefore, these results suggest that dpr might be one of the essential proteins for s. mutans survival on teeth in the presence of early colonizing oral streptococci.

TI  == bacteria-induced intracellular signalling in platelets.
AB  == multiple studies have now shown that various species of bacteria can stimulate platelets; many in a strain and donor-dependent manner. the signalling pathways underlying this platelet activation has been the subject of scrutiny for the last decade. the best-delineated pathway is that in response to streptococcal species, such as streptococcus sanguinis (s. sanguinis), streptococcus gordonii (s. gordonii) and streptococcus oralis (s. oralis), where a pathway is initiated by the engagement of the low affinity igg receptor, fcgammariia. this leads to and involves the tyrosine kinase syk, the adaptor protein linker of activated t cells (lat) and subsequently both phospholipase cgamma2 (plcgamma2) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pi-3-k). finally, this leads to the expression of  the alphaiibbeta3 integrin, the synthesis and release of thromboxane a2 (t x a2)  and the exocytosis of pf4, each of which plays a crucial role in secondary signalling and full platelet activation. roles for other signalling pathways in streptococcal-induced platelet activation are less clear, although an adp-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, a glycoprotein ib/ix/v-mediated pathway and perhaps a complement-induced pathway have each been proposed. platelet activation by porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) at least partially shares the fcgammariia/syk/plcgamma2/pi-3-k mechanism utilised by streptococcal species. however, it has also been suggested that p. gingivalis activates platelets by two additional methods; stimulation of the protease-activated receptors leading to activation of phospholipase cbeta (plcbeta), and the engagement of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 by released lipopolysaccharide leading to an ill-defined pathway which may involve pi-3-k. consequently, it appears that bacteria can stimulate platelets by eliciting multiple signalling pathways some of which are common, and some unique, to individual species.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == penetration of streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus sanguinis into dental enamel.
AB  == the aim of this pilot study was to assess the difference in virulence of acidogenic and aciduric oral streptococci in an in vitro caries model using their penetration depths into dental enamel. 30 caries-free extracted molars from 11- to 16-year-olds were cleaned ultrasonically for 1 min with de-ionized water and,  after air-drying, embedded in epoxy resin. after 8-h of setting at room temperature, the specimens were ground on the buccal side with sic-paper 1200 (particle size 13-16 mum). enamel was removed in circular areas sized 3 mm in diameter; the mean depth of removed enamel was 230 +/- 60 mum. 15 specimens each  were incubated anaerobically under standardized conditions with 24 h-cultures of  streptococcus sanguinis 9s or streptococcus sobrinus omz 176 in balmelli broth at 37 +/- 2 degrees c; the ph-values of the broths were measured at the beginning and end of each incubation cycle. after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks 3 teeth each were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer for 24 h, washed 3x and dehydrated 30-60min by sequential washes through a series of 30-100% graded ethanol. the teeth were cut in half longitudinally; afterward, two slits were made to obtain fracture surfaces in the infected area. after critical-point-drying the fragments were gold-sputtered and viewed in a scanning  electron microscope at magnifications of x20-20,000. after 10 weeks of incubation, penetration of s. sanguinis of 11.13 +/- 24.04 mum below the break edges into the enamel was observed. the invasion of s. sobrinus reached depths of 87.53 +/- 76.34 mum. the difference was statistically significant (paired t test: p = 0.033). the experimental penetration depths emphasize the importance of s. sanguinis versus s. sobrinus in the context of the extended ecological plaque hypothesis.

TI  == effect of rhus coriaria l. water extract on five common oral bacteria and bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire.
AB  == background and objectives: recently, use of herbal medicine and plant extracts as a substitute for commercially available chemical drugs for control of infectious  diseases such as dental caries and periodontal disease has become increasingly popular. the present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of rhus coriaria l. water extract on five common oral bacteria and bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire. materials and methods: for primary assessment of the antibacterial properties of rhus coriaria l. water extract, the well-plate method in bhia (brain heart infusion agar, merck, germany) medium was used using macrodilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the extract against each microorganism were determined. the effect of rhus coriaria l. on bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire was assessed using viable cell count in biofilm medium (bm) containing 3% sucrose. in the final phase, after fixation of samples in alcohol and glutaraldehyde, samples were prepared for sem (scanning electron microscopy)  analysis. results: the diameter of the zone of growth inhibition was proportionate to the tested concentrations of the extract. the lowest mic (0.390  mg/ml) and mbc (1.5 mg/ml ) of the rhus coriaria l. were found to be against streptococcus sobrinus atcc 27607. rhus coriaria l. water extract decreased bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire at mic and 1/8 of mic by s. sanguinis atcc 10556, s. sobrinus atcc 27607, s. salivarius atcc 9222, s. mutans  atcc 35608 and e. faecalis cip 55142 by24.2%-43%, 68.5%-91.6%, 10.6%-79.1%, 22.2%-86.1% and 40.6%-76.4%, respectively. conclusion: based on the results, rhus coriaria l. water extract had significant antibacterial properties against five common oral bacteria and was able to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire. further investigations are recommended for widespread clinical  use of this extract.

TI  == platelets and infections - complex interactions with bacteria.
AB  == platelets can be considered sentinels of vascular system due to their high number in the circulation and to the range of functional immunoreceptors they express. platelets express a wide range of potential bacterial receptors, including complement receptors, fcgammarii, toll-like receptors but also integrins conventionally described in the hemostatic response, such as gpiib-iiia or gpib.  bacteria bind these receptors either directly, or indirectly via fibrinogen, fibronectin, the first complement c1q, the von willebrand factor, etc. the fate of platelet-bound bacteria is questioned. several studies reported the ability of activated platelets to internalize bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus or porphyromonas gingivalis, though there is no clue on what happens thereafter. are they sheltered from the immune system in the cytoplasm of platelets or are they lysed? indeed, while the presence of phagolysosome has not been demonstrated in platelets, they contain antimicrobial peptides that were shown to be efficient on s. aureus. besides, the fact that bacteria can bind to platelets via receptors involved in hemostasis suggests that they may induce aggregation; this has indeed been described for streptococcus sanguinis, s. epidermidis, or c. pneumoniae. on  the other hand, platelets are able to display an inflammatory response to an infectious triggering. we, and others, have shown that platelet release soluble immunomodulatory factors upon stimulation by bacterial components. moreover, interactions between bacteria and platelets are not limited to only these two partners. indeed, platelets are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial clearance by trapping  bacteria and concentrating antibacterial factors but in enhancing thrombosis. in  conclusion, the platelet-bacteria interplay is a complex game; its fine analysis  is complicated by the fact that the inflammatory component adds to the aggregation response.

TI  == antifouling coatings for dental implants: polyethylene glycol-like coatings on titanium by plasma polymerization.
AB  == titanium dental implants are commonly used for the replacement of lost teeth, but they present a considerable number of failures due to the infection on surrounding tissues. the aim of this paper is the development of a polyethylene glycol-like (peg-like) coating on the titanium surface by plasma polymerization to obtain a novel improved surface with suitable low bacterial adhesion and adequate cell response. surface analysis data of these coatings are presented, in particular, water contact angle, surface roughness, and film chemistry, demonstrating the presence of a peg-like coating. streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius bacterial adhesion assays showed a decreased adhesion on the plasma polymerized samples, while cell adhesion of fibroblasts and osteoblasts on the treated surfaces was similar to control surfaces. thus, the peg-like antifouling coating obtained by plasma polymerization on ti confers this biomaterial's highly suitable properties for dental applications, as they reduce  the possibility of infection while allowing the tissue integration around the implant.

TI  == effect of antibacterial dental adhesive on multispecies biofilms formation.
AB  == antibacterial adhesives have favorable prospects to inhibit biofilms and secondary caries. the objectives of this study were to investigate the antibacterial effect of dental adhesives containing dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate (dmaddm) on different bacteria in controlled multispecies biofilms and its regulating effect on development of biofilm for the first time. antibacterial material was synthesized, and streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus sanguinis were chosen to form multispecies biofilms.  lactic acid assay and ph measurement were conducted to study the acid production  of controlled multispecies biofilms. anthrone method and exopolysaccharide (eps):bacteria volume ratio measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy were performed to determine the eps production of biofilms. the colony-forming unit counts, scanning electron microscope imaging, and dead:live volume ratio decided  by confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to study the biomass change of controlled multispecies biofilms. the taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction  and fluorescent in situ hybridization imaging were used to study the proportion change in multispecies biofilms of different groups. the results showed that dmaddm-containing adhesive groups slowed the ph drop and decreased the lactic acid production noticeably, especially lactic acid production in the 5% dmaddm group, which decreased 10- to 30-fold compared with control group (p < 0.05). eps was reduced significantly in 5% dmaddm group (p < 0.05). the dmaddm groups reduced the colony-forming unit counts significantly (p < 0.05) and had higher dead:live volume ratio in biofilms compared with control group (p < 0.05). the proportion of s. mutans decreased steadily in dmaddm-containing groups and continually increased in control group, and the biofilm had a more healthy development tendency after the regulation of dmaddm. in conclusion, the adhesives containing dmaddm had remarkable antimicrobial properties to serve as "bioactive" adhesive materials and revealed its potential value for antibiofilm and anticaries clinical applications.

TI  == environment and colonisation sequence are key parameters driving cooperation and  competition between pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis strains and oral commensal streptococci.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) patient airways harbour diverse microbial consortia that, in addition to the recognized principal pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, include other bacteria commonly regarded as commensals. the latter include the oral (viridans) streptococci, which recent evidence indicates play an active role during infection of this environmentally diverse niche. as the interactions between inhabitants of the cf airway can potentially alter disease progression, it is important to identify key cooperators/competitors and environmental influences if therapeutic intervention is to be improved and pulmonary decline arrested. importantly, we recently showed that virulence of the p. aeruginosa liverpool epidemic strain (les) could be potentiated by the anginosus-group of streptococci (ags). in the present study we explored the relationships between other viridans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis) and the les and observed that co-culture outcome was dependent upon inoculation sequence and environment. all four streptococcal species were shown to potentiate les virulence factor production in co-culture biofilms. however, in the case of s. oralis interactions were environmentally determined; in air cooperation within a high cell density co-culture biofilm occurred together with stimulation of les virulence factor production, while in an atmosphere containing added co2 this species became a competitor antagonising les growth through hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production, significantly altering biofilm population dynamics and appearance. streptococcus  mitis, s. gordonii and s. sanguinis were also capable of h2o2 mediated inhibition of p. aeruginosa growth, but this was only visible when inoculated as a primary coloniser prior to introduction of the les. therefore, these observations, which  are made in conditions relevant to the biology of cf disease pathogenesis, show that the pathogenic and colonisation potential of p. aeruginosa isolates can be modulated positively and negatively by the presence of oral commensal streptococci.

TI  == introducing a semi-coated model to investigate antibacterial effects of biocompatible polymers on titanium surfaces.
AB  == peri-implant infections from bacterial biofilms on artificial surfaces are a common threat to all medical implants. they are a handicap for the patient and can lead to implant failure or even life-threatening complications. new implant surfaces have to be developed to reduce biofilm formation and to improve the long-term prognosis of medical implants. the aim of this study was (1) to develop a new method to test the antibacterial efficacy of implant surfaces by direct surface contact and (2) to elucidate whether an innovative antimicrobial copolymer coating of 4-vinyl-n-hexylpyridinium bromide and dimethyl(2-methacryloyloxyethyl) phosphonate (vp:dmmep 30:70) on titanium is able to reduce the attachment of bacteria prevalent in peri-implant infections. with a new in vitro model with semi-coated titanium discs, we were able to show a dramatic reduction in the adhesion of various pathogenic bacteria (streptococcus  sanguinis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis),  completely independently of effects caused by soluble materials. in contrast, soft tissue cells (human gingival or dermis fibroblasts) were less affected by the same coating, despite a moderate reduction in initial adhesion of gingival fibroblasts. these data confirm the hypothesis that vp:dmmep 30:70 is a promising antibacterial copolymer that may be of use in several clinical applications.

AB  == background: the use of morse taper systems in dental implantology has been associated widely with a more precise adaptation between implants and their respective abutments. this may lead to an increase in the stability of the implant system and may also prevent microbial invasion through the implant-abutment interface. the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the ability of four commercially available morse taper system units to impede bacterial penetration through their implant-abutment interfaces. methods: abutments were screwed onto the implants, and the units were subsequently immersed in streptococcus sanguinis bacterial broth (1 x 10(8) colony forming units/ml) for 48 hours. the units were examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem) under three conditions: 1) with the implant-abutment components assembled as units to investigate for both the existence of microgaps and the presence of bacteria; 2) with the implants and abutments separated for examination of internal surfaces; and 3) with the implant-abutment components again assembled as units to measure any microgaps detected. the mean size of the microgaps in each unit was determined by measuring, under sem, their width in four equidistant points. results: microgaps were detected in all units with no significant differences in dimension (kruskal-wallis test, p >0.05). within all units, the presence of bacteria was also observed. conclusion: the seals provided by the interfaces of the commercially available morse taper implant-abutment units tested were not sufficiently small to shield the implant from bacterial penetration.

TI  == isolation of alkaline-tolerant bacteria from primary infected root canals.
AB  == introduction: alkaline-tolerant bacteria in primary infected root canals could have enhanced survival capacity against antimicrobials commonly used in root canal treatment. the aims of this study were to isolate and characterize alkaline-tolerant bacteria before endodontic treatment (s1), after chemomechanical root canal preparation (s2), and after calcium hydroxide dressing (s3). methods: bacteriologic samples were obtained from 43 primary infected root  canals. samples were inoculated into culture media at a ph of 9 and incubated anaerobically. the identities of bacterial isolates were determined by 16s ribosomal rna sequencing. results: all s1 samples were culture positive, with 70% harboring bacteria tolerating a ph of 9. gram-positive bacteria pseudoramibacter  alactolyticus and streptococcus spp were the most frequently isolated strains with a prevalence of 54%. of 13 culture-positive s2 samples, 8 isolates tolerated a ph of 9, namely streptococcus sanguinis, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cancerogenus, streptococcus oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. seven of these 8 isolates (88%) were correspondingly isolated at s1. all 3 culture-positive s3 samples tolerated a ph of 9, namely s. sanguinis and e. faecalis, which were also isolated in the corresponding s1 and s2 samples. conclusions: we showed that the  presence of alkaline-tolerant streptococcus and enterococcus spp in primary infected root canals could lead to their persistence during and after root canal  treatment and could pose a challenge to current treatment efficacy.

TI  == the innate defense antimicrobial peptides hbd3 and rnase7 are induced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by classical inflammatory cytokines but not th17 cytokines.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are multifunctional effector molecules of innate immunity. in this study we investigated whether endothelial cells actively contribute to innate defense mechanisms by expression of antimicrobial peptides. we therefore stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) with inflammatory cytokines, th17 cytokines, heat-inactivated bacteria, bacterial conditioned medium (bcm) of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus sanguinis, and lipoteichoic acid (lta). stimulation with single cytokines induced discrete expression of human beta-defensin 3 (hbd3) by ifn-gamma or il-1beta and of ribonuclease 7 (rnase7) by tnf-alpha without any effects on ll-37 gene expression. stronger hbd3 and rnase7 induction was observed after combined stimulation with il-1beta, tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma and was confirmed by high hbd3 and rnase7 peptide levels in cell culture supernatants. in contrast, th17 cytokines or stimulation with lta did not result in amp production. moreover, only bcm of an invasive s. aureus bacteremia isolate induced hbd3 in huvec. we conclude that endothelial cells actively contribute to prevent dissemination of pathogens at the blood-tissue-barrier by production of amps that exhibit microbicidal and immunomodulatory functions. further investigations should focus  on tissue-specific amp induction in different endothelial cell types, on pathogen-specific induction patterns and potentially involved pattern-recognition receptors of endothelial cells.

TI  == identifying essential streptococcus sanguinis genes using genome-wide deletion mutation.
AB  == essential genes in pathogens are important for the development of antibacterial drugs. in this report, we described a protocol to identify essential genes in the streptococcus sanguinis sk36 strain using genome-wide deletion mutation. a fusion pcr-based method is used to construct gene deletion fragments, which contain kanamycin resistance cassettes with two flanking arms of dna upstream and downstream of the target gene. the linear fused pcr amplicons were transformed into s. sanguinis sk36 cells. no kanamycin-resistant transformants suggested the  gene essentiality because the deletion of the essential gene renders a lethal phenotype of the transformants. the putative essential genes were further confirmed by independent transformations up to five attempts. the false nonessential genes were also identified by removing double-band mutants.

TI  == characterization of the arginolytic microflora provides insights into ph homeostasis in human oral biofilms.
AB  == a selected group of oral bacteria commonly associated with dental health is capable of producing alkali via the arginine deiminase system (ads), which has a  profound impact on the ph of human oral biofilms. an increased risk for dental caries has been associated with reduced ads activity of the bacteria in oral biofilms. arginolytic bacterial strains from dental plaque samples of caries-free and caries-active adults were isolated and characterized to investigate the basis for differences in plaque ads activity between individuals. fifty-six ads-positive bacterial strains were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing, and their ads activity levels were compared under standard growth conditions. the spectrum of bacterial ads activity ranged from 45.2 to 688.0 units (mg protein)(-1). although streptococcus sanguinis was the most prevalent species, other streptococcus sp. were also represented. biochemical assays carried out using 27 ads-positive strains under conditions known to induce or repress ads gene expression showed substantial variation in arginolytic activity in response  to ph, oxygen and the availability of carbohydrate or arginine. this study reveals that the basis for the wide spectrum of arginolytic expression observed among clinical strains is, at least in part, attributable to differences in the regulation of the ads within and between species. the results provide insights into the microbiological basis for intersubject differences in ads activity in oral biofilms and enhance our understanding of dental caries as an ecologically driven disease in which arginine metabolism moderates plaque ph and promotes dental health.

AB  == the 2013 leader surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the united states. a total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. the groups were staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. the mic90 value for each of the 6  pathogen groups was 1 mug/ml. susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was  99.83%. only 12 isolates (2 s. aureus, 3 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 streptococcus sanguinis, 5 enterococcus faecium, and 1 enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). three of these (2 s. aureus and 1 e. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. the findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.

TI  == comparison of species identification of endocarditis associated viridans streptococci using rnpb genotyping and 2 maldi-tof systems.
AB  == streptococcus spp. are important causes of infective endocarditis but challenging in species identification. this study compared identification based on sequence determination of the rnpb gene with 2 systems of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, maldi biotyper (bruker) and vitek ms ivd (biomerieux). blood culture isolates of viridans streptococci from 63 patients with infective endocarditis were tested. the 3 methods showed full agreement for all 36 isolates identified in the anginosus, bovis, and mutans groups or identified as streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, or streptococcus sanguinis. none of the methods could reliably identify the 23 isolates to the species level when designated as streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, or streptococcus tigurinus. in 7 isolates classified to the mitis group, the rnpb sequences deviated strikingly from all reference sequences, and additional analysis of soda and groel genes indicated the occurrence of yet unidentified streptococcus spp.

TI  == antibacterial properties of hlf1-11 peptide onto titanium surfaces: a comparison  study between silanization and surface initiated polymerization.
AB  == dental implant failure can be associated with infections that develop into peri-implantitis. in order to reduce biofilm formation, several strategies focusing on the use of antimicrobial peptides (amps) have been studied. to covalently immobilize these molecules onto metallic substrates, several techniques have been developed, including silanization and polymer brush prepared by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (atrp), with varied peptide binding yield and antibacterial performance. the aim of the present study was to compare the efficiency of these methods to immobilize the lactoferrin-derived hlf1-11 antibacterial peptide onto titanium, and evaluate their antibacterial activity in vitro. smooth titanium samples were coated with hlf1-11 peptide under three different conditions: silanization with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (aptes), and polymer brush based coatings with two different silanes. peptide presence was determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the mechanical stability of the coatings was studied under ultrasonication. the ldh assays confirmed that hffs viability and proliferation were no affected by the treatments. the in vitro antibacterial properties of the  modified surfaces were tested with two oral strains (streptococcus sanguinis and  lactobacillus salivarius) showing an outstanding reduction. a higher decrease in  bacterial attachment was noticed when samples were modified by atrp methods compared to silanization. this effect is likely due to the capacity to immobilize more peptide on the surfaces using polymer brushes and the nonfouling nature of polymer pdma segment.

TI  == combinatorial effects of arginine and fluoride on oral bacteria.
AB  == dental caries is closely associated with the microbial disequilibrium between acidogenic/aciduric pathogens and alkali-generating commensal residents within the dental plaque. fluoride is a widely used anticaries agent, which promotes tooth hard-tissue remineralization and suppresses bacterial activities. recent clinical trials have shown that oral hygiene products containing both fluoride and arginine possess a greater anticaries effect compared with those containing fluoride alone, indicating synergy between fluoride and arginine in caries management. here, we hypothesize that arginine may augment the ecological benefit of fluoride by enriching alkali-generating bacteria in the plaque biofilm and thus synergizes with fluoride in controlling dental caries. specifically, we assessed the combinatory effects of naf/arginine on planktonic and biofilm cultures of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and porphyromonas gingivalis with checkerboard microdilution assays. the optimal naf/arginine combinations were selected, and their combinatory effects on microbial composition were further examined in single-, dual-, and 3-species biofilm using  bacterial species-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. we found that arginine synergized with fluoride in suppressing acidogenic s. mutans in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. in addition, the naf/arginine combination synergistically reduced s. mutans but enriched s. sanguinis within the multispecies biofilms. more importantly, the optimal combination of naf/arginine maintained a "streptococcal pressure" against the potential growth of oral anaerobe p. gingivalis within the alkalized biofilm. taken together, we conclude that the combinatory application of fluoride and arginine has a potential synergistic effect in maintaining a healthy oral microbial equilibrium and thus represents a promising ecological approach to caries management.

TI  == oral streptococci utilize a siglec-like domain of serine-rich repeat adhesins to  preferentially target platelet sialoglycans in human blood.
AB  == damaged cardiac valves attract blood-borne bacteria, and infective endocarditis is often caused by viridans group streptococci. while such bacteria use multiple  adhesins to maintain their normal oral commensal state, recognition of platelet sialoglycans provides an intermediary for binding to damaged valvular endocardium. we use a customized sialoglycan microarray to explore the varied binding properties of phylogenetically related serine-rich repeat adhesins, the gspb, hsa, and srpa homologs from streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis species, which belong to a highly conserved family of glycoproteins that contribute to virulence for a broad range of gram-positive pathogens. binding profiles of recombinant soluble homologs containing novel sialic acid-recognizing siglec-like domains correlate well with binding of corresponding whole bacteria to arrays. these bacteria show multiple modes of glycan, protein,  or divalent cation-dependent binding to synthetic glycoconjugates and isolated glycoproteins in vitro. however, endogenous asialoglycan-recognizing clearance receptors are known to ensure that only fully sialylated glycans dominate in the  endovascular system, wherein we find these particular streptococci become primarily dependent on their siglec-like adhesins for glycan-mediated recognition events. remarkably, despite an excess of alternate sialoglycan ligands in cellular and soluble blood components, these adhesins selectively target intact bacteria to sialylated ligands on platelets, within human whole blood. these preferred interactions are inhibited by corresponding recombinant soluble adhesins, which also preferentially recognize platelets. our data indicate that circulating platelets may act as inadvertent trojan horse carriers of oral streptococci to the site of damaged endocardium, and provide an explanation why it is that among innumerable microbes that gain occasional access to the bloodstream, certain viridans group streptococci have a selective advantage in colonizing damaged cardiac valves and cause infective endocarditis.

TI  == identification and analysis of potential targets in streptococcus sanguinis using computer aided protein data analysis.
AB  == purpose: streptococcus sanguinis is a gram-positive, facultative aerobic bacterium that is a member of the viridans streptococcus group. it is found in human mouths in dental plaque, which accounts for both dental cavities and bacterial endocarditis, and which entails a mortality rate of 25%. although a range of remedial mediators have been found to control this organism, the effectiveness of agents such as penicillin, amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin, was observed. the emphasis of this investigation was on finding substitute and efficient remedial approaches for the total destruction of this bacterium. materials and methods: in this computational study, various databases and online software were used to ascertain some specific targets of s. sanguinis. particularly, the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes databases were applied to determine human nonhomologous proteins, as well as the metabolic pathways involved with those proteins. different software such as phyre2, castp, dogsitescorer, the protein function predictor server, and string were utilized to evaluate the probable active drug binding site with its known function and protein-protein interaction. results: in this study, among 218 essential proteins of this pathogenic bacterium, 81 nonhomologous proteins were accrued, and 15 proteins that are unique in several metabolic pathways of s. sanguinis were isolated through metabolic pathway analysis. furthermore, four essentially membrane-bound unique proteins that are involved in distinct metabolic pathways were revealed by this research. active sites and druggable pockets of these selected proteins were investigated with bioinformatic techniques. in addition, this study also mentions the activity of those proteins, as well as their interactions with the other proteins. conclusion: our findings helped to identify the type of protein to be considered  as an efficient drug target. this study will pave the way for researchers to develop and discover more effective and specific therapeutic agents against s. sanguinis.

TI  == phylogenomic and maldi-tof ms analysis of streptococcus sinensis hku4t reveals a  distinct phylogenetic clade in the genus streptococcus.
AB  == streptococcus sinensis is a recently discovered human pathogen isolated from blood cultures of patients with infective endocarditis. its phylogenetic position, as well as those of its closely related species, remains inconclusive when single genes were used for phylogenetic analysis. for example, s. sinensis branched out from members of the anginosus, mitis, and sanguinis groups in the 16s ribosomal rna gene phylogenetic tree, but it was clustered with members of the anginosus and sanguinis groups when groel gene sequences used for analysis. in this study, we sequenced the draft genome of s. sinensis and used a polyphasic approach, including concatenated genes, whole genomes, and matrix-assisted laser  desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry to analyze the phylogeny of s. sinensis. the size of the s. sinensis draft genome is 2.06 mb, with gc content of 42.2%. phylogenetic analysis using 50 concatenated genes or whole genomes revealed that s. sinensis formed a distinct cluster with streptococcus oligofermentans and streptococcus cristatus, and these three streptococci were clustered with the "sanguinis group." as for phylogenetic analysis using hierarchical cluster analysis of the mass spectra of streptococci, s. sinensis also formed a distinct cluster with s. oligofermentans and s. cristatus, but these three streptococci were clustered with the "mitis group." on the basis of the findings, we propose a novel group, named "sinensis group," to include s. sinensis, s. oligofermentans, and s. cristatus, in the streptococcus genus. our study also illustrates the power of phylogenomic analyses for resolving ambiguities in bacterial taxonomy.

TI  == oral streptococci and nitrite-mediated interference of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == the oral cavity harbors a diverse community of microbes that are physiologically  unique. oral microbes that exist in this polymicrobial environment can be pathogenic or beneficial to the host. numerous oral microbes contribute to the formation of dental caries and periodontitis; however, there is little understanding of the role these microbes play in systemic infections. there is mounting evidence that suggests that oral commensal streptococci are cocolonized  with pseudomonas aeruginosa during cystic fibrosis pulmonary infections and that  the presence of these oral streptococci contributes to improved lung function. the goal of this study was to examine the underlying mechanism by which streptococcus parasanguinis antagonizes pathogenic p. aeruginosa. in this study,  we discovered that oral commensal streptococci, including streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus gordonii, inhibit the growth of p. aeruginosa and that this inhibition is mediated by the presence of nitrite and the production of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) by oral streptococci. the  requirement of both h2o2 and nitrite for the inhibition of p. aeruginosa is due to the generation of reactive nitrogenous intermediates (rni), including peroxynitrite. transposon mutagenesis showed that a p. aeruginosa mutant defective in a putative abc transporter permease is resistant to both streptococcus/nitrite- and peroxynitrite-mediated killing. furthermore, s. parasanguinis protects drosophila melanogaster from killing by p. aeruginosa in a nitrite-dependent manner. our findings suggest that the combination of nitrite and h2o2 may represent a unique anti-infection strategy by oral streptococci during polymicrobial infections.

TI  == salivary antibody response to streptococci in preterm and fullterm children: a prospective study.
AB  == objectives: secretory immunoglobulins present in mucosa surfaces represent the first line of defense of the adaptive immune system against infectious challenges. preterm (pt) neonates' humoral immunity is diminished compared to full-term (ft) newborns. the identification of important antigens (ags) of virulence of oral species may help in the investigation of the mechanisms of antigenic stimulation and the development of the mucosal immune response. in the  present study, we measured saliva levels of immunoglobulins a (iga) and m (igm) and characterized the specificity of iga against ags of several streptococcal species found early in life. methods: this was a prospective observational study. salivary iga (siga) antibody responses to bacterial species that are prototypes of pioneer (streptococcus mitis, s. sanguinis, s. gordonii) and pathogenic (streptococcus mutans) microorganisms of the oral cavity were studied in ft and pt children in two visits: at birth (t0) and at 3 months of age (t3). salivas from 123 infants (72 ft and 51 pt) were collected during the first 10h after birth (t0) and again at 3 months of age (t3). salivary levels of iga and igm antibodies were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a subgroup of 26 ft and 24 pt children were compared with respect to patterns of antibody specificities against different streptococci ags using western blot assays. results: no significant differences (p>0.05) in salivary levels of iga and igm between ft and pt babies were found at birth. at t3, mean siga values were similar between groups and sigm levels were significantly higher in pt than ft (p<0.05). western blot assays identified positive iga response to streptococci in the majority of children, especially in the ft group. there were some differences between groups in relation to the frequency of children with positive response to ags and intensity of iga response. in general, oral streptococci ags were more frequently detected and bands were more intense in ft than in pt, especially in t3. prospective analysis of patterns of siga against ags of different streptococcal species revealed an increase in complexity of the siga antibody response from the first day of birth (t0) to t3 in pt and ft. conclusion: the patterns of siga response to streptococci ags appear to be influenced by the gestational age, which might reflect the level of immunological maturity of the mucosal immune system.

TI  == comparison of genes required for h2o2 resistance in streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) is produced by several members of the genus streptococcus mainly through the pyruvate oxidase spxb under aerobic growth conditions. the acute toxic nature of h2o2 raises the interesting question of how streptococci cope with intrinsically produced h2o2, which subsequently accumulates in the microenvironment and threatens the closely surrounding population. here, we investigate the h2o2 susceptibility of oral streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis and elucidate potential mechanisms of how they protect themselves from the deleterious effect of h2o2. both organisms are considered primary colonizers and occupy the same intraoral niche making them potential targets for h2o2 produced by other species. we demonstrate that s. gordonii produces relatively more h2o2 and has a greater ability for resistance to h2o2 stress. functional studies show that, unlike in streptococcus pneumoniae, h2o2 resistance is not dependent on a functional spxb and confirms the important  role of the ferritin-like dna-binding protein dps. however, the observed increased h2o2 resistance of s. gordonii over s. sanguinis is likely to be caused by an oxidative stress protection machinery present even under anaerobic conditions, while s. sanguinis requires a longer period of time for adaptation. the ability to produce more h2o2 and be more resistant to h2o2 might aid s. gordonii in the competitive oral biofilm environment, since it is lower in abundance yet manages to survive quite efficiently in the oral biofilm.

AB  == enterococcus faecalis is often involved in the aetiology of apical periodontitis  after endodontic treatment. this project aimed to establish, on dentine in vitro, a multi-species biofilm containing e. faecalis, and to determine if the organism  had an increased resistance to sodium hypochlorite compared with an axenic biofilm. biofilms were established on dentine discs in flow cells with either e.  faecalis alone (axenic) or together with fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus sanguinis. following treatment with either 0.9% sodium hypochlorite or saline, the viability of e. faecalis was determined by serial plating and qualitative analysis was performed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. viable counts indicated that 0.9% naocl is highly effective against e. faecalis grown alone and as part of a multi-species biofilm  (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.001, respectively). no significant difference in its survival in the two biofilm types was found (p = 0.8276).

TI  == two-component system vicrk regulates functions associated with establishment of streptococcus sanguinis in biofilms.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is a commensal pioneer colonizer of teeth and an opportunistic pathogen of infectious endocarditis. the establishment of s. sanguinis in host sites likely requires dynamic fitting of the cell wall in response to local stimuli. in this study, we investigated the two-component system (tcs) vicrk in s. sanguinis (vicrkss), which regulates genes of cell wall  biogenesis, biofilm formation, and virulence in opportunistic pathogens. a vick knockout mutant obtained from strain sk36 (skvic) showed slight reductions in aerobic growth and resistance to oxidative stress but an impaired ability to form biofilms, a phenotype restored in the complemented mutant. the biofilm-defective  phenotype was associated with reduced amounts of extracellular dna during aerobic growth, with reduced production of h2o2, a metabolic product associated with dna  release, and with inhibitory capacity of s. sanguinis competitor species. no changes in autolysis or cell surface hydrophobicity were detected in skvic. reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr), electrophoretic mobility shift  assays (emsa), and promoter sequence analyses revealed that vicr directly regulates genes encoding murein hydrolases (ssa_0094, cwdp, and gbpb) and spxb, which encodes pyruvate oxidase for h2o2 production. genes previously associated with spxb expression (spxr, ccpa, acka, and tpk) were not transcriptionally affected in skvic. rt-qpcr analyses of s. sanguinis biofilm cells further showed  upregulation of vicrk targets (spxb, gbpb, and ssa_0094) and other genes for biofilm formation (gtfp and come) compared to expression in planktonic cells. this study provides evidence that vicrkss regulates functions crucial for s. sanguinis establishment in biofilms and identifies novel vicrk targets potentially involved in hydrolytic activities of the cell wall required for these functions.

TI  == levels and complexity of iga antibody against oral bacteria in samples of human colostrum.
AB  == streptococcus mutans (sm) have three main virulence antigens: glucan binding protein b (gbpb), glucosyltransferase (gtf) and antigens i/ii (ag i/ii) envolved  in the capacity of those bacteria to adhere and accumulate in the dental biofilm. also, the glycosyltransferases 153 kda of streptococcus gordonii (sgo) and 170kda of streptococcus sanguinis (ssa) were important antigens associated with the accumulation of those bacterias. streptococcus mitis (smi) present iga1 protease  of 202 kda. we investigated the specificity and levels iga against those antigens of virulence in samples of human colostrum. this study involved 77 samples of colostrum that were analyzed for levels of immunoglobulian a, m and g by elisa. the specificity of iga against extracts of sm and initials colonizators (ssa, smi, sgo) were analyzed by the western blot. the mean concentration of iga was 2850.2 (+/-2567.2) mg/100 ml followed by igm and igg (respectively 321.8+/-90.3 and 88.3+/-51.5), statistically different (p<0.05). results showed that the majority of samples had detectable levels of iga antibodies to extracts of bacteria antigens and theirs virulence antigens. to sm, the gbpb was significantly lower detected than others antigens of sm (p<0.05). high complexities of response to ags were identified in the samples. there were no significant differences in the mean number of iga-reactive ags between the antigens (p>0.4). so, the breast milk from first hours after birth presented significant levels of iga specific against important virulence of antigens those  oral streptococci, which can disrupt the installation and accumulation process of these microorganisms in the oral cavity.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of exogenous nitric oxide on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == current treatments for periodontitis (e.g., scaling/root planing and chlorhexidine) have limited efficacy since they fail to suppress microbial biofilms satisfactorily over time, and the use of adjunctive antimicrobials can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. herein, we report the novel application of nitric oxide (no)-releasing scaffolds (i.e., dendrimers and  silica particles) as anti-periodontopathogenic agents. the effectiveness of macromolecular no release was demonstrated by a 3-log reduction in periodontopathogenic aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis viability. in contrast, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis, caries-associated organisms, were substantially less sensitive to no treatment. both dendrimer- and silica-based no release exhibited substantially less toxicity to human gingival fibroblasts at concentrations necessary to eradicate periodontopathogens than did clinical concentrations of chlorhexidine.  these results suggest the potential utility of macromolecular no-release scaffolds as a novel platform for the development of periodontal disease therapeutics.

TI  == in-office bleaching gel with 35% hydrogen peroxide enhanced biofilm formation of  early colonizing streptococci on human enamel.
AB  == objectives: to compare the effects of 25% and 35% hydrogen peroxide in-office bleaching systems on surface roughness and streptococcal biofilm formation on human enamel. methods: enamel specimens (3mmx3mmx2mm, n=162) from human permanent teeth were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups (n=54 each): (1) control, (2) bleached with 25% hydrogen peroxide (zoom2), and (3) bleached with 35% hydrogen peroxide (beyond). the enamel surface roughness was measured by a profilometer before and after treatments. subsequently, the treated enamel specimens were randomly placed into 3 subgroups (n=18 each) and incubated with: (1) trypticase soy broth control, (2) streptococcus mutans culture and (3) streptococcus sanguinis culture for 24h. biofilm formation was quantified by crystal violet staining. the biofilm structure on three specimens from each group was visualized by scanning electron microscopy. data were analyzed by kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney u tests with bonferroni corrections. significance level was set at p<0.05. results: both bleaching systems significantly reduced enamel surface roughness comparing to the control group (p<0.001), but there was no difference between the two treatment groups. remarkably, s. sanguinis biofilm formation was  significantly higher on enamel specimens bleached with 35% hydrogen peroxide than other treatments (p<0.001), but was lower on those bleached with 25% hydrogen peroxide (p<0.001). in contrast, no difference in s. mutans biofilm formation was observed among the three treatment groups. conclusion: both 25% and 35% hydrogen  peroxide caused similar degrees of reduction in enamel surface roughness. nevertheless, bleaching with 35% hydrogen peroxide appeared to markedly promote s. sanguinis biofilm formation. clinical significance: the increase of early colonizer biofilm raised concerns over adverse effects of in-office bleaching on  plaque formation. this should be further investigated in vivo and efficient plaque control should be emphasized after bleaching with high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide.

TI  == effects of simulated microgravity on streptococcus mutans physiology and biofilm  structure.
AB  == long-term spaceflights will eventually become an inevitable occurrence. previous  studies have indicated that oral infectious diseases, including dental caries, were more prevalent in astronauts due to the effect of microgravity. however, the impact of the space environment, especially the microgravity environment, on the  virulence factors of streptococcus mutans, a major caries-associated bacterium, is yet to be explored. in the present study, we investigated the impact of simulated microgravity on the physiology and biofilm structure of s. mutans. we also explored the dual-species interaction between s. mutans and streptococcus sanguinis under a simulated microgravity condition. results indicated that the simulated microgravity condition can enhance the acid tolerance ability, modify the biofilm architecture and extracellular polysaccharide distribution of s. mutans, and increase the proportion of s. mutans within a dual-species biofilm, probably through the regulation of various gene expressions. we hypothesize that  the enhanced competitiveness of s. mutans under simulated microgravity may cause  a multispecies micro-ecological imbalance, which would result in the initiation of dental caries. our current findings are consistent with previous studies, which revealed a higher astronaut-associated incidence of caries. further research is required to explore the detailed mechanisms.

TI  == cell wall-anchored nuclease of streptococcus sanguinis contributes to escape from neutrophil extracellular trap-mediated bacteriocidal activity.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis, a member of the commensal mitis group of streptococci, is a primary colonizer of the tooth surface, and has been implicated in infectious complications including bacteremia and infective endocarditis. during  disease progression, s. sanguinis may utilize various cell surface molecules to evade the host immune system to survive in blood. in the present study, we discovered a novel cell surface nuclease with a cell-wall anchor domain, termed swan (streptococcal wall-anchored nuclease), and investigated its contribution to bacterial resistance against the bacteriocidal activity of neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). recombinant swan protein (rswan) digested multiple forms of dna including net dna and human rna, which required both mg(2+) and ca(2+) for optimum activity. furthermore, dnase activity of s. sanguinis was detected around growing colonies on agar plates containing dna. in-frame deletion of the swan gene mostly reduced that activity. these findings indicated that swan is a major nuclease displayed on the surface, which was further confirmed by immuno-detection of swan in the cell wall fraction. the sensitivity of s. sanguinis to net killing was reduced by swan gene deletion. moreover, heterologous expression of the swan gene rendered a lactococcus lactis strain more resistant to net killing. our results suggest that the swan nuclease on the  bacterial surface contributes to survival in the potential situation of s. sanguinis encountering nets during the course of disease progression.

TI  == s-aryl-l-cysteine sulphoxides and related organosulphur compounds alter oral biofilm development and ai-2-based cell-cell communication.
AB  == aims: to design and synthesize a library of structurally related, small molecules related to homologues of compounds produced by the plant petiveria alliacea and determine their ability to interfere with ai-2 cell-cell communication and biofilm formation by oral bacteria. many human diseases are associated with persistent bacterial biofilms. oral biofilms (dental plaque) are problematic as they are often associated with tooth decay, periodontal disease and systemic disorders such as heart disease and diabetes. methods and results: using a microplate-based approach, a bio-inspired small molecule library was screened for anti-biofilm activity against the oral species streptococcus mutans ua159, streptococcus sanguis 10556 and actinomyces oris mg1. to complement the static screen, a flow-based bioflux microfluidic system screen was also performed under  conditions representative of the human oral cavity. several compounds were found  to display biofilm inhibitory activity in all three of the oral bacteria tested.  these compounds were also shown to inhibit bioluminescence by vibrio harveyi and  were thus inferred to be quorum sensing (qs) inhibitors. conclusion: due to the structural similarity of these compounds to each other, and to key molecules in ai-2 biosynthetic pathways, we propose that these molecules potentially reduce biofilm formation via antagonism of qs or qs-related pathways. significance and impact of the study: this study highlights the potential for a non-antimicrobial-based strategy, focused on ai-2 cell-cell signalling, to control the development of dental plaque. considering that many bacterial species use ai-2 cell-cell signalling, as well as the increased concern of the use of antimicrobials in healthcare products, such an anti-biofilm approach could also be used to control biofilms in environments beyond the human oral cavity.

TI  == bioinformatic investigation of the cost management strategies of five oral microbes.
AB  == some amino acids are more energetically costly to synthesize de novo, therefore many microbes have evolved to regulate the metabolic expenditure of the cell and  reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. several oral bacterial species take up amino acids and peptides obtained from proteolysis of host proteins and hence do not rely only on de novo synthesis. the aim of this study was to investigate if five oral bacterial species implement cost management strategies to reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. since the relative de novo amino acid synthesis costs are proportional to the masses of the amino acids, the energy costs of producing proteins were assessed by calculating the mean amino acid mass for each protein. for porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia and  streptococcus sanguinis, the outer membrane/extracellular proteins are made up of a much larger percentage of lower average mass amino acids whereas cytoplasmic proteins are made up of a larger proportion of higher average mass amino acid residues. these results are consistent with the five oral bacterial species employing energy-saving mechanisms in the production of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. interestingly, the p. gingivalis and s. sanguinis genomes  exhibited significantly lower predicted mean amino acid masses compared with those of the genomes of the other three species, suggesting that this may provide them with an energy advantage with respect to protein biosynthetic cost.

AB  == objectives: the intraoral transmission of cariogenic and periodontopathogenic species seems to be facilitated by contaminated toothbrushes and other oral hygiene devices. the aim of this investigation was to analyze the in vitro retention and survival rate of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis on different toothbrushes. the impacts of human saliva and antimicrobial toothpaste on these parameters were further evaluated. material and methods: part i: four toothbrushes (colgate 360 degrees , curaprox cs5460 ultra soft, elmex interx, trisa flexible head3) were contaminated by s. mutans dsm 20523 or s. sanguinis dsm 20068 suspensions for three minutes. bacteria were removed from the toothbrushes after either three minutes (t0) or 24 hours (t24) of dry storage and grown on columbia blood agar plates for the quantification of colony-forming units (cfus). part ii: the effects of saliva from a caries-active or a caries-inactive person and of toothpaste containing 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate were also tested. results: part i: after three minutes of dry storage, approximately one percent of the bacteria were still detectable on the toothbrushes. after 24 hours, s. sanguinis exhibited a more pronounced decrease in viable cell numbers compared with s. mutans but the differences were not significant (kruskal-wallis test, p>0.05). part ii: the addition of human saliva  from a caries-active or caries-inactive person slightly increased the retention of both streptococcal species at t0. the use of toothpaste had no influence on the amount of viable streptococci at t0, but it reduced the microbial load after  24 hours of storage. there were only slight nonsignificant differences (p>0.05) between the four toothbrushes. conclusions: in vitro bacterial retention and survival of s. sanguinis and s. mutans on different toothbrushes occurred. within the limitations of this study, the use of human saliva or an antimicrobial toothpaste did not lead to significant differences in the microbial load on toothbrushes.

TI  == neuraminidase-producing oral mitis group streptococci potentially contribute to influenza viral infection and reduction in antiviral efficacy of zanamivir.
AB  == influenza is a serious respiratory disease among immunocompromised individuals, such as the elderly, and its prevention is an urgent social issue. influenza viruses rely on neuraminidase (na) activity to release progeny viruses from infected cells and spreading the infection. na is, therefore, an important target of anti-influenza drugs. a causal relationship between bacteria and influenza virus infection has not yet been established, however, a positive correlation between them has been reported. thus, in this study, we examined the biological effects of oral mitis group streptococci, which are predominant constituents of human oral florae, on the release of influenza viruses. among them, streptococcus oralis atcc 10557 and streptococcus mitis atcc 6249 were found to exhibit na activity and their culture supernatants promoted the release of influenza virus and cell-to-cell spread of the infection. in addition, culture supernatants of these na-producing oral bacteria increased viral m1 protein expression levels and cellular erk activation. these effects were not observed with culture supernatants of streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556 which lacks the ability to produce na. although the na inhibitor zanamivir suppressed the release of progeny viruses from the infected cells, the viral release was restored upon the addition of culture supernatants of na-producing s. oralis atcc 10557 or s. mitis atcc 6249. these findings suggest that an increase in the number of na-producing oral  bacteria could elevate the risk of and exacerbate the influenza infection, hampering the efficacy of viral na inhibitor drugs.

TI  == adherence of human oral keratinocytes and gingival fibroblasts to nano-structured titanium surfaces.
AB  == background: a key element for long-term success of dental implants is integration of the implant surface with the surrounding host tissues. modification of titanium implant surfaces can enhance osteoblast activity but their effects on soft-tissue cells are unclear. adherence of human keratinocytes and gingival fibroblasts to control commercially pure titanium (cpti) and two surfaces prepared by anodic oxidation was therefore investigated. since implant abutments  are exposed to a bacteria-rich environment in vivo, the effect of oral bacteria on keratinocyte adhesion was also evaluated. methods: the surfaces were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (sem). the number of adhered cells and binding strength, as well as vitality of fibroblasts and keratinocytes  were evaluated using confocal scanning laser microscopy after staining with live/dead baclight. to evaluate the effect of bacteria on adherence and vitality, keratinocytes were co-cultured with a four-species streptococcal consortium. results: sem analysis showed the two anodically oxidized surfaces to be nano-structured with differing degrees of pore-density. over 24 hours, both fibroblasts and keratinocytes adhered well to the nano-structured surfaces, although to a somewhat lesser degree than to cpti (range 42-89% of the levels on  cpti). the strength of keratinocyte adhesion was greater than that of the fibroblasts but no differences in adhesion strength could be observed between the two nano-structured surfaces and the cpti. the consortium of commensal streptococci markedly reduced keratinocyte adherence on all the surfaces as well  as compromising membrane integrity of the adhered cells. conclusion: both the vitality and level of adherence of soft-tissue cells to the nano-structured surfaces was similar to that on cpti. co-culture with streptococci reduced the number of keratinocytes on all the surfaces to approximately the same level and caused cell damage, suggesting that commensal bacteria could affect adherence of  soft-tissue cells to abutment surfaces in vivo.

TI  == antagonistic effect of protein extracts from on pathogenic bacteria and fungi of  the oral cavity.
AB  == an antibacterial substance from streptococcus sanguinis (s. sanguinis) is known to have an inhibitory effect on putative periodontal pathogens, but its inhibitory effect on pathogens of oral candidiasis is unknown. in this study, intracellular and exocrine proteins were extracted from s. sanguinis. the antagonistic effect of the protein extracts on prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) was detected by a well-plate technique, and the effects of the protein extracts on biofilms formed  by these bacteria were evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. the antagonistic effect of the protein extracts on pathogenic fungi was investigated  using candida albicans (c. albicans) and candida tropicalis (c. tropicalis). the  growth curves of c. albicans and c. tropicalis were determined from ultraviolet absorption measurements, their morphological changes following treatment were observed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, and the effects  of the protein extracts on the thickness of their biofilms and the distribution of dead/live bacteria within the biofilms were detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy. the results showed significant inhibitory effects of the intracellular proteins extracted from s. sanguinis on pathogenic bacteria (p. intermedia and p. gingivalis), fungi (c. albicans and c. tropicalis) and the biofilms formed by them. furthermore, the growth curves and morphology of c. albicans and c. tropicalis were altered following treatment with the intracellular proteins, resulting in disc-like depressions in the surfaces of the fungal spores and mycelia. by contrast, the exocrine proteins demonstrated no significant inhibitory effect on the pathogenic bacteria, fungi and the biofilms  formed by them. thus, it may be concluded that intracellular proteins of s. sanguinis have antibacterial activity and exert an antagonistic effect on certain pathogenic bacteria and fungi of the oral cavity.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial properties of silver-doped titanium surfaces prepared with a novel electrochemical anodizing process. material and methods: titanium samples were anodized with a pulsed process in a solution of silver nitrate and sodium thiosulphate at room temperature with stirring. samples were processed with different electrolyte concentrations and treatment cycles to improve silver deposition. physicochemical properties were determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, white-light interferometry, and scanning electron microscopy. cellular cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts was studied with lactate dehydrogenase assays. the in vitro effect of treated surfaces on two oral bacteria strains (streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius) was studied with viable bacterial adhesion measurements and growth curve assays. nonparametric statistical kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney u-tests were used for multiple and paired comparisons, respectively. post hoc spearman's correlation tests were calculated to check the dependence between bacteria adhesion and surface properties. results: x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed the presence of silver on treated samples and showed that treatments with higher silver nitrate concentration and more cycles increased the silver deposition on titanium surface. no negative effects in fibroblast cell viability were detected  and a significant reduction on bacterial adhesion in vitro was achieved in silver-treated samples compared with control titanium. conclusions: silver deposition on titanium with a novel electrochemical anodizing process produced surfaces with significant antibacterial properties in vitro without negative effects on cell viability.

TI  == crystalline anatase-rich titanium can reduce adherence of oral streptococci.
AB  == dental implant abutments that emerge through the mucosa are rapidly covered with  a salivary protein pellicle to which bacteria bind, initiating biofilm formation. in this study, adherence of early colonizing streptococci, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguinis to two saliva-coated anodically oxidized surfaces was compared with that on commercially pure titanium (cpti). near edge x-ray absorption (nexafs) showed crystalline anatase was more pronounced on the anodically oxidized surfaces than  on the cpti. as revealed by fluorescence microscopy, a four-species mixture, as well as individual bacterial species, exhibited lower adherence after 2 h to the  saliva-coated, anatase-rich surfaces than to cpti. since wettability did not differ between the saliva-coated surfaces, differences in the concentration and/or configuration of salivary proteins on the anatase-rich surfaces may explain the reduced bacterial binding effect. anatase-rich surfaces could thus contribute to reduced overall biofilm formation on dental implant abutments through diminished adherence of early colonizers.

AB  == oral veillonella, veillonella atypica, veillonella denticariosi, veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula, veillonella rogosae, and veillonella tobetsuensis are known as early colonizers in oral biofilm formation. to investigate the role  of oral veillonella, biofilms formed by the co-culture of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or streptococcus sanguinis, with  oral veillonella were examined at the species level. the amount of biofilm formed by s. mutans, s. gordonii, and s. salivarius in the presence of the six veillonella species was greater than that formed in the control experiments, with the exception of s. mutans with v. dispar. in contrast, in the case of biofilm formation by s. sanguinis, the presence of veillonella species reduced the amount of the biofilm, with the exception of v. parvula and v. dispar. the time-dependent changes in the amount of biofilm and the number of planktonic cells were grouped into four patterns over the 24 combinations. only that of s. gordonii with v. tobetsuensis showed a unique pattern. these results indicate that the mode of action of this combination differed from that of the other combinations with respect to biofilm formation. it is possible that there may be  several factors involved in the interaction between streptococcus and veillonella species.

TI  == effective release of a broad spectrum antibiotic from elastin-like polypeptide-collagen composite.
AB  == preparation of hydrogels that possess an effective antibiotic release profile and better mechanical properties compared to the traditionally used collagen hydrogels has the potential to minimize post-surgical infections and support wound healing. toward this goal, we prepared elastin-like polypeptide (elp)-collagen composite hydrogels that displayed a significantly higher elastic  modulus compared to the collagen hydrogels. we then characterized the release behavior of the collagen and elp-collagen hydrogels loaded with varying dosages (1-5% w/w) of a commonly used broad spectrum antibiotic, doxycycline hyclate. both collagen and elp-collagen hydrogels showed a gradual time dependent doxycycline release over a period of 5 days. the elp-collagen hydrogels, in general, showed a slower release of the doxycycline compared to the collagen hydrogels. the released doxycycline was found to be effective against four bacterial strains (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguinis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) in a dose dependent manner. combined with their improved mechanical properties, the gradual and effective drug release from the biocompatible elp-collagen hydrogels shown here may be beneficial for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications.

AB  == infective endocarditis is caused by oral commensal bacteria which are important etiologic agents in this disease and can induce release of nitric oxide (no), promoting an inflammatory response in the endocardium. in this study, we investigated the properties of kaempherol, epigallocatechin, apigenin, and naringin in embryonic mouse heart cells (h9c2) treated with lipoteichoic acid (lta) obtained from streptococcus sanguinis. no production was measured with the  griess method. expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) was detected  by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). in addition, western blot assays and immunofluorescence staining were used to assess translocation of  nuclear factor kappa beta (nf-kappab), degradation of ikappab, and activity of the mitogen activated protein (map) kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk 1/2), p38, and c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk). and the effects of these flavonoids on cell viability were also assessed. our results showed that flavonoids blocked activation of erk, jnk, and p38 in cardiomyocytes treated with lta. moreover, the flavonoids showed no cytotoxic effects and blocked nf-kappab translocation and ikappab degradation and inhibited lta-induced nf-kappab promoter activity, inos expression and no production. in conclusion these effects are consistent with some of the observed anti-inflammatory properties of other flavonoids.

TI  == streptococcus sanguinis-induced cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase-1 release from platelets.
AB  == background: streptococcus sanguinis (s.sanguinis), a predominant bacterium in the human oral cavity, has been widely associated with the development of infective endocarditis. platelets play both a haemostatic function and can influence both innate and adaptive immune responses. previous studies have shown that s.sanguinis can interact with, and activate, platelets. results: the aim of this  study was to determine whether s.sanguinis stimulates the release of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) 1, 2 and 9 and the pro-inflammatory mediators sdf-1, vegf and scd40l, from platelets and to subsequently pharmacologically address the release mechanism (s). s.sanguinis stimulated the release of mmp-1, sdf-1, vegf and scd40l from platelets and inhibitors of cyclooxygenase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and antagonists of the alphaiibbeta3 integrin and  glycoprotein ib, each inhibited the secretion of all factors. conclusions: therefore the release of mmp-1, sdf-1, vegf and scd40l occurs late in the platelet response to s.sanguinis and highlights the complex intracellular signalling pathways stimulated in response to s.sanguinis which lead to haemostasis, mmp and pro-inflammatory mediator secretion.

TI  == bacterial contamination along implant-abutment interface in external and internal-hex dental implants.
AB  == the aim of this research was to evaluate bacterial contamination along the implant-abutment interface in relation to the size of the interface. 80 brand name implants were used, 40 internal-hex and 40 external-hex. the implants were handled in a sterile atmosphere inside a box, where they were inoculated with 0.3 mul of the streptococcus sanguis atcc10556 bacterium in the interior and the abutment was immediately installed with a torque of 30 ncm for the external-hex and 20 ncm for the internal-hex; the system was included in an eppendorf control  for 30 seconds and then placed in an eppendorf control for 30 days. the implants  were removed and assessed under a scanning electron microscope while the eppendorf controls were bred in blood agar to analyze the colonies formed. the data were analyzed using the chi-squared, kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney tests,  considering a value of p<0.05 to obtain statistical significance. five implants were excluded due to probable external contamination. microspaces of up to 86.8 mum were observed in the external-hex implants and up to 53.9 mum in the internal-hex implants with no significant differences between the different systems being observed (p>0.05). the contamination observed was produced mainly in the external-hex implants and statistically significant differences were observed between the different hex systems from the same company. no significant  differences were observed between interface size and bacterial contamination. within our limitations, there was no relation between the size of the implant-abutment interface and bacterial contamination with streptococcus sanguis atcc10556.

TI  == the relationship of the lipoprotein ssab, manganese and superoxide dismutase in streptococcus sanguinis virulence for endocarditis.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis colonizes teeth and is an important cause of infective endocarditis. our prior work showed that the lipoprotein ssab is critical for s.  sanguinis virulence for endocarditis and belongs to the lrai family of conserved  metal transporters. in this study, we demonstrated that an ssab mutant accumulates less manganese and iron than its parent. a mutant lacking the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, soda, was significantly less virulent than wild-type in a rabbit model of endocarditis, but significantly more virulent than the ssab mutant. neither the ssab nor the soda mutation affected sensitivity to phagocytic killing or efficiency of heart valve colonization. animal virulence results for all strains could be reproduced by growing bacteria in serum under physiological levels of o(2). soda activity was reduced, but not eliminated in the ssab mutant in serum and in rabbits. growth of the ssab mutant in serum was restored upon addition of mn(2+) or removal of o(2). antioxidant supplementation  experiments suggested that superoxide and hydroxyl radicals were together responsible for the ssab mutant's growth defect. we conclude that manganese accumulation mediated by the ssab transport system imparts virulence by enabling  cell growth in oxygen through soda-dependent and independent mechanisms.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == covalent immobilization of hlf1-11 peptide on a titanium surface reduces bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation.
AB  == bacterial infection represents a major cause of implant failure in dentistry. a common approach to overcoming this issue and treating peri-implant infection consists in the use of antibiotics. however, the rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria poses serious concerns to this strategy. a promising alternative is the  use of antimicrobial peptides due to their broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and reduced bacterial resistance responses. the aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro antibacterial activity of the human lactoferrin-derived peptide hlf1-11 anchored to titanium surfaces. to this end, titanium samples were functionalized with the hlf1-11 peptide either by silanization methods or physical adsorption. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed the successful covalent attachment of the hlf1-11 peptide onto titanium surfaces. lactate dehydrogenase assay determined that hlf1-11 peptide did not affect fibroblast viability. an outstanding reduction in the adhesion and early stages of biofilm formation of streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius was observed on the biofunctionalized surfaces compared to control non-treated samples. furthermore, samples coated with the hlf1-11 peptide inhibited the early stages of bacterial growth. thus, this strategy holds great potential to develop antimicrobial biomaterials for dental applications.

TI  == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI  == amplification of bacteria-induced platelet activation is triggered by fcgammariia, integrin alphaiibbeta3, and platelet factor 4.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to platelets is mediated via a range of strain-specific bacterial surface proteins that bind to a variety of platelet receptors. it is unclear how these interactions lead to platelet activation. we demonstrate a critical role for the immune receptor fcgammariia, alphaiibbeta3, and src and syk tyrosine kinases in platelet activation by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. fcgammariia activation is dependent on immunoglobulin g (igg) and alphaiibbeta3 engagement. moreover, feedback agonists adenosine 5'-diphosphate and thromboxane a2 are mandatory for platelet aggregation. additionally, platelet factor 4 (pf4) binds to bacteria and reduces the lag time for aggregation, and gray platelet syndrome alpha-granule-deficient platelets do not aggregate to 4 of 5 bacterial strains. we propose that fcgammariia-mediated activation is a common  response mechanism used against a wide range of bacteria, and that release of secondary mediators and pf4 serve as a positive feedback mechanism for activation through an igg-dependent pathway.

TI  == the influence of a glucosyltransferase, encoded by gtfp, on biofilm formation by  streptococcus sanguinis in a dual-species model.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is an early colonizer of tooth surfaces and forms biofilms with other species of microorganisms. in vitro, s. sanguinis produces water-soluble glucans from sucrose and releases them into the culture supernatant; however, the role played by these glucans in biofilm formation is unclear. the present study examined both the effect of glucans on biofilm formation by s. sanguinis and the proportion of this bacterial species within the biofilms. inactivation of the gtfp gene, annotated as glucosyltransferase in the  s. sanguinis genome database, caused a marked reduction in the amount of water-soluble glucans in the culture supernatant, but not in the amount of water-insoluble glucans expressed on the bacterial cell surface. scanning electron microscopy revealed that wild-type s. sanguinis, but not the gtfp-deficient mutant, produced large amounts of sticky material in the presence  of 1% (w/v) sucrose. in addition, biofilm production by wild-type bacteria was greater than that by the mutant strain. by contrast, co-culture of mutant bacteria with streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. anginosus, or s. salivarius showed that inactivating the gtfp gene had little effect on the amount of biofilm produced. furthermore, inactivating the gtfp gene did not greatly alter the proportion of s. sanguinis in the biofilms formed by the co-cultures. thus, despite the role of s. sanguinis glucosyltransferase in formation of water-soluble glucans and biofilms in monoculture, the functional gene contributed little to biofilms in co-culture experiments.

TI  == antibacterial effect of iranian green-tea-containing mouthrinse vs chlorhexidine  0.2%: an in vitro study.
AB  == purpose: considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of green tea, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of mouthrinses containing green tea extract vs 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected microorganisms in vitro. materials and methods: the antibacterial activity of both mouthrinses and the pure green tea extract was assessed by using disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) methods against five microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aerogenosa and escherichia coli. growth inhibition zones were measured in mm after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. the two mouthrinses were assessed at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mg/ml to determine the mic, which was interpreted as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. results: 0.2% chlorhexidine produced a larger zone of growth inhibition than did the mouthrinse made of green tea extract (p < 0.01). paradoxically, the growth inhibition zones  of the tested bacteria were significantly larger in pure extract of green tea than in 0.2% chlorhexidine (p < 0.01). the chlorhexidine mouthrinse inhibited the growth of all tested species and exhibited significantly lower mics than did the  green tea mouthrinse (p < 0.01). conclusions: even though the mouthrinse made with green tea extract presented an in vitro antimicrobial activity inferior to 0.2% chlorhexidine, the pure extract had considerable bactericidal effect.

TI  == intensity and duration of in-vitro antibacterial activity of different adhesives  used in orthodontics.
AB  == this work investigated the antibacterial activity of 14 bonding agents to predict their ability to inhibit white-spot development during orthodontic treatment. standardized, sterilized disks of each material were continuously rinsed (for up  to 180 d) in a flow of sterile saline. at predetermined time points, the residual ability of each material to inhibit bacterial growth (determined by measuring the size of inhibition halos around disks placed onto appropriate culture media seeded with streptococcus gordonii dsm6777, streptococcus sanguinis dsm20567, streptococcus mutans dsm20523, or lactobacillus acidophilus dsm20079) and biofilm formation (determined by measuring the numbers of bacteria adherent to disks following incubation in appropriate broths) was tested in triplicate and compared with the baseline activities of freshly prepared materials. overall antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities, adjusted for exposure time and strain of bacteria, were assessed. the decrease of antibacterial activity was faster (30-60 d) and complete for fluoride-enriched materials, but slower (90 d) and partial for antimicrobial-containing materials (benzalkonium chloride, zinc oxide, chlorexidine, or mdpb). materials enriched with benzalkonium chloride, chlorexidine, or mdpb showed the highest antibacterial activities. anti-biofilm assays yielded similar results. these data could be helpful for clinicians in the choice of the best performing bonding agent also in light of duration of the clinical application.

TI  == adherence of streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mutans to saliva-coated s-prg resin blocks.
AB  == this in vitro study performed elemental analysis of the ions absorbed into the salivary coat covering the surfaces of s-prg resin blocks and assessed the adherence of streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mutans to these saliva-coated s-prg resin blocks. elemental analysis of ions absorbed into the salivary coat of resin blocks exposed to the saliva was performed using an inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer and the fluoride electrode  method. quantitative adherence of radio-labeled test bacteria to the resin blocks was determined. as the results, the saliva-coated s-prg resin showed significantly greater amounts of absorbed b, al, si, sr, and f than the saliva-coated unfilled resin. it was of particular significance that the salivary coating of the s-prg resin reduced the adherence of s. mutans to this resin. however, in the case of s. sanguinis, no significant difference in adherence could be recognized between saliva-coated s-prg resin and saliva-coated unfilled  resin.

TI  == myricetin blocks lipoteichoic acid-induced cox-2 expression in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == periodontitis is an infectious disease caused by microorganisms present in dental bacterial plaque. lipoteichoic acid (lta) is a component of the external membrane of gram-positive bacteria. it causes septic shock. ingested flavonoids have been  reported to directly affect the regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) expression induced by bacterial toxins. in this study, we examined the effects of four flavonoids (luteolin, fisetin, morin and myricetin) on the activation of erk1/2,  p38 and akt, and on the synthesis of cox-2 in human gingival fibroblasts treated  with lta from streptococcus sanguinis. we found that luteolin and myricetin blocked akt and p38 activation and that myricetin blocked lta-induced cox-2 expression. the results of our study are important for elucidating the mechanism  of action of flavonoid regulation of inflammatory responses.

AB  == objectives: to determine the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical cleaning on the removal of microorganisms from essix orthodontic retainers. design: in vitro  laboratory study. setting: department of orthodontics and microbiology, eastman dental institute, university college london, uk. methods: study 1: 120 essix retainers were divided into four cleaning groups. the effectiveness of each cleaning method to remove a single species biofilm of streptococcus mutans from the retainer was assessed. study 2: 140 essix retainers were divided into four study groups (brushing with fluoride toothpaste, chlorhexidine gel, immersion in  chlorhexidine solution only and a control) to investigate the chemical and mechanical cleaning of the multispecies biolfilm of (streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans). relevant results: in study 1, brushing with toothpaste resulted in 99% reduction of streptococcus mutans. in study 2, all three cleaning methods recorded similarly statistically significant reductions in colony forming units per millilitre compared to the control. there were no statistically significant differences between any of the cleaning groups for any of the microorganisms except mrsa-16. for mrsa-16, chlorhexidine mouthwash and gel were significantly more potent in eliminating the microorganism than the fluoride toothpaste. conclusions: all three cleaning methods effectively removed 99% of microorganisms from the essix retainers. brushing with fluoride toothpaste can therefore be confirmed as an effective method for cleaning retainers in most circumstances. the use of chlorhexidine gel or mouthwash is recommended in patients where bacterial infection has to be avoided due to immunosuppression or other reasons.

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide contributes to the epithelial cell death induced by the oral mitis group of streptococci.
AB  == members of the mitis group of streptococci are normal inhabitants of the commensal flora of the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract of humans. some mitis group species, such as streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguinis, are primary colonizers of the human oral cavity. recently, we found that hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) produced by s. oralis is cytotoxic to human macrophages, suggesting that streptococcus-derived h2o2 may act as a cytotoxin. since epithelial cells provide a physical barrier against pathogenic microbes, we investigated their susceptibility to infection by h2o2-producing streptococci in  this study. infection by s. oralis and s. sanguinis was found to stimulate cell death of detroit 562, calu-3 and hela epithelial cell lines at a multiplicity of  infection greater than 100. catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decomposition  of h2o2, inhibited s. oralis cytotoxicity, and h2o2 alone was capable of eliciting epithelial cell death. moreover, s. oralis mutants lacking the spxb gene encoding pyruvate oxidase, which are deficient in h2o2 production, exhibited reduced cytotoxicity toward detroit 562 epithelial cells. in addition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that both s. oralis and h2o2 induced  interleukin-6 production in detroit 562 epithelial cells. these results suggest that streptococcal h2o2 is cytotoxic to epithelial cells, and promotes bacterial  evasion of the host defense systems in the oral cavity and upper respiratory tracts.

TI  == antibacterial activity of selected glass ionomer cements.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the paper was to determine the antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements against bacteria of the genera streptococcus and lactobacillus. material and methods: four capsulated glass ionomer cements were applied in the study: fuji triage (gc), fuji ix (gc), ketac molar (3m espe) and ketac silver (3m espe). four standard bacterial strains were used to assess the antibacterial activity of the studied cements: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis,  s. salivarius and lactobacillus casei. the antibacterial activity was determined  by the agar diffusion method. the bacterial suspension was spread with a cotton swab on tsa plates. for each material six wells (7 mm diameter, 5 mm deep) were made with a cork borer. each well was then filled with freshly prepared cements.  the results were obtained by measuring the bacterial growth inhibition zone after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days. results: fuji triage cement inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains. fuji ix cement demonstrated the most potent antibacterial activity against s. sanguis. ketac molar showed antibacterial activity against s. sanguis and s. salivarius, whereas ketac silver was efficient against s. mutans as well. neither of the ketac cements inhibited growth of the standard l. casei strain. discussion: antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements has attracted the interest of scientists in recent years. most authors, including us, carried out experiments using the agar diffusion method and demonstrated antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements. different antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements, observed in our study and studies of other authors, depended on  the evaluated cement, bacterial strain and period of evaluation.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == genetic basis of coaggregation receptor polysaccharide biosynthesis in streptococcus sanguinis and related species.
AB  == interbacterial adhesion between streptococci and actinomyces promotes early dental plaque biofilm development. recognition of coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (rps) on strains of streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis by actinomyces spp. type 2 fimbriae is the principal mechanism of these interactions. previous studies of genetic loci for synthesis of rps (rps) and rps precursors (rml, gale1 and gale2) in s. gordonii 38 and s. oralis 34 revealed differences between these strains. to determine whether these differences are strain-specific or species-specific, we identified  and compared loci for polysaccharide biosynthesis in additional strains of these  species and in several strains of the previously unstudied species, s. sanguinis. genes for synthesis of rps precursors distinguished the rps loci of different streptococci. hence, rml genes for synthesis of tdp-l-rha were in rps loci of s.  oralis strains but at other loci in s. gordonii and s. sanguinis. genes for two distinct galactose epimerases were also distributed differently. hence, gale1 for epimerization of udp-glc and udp-gal was in galactose operons of s. gordonii and  s. sanguinis strains but surprisingly, this gene was not present in s. oralis. moreover, gale2 for epimerization of both udp-glc and udp-gal and udp-glcnac and  udp-galnac was at a different locus in each species, including rps operons of s.  sanguinis. the findings provide insight into cell surface properties that distinguish different rps-producing streptococci and open an approach for identifying these bacteria based on the arrangement of genes for synthesis of polysaccharide precursors.

TI  == cariogenicity of streptococcus mutans glucan-binding protein deletion mutants.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a principal etiologic agent in the development of dental  caries due to its exceptional aciduric and acidogenic properties, and its ability to adhere and accumulate in large numbers on tooth surfaces in the presence of sucrose. sucrose-dependent adherence is mediated by glucans, polymers of glucose  synthesized from sucrose by glucosyltransferase (gtf) enzymes. s. mutans makes several proteins that have the property of binding glucans. we hypothesized that  three of these glucan-binding proteins (gbps), gbps a, c and d, contribute to the cariogenicity of s. mutans. a specific pathogen-free rat model was used to compare the cariogenicity of s. mutans ua130 and a panel of mutants with individual or multiple gbp gene deletions. the mutants were also evaluated in vitro for properties related to cariogenicity, such as acidogenicity, aciduricity, and adhesion to glucan. only a subset of gbp mutants were attenuated for cariogenicity, with the combined loss of gbps a and c most affecting smooth surface caries. the attenuation of gbp mutant strains was unlikely due to differences in acid-related properties since the mutants were at least as acidogenic and acid-tolerant as the parental strain. additionally, loss of gbps did not reduce adhesion to a pre-formed biofilm of s. sanguinis. analyses of the  caries data with in vitro biofilm properties previously determined for the mutant panel found correlations between cariogenicity and biofilm depth and substratum coverage. it is concluded that gbps contribute to the cariogenicity of s. mutans  through a mechanism that may involve alteration of biofilm architecture.

TI  == streptococcus sanguinis class ib ribonucleotide reductase: high activity with both iron and manganese cofactors and structural insights.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is a causative agent of infective endocarditis. deletion  of ssab, a manganese transporter, drastically reduces s. sanguinis virulence. many pathogenic organisms require class ib ribonucleotide reductase (rnr) to catalyze the conversion of nucleotides to deoxynucleotides under aerobic conditions, and recent studies demonstrate that this enzyme uses a dimanganese-tyrosyl radical (mn(iii)2-y(*)) cofactor in vivo. the proteins required for s. sanguinis ribonucleotide reduction (nrde and nrdf, alpha and beta subunits of rnr; nrdh and trxr, a glutaredoxin-like thioredoxin and a thioredoxin reductase; and nrdi, a flavodoxin essential for assembly of the rnr metallo-cofactor) have been identified and characterized. apo-nrdf with fe(ii) and o2 can self-assemble a diferric-tyrosyl radical (fe(iii)2-y(*)) cofactor (1.2 y(*)/beta2) and with the help of nrdi can assemble a mn(iii)2-y(*) cofactor (0.9  y(*)/beta2). the activity of rnr with its endogenous reductants, nrdh and trxr, is 5,000 and 1,500 units/mg for the mn- and fe-nrdfs (fe-loaded nrdf), respectively. x-ray structures of s. sanguinis nrdiox and mn(ii)2-nrdf are reported and provide a possible rationale for the weak affinity (2.9 mum) between them. these streptococcal proteins form a structurally distinct subclass relative to other ib proteins with unique features likely important in cluster assembly, including a long and negatively charged loop near the nrdi flavin and a bulky residue (thr) at a constriction in the oxidant channel to the nrdi interface. these studies set the stage for identifying the active form of s. sanguinis class ib rnr in an animal model for infective endocarditis and establishing whether the manganese requirement for pathogenesis is associated with rnr.

TI  == genetic characterization and role in virulence of the ribonucleotide reductases of streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is a cause of infective endocarditis and has been shown to require a manganese transporter called ssab for virulence and o2 tolerance. like certain other pathogens, s. sanguinis possesses aerobic class ib (nrdef) and anaerobic class iii (nrddg) ribonucleotide reductases (rnrs) that perform the essential function of reducing ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. the accompanying paper (makhlynets, o., boal, a. k., rhodes, d. v., kitten, t., rosenzweig, a. c., and stubbe, j. (2014) j. biol. chem. 289, 6259-6272) indicates that in the presence of o2, the s. sanguinis class ib rnr self-assembles an essential diferric-tyrosyl radical (fe(iii)2-y(*)) in vitro, whereas assembly of  a dimanganese-tyrosyl radical (mn(iii)2-y(*)) cofactor requires nrdi, and mn(iii)2-y(*) is more active than fe(iii)2-y(*) with the endogenous reducing system of nrdh and thioredoxin reductase (trxr1). in this study, we have shown that deletion of either nrdhekf or nrdi completely abolishes virulence in an animal model of endocarditis, whereas nrdd mutation has no effect. the nrdhekf, nrdi, and trxr1 mutants fail to grow aerobically, whereas anaerobic growth requires nrdd. the nrdj gene encoding an o2-independent adenosylcobalamin-cofactored rnr was introduced into the nrdhekf, nrdi, and trxr1 mutants. growth of the nrdhekf and nrdi mutants in the presence of o2 was partially restored. the combined results suggest that mn(iii)2-y(*)-cofactored nrdf is required for growth under aerobic conditions and in animals. this could explain in part why manganese is necessary for virulence and o2 tolerance in many bacterial pathogens possessing a class ib rnr and suggests nrdf and nrdi may serve as promising new antimicrobial targets.

TI  == characterization of a novel cold-active esterase isolated from swamp sediment metagenome.
AB  == a functional screen of a metagenomic library from "upo" swamp sediment in korea identified a gene estl28, the product of which displayed lipolytic properties on  a tributyrin-supplemented medium. the estl28 sequence encodes a 290 amino acid protein (designated as estl28), with a predicted molecular weight of 31.3 kda. the encoded estl28 protein exhibited the highest sequence similarity (45 %) to a  hydrolase found in streptococcus sanguinis. phylogenetic analysis indicated that  estl28 belongs to a currently uncharacterized family of esterases. within the conserved alpha/beta-hydrolase 6 domain, the estl28 retains the catalytic triad ser(1)(0)(3)-asp(2)(4)(8)-his(2)(6)(8) that is typical of esterases. the ser103 residue in the catalytic triad is located in the consensus pentapeptide motif gxsxg. the purified estl28 enzyme worked optimally at 35 degrees c and ph 8.5 and remained stable at temperatures lower than 20 degrees c. the catalytic activity of estl28 was maximal with p-nitrophenyl butyrate, indicating that it was an esterase. this enzyme also exhibited stable activity in the presence of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide. therefore, the level of stability in organic solvents and cold temperature suggests that estl28 has potential for many biotechnological applications.

TI  == phylogenetic relationship and virulence inference of streptococcus anginosus group: curated annotation and whole-genome comparative analysis support distinct  species designation.
AB  == background: the streptococcus anginosus group (sag) represents three closely related species of the viridans group streptococci recognized as commensal bacteria of the oral, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. the sag also cause  severe invasive infections, and are pathogens during cystic fibrosis (cf) pulmonary exacerbation. little genomic information or description of virulence mechanisms is currently available for sag. we conducted intra and inter species whole-genome comparative analyses with 59 publically available streptococcus genomes and seven in-house closed high quality finished sag genomes; s. constellatus (3), s. intermedius (2), and s. anginosus (2). for each sag species, we sequenced at least one numerically dominant strain from cf airways recovered during acute exacerbation and an invasive, non-lung isolate. we also evaluated microevolution that occurred within two isolates that were cultured from one individual one year apart. results: the sag genomes were most closely related to  s. gordonii and s. sanguinis, based on shared orthologs and harbor a similar number of proteins within each cog category as other streptococcus species. numerous characterized streptococcus virulence factor homologs were identified within the sag genomes including; adherence, invasion, spreading factors, lpxtg cell wall proteins, and two component histidine kinases known to be involved in virulence gene regulation. mobile elements, primarily integrative conjugative elements and bacteriophage, account for greater than 10% of the sag genomes. s. anginosus was the most variable species sequenced in this study, yielding both the smallest and the largest sag genomes containing multiple genomic rearrangements, insertions and deletions. in contrast, within the s. constellatus and s. intermedius species, there was extensive continuous synteny, with only slight differences in genome size between strains. within s. constellatus we were able to determine important snps and changes in vntr numbers that occurred over the course of one year. conclusions: the comparative genomic analysis of the sag  clarifies the phylogenetics of these bacteria and supports the distinct species classification. numerous potential virulence determinants were identified and provide a foundation for further studies into sag pathogenesis. furthermore, the  data may be used to enable the development of rapid diagnostic assays and therapeutics for these pathogens.

AB  == the application of bayes theorem in medical diagnostic includes such important step as derivation for every symptom and diagnosis data values of finite or a posteriori probability of presence of germ, for instance s. sanguis, in patients  receiving orthodontic treatment. this value expresses importance of the given symptoms for detection of germ presence. in the implemented studies the bayes theorem was applied to evaluate probability of presence of particular germ in particular concentration (degree of semination, co) under concrete symptom group. the rates were used to calculate probability of presence of cariesgenic streptococcus s. mutans and s. sanguis in prospect patient. the rates were calculated for the group with fixed orthodontic apparatuses. the high degree of risk of development of caries in children under orthodontic treatment is conditioned by a whole complex of existing unfavorable factors present in oral cavity. hence, a powerful negative potential to develop expressed cariesgenic situation in oral cavity is present. the analysis of medical data of patients with distal occlusion was applied using bayes theorem from the point of view their diagnostic value. the study established 36 symptoms, factors, risk factors  and background diseases common in case of distal occlusion in children. the probability to detect the mentioned characteristics and likelihood ratio under different degree of concentration of cariesgenic streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis in dental plaque of children was considered. the establishment of character of likelihood ratio for different qualitative content  of streptococcus in case of isolation from biotope of dental plaque permitted to  determine the informative characteristics. the bayesian model can be applied in clinics as a computer program to process incoming information about patients with distal occlusion under active orthodontic treatment. the developed diagnostic algorithm in a fast and simple mode of clinical detection of caries and determination of concentration of cariesgenic streptococcus.

TI  == systematic study of genes influencing cellular chain length in streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is a gram-positive bacterium that is indigenous to the oral cavity. s. sanguinis, a primary colonizer of the oral cavity, serves as a tether for the attachment of other oral pathogens. the colonization of microbes on the tooth surface forms dental plaque, which can lead to the onset of periodontal disease. we examined a comprehensive mutant library to identify genes related to cellular chain length and morphology using phase-contrast microscopy.  a number of hypothetical genes related to the cellular chain length were identified in this study. genes related to the cellular chain length were analysed along with clusters of orthologous groups (cog) for gene functions. it was discovered that the highest proportion of cog functions related to cellular chain length was 'cell division and chromosome separation'. however, different cog functions were also found to be related with altered cellular chain length. this suggested that different genes related with multiple mechanisms contribute to the cellular chain length in s. sanguinis sk36.

TI  == smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

TI  == [pathophysiology of behcet's disease].
AB  == although the precise pathogenesis and etiology of behcet's disease (bd) still remains unknown, current evidence suggests that inflammatory reaction in bd arises from disruption of homeostasis in genetically susceptible individuals, resulting in altered innate and adaptive immunity responses, pathogenic t cell activation in the peripheral blood, and in inflammatory sites. association with hla-b51 is known as the strongest genetic susceptibility factor for bd. recent gwas (genome-wide association studies) have confirmed this relationship, and reported new susceptibility genes (il-10, il-23r, il-12rb2) for the disease. a triggering infectious agent could operate through molecular mimicry, and the disease could subsequently be perpetuated by an abnormal immune response to an auto-antigen in the absence of ongoing infection. several potential bacteria have been investigated but the most commonly implicated microorganism is streptococcus sanguis. recent data have showed that the t cell homeostasis perturbation consisted mainly of th1 and th17 expansions, while regulatory t cell response was suppressed. cytokine such as il-17, il-23 and il-21 play a significant role in the pathogenesis of bd. inflammatory cells within bd inflammatory lesions include mostly neutrophils, cd4(+) t cells, and cytotoxic cells. lastly, endothelium dysfunction has been clearly established. this improved understanding of the pathophysiology of bd will certainly lead to the development of new therapeutic agents, potentially more effective than current therapy. in this review, we have  studied the etiopathogenesis of bd in the light of recent advances.

TI  == adhesion forces and composition of planktonic and adhering oral microbiomes.
AB  == the oral microbiome consists of a planktonic microbiome residing in saliva and an adhering microbiome (the biofilm adhering to oral hard and soft tissues). here we hypothesized that possible differences in microbial composition of the planktonic and adhering oral microbiome on teeth can be related to the forces by which different bacterial species are attracted to the tooth surface. the relative presence of 7 oral bacterial species in saliva and biofilm collected from 10 healthy human volunteers was determined twice in each volunteer by denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis. analysis of both microbiomes showed complete separation of the planktonic from the adhering oral microbiome. next, adhesion forces of corresponding bacterial strains with saliva-coated enamel surfaces were measured by atomic force microscopy. species that were found predominantly in the adhering microbiome had significantly higher adhesion forces to saliva-coated enamel (-0.60 to -1.05 nn) than did species mostly present in the planktonic microbiome (-0.40 to -0.55 nn). it is concluded that differences in composition of the planktonic and the adhering oral microbiome are due to small differences in the forces by which strains adhere to saliva-coated enamel,  providing an important step in understanding site- and material-specific differences in the composition of biofilms in the oral cavity.

AB  == both streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis are normal bacterial inhabitants of dental plaque. streptococcus mutans is the major agent causing dental caries. it has been well documented that nicotine affects the growth of s. mutans. this study investigated the effect of nicotine on mono- and dual-species  growth of s. mutans and s. sanguinis. the results indicate that nicotine has no significant effect on s. sanguinis grown in either mono- or dual-species biofilms. however, nicotine significantly increased (p < 0.05) the growth of s. mutans in dual-species biofilm formation. in addition, the cfu level of s. sanguinis was higher than s. mutans without nicotine in the culture. with the addition of nicotine, the level of s. mutans biofilm was significantly enhanced as the nicotine concentration increased over the level of s. sanguinis in dual-species biofilm, and we also got the same result from the fluorescence in situ hybridization detecting the two bacteria grown in biofilm formation. the exopolysaccharide (eps) of s. mutans has also been increased by the increasing nicotine concentration, while the eps of s. sanguinis was decreased or inhibited  by the affected nicotine. the data further confirm that nicotine is able to enhance the growth of s. mutans.

TI  == a tissue-dependent hypothesis of dental caries.
AB  == current understanding of dental caries considers this disease a demineralization  of the tooth tissues due to the acid produced by sugar-fermenting microorganisms. thus, caries is considered a diet- and ph-dependent process. we present here the  first metagenomic analysis of the bacterial communities present at different stages of caries development, with the aim of determining whether the bacterial composition and biochemical profile are specific to the tissue affected. the data show that microbial composition at the initial, enamel-affecting stage of caries  is significantly different from that found at subsequent stages, as well as from  dental plaque of sound tooth surfaces. although the relative proportion of streptococcus mutans increased from 0.12% in dental plaque to 0.72% in enamel caries, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguinis were the dominant streptococci in these lesions. the functional profile of caries-associated bacterial communities indicates that genes involved in acid stress tolerance and  dietary sugar fermentation are overrepresented only at the initial stage (enamel  caries), whereas other genes coding for osmotic stress tolerance as well as collagenases and other proteases enabling dentin degradation are significantly overrepresented in dentin cavities. the results support a scenario in which ph and diet are determinants of the disease during the degradation of enamel, but in dentin caries lesions not only acidogenic but also proteolytic bacteria are involved. we propose that caries disease is a process of varying etiology, in which acid-producing bacteria are the vehicle to penetrate enamel and allow dentin degrading microorganisms to expand the cavity.

AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == as lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. however, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. the antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. both lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. the  higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. the inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than lactobacillus salivarius. however, the fermentative broth of lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of lactobacillus salivarius. these data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of herbal extracts on streptococcus mutans and normal oral  streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is associated with dental caries. a cariogenic biofilm, in particular, has been studied extensively for its role in the formation of dental  caries. herbal extracts such as cudrania tricuspidata, sophora flavescens, ginkgo biloba, and betula schmidtii have been used as a folk remedy for treating diseases. the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial activity of herbal extracts against normal oral streptococci, planktonic and biofilm of s. mutans. streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguinis, and s. mutans were cultivated with brain heart infusion broth and susceptibility assay for the herbal extracts was performed according to the protocol of clinical and laboratory standard institute. also, s. mutans biofilm was formed on a polystyrene 12-well plate and  8-well chamber glass slip using bhi broth containing 2% sucrose and 1% mannose after conditioning the plate and the glass slip with unstimulated saliva. the biofilm was treated with the herbal extracts in various concentrations and inoculated on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar plate for enumeration of viable s. mutans by counting colony forming units. planktonic s. mutans showed susceptibility to all of the extracts and s. mutans biofilm exhibited the highest level of sensitivity for the extracts of s. flavescens. the normal oral streptococci exhibited a weak susceptibility in comparison to s. mutans. s. oralis, however, was resistant to all of the extracts. in conclusion, the extract of s. flavescens may be a potential candidate for prevention and management of dental caries.

TI  == [comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activities of bioaggregate and mineral trioxide aggregate].
AB  == treatment outcome of endodontic perforations depends on successful elimination of the associated microorganisms and infected tissues as well as the effective seal  of the root-end or perforation site to prevent future contamination. ideally, perforation repair material has to be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in order to  prevent bacterial contamination as well as good sealing properties and biocompatibility. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of bioaggregate (ba) and mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) on the standard strains of candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar disc diffusion test. colonies of each strains were harvested from the medium and microorganisms were diluted to obtain a suspension of approximately 108 cfu/ml. petri plates with blood agar base with 5% sheep blood or sabouraud dextrose agar  (for c.albicans) were inoculated with experimental suspensions and ba and mta discs prepared as 2 mm length and 6 mm diameter were placed. after 24 and 48 hours incubation, the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured. the results of the disc diffusion tests showed that ba and mta were effective on the  tested microorganisms at 24 and 48 hours incubation periods. ba and mta showed similar antimicrobial effects on c.albicans and e.coli. ba was more effective than mta on s.mutans, e.faecalis and p.aeruginosa, however mta was more effective than ba on s.sanguinis at 48 hours. when the time efficiency of the materials were compared, there was no statistically difference between 24 to 48 hours on e.coli, e.faecalis, s.mutans, s.sanguinis in both two groups (p> 0.05). there was statistically significant decrease 24 to 48 hours on c.albicans in ba and mta groups and p.aeruginosa in ba group (p< 0.05). it can be concluded that although  ba and mta displayed similar antimicrobial efficacy on the tested microorganisms  newly improved material ba demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity than other.

TI  == [a novel typing method and scheme for streptococcus pneumoniae].
AB  == study aim: to introduce a novel molecular pcr method for the typing of streptococcus pneumonia in the national reference laboratory (nrl) for streptococcal infections. material and methods: strains of streptococcus pneumoniae are referred to the nrl from different regions of the czech republic.  generally, the identification and typing are based on strain morphology, optochin susceptibility, bile solubility, latex agglutination, and the quellung reaction.  since 2012, a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mpcr) assay has been introduced. the novel assay was tested on 210 s. pneumoniae isolates and 8 isolates of the related species s. pseudopneumoniae, s. sanguinis, and s. oralis. results: the nrl for streptococcal infections has included a novel mpcr assay in  the algorithm of s. pneumoniae identification and typing. the mpcr assay was able to identify and type any pneumococcal strain from the study collection, with the  isolates of the related species remaining negative. the mpcr assay showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in this study. the pcr appeared to be an excellent tool for s. pneumoniae typing. conclusion: until recently, s. pneumoniae serotypes and serogroups were differentiated using a serological approach (quellung reaction), but the nrl for streptococcal infections has switched to a novel mpcr assay. this molecular tool improves s. pneumoniae typing, making it more accurate.

TI  == development of a tunable wide-range gene induction system useful for the study of streptococcal toxin-antitoxin systems.
AB  == despite the plethora of genetic tools that have been developed for use in streptococcus mutans, the s. mutans genetic system still lacks an effective gene  induction system exhibiting low basal expression and strong inducibility. consequently, we created two hybrid gene induction cassettes referred to as xyl-s1 and xyl-s2. both xyl-s cassettes are xylose inducible and controlled by the bacillus megaterium xylose repressor. the xyl-s cassettes each demonstrated >600-fold-increased reporter activity in the presence of 1.2% (wt/vol) xylose. however, the xyl-s1 cassette yielded a much higher maximum level of gene expression, whereas the xyl-s2 cassette exhibited much lower uninduced basal expression. the cassettes also performed similarly in streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii, which suggests that they are likely to be useful in a variety of streptococci. we demonstrate how both xyl-s cassettes are particularly useful for the study of toxin-antitoxin (ta) modules using both the previously characterized s. mutans mazef ta module and a previously uncharacterized hicab ta module in s. mutans. hicab ta modules are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea, but little is known about their function. we show that hica serves as the toxin component of the module, while hicb serves as the antitoxin. our results suggest that, in contrast to that of typical ta modules, hica toxicity in s. mutans is modest at best. the implications of these results for hicab function are discussed.

TI  == a high-sensitive and non-radioisotopic fluorescence dye method for evaluating bacterial adhesion to denture materials.
AB  == oral bacteria adhered to dental material surfaces are known to cause various oral diseases. this study aimed to develop a highsensitive and non-radioisotopic fluorescence dye method for quantification of oral bacteria (streptococcus, actinomyces and veillonella) adhered to denture material surfaces. the amount of  adhered bacteria was estimated from the fluorescence intensity derived from resazurin, which is reduced by bacterial metabolic reactions. the addition of bacterial metabolic substrates (glucose for streptococcus and actinomyces and sodium lactate for veillonella) to the reaction mixture increased the fluorescence intensity by 2.3-110 times, subsequently improved the sensitivity. furthermore, an experimental device having silicon wells containing test material was carefully designed for accurate quantification of bacteria adhered to test materials. the improved resazurin method using a new experimental device successfully enabled the quantification of bacterial adhesion to polymethyl methacrylate and other three conventional denture materials.

TI  == involvement of gshab in the interspecies competition within oral biofilm.
AB  == although streptococcus sanguinis has been reported to produce h2o2 to gain a competitive edge over streptococcus mutans, the molecular mechanisms evolved by s. mutans to counter this "peer stress" are still to be identified. the current study was designed to investigate the ecological role of glutathione synthetase (gshab) in the interspecies interaction between s. mutans and s. sanguinis. a gshab in-frame deletion strain of s. mutans was constructed, and its phenotypic traits were characterized. the spatio-temporal interaction of the gshab mutant with s. sanguinis was further investigated in a dual-species biofilm model by fluorescence in situ hybridization. we found that, although less tolerant for h2o2, the gshab mutant produced more extracellular polysaccharides by up-regulating gtfs expression, so as to cluster as condensed microcolonies. in addition, the mutant was more susceptible to the conditioned medium of s. sanguinis, and its competitiveness was significantly compromised. taken together, we believe that gshab is essential for the competitiveness and prevalence of s. mutans through detoxifying the h2o2 produced by s. sanguinis. given the ecological importance of bacterial equilibrium within the oral biofilm, gshab may represent a promising target to modulate the s. mutans/s. sanguinis ratio under cariogenic conditions, thus contributing to the management of dental caries.

TI  == cloning-independent plasmid construction for genetic studies in streptococci.
AB  == shuttle plasmids are among the few routinely utilized tools in the streptococcus  mutans genetic system that still require the use of classical cloning methodologies and intermediate hosts for genetic manipulation. accordingly, it typically requires considerably less time and effort to introduce mutations onto  the s. mutans chromosome than it does to construct shuttle vectors for expressing genes in trans. occasionally, shuttle vector constructs also exhibit toxicity in  escherichia coli, which prevents their proper assembly. to circumvent these limitations, we modified a prolonged overlap extension pcr (poe-pcr) protocol to  facilitate direct plasmid assembly in s. mutans. using solely pcr, we created the reporter vector pzx7, which contains a single minimal streptococcal replication origin and harbors a spectinomycin resistance cassette and the gusa gene encoding beta-glucuronidase. we compared the efficiency of pzx7 assembly using multiple strains of s. mutans and were able to obtain from 5 x 10(3) to 2 x 10(5) cfu/mug  pcr product. likewise, we used pzx7 to further demonstrate that streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii are also excellent hosts for cloning-independent plasmid assembly, which suggests that this system is likely to function in numerous other streptococci. consequently, it should be possible to completely forgo the use of e. coli-streptococcus shuttle vectors in many streptococcal species, thereby decreasing the time and effort required to assemble constructs and eliminating any toxicity issues associated with intermediate hosts.

TI  == multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing excessive acetaldehyde production from ethanol by oral streptococci.
AB  == ethanol consumption and poor oral hygiene are risk factors for oral and oesophageal cancers. although oral streptococci have been found to produce excessive acetaldehyde from ethanol, little is known about the mechanism by which this carcinogen is produced. by screening 52 strains of diverse oral streptococcal species, we identified streptococcus gordonii v2016 that produced the most acetaldehyde from ethanol. we then constructed gene deletion mutants in  this strain and analysed them for alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases by zymograms. the results showed that s. gordonii v2016 expressed three primary alcohol dehydrogenases, adha, adhb and adhe, which all oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde, but their preferred substrates were 1-propanol, 1-butanol and ethanol, respectively. two additional dehydrogenases, s-adha and tdha, were identified with specificities to the secondary alcohol 2-propanol and threonine,  respectively, but not to ethanol. s. gordonii v2016 did not show a detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase even though its adhe gene encodes a putative bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. mutants with adhe deletion showed greater tolerance to ethanol in comparison with the wild-type and mutant with adha or adhb deletion, indicating that adhe is the major alcohol dehydrogenase in s. gordonii. analysis of 19 additional strains of s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis showed expressions of up to three alcohol dehydrogenases, but none showed detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, except one strain that showed a novel aldh. therefore, expression  of multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase may contribute to excessive production of acetaldehyde from ethanol by certain oral streptococci.

AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of periodontal bacterial lysates on maturation and function of mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (m-mddcs) derived from individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp) or healthy periodontal tissue (hp). design: m-mddcs derived from peripheral blood monocytes, cultured for 7 days in presence of interleukin (il)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), were stimulated with lysates of streptococcus sanguinis, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, or treponema denticola on day 4, and were then phenotyped. il-10, il-12 and ifn-gamma concentration in the supernatant of cultures were measured. results: expression of hla-dr was lower in bacterial-unstimulated mature m-mddc from cp compared to hp (p=0.04), while expression of cd1a and cd123 were higher in cp. the expression pattern of hla-dr, cd11c, cd123, and cd1a did not change on bacterial stimulation, regardless of the bacteria. stimulation with p. intermedia upregulated cd80 and cd86 in cp cells (p</=0.05). production of il-12p70 by bacterial-unstimulated m-mddcs was 5.8-fold greater in cp compared to hp. bacterial stimulation further increased il-12p70 production while decreasing il-10. significantly more ifn-gamma was produced in co-cultures of cp m-mddcs than with hp m-mddcs when cells were stimulated with p. intermedia (p=0.009). conclusions: bacterial-unstimulated m-mddc from cp exhibited a more immature phenotype but a cytokine profile biased towards proinflammatory response; this pattern was maintained/exacerbated after bacterial stimulation. p. intermedia upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and ifn-gamma expression in cp m-mddc. these events might contribute to periodontitis pathogenesis.

AB  == background: the mechanism of action of adjuvant antibiotic therapy in the treatment of peri-implantitis is not well understood. the aim of this study is to investigate antibiotic susceptibility of an in vitro biofilm by isothermal microcalorimetry (imc). methods: titanium disks containing a 72-hour three-species biofilm (streptococcus sanguinis dsm20068, fusobacterium nucleatum  atcc10953, and porphyromonas gingivalis dsm20709) were placed in a series of imc  ampoules with nutrient agar supplemented with increasing concentrations of amoxicillin, metronidazole, or their combination and incubated anaerobically for  10 days. lag time and maximum growth rate were determined from continuous heat-flow recordings of metabolic activity. to validate the imc biofilm results,  adherent s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis were incubated anaerobically in medium supplemented with antibiotics at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, and their vitality was determined by live/dead staining, conventional culturing, and imc. results: in all biofilm samples incubated with antibiotics, a prolonged lag phase was observed compared with controls (p <0.05). maximum growth rate was significantly  lower for samples treated with either amoxicillin or metronidazole compared with  controls (p <0.05). combining the antibiotics did not improve this effect. concentrations exceeding 10 times the minimum inhibitory concentration completely inhibited the growth of adherent s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis, whereas lower concentrations resulted in only a delay in the lag phase. a poor correlation was  observed between live/dead staining and conventional culturing. conclusions: imc  gives new evidence about antibiotic effects on oral biofilms and is more informative than conventional culture and live/dead assays. the combination of antibiotics was found to be more efficient than metronidazole alone; however, only minor differences in growth inhibition were detected compared with amoxicillin alone.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == distribution of streptococcus troglodytae and streptococcus dentirousetti in chimpanzee oral cavities.
AB  == aim of this study was to analyze the distribution and the phenotypic properties of the indigenous streptococci in the chimpanzee (pan troglodytes) oral cavities. eleven chimpanzees (from 9 to 44, average +/- sd, 26.9 +/- 12.6 years old) in the primate research institutes, kyoto university, were enrolled in this research, and their brushing bacterial samples were collected. as the results, streptococci were isolated from the oral cavities of all chimpanzees. the isolates (n = 46) were identified as thirteen species by the 16s rrna genes analysis. the predominant species was streptococcus sanguinis of the mitis streptococci from five chimpanzees (45%). the mutans streptococci were isolated from six chimpanzees (55%). the predominant species in the mutans streptococci were streptococcus troglodytae from four chimpanzees (36%), which species had been proposed as a novel species by us, and streptococcus dentirousetti from three chimpanzees (27%). streptococcus mutans, was isolated from one chimpanzee (9%), however, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus macacae and streptococcus downei,  which are indigenous human or monkey (macaca fasciclaris) oral habitats, were not isolated. s. troglodytae, s. dentirousetti, and s. mutans of the mutans streptococci possessed strong adherence activity to glass surface.

TI  == effects of er:yag laser on bacteria associated with titanium surfaces and cellular response in vitro.
AB  == this in vitro study examined (a) the anti-bacterial efficacy of a pulsed erbium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (er:yag) laser applied to streptococcus sanguinis or porphyromonas gingivalis adhered to either polished or microstructured titanium implant surfaces, (b) the response of osteoblast-like cells and (c) adhesion of oral bacteria to titanium surfaces after laser irradiation. thereto, (a) bacteria adhered to titanium disks were irradiated with a pulsed er:yag laser (lambda = 2,940 nm) at two different power settings: a lower mode (12.74 j/cm(2) calculated energy density) and a higher mode (63.69 j/cm(2)). (b) after laser irradiation with both settings of sterile titanium, disks were seeded with 10(4) mg-63 cells/cm(2). adhesion and proliferation were determined after 1, 4, and 24 h by fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron  microscopy. (c) bacterial adhesion was also studied on irradiated (test) and non-irradiated (control) surfaces. adhered p. gingivalis were effectively killed, even at the lower laser setting, independent of the material's surface. s. sanguinis cells adhered were effectively killed only at the higher setting of 63.69 j/cm(2). laser irradiation of titanium surfaces had no significant effects  on (b) adhesion or proliferation of osteoblast-like mg-63 cells or (c) adhesion of both oral bacterial species in comparison to untreated surfaces. an effective  decontamination of polished and rough titanium implant surfaces with a er:yag laser could only be achieved with a fluence of 63.69 j/cm(2). even though this setting may lead to certain surface alterations, no significant adverse effect on subsequent colonization and proliferation of mg-63 cells or increased bacterial adhesion was found in comparison to untreated control surfaces.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

TI  == a defined-multispecies microbial model for studying enamel caries development.
AB  == the aims of this study were to describe and validate an in vitro multispecies microbial biofilm model for caries development by evaluating the effects of varying medium concentration of sucrose (0.5 and 1.0%) and fluoride (0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f) in study 1, and calcium (1.0 and 2.0 mm ca) in study 2. defined-multispecies biofilms, formed by lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, were grown on the surface of salivary-pellicle-coated enamel slabs, with known baseline surface hardness; growth medium was changed daily. counts of viable cells on biofilms and the percentage of surface microhardness change (%smc), lesion depth (ld) and integrated mineral loss (iml) on enamel slabs were assessed after 4 days of biofilm formation under the tested conditions. counts of viable cells on biofilms were significantly affected by sucrose, fluoride and calcium concentrations (p <  0.05). there was a decrease in %smc in response to increased fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.001). lower iml (p < 0.001) and ld (p < 0.05) were found in the presence of 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f. a negative correlation was found between the response variables (%smc, ld and iml) and fluoride and calcium concentrations. the results suggest that the microbial caries model developed was able to show distinct levels of caries inhibition in response to fluoride and calcium concentrations, corroborating clinical observations. an effect of sucrose concentration on caries development was found only in the presence of the lowest  fluoride concentration.

TI  == s. sanguinis adhesion on rough titanium surfaces: effect of culture media.
AB  == bacterial colonization plays a key role in dental implant failure, because they attach directly on implant surface upon implantation. between different types of  bacteria associated with the oral environment, streptococcus sanguinis is essential in this process since it is an early colonizer. in this work the relationship between titanium surfaces modified by shot blasting treatment and s. sanguinis adhesion; have been studied in approached human mouth environment. bacteria pre-inoculated with routinary solution were put in contact with titanium samples, shot-blasted with alumina and silicon carbide, and adhesion results were compared with those obtained when bacteria were pre-inoculated with modified artificial saliva medium and on saliva pre-coated titanium samples. our results showed that bacterial adhesion on titanium samples was influenced by culture conditions. when s. sanguinis was inoculated in routinary culture media, colonies forming unities per square millimeter presented an increment correlated with roughness and surface energy, but separated by the type of particle used during shot-blasting treatment; whereas in modified artificial saliva only a relationship between bacteria adhered and the increment in both roughness and surface energy were observed, regardless of the particle type. finally, on human  saliva pre-coated samples no significant differences were observed among roughness, surface energy or particle.

TI  == incidence of bacteriocins produced by food-related lactic acid bacteria active towards oral pathogens.
AB  == in the present study we investigated the incidence of bacteriocins produced by 236 lactic acid bacteria (lab) food isolates against pathogenic or opportunistic  pathogenic oral bacteria. this set of lab contained several strains (>/=17%) producing bacteriocins active against food-related bacteria. interestingly only streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 was able to inhibit the growth of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii, while lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179 and lactobacillus plantarun aca-dc 269 produced bacteriocins solely against streptococcus oralis. thus, the percentage of strains that were found to produce bacteriocins against oral bacteria was ~1.3%. the rarity of bacteriocins active against oral lab pathogens produced by food-related lab was unexpected given their close phylogenetic relationship. nevertheless, when tested in inhibition assays, the potency of the bacteriocin(s) of s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 against the three oral streptococci was high. fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis revealed that exposure of the target cells to the antimicrobial compounds caused major alterations of key cellular constituents. our findings indicate that bacteriocins produced by food-related lab against oral lab may be rare, but deserve further investigation since, when discovered, they can be effective antimicrobials.

TI  == the surface layer of tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. the surface layer (s-layer) of t. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as tfsa and tfsb, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. here we investigated the association of this s-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. the growth of the s-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (cs) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (wt). next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. the survival  ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated cs (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the wt (97% survival). furthermore, significant  c3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the wt. in a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum. these results indicated that the s-layer of t. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.

TI  == dpr and sod in streptococcus mutans are involved in coexistence with s. sanguinis, and perr is associated with resistance to h2o2.
AB  == large numbers of bacteria coexist in the oral cavity. streptococcus sanguinis, one of the major bacteria in dental plaque, produces hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)), which interferes with the growth of other bacteria. streptococcus mutans, a cariogenic bacterium, can coexist with s. sanguinis in dental plaque, but to do so, it needs a means of detoxifying the h(2)o(2) produced by s. sanguinis. in this study, we investigated the association of three oxidative stress factors, dpr, superoxide dismutase (sod), and ahpcf, with the resistance of s. sanguinis to h(2)o(2). the knockout of dpr and sod significantly increased  susceptibility to h(2)o(2), while the knockout of ahpcf had no apparent effect on susceptibility. in particular, dpr inactivation resulted in hypersensitivity to h(2)o(2). next, we sought to identify the factor(s) involved in the regulation of these oxidative stress genes and found that perr negatively regulated dpr expression. the knockout of perr caused increased dpr expression levels, resulting in low-level susceptibility to h(2)o(2) compared with the wild type. furthermore, we evaluated the roles of perr, dpr, and sod when s. mutans was cocultured with s. sanguinis. culturing of the dpr or sod mutant with s. sanguinis showed a significant decrease in the s. mutans population ratio compared with the wild type, while the perr mutant increased the ratio. our results suggest that dpr and sod in s. mutans are involved in coexistence with s. sanguinis, and perr is associated with resistance to h(2)o(2) in regulating the expression of dpr.

AB  == bacterial infection (i.e., streptococcus sanguinis) has been suggested to be related to pathogenesis and/or symptom of behcet's disease (bd). toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) plays an important role in both the innate and adaptive immune  systems by recognizing a component of bacterial dna (i.e., cpg-dna). previous studies have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in tlr9 were associated with infectious and autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases. in this study, we detected five snps with bd patients in a japanese population. allele frequency analysis of the three common snps (-1486: t/c (promoter region), 1174:  a/g (intron 1), 2848: g/a (exon 2; pro545pro)) showed no statistically significant difference between the bd patients and the healthy controls. however, genotyping analysis revealed that the homozygous genotypes -1486cc and 1174gg were significantly more frequent in the bd patients compared to the healthy controls (p = 0.048 and p = 0.027, respectively). the homozygous diplotype distribution c-g-a/c-g-a was significantly more frequent in the bd patients compared to the healthy controls (p = 0.041). for reporter gene assay, the plasmid construct carrying diplotype distribution c-g/c-g of the -1486t/c and 1174a/g snps showed significantly higher luciferase activity compared to the plasmid construct carrying diplotype distribution t-a/t-a (p = 0.019). these results suggested an association of the homozygous genotypes and homozygous diplotype configuration of the tlr9 snps with susceptibility to bd in the japanese population.

TI  == computer-assisted flapless implant placement reduces the incidence of surgery-related bacteremia.
AB  == objective: bacteremia--the access of bacterium to the bloodstream--may yield life-threatening complications. the aim of this study was to compare the incidence, duration, and type of bacterium leading to bacteremia with relation to conventional and computer-assisted flapless implant surgery. material and methods: a total of 377 implants were placed in 68 edentulous jaws using the conventional (conventional group) or a computer-assisted stereolithographic (sla) template-guided surgery technique (flapless group). bacteremia was monitored from pre- and postoperative blood samples. results: the duration of the surgical intervention was significantly shorter in the flapless group (p = 0.3510). baseline samples were sterile. following the 15th minute after the placement of the last implant, bacteria were present in 62 and 12 % of the patients in the conventional and flapless groups, respectively (p < 0.0001; relative risk: 3.05). the differences in the incidence of the bacteremia detected at the baseline and 15 min after the last implant placement were statistically significant in the conventional group (p = 0.0001). however, no such statistical significance was present in the flapless group. staphylocccus epidermidis, bifidobacterium spp., streptococcus viridans, corynebacterium spp., and streptococcus sanguinis were the isolated bacterium. conclusions: irrespective of the utilized technique, bacteremia may occur upon the placement of four to eight implants to an edentulous jaw. the probability of bacteremia for the patients operated with the  conventional technique is, however, 3.05 greater than those operated with the flapless technique. clinical relevance: flapless implant placement reduces the incidence of surgery-related bacteremia and, therefore, may be beneficial to patients at risk.

TI  == can salivary activity predict periodontal breakdown in a. actinomycetemcomitans infected adolescents?
AB  == objective: while aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) is highly associated  with localised aggressive periodontitis (lap) many aa-carriers do not develop lap. this study was designed to determine whether specific salivary factors could distinguish between subjects who have aa initially and remain healthy (h/aa) as compared to those who develop lap (lap/aa). design: h/aa subjects and healthy controls with no aa (h) were enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study to investigate initiation of bone loss (lap) over 3 years. after detection of lap, stored saliva from 10 h, 10 h/aa, and 10 lap/aa subjects was thawed, processed, and tested for (1) lactoferrin (lf) concentration and iron levels; (2) agglutination of aa; (3) killing of gram-positive bacteria. results: lap/aa saliva levels of lf iron were low prior to and after bone loss (3.6+1.7ngfe/mug)  (lap/aa vs. h and h/aa p</=0.01). saliva from h/aa subjects caused aa to agglutinate significantly more than h or lap/aa saliva (p</=0.01). lap/aa saliva  killed streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis and lactobacillus in vitro by  >83%. saliva from h individuals killed these bacteria by <3.3% (lap/aa vs. h; p</=0.01). h/aa killing was intermediate. conclusion: lap/aa saliva showed: low levels of lf iron, minimal aa agglutinating activity, and high killing activity against gram-positive bacteria. aa-positive healthy saliva (h/aa) showed: higher  levels of lf iron, maximal aa agglutinating activity, and moderate killing of gram-positive bacteria. a salivary activity profile can distinguish between subjects who are aa-positive and remain healthy from those who develop lap.

TI  == genome-wide gene deletions in streptococcus sanguinis by high throughput pcr.
AB  == transposon mutagenesis and single-gene deletion are two methods applied in genome-wide gene knockout in bacteria (1,2). although transposon mutagenesis is less time consuming, less costly, and does not require completed genome information, there are two weaknesses in this method: (1) the possibility of a disparate mutants in the mixed mutant library that counter-selects mutants with decreased competition; and (2) the possibility of partial gene inactivation whereby genes do not entirely lose their function following the insertion of a transposon. single-gene deletion analysis may compensate for the drawbacks associated with transposon mutagenesis. to improve the efficiency of genome-wide  single gene deletion, we attempt to establish a high-throughput technique for genome-wide single gene deletion using streptococcus sanguinis as a model organism. each gene deletion construct in s. sanguinis genome is designed to comprise 1-kb upstream of the targeted gene, the apha-3 gene, encoding kanamycin  resistance protein, and 1-kb downstream of the targeted gene. three sets of primers f1/r1, f2/r2, and f3/r3, respectively, are designed and synthesized in a  96-well plate format for pcr-amplifications of those three components of each deletion construct. primers r1 and f3 contain 25-bp sequences that are complementary to regions of the apha-3 gene at their 5' end. a large scale pcr amplification of the apha-3 gene is performed once for creating all single-gene deletion constructs. the promoter of apha-3 gene is initially excluded to minimize the potential polar effect of kanamycin cassette. to create the gene deletion constructs, high-throughput pcr amplification and purification are performed in a 96-well plate format. a linear recombinant pcr amplicon for each gene deletion will be made up through four pcr reactions using high-fidelity dna  polymerase. the initial exponential growth phase of s. sanguinis cultured in todd hewitt broth supplemented with 2.5% inactivated horse serum is used to increase competence for the transformation of pcr-recombinant constructs. under this condition, up to 20% of s. sanguinis cells can be transformed using ~50 ng of dna. based on this approach, 2,048 mutants with single-gene deletion were ultimately obtained from the 2,270 genes in s. sanguinis excluding four gene orfs contained entirely within other orfs in s. sanguinis sk36 and 218 potential essential genes. the technique on creating gene deletion constructs is high throughput and could be easy to use in genome-wide single gene deletions for any  transformable bacteria.

TI  == divalent cations enhance fluoride binding to streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis cells and subsequently inhibit bacterial acid production.
AB  == one preventive effect of topical fluoride application is derived from the fact that fluoride can inhibit bacterial acid production. furthermore, divalent cations such as ca(2+) and mg(2+) increase the binding of fluoride to bacterial cells. these findings suggest that exposure of oral bacteria to fluoride in the presence of divalent cations increases fluoride binding to bacterial cells and subsequently enhances fluoride-induced inhibition of bacterial acid production. this study investigated the effects of fluoride exposure (0-20,000 ppm f) in the  presence of ca(2+) or mg(2+) prior to glucose challenge on ph fall ability by bacterial sugar fermentation, as well as fluoride binding to bacterial cells by exposure to fluoride, and fluoride release from bacterial cells during bacterial  sugar fermentation, using caries-related bacteria, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis. the ph fall by both streptococci was inhibited by exposure to over 250 ppm f in the presence of ca(2+) (p < 0.01), whereas in the presence of mg(2+), the ph fall by s. mutans and s. sanguinis was inhibited after exposure to over 250 and 950 ppm f, respectively (p < 0.05). the amounts of fluoride binding to and released from streptococcal cells increased with the concentration of fluoride the cells were exposed to in the presence of mg(2+), but were high enough even after 250 ppm f exposure in the presence of ca(2+). the enhanced inhibition of acid production in the presence of divalent cations is probably due to the improved efficiency of fluoride binding to bacterial cells being improved via these divalent cations.

TI  == effect of osteopontin on the initial adhesion of dental bacteria.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are involved in numerous infections of the human body, including dental caries. while conventional therapy of biofilm diseases aims at eradication and mechanical removal of the biofilms, recent therapeutic approaches target the mechanisms of biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion in particular.  the effect of bovine milk osteopontin, a highly phosphorylated whey protein, on adhesion of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and actinomyces naeslundii, three prominent colonizers in dental biofilms, to saliva-coated surfaces was investigated. while adhesion of a. naeslundii was not affected by osteopontin, a strong, dose-dependent reduction in the number of adhering s. mitis was shown. no difference in bacterial adhesion was observed for caseinoglycomacropeptide, another phosphorylated milk protein. osteopontin did not affect bacterial viability, but changed bacterial surface hydrophobicity, and may be suggested to prevent the adhesins of s. mitis from interacting with their  salivary receptors. the antiadhesive effect of osteopontin may be useful for caries prevention.

TI  == streptococcus sanguinis and the sera of patients with behcet's disease stimulate  membrane expression of alpha-enolase in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells.
AB  == the glycolytic enzyme alpha-enolase is a plasminogen-binding protein that is generally found in the cytosolic compartment. however, alpha-enolase can also be  expressed on cell surfaces following an inflammatory stimulus via an unknown mechanism. we investigated the effects of streptococcus sanguinis (s. sanguinis)  and the sera of patients with behcet's disease (bd) on the expression and distribution of alpha-enolase in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (hdmecs). hdmecs were stimulated with cultured s. sanguinis and the sera of active bd patients. hdmecs incubated for 6, 12 or 24 h were harvested, and the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions of proteins were extracted. the expression and distribution of alpha-enolase were analyzed using subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting. subcellular localization of alpha-enolase was also assessed by immunocytochemistry. s. sanguinis stimulated the expression of alpha-enolase in the membranous compartment of hdmecs in a dose-dependent manner. this pattern was also observed in hdmecs incubated with bd patients' sera. although incubation of  hdmecs with sera from healthy controls increased membrane expression of alpha-enolase, incubation with bd sera resulted in earlier and higher expression  of this glycoprotein in the cellular membrane of hdmecs. immunocytochemistry revealed strong immunostaining of alpha-enolase in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic  membrane of hdmecs incubated with s. sanguinis or bd patients' sera. in conclusions, these results indicate that s. sanguinis infection and the sera of bd patients with active disease are inflammatory stimuli that can induce membranous alpha-enolase expression in endothelial cells. membrane-expressed alpha-enolase could potentially react with anti-alpha-enolase antibodies in bd patients' sera, resulting in increased inflammation.

TI  == beyond streptococcus mutans: dental caries onset linked to multiple species by 16s rrna community analysis.
AB  == dental caries in very young children may be severe, result in serious infection,  and require general anesthesia for treatment. dental caries results from a shift  within the biofilm community specific to the tooth surface, and acidogenic species are responsible for caries. streptococcus mutans, the most common acid producer in caries, is not always present and occurs as part of a complex microbial community. understanding the degree to which multiple acidogenic species provide functional redundancy and resilience to caries-associated communities will be important for developing biologic interventions. in addition, microbial community interactions in health and caries pathogenesis are not well understood. the purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial community profiles associated with the onset of caries in the primary dentition. in a combination cross-sectional and longitudinal design, bacterial community profiles at progressive stages of caries and over time were examined and compared to those of health. 16s rrna gene sequencing was used for bacterial community analysis. streptococcus mutans was the dominant species in many, but not all, subjects with caries. elevated levels of s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and s. parasanguinis were  also associated with caries, especially in subjects with no or low levels of s. mutans, suggesting these species are alternative pathogens, and that multiple species may need to be targeted for interventions. veillonella, which metabolizes lactate, was associated with caries and was highly correlated with total acid producing species. among children without previous history of caries, veillonella, but not s. mutans or other acid-producing species, predicted future  caries. bacterial community diversity was reduced in caries as compared to health, as many species appeared to occur at lower levels or be lost as caries advanced, including the streptococcus mitis group, neisseria, and streptococcus sanguinis. this may have implications for bacterial community resilience and the  restoration of oral health.

TI  == contact-killing of adhering streptococci by a quaternary ammonium compound incorporated in an acrylic resin.
AB  == purpose: acrylates for bonding of joint prostheses and stainless-steel brackets in orthopedics and orthodontics are prone to bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation, respectively, leading to serious infectious complications. here we describe the preparation of a contact-killing acrylic resin by incorporation of [3-(methacryloylamino)propyl] trimethylammonium chloride (maptac). methods: physicochemical properties of the acrylates with and without maptac incorporated  were determined with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and water contact angles. the bond-strength of the acrylate with different percentages of maptac was determined in a shear mode. the efficacy in contact-killing of the acrylate with  maptac incorporated with and without an adsorbed salivary coating was evaluated for various oral streptococcal strains. cytotoxicity was tested against human skin fibroblasts. results: acrylates with 16 wt% and 20 wt% incorporated maptac showed strong contact-killing of various oral streptococcal strains up to challenge concentrations of 109 ml-1 within 15 min, with no elution of antimicrobial polymers. contact-killing reduced after coating with a salivary conditioning film, but still remained significant up to a challenge concentration of 105 ml-1. no cytotoxicity of acrylate with incorporated maptac was observed toward human skin fibroblasts. the bond strengths of stainless-steel brackets fixed to etched enamel through the resin (12 +/- 3 mpa) decreased with increasing amounts maptac to half of the original value when 20 wt% of maptac was incorporated, which remained within a clinically acceptable range. conclusions: these results suggest that maptac can be effectively incorporated in orthodontic  resin to provide long-term bactericidal activity against oral bacteria, with potential application in orthopedics.

TI  == streptococcus danieliae sp. nov., a novel bacterium isolated from the caecum of a mouse.
AB  == we report the characterization of one novel bacterium, strain erd01g(t), isolated from the cecum of a tnf(deltaare) mouse. the strain was found to belong to the genus streptococcus based on phylogenetic analysis of partial 16s rrna gene sequences. the bacterial species with standing name in nomenclature that was most closely related to our isolate was streptococcus alactolyticus (97 %). the two bacteria were characterized by a dna-dna hybridization similarity value of 35 %,  demonstrating that they belong to different species. the new isolate was negative for acetoin production, esculin hydrolysis, urease, alpha-galactosidase and beta-glucosidase, was able to produce acid from starch and trehalose, grew as beta-hemolytic coccobacilli on blood agar, did not grow at >40 degrees c, did not survive heat treatment at 60 degrees c for 20 min and showed negative agglutination in lancefield tests. on the basis of these characteristics, strain  erd01g(t) differed from the most closely related species s. alactolyticus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus sanguinis. thus, based on genotypic and phenotypic evidence, we propose that the isolate belongs to a novel bacterial taxon within the genus streptococcus, for which the  name streptococcus danieliae is proposed. the type strain is erd01g(t) (= dsm 22233(t) = ccug 57647(t)).

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == assessing the effect of pineapple extract alone and in combination with vancomycin on streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a major problem that affects a large number of patients in the society. various treatment alternatives have been proposed to control this pathologic condition. streptococcus sanguis is one of the countless  pathogens involved in periodontitis. objectives: the current study aimed to assess the efficacy of pineapple extract per se and in synergy with vancomycin on the growth activity of s. sanguis. materials and methods: an experimental study was designed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of pineapple extract per se and in conjunction with vancomycin. the study was carried out in three stages. serial concentrations of the aqueous pineapple extract, vancomycin, and pineapple plus vancomycin were prepared by broth microdilution technique respectively and were exposed to the standard laboratory strain of s. sanguis (10556 atcc). the lowest concentration of the pineapple extract and the mixed pineapple/vancomycin solution which inhibited bacterial growth was recorded as the mic. results: the minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin was determined 1 microg/ ml. the pineapple extract failed to show any inhibitory effects per se, however, once added to vancomycin, it reduced the mic to 0.5microg/ml. conclusion: prescription of pineapple extract along with antibiotics increases the antibacterial effects of the drug, therefore reduces the minimum inhibitory concentration of the antibiotic.

TI  == factors related to maternal transmission of mutans streptococci in high-risk children-pilot study.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to investigate virulence factors associated with maternal transmission of mutans streptococci (ms). methods: saliva samples were collected from 10 mothers with active caries and their 2- to  5-year-old children. ten ms colonies were isolated from each subject. transmission of ms was identified by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reactions. biofilm formation and mutacin production of the isolates against streptococcus gordonii 10558, streptococcus sanguinis 10557, streptococcus mutans 25175, and streptococcus sobrinus 6715 were analyzed. results: all mothers and children had ms colonization. only 7 of the 36 maternal genotypes (33 streptococcus mutans genotypes and 3 streptococcus sobrinus genotypes) were transmitted. maternal transmission was found in 4 mother-child pairs, whereas 9 children had nonmaternal genotypes. there was no difference in biofilm formation  between transmitted and nontransmitted genotypes (p>.05). transmitted genotypes,  however, produced more mutacin against streptococcus sobrinus 6715 than nontransmitted genotypes. conclusions: this pilot study showed that there may be  nonmaternal as well as maternal mutans streptococci transmission.

TI  == effect of xylitol on cariogenic and beneficial oral streptococci: a randomized, double-blind crossover trial.
AB  == background/purpose: although habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels, its effect on beneficial oral streptococci is less clear. the main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the oral beneficial streptococci level of saliva, streptococcus sanguinis and s. mitis. material and methods: twenty four volunteers with a median age of 23.7 years (range: 20-28) harboring streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. sanguinis and s. mitis participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum (1.5 g/pellet) contained 70% xylitol w/w while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol w/w. saliva samples were collected before and after two three-week test periods with a four-week washout interval. colony-forming units (cfu)/ml were enumerated for the estimation of s.  mutans levels on mitis salivarius-mutans valinomycin (ms-mutv), s. sobrinus on mitis salivarius-sobrinus (ms-sob), s. sanguinis on modified medium 10-sucrose (mm10-s) and s. mitis on mitis salivarius agar with tellurite (msat) media. results: the s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts of the saliva samples decreased significantly (p = 0.01 and p = 0.011, respectively) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. the salivary s. sanguinis and s. mitis counts did  not decrease in both xylitol and sorbitol gum groups. conclusions: based on the findings of this study, xylitol consumption reduced s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts in saliva but appeared not to effect numbers of s. sanguinis and s. mitis  in saliva. so, habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels without any effect on beneficial sterptococci for the oral cavity.

TI  == isothermal microcalorimetry provides new insights into biofilm variability and dynamics.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate a three-species in vitro biofilm with peri-implantitis-related bacteria for its variability and metabolic activity. streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were suspended in simulated body fluid containing 0.2% glucose to form biofilms on polished, protein-coated implant-grade titanium disks over 72 h using a flow chamber system. thereafter, biofilm-coated disks were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization/confocal laser scanning microscopy. to assess metabolic activity within the biofilms, their heat flow was recorded for 480 h at 37 degrees c by imc. the microscopic methods revealed that the total number of bacteria in the biofilms varied slightly among specimens (2.59 x 10(4) +/- 0.67 x 10(4) cells mm(-2) ), whereas all three species were found constantly with unchanged proportions (s. sanguinis  41.3 +/- 4.8%, f. nucleatum 17.7 +/- 2.1%, and p. gingivalis 41.0 +/- 4.9%). imc  revealed minor differences in time-to-peak heat flow (20.6 +/- 4.5 h), a trend consistent with the small variation in bacterial species proportions as shown by  microscopy. peak heat flow (35.8 +/- 42.6 muw), mean heat flow (13.1 +/- 22.0 muw), and total heat over 480 h (23.5 +/- 37.2 j) showed very high variation. these imc results may be attributed to differences in the initial cell counts and relative proportions of the three species, their distribution and embedment in exopolysaccharide matrix on the test specimens. the present results provide new insights into variability and dynamics of biofilms on titanium disks, aspects that should be explored in future studies of dental surfaces.

TI  == regulation of neuraminidase expression in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic acid; neunac) is one of the most important carbohydrates for streptococcus pneumoniae due of its role as a carbon  and energy source, receptor for adhesion and invasion and molecular signal for promotion of biofilm formation, nasopharyngeal carriage and invasion of the lung. results: in this work, neunac and its metabolic derivative n-acetyl mannosamine (mannac) were used to analyze regulatory mechanisms of the neuraminidase locus expression. genomic and metabolic comparison to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis elucidates the metabolic association of the two amino sugars to different parts of the locus coding for the two main pneumococcal neuraminidases and confirms the substrate specificity of the respective abc transporters. quantitative gene expression analysis shows repression of the locus by glucose and induction of all predicted transcriptional units by mannac and neunac, each inducing with higher efficiency the operon encoding for the transporter with higher specificity for the respective amino sugar. cytofluorimetric analysis demonstrated enhanced surface exposure of nana on pneumococci grown in neunac and mannac and an activity assay allowed to quantify approximately twelve times as much neuraminidase activity on induced cells as opposed to glucose grown cells. conclusions: the present data increase the understanding of metabolic regulation  of the nanab locus and indicate that experiments aimed at the elucidation of the  relevance of neuraminidases in pneumococcal virulence should possibly not be carried out on bacteria grown in glucose containing media.

TI  == heterologous expression of sahh reveals that biofilm formation is autoinducer-2-independent in streptococcus sanguinis but is associated with an intact activated methionine cycle.
AB  == numerous studies have claimed deleterious effects of luxs mutation on many bacterial phenotypes, including bacterial biofilm formation. genetic complementation mostly restored the observed mutant phenotypes to wt levels, leading to the postulation that quorum sensing via a family of molecules generically termed autoinducer-2 (ai-2) is essential for many phenotypes. because luxs mutation has dual effects, this hypothesis needs to be investigated into the details for each bacterial species. in this study we used s. sanguinis sk36 as a  model biofilm bacterium and employed physiological characterization and transcriptome approaches on wt and luxs-deficient strains, in combination with chemical, luxs, and sahh complementation experiments. sahh enables a direct conversion of sah to homocysteine and thereby restores the activated methionine cycle in a luxs-negative background without formation of the ai-2 precursor 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione. with this strategy we were able to dissect the individual contribution of luxs and ai-2 activity in detail. our data revealed that s. sanguinis biofilm formation is independent from ai-2 substance pools and  is rather supported by an intact activated methyl cycle. of 216 differentially transcribed genes in the luxs mutant, 209 were restored by complementation with a gene encoding the s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase. only nine genes, mainly involved in natural competence, were directly affected by the ai-2 quorum-sensing substance pool. cumulatively, this suggested that biofilm formation in s. sanguinis is not under control of ai-2. our study suggests that previously evaluated luxs mutants in other species need to be revisited to resolve the precise contribution of ai-2 substance pools and the methionine pathways.

TI  == comparison of oral streptococci biofilm in caries-free and caries-affected preschool mexican children.
AB  == interaction of oral streptococci biofilm is the main etiological factor for dental caries. the aim of the study was to compare oral streptococci (os) distribution in the biofilm of primary dentition from caries-free and caries-affected preschool mexican children. this cross-sectional study involved 40 caries-free and 40 caries-affected children with primary dentition. each child was examined using the dmfs index, dna was extracted from saliva and presence of  os was determined by pcr. data obtained showed no statistical difference regarding age and gender (p > 0.05). streptococcus mutans (smut), streptococcus sobrinus (ssob) and their combination showed significant statistical differences  between groups (p < 0.05). smut, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii had an inverse relation with dmfs index and ssob had a direct relation similar to combined with smut. smut-ssob combined with other os showed statistical differences (p < 0.05). in free-caries group streptococcus gordonii was more frequently identified than smut. the ratio smut/streptococcus sanguinis  could represent a high risk of dental caries development; this ratio was higher in the caries-affected (1.18) than in the caries-free group (0.32). in conclusion, os play an important role in dental caries predisposition and severity, not only the presence of smut and srob, but also the complexity and distribution of os in the biofilm.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == osteopontin reduces biofilm formation in a multi-species model of dental biofilm.
AB  == background: combating dental biofilm formation is the most effective means for the prevention of caries, one of the most widespread human diseases. among the chemical supplements to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures, non-bactericidal adjuncts that target the mechanisms of bacterial biofilm formation have gained increasing interest in recent years. milk proteins, such as lactoferrin, have been shown to interfere with bacterial colonization of saliva-coated surfaces. we here study the effect of bovine milk osteopontin (opn), a highly phosphorylated whey glycoprotein, on a multispecies in vitro model of dental biofilm. while considerable research effort focuses on the interaction of opn with mammalian cells, there are no data investigating the influence of opn on bacterial biofilms. methodology/principal findings: biofilms consisting of streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and streptococcus sanguinis were grown in a flow cell system that permitted in situ microscopic analysis. crystal violet staining showed significantly less biofilm formation in the presence of opn, as compared to biofilms grown without opn or biofilms grown in the presence of caseinoglycomacropeptide, another phosphorylated milk protein. confocal microscopy revealed that opn bound to the surface of bacterial cells and reduced mechanical stability of the biofilms without affecting cell viability. the bacterial composition of the biofilms, determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, changed considerably in the presence of opn. in particular, colonization of s. mitis, the best biofilm former in the model, was reduced dramatically. conclusions/significance: opn strongly reduces the amount of biofilm formed in a well-defined laboratory model of acidogenic dental biofilm. if a similar effect can be observed in vivo, opn might serve as a valuable adjunct to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures.

TI  == the role of hydrogen peroxide in environmental adaptation of oral microbial communities.
AB  == oral streptococci are able to produce growth-inhibiting amounts of hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) as byproduct of aerobic metabolism. several recent studies showed that the produced h(2)o(2) is not a simple byproduct of metabolism but functions in several aspects of oral bacterial biofilm ecology. first, the release of dna from cells is closely associated to the production of h(2)o(2) in  streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii. extracellular dna is crucial  for biofilm development and stabilization and can also serve as source for horizontal gene transfer between oral streptococci. second, due to the growth inhibiting nature of h(2)o(2), h(2)o(2) compatible species associate with the producers. h(2)o(2) production therefore might help in structuring the initial biofilm development. on the other hand, the oral environment harbors salivary peroxidases that are potent in h(2)o(2) scavenging. therefore, the effects of biofilm intrinsic h(2)o(2) production might be locally confined. however, taking  into account that 80% of initial oral biofilm constituents are streptococci, the  influence of h(2)o(2) on biofilm development and environmental adaptation might be under appreciated in current research.

TI  == spxa1 involved in hydrogen peroxide production, stress tolerance and endocarditis virulence in streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is one of the most common agents of infective endocarditis. spx proteins are a group of global regulators that negatively or positively control global transcription initiation. in this study, we characterized the spxa1 gene in s. sanguinis sk36. the spxa1 null mutant displayed opaque colony morphology, reduced hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) production, and reduced antagonistic activity against streptococcus mutans ua159  relative to the wild type strain. the deltaspxa1 mutant also demonstrated decreased tolerance to high temperature, acidic and oxidative stresses. further analysis revealed that deltaspxa1 also exhibited a approximately 5-fold reduction in competitiveness in an animal model of endocarditis. microarray studies indicated that expression of several oxidative stress genes was downregulated in  the deltaspxa1 mutant. the expression of spxb and nox was significantly decreased in the deltaspxa1 mutant compared with the wild type. these results indicate that spxa1 plays a major role in h(2)o(2) production, stress tolerance and endocarditis virulence in s. sanguinis sk36. the second spx gene, spxa2, was also found in s. sanguinis sk36. the spxa2 null mutant was found to be defective for growth under normal conditions and showed sensitivity to high temperature, acidic and oxidative stresses.

TI  == ecto-5'-nucleotidase: a candidate virulence factor in streptococcus sanguinis experimental endocarditis.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is the most common cause of infective endocarditis (ie).  since the molecular basis of virulence of this oral commensal bacterium remains unclear, we searched the genome of s. sanguinis for previously unidentified virulence factors. we identified a cell surface ecto-5'-nucleotidase (nt5e), as a candidate virulence factor. by colorimetric phosphate assay, we showed that s. sanguinis nt5e can hydrolyze extracellular adenosine triphosphate to generate adenosine. moreover, a nt5e deletion mutant showed significantly shorter lag time (p<0.05) to onset of platelet aggregation than the wild-type strain, without affecting platelet-bacterial adhesion in vitro (p=0.98). in the absence of nt5e,  s. sanguinis caused ie (4 d) in a rabbit model with significantly decreased mass  of vegetations (p<0.01) and recovered bacterial loads (log(10)cfu, p=0.01), suggesting that nt5e contributes to the virulence of s. sanguinis in vivo. as a virulence factor, nt5e may function by (i) hydrolyzing atp, a pro-inflammatory molecule, and generating adenosine, an immunosuppressive molecule to inhibit phagocytic monocytes/macrophages associated with valvular vegetations. (ii) nt5e-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation could also delay presentation of platelet microbicidal proteins to infecting bacteria on heart valves. both plausible nt5e-dependent mechanisms would promote survival of infecting s. sanguinis. in conclusion, we now show for the first time that streptococcal nt5e  modulates s. sanguinis-induced platelet aggregation and may contribute to the virulence of streptococci in experimental ie.

AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to investigate the viability of early colonizers on the surfaces of resin-based dental restorative materials modified with low-surface tension active agents in comparison with the unmodified material. a novel polymeric sorption material, loaded with two low-surface tension gamma(l) active agents (hydroxyfunctional polydimethylsiloxane and polydimethylsiloxane) or a polymerizable active agent (silicone polyether acrylate), was used to modify commonly formulated experimental dental resin composites. the non-modified resin was used as the standard (st). the viability of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis on water-stored, polished, and  human saliva pellicle-coated specimens was determined using a fluorescence microscope after 8 and 24h. total, vital, and non-vital cells were calculated from the microscopic images by counting pixels per colour. means, standard deviations, univariate anova and multiple comparisons with post hoc scheffe's tests were calculated. t-test was done to compare 8-h and 24-h bacteria counts. for all tests p<0.05 was chosen. null hypothesis: the test materials and the standard did not differ either in the total bacterial counts or in the respective bacterium's viability after 8 or 24h. the test materials modified with the silicone polyether acrylate showed lower total bacteria count after 8 or 24h than st. but all test materials had significantly fewer vital cells after 8 or 24h compared to st. the contact angle did not influence bacterial adhesion, but low total sfe and a low polar term of sfe resulted in fewer bacteria. the material's  chemistry also affected the total and vital cell counts. different bacteria viabilities needed to be explored to obtain relevant information regarding bacterial adhesion on dental composite resins. the novel sorption material loaded with low gamma(l) active agents or with a low gamma(l) polymerizable silicone polyether acrylate used to modify the chemistry of the test materials was appropriate to reduce bacterial adhesion or cell viability, respectively.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial comparison of chlorhexidine, persica mouthwash and miswak  extract.
AB  == aim: herbal mouthwashes, such as persica (salvadora persica, mint and yarrow extracts) and miswak extract have been shown to decrease gingival inflammation and plaque accumulation. the aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activities of persica and miswak extract with the conventional mouthwash chlorhexidine against streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus vulgaris and candida albicans. materials and methods: in this in vitro study, blood-agar culture (merk, germany) was used to grow the streptococcus strains, saburd-dextrose culture (merk, germany) was used to grow c. albicans and mrs-agar was used to grow l. vulgaris. various concentrations of  these substances (0.1, 0.05 and 0.025% of miswak extract, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025 and 0.0125% of persica, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.025% of chlorhexidine) were added to paper disks, separately, inserted into culture plates and transferred into the incubator. the inhibition zone around each disk was measured after 24 hours and the data was analyzed by the kruskal-wallis test. results: chlorhexidine possessed antibacterial activity at all concentrations tested. it was more effective than persica and miswak at all concentrations on s. salivarius (p = 0.022 for 0.1%, 0.009 for 0.05 and 0.025%). it had greater effect than the other  two tested material on s.sanguis only at concentration 0.01%. chlorhexidine was the most effective against s.salivarius; persica was the most effective against lactobacillus (p = 0.005) and the least effective against s. salivarius; and miswak extract was the most effective against s. salivarius and s. sanguis at concentrations 0.1 and 0.05% (p = 0.005) and ineffective against l. vulgaris. none of these mouthwashes were effective against c. albicans. conclusion: this study revealed that chlorhexidine remains the gold standard as an antimicrobial agent, although herbal based mouthwashes do have marginal antimicrobial activities. it is necessary to conduct more clinical and microbiological studies  focusing on periodontal pathogens and anaerobic microorganisms. clinical significance: mechanical plaque control is the main way for periodontal disease prevention and mouthrinses are used to improve its efficacy. based on the results of this study, chlorhexidine has the most antibacterial effect and although persica mouthwash and miswak are routinely used in some asian countries their antibacterial efficacies are suspected.

TI  == effects of xylitol on xylitol-sensitive versus xylitol-resistant streptococcus mutans strains in a three-species in vitro biofilm.
AB  == we studied the effects of xylitol on biofilms containing xylitol-resistant (xr) and xylitol-sensitive (xs) streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii and s. sanguinis. the biofilms were grown for 8 and 24 h on hydroxyapatite discs. the viable microorganisms were determined by plate culturing techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) was performed using a s. mutans-specific probe. extracellular cell-bound polysaccharides (eps) were determined by spectrofluorometry from single-species s. mutans biofilms. in the presence of 5 % xylitol, the counts of the xs s. mutans decreased tenfold in the  young (8 h) biofilm (p < 0.05) but no effect was seen in the mature (24 h) biofilm. no decrease was observed for the xr strains, and fish confirmed these results. no differences were detected in the eps production of the xs s. mutans grown with or without xylitol, nor between xr and xs s. mutans strains. thus, it  seems that xylitol did not affect the eps synthesis of the s. mutans strains. since the xr s. mutans strains, not inhibited by xylitol, showed no xylitol-induced decrease in the biofilms, we conclude that growth inhibition could be responsible for the decrease of the counts of the xs s. mutans strains in the clinically relevant young biofilms.

TI  == levels of selenomonas species in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: to compare the levels of selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. material and methods: fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique. between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the mann-whitney u-test. results: subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, s. sputigena and the mitsuokella sp. human oral taxon (hot) 131 (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone cs002), while higher mean counts of actinomyces gerencseriae and streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). selenomonas sp. hot 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of p. gingivalis and s. sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth >/= 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth </= 3 mm) (p < 0.01). furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive  periodontitis, sites with probing depth of </= 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. there were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of p. gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), s. sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and selenomonas dianae (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone ew076) (r  = 0.42, p < 0.05). conclusion: s. sputigena and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 may be associated with the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis, and their role in the onset and progression of this infection should be investigated  further.

TI  == influence of orthodontic treatment on oral streptococci.
AB  == objective of this study is to evaluate the changes of the oral microbial flora, concentrating on the oral streptococci, after the first 3 and 6 months of orthodontic treatment. materials and methods: 40 patients, aged 7-17, that presented for orthodontic treatment between april and september 2010 in the department of orthodontics and dento-facial orthopedics of "carol davila" university of medicine and pharmacy, bucharest have been selected. according to the protocol, coronary and subgingival plaque was collected from the dental surface before starting any orthodontic treatment (t0), 3 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t1) and 6 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t2). the samples were studied in cantacuzino national institute of research-development for microbiology and immunology [isolation on columbia agar  with 5% sheep blood, identification on morphotinctorial, growth and biochemical characteristics using api 20 strep (biomerieux)]. bacterial concentration (colony-forming units/sample = cfu/sample) for the aerobic and anaerobic flora was calculated by the serial dilution method of counting bacteria. results: 106 strains of oral streptococci were isolated from dental plaque, belonging to 6 species (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus acidominimus),  37 strains of oral streptococci in patients from group i (t0), 40 strains from group ii (t1) and 29 strains of oral streptococci from group iii (t2). after 3 months (t1) the aerobic bacteria percentage, detected at a concentration between  10(5) and 10(6), increased from 30 to 38.2%. the percentage of patients with a bacterial concentration higher than 10(6) cfu/sample increased from 5% to 8.8%. the samples colected at t2 (patients examined after 6 months of orthodonic treatment) presented a lower bacterial concentration, as compared to group ii (t1). the most common isolated species of streptococci were s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. mutans (37.5%, 22.5% and 10%), whose frequency increased after 3 months of treatment to 41.14%, 32.3% and respectively 14.4%, returning after 6 months of treatment at values similar to those recorded before beginning the orthodontic treatment. conclusions: presence of orthodontic appliances may produce a transitory increase of bacterial concentration (cfu/sample) and isolation rate of oral streptococci, returning to the level prior to the application of these devices after a time interval of several months.

TI  == effect of penicillin g every three weeks on oral microflora by penicillin resistant viridans streptococci.
AB  == background: benzathine penicillin g every 3 weeks is the standard protocol for secondary prophylaxis for recurrent rheumatic fever. objective: assess the effect of benzathine penicillin g on streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus oralis in patients with cardiac valvular disease due to rheumatic fever receiving secondary prophylaxis. methods: oral streptococci were evaluated before (baseline) and after 7 days (day 7) with benzathine penicillin g in 100 patients receiving routine secondary rheumatic fever prophylaxis. saliva samples were evaluated for  colony count and presence of s. sanguinis and s. oralis. chewing-stimulated saliva samples were serially diluted and plated onto both nonselective and selective 5% sheep blood agar containing penicillin g. the species were identified using conventional biochemical tests. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined with the etest. results: no statistical differences were found in the presence of s. sanguinis comparing baseline and day 7 (p = 0.62). however, the existing number of positive cultures of s. oralis on day 7 after benzathine penicillin g presented a significant increase compared to  baseline (p = 0.04). no statistical difference was found between baseline and day 7 concerning the number of s. sanguinis or s. oralis cfu/ml and median minimal inhibitory concentrations. conclusion: this study showed that benzathine penicillin g every 3 weeks did not change the colonization by s. sanguinis, but increased colonization of s. oralis on day 7 of administration. therefore, susceptibility of streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus oralis to penicillin  g was not modified during the penicillin g routine secondary rheumatic fever prophylaxis.

TI  == fibroblast adhesion and activation onto micro-machined titanium surfaces.
AB  == objectives: surface modifications performed at the neck of dental implants, in the manner of micro-grooved surfaces, can reduce fibrous tissue encapsulation and prevent bacterial colonization, thereby improving fibrointegration and the formation of a biological seal. however, the applied procedures are technically complex and/or time consuming methods. the aim of this study was to analyse the fibroblast behaviour on modified titanium surfaces obtained, applying a simple and low-cost method. material and methods: an array of titanium surfaces was obtained using a commercial computerized numerical control lathe, modifying the feed rate and the cutting depth. to elucidate the potential ability of the generated surfaces to activate connective tissue cells, a thorough gene (by real  time - qpcr) and protein (by western blot or zymography) expression and cellular  response characterization (cell morphology, cell adhesion and cell activation by  secreting extracellular matrix (ecm) components and their enzyme regulators) was  performed. results: micro-grooved surfaces have statistically significant differences in the groove's width (approximately 10, 50 and 100 mum) depending on the applied advancing fixed speed. field emission scanning electron microscopy images showed that fibroblasts oriented along the generated grooves, but they were only entirely accommodated on the wider grooves (>/=50 mum). micro-grooved surfaces exhibited an earlier cell attachment and activation, as seen by collagen ialpha1 and fibronectin deposition and activation of ecm remodelling enzymes, compared with the other surfaces. however, fibroblasts could remain in an activated state on narrower surfaces (<50 mum) at later stages. conclusions: the  use of micro-grooved surfaces could improve implant integration at the gingival site with respect to polished surfaces. micro-grooved surfaces enhance early fibroblast adhesion and activation, which could be critical for the formation of  a biological seal and finally promote tissue integration. surfaces with wider grooves (>/=50 mum) seem to be more appropriate than surfaces with narrow grooves (<50 mum), as fibroblasts could persist in an activated state on narrower grooved surfaces, increasing the probability of producing a fibrotic response.

TI  == comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == effect of streptococcus sanguinis/porphyromonas gingivalis single and combined biofilms upon platelet aggregation.
AB  == objective: to assess the effect of two oral bacteria streptococcus sanguinis and  porphyromonas gingivalis upon platelet aggregation. materials and methods: streptococcus sanguinis, p. gingivalis, s. sanguniis+p. gingivalis were added to  platelet-rich plasma and platelet aggregation measured using a platelet aggregometer. platelets were passed through a flow chamber with s. sanguinis, p.  gingivalis or a biofilm of s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis coated with saliva. platelet adhesion to the chamber was observed under a fluorescence microscope for 15min. the positive control was platelets treated with adrenaline; the negative control was platelets treated with phosphate-buffered saline. results: the mean (+/- s.e.) aggregation magnitude of s. sanguinis and p. gingivalis was 77.7+/-7.4% and 79.3+/-9.9%, respectively. the aggregation magnitude of s. sanguinis+p. gingivalis was 51.3+/-12.9%, which was significantly lower than that for s. sanguinis/p. gingivalis (p<0.05). in the flow chamber system, platelets adhered to s. sanguinis/p.gingivalis respectively within 3min, and reached a plateau at 5-15min. under the condition of the s. sanguinis- and p. gingivalis-saliva biofilm, platelet adhesion to the biofilm was significantly reduced at 5-15min (p<0.05). conclusions: in the static or dynamic flow system, platelets adhered to s. sanguinis or p. gingivalis. however, if s. sanguinis was  mixed with p. gingivalis, the aggregation magnitude (%) was significantly reduced.

TI  == connective tissue graft plus resin-modified glass ionomer restoration for the treatment of gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesions: microbiological and immunological results.
AB  == objectives: it was previously reported the clinical results of placing subgingival resin-modified glass ionomer restoration for treatment of gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesions. the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of this treatment on the subgingival biofilm and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) inflammatory markers. materials and methods: thirty-four patients presenting the combined defect were selected. the defects were treated with either connective tissue graft plus modified glass ionomer restoration (ctg+r) or with connective tissue graft only (ctg). evaluation included bleeding on probing and probing depth, 5 different bacteria targets in the subgingival plaque assessed at baseline, 45, and 180 days post treatments, and 9 inflammatory mediators were also assessed in the gcf. results: the levels of each target bacterium were similar during the entire period of evaluation (p > 0.05), both within and between groups. the highest levels among the studied species were observed for the bacterium associated with periodontal health. additionally, the levels of all cyto/chemokines analyzed were not statistically different between groups (p > 0.05). conclusion: within the limits of the present study, it can be concluded that the presence of subgingival restoration may not interfere with the subgingival microflora and with gcf inflammatory markers analyzed. clinical relevance: this approach usually leads to the placement of a subgingival restoration. there is a lack of information about the microbiological and immunological effects of this procedure. the results suggest that this combined approach may be considered as a treatment option for the lesion included in this study.

TI  == platelet activation by streptococcus sanguinis is accompanied by map kinase phosphorylation.
AB  == there is increasing interest in the role of infections in atherothrombotic conditions. in particular, bacteria, notably those of oral origin, have been shown to activate platelets using a variety of mechanisms. previous studies have  shown that s. sanguinis strain 2017-78 induces platelet aggregation which requires the presence of both vwf and igg. this aggregation is accompanied by the consecutive phosphorylation/desphosphorylation/rephosphorylation of several signalling proteins. the first two phases are thromboxane-dependent whereas the rephosphorylation phase is mediated by engagement of the alphaiibbeta3 integrin.  here signalling events, specifically the potential role of map kinases, associated with s. sanguinis strain 2017-78-induced platelet activation have been further examined using an immunoblotting approach. the addition of s. sanguinis strain 2017-78 caused a similar triphasic phosphorylation profile of the platelet map kinase erk2 to that seen with other phosphoproteins. pretreatment with aspirin or rgds did not affect 2017-78-induced erk2 phosphorylation or desphosphorylation but both inhibited the rephosphorylation phase. in contrast the level of 2017-78-induced platelet map kinase p38 phosphorylation remained at  an elevated level, and this was unaffected by aspirin. similarly, 2017-78-induced cpla(2) phosphorylation remained above basal levels during the aggregation process. the p38 inhibitor sb203580 inhibited s. sanguinis-induced aggregation with no effect on the phosphorylation of either p38 or cpla(2). thus the current  study demonstrates the activation of both the erk2 and p38 forms of map kinases,  and of cpla(2), in platelets stimulated with s. sanguinis strain 2017-78, and is  consistent with a role for erk2, but not for p38, in the cpla(2) phosphorylation  in response to s. sanguinis.

AB  == objective: although peri-implantitis has presented an ever increasing problem in  modern dentistry, satisfying therapeutic strategies or scientifically based treatment recommendations are still not available. the main object of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of six different topical antiseptics on three test microorganisms attached to titanium implant specimens.  material and methods: for biofilm formation, plane titan specimens were incubated either in candida albicans, streptococcus sanguinis, or staphylococcus epidermidis for 2h. the specimens were then treated with different topical antiseptics for 60s (sodium hypochlorite 1.0%, hydrogen peroxide 3.0%, chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2%, citric acid 40.0%, plax, or listerine) and with sterile saline as control. remaining vital fungi were quantified by means of a bioluminometric assay and the bacterial load and the viability of adhering s. epidermidis and s. sanguinis by live or dead cell labelling in combination with fluorescence microscopy. results: sodium hypochlorite was effective against all three species, whereas hydrogen peroxide was solely effective against c. albicans. chx and listerine showed antimicrobial activity against s. sanguinis and c. albicans and citric acid and plax against both tested bacteria. conclusions: none of the tested antimicrobial agents, except for sodium hypochlorite, showed a significant in vitro effect on all three test microbes. considering the possible toxicity of sodium hypochlorite, none of the tested - and so far widely used - antiseptics showed any broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect and could therefore not be recommended for the topical disinfection and detoxification of infected implant surfaces.

TI  == genome-wide essential gene identification in streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == a clear perception of gene essentiality in bacterial pathogens is pivotal for identifying drug targets to combat emergence of new pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, for synthetic biology, and for understanding the origins of life. we have constructed a comprehensive set of deletion mutants and  systematically identified a clearly defined set of essential genes for streptococcus sanguinis. our results were confirmed by growing s. sanguinis in minimal medium and by double-knockout of paralogous or isozyme genes. careful examination revealed that these essential genes were associated with only three basic categories of biological functions: maintenance of the cell envelope, energy production, and processing of genetic information. our finding was subsequently validated in two other pathogenic streptococcal species, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans and in two other gram-positive  pathogens, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. our analysis has thus led to a simplified model that permits reliable prediction of gene essentiality.

TI  == a comparative evaluation of the antibacterial efficacy of honey in vitro and antiplaque efficacy in a 4-day plaque regrowth model in vivo: preliminary results.
AB  == background: honey has a potent broad-spectrum antibacterial action that may make  it suitable for "anti-infective" treatment of periodontal disease. the aims of this study are as follows: 1) to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of honey against oral bacteria and compare the same with 0.2% chlorhexidine; and 2) to compare antiplaque efficacy in vivo with chlorhexidine. methods: the study was conducted in two parts. in the in vitro part, the inhibitory effects of three test agents, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, honey mouthwash, and saline, against six oral bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512  mug/ml were tested in duplicate. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was set as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. the in vivo part consisted of a double-masked parallel clinical trial based on a 4-day plaque regrowth model. sixty-six volunteers, 20 to 24 years of age, participated in the study, and the plaque scores were compared at baseline and at the end of 4 days. the kruskal-wallis test was used for significance, and the mann-whitney u test was used for pairwise comparison of the groups. the mean plaque scores were 1.77 +/- 0.86, 1.64 +/- 0.90, and 3.27 +/- 0.83 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. results: the honey mouthrinse effectively inhibited the six tested microorganisms. the chlorhexidine gluconate  rinse had the lowest mics compared with honey and saline rinses for all test species examined. the in vivo results revealed that plaque formation was inhibited/reduced by chlorhexidine and honey rinses. conclusion: honey has antibacterial action against tested oral microorganisms and also has antiplaque action.

TI  == novel bacterial lipoprotein structures conserved in low-gc content gram-positive  bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides inducing host innate immune responses are sensed by mammalian toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2). these bacterial lipoproteins are structurally divided into two groups, diacylated or triacylated lipoproteins, by  the absence or presence of an amide-linked fatty acid. the presence of diacylated lipoproteins has been predicted in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas based on the absence of one modification enzyme in their genomes; however, we recently determined triacylated structures in low-gc gram-positive staphylococcus aureus, raising questions about the actual lipoprotein structure in other low-gc content gram-positive bacteria. here, through intensive ms analyses, we identified a novel and unique bacterial lipoprotein structure containing an n-acyl-s-monoacyl-glyceryl-cysteine (named the lyso structure) from low-gc gram-positive enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus bulgaricus. two of the purified native lyso-form lipoproteins induced proinflammatory cytokine production from mice macrophages in a tlr2-dependent and tlr1-independent manner but with a different dependence on tlr6. additionally, two other new lipoprotein structures were identified. one is  the "n-acetyl" lipoprotein structure containing n-acetyl-s-diacyl-glyceryl-cysteine, which was found in five gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis. the n-acetyl lipoproteins induced the proinflammatory cytokines through the tlr2/6 heterodimer. the other was identified in a mycoplasma strain and is an unusual diacyl lipoprotein structure  containing two amino acids before the lipid-modified cysteine residue. taken together, our results suggest the existence of novel tlr2-stimulating lyso and n-acetyl forms of lipoproteins that are conserved in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and provide clear evidence for the presence of yet to be identified key  enzymes involved in the bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on the mechanical behavior of titanium dental implants.
AB  == purpose: this study sought to determine whether the mechanical properties of titanium dental implants changed after exposure to bacteria. materials and methods: two strains of bacteria (streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius) were used in the study. the adhesive properties of the two strains were investigated as follows. titanium implants were placed in bacteria broth, seeded with the two bacteria strains, and left in the broth for 1 or 3 months. another group of titanium implants was immersed in artificial saliva at 37 degrees c for 3 months. ten implants in each group were tested in 37 degrees c artificial saliva to evaluate their mechanical flexural strength and fatigue life. results: the bacterial cultures grew quickly on titanium surfaces. after 1  month of bacteria culture in vitro, the bacteria had produced corrosion pits on the titanium surfaces. after 3 months of bacterial culture, a 7% decrease in the  flexural strength of the implant samples and a decrease of 15% in the number of cycles to failure by fatigue were seen versus implants not exposed to bacteria. conclusions: these results demonstrate that, in physiologic conditions in vitro,  bacteria have the capacity to produce a pitting corrosion phenomenon on exposed titanium surfaces, leading to a significant deterioration in the mechanical properties of the implant. it is therefore logical to conclude that bacteria may  produce corrosion that reduces the useful life of dental implants.

AB  == oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. however, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. this report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. monoinfection biofilms were developed with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial  species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, okf4, for up to 24h. gro-1alpha, il1alpha, il-6, il-8, tgfalpha, fractalkine, mip-1alpha, and ip-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. p. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines,  except mip-1alpha. generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited gro-1alpha, tgfalpha, and fractalkine production, while f. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in il-1alpha, il-6, il-8, and ip-10. a. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of il-6, il-8 and ip-10. the oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. the results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.

TI  == potential infectious etiology of behcet's disease.
AB  == behcet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, and skin lesions. the cause of behcet's disease remains unknown, but epidemiologic findings suggest that an autoimmune process is triggered by an environmental agent in a genetically predisposed individual. an infectious agent could operate through molecular mimicry, and subsequently the disease could be perpetuated by an abnormal immune response to an autoantigen in the absence of ongoing infection. potentia bacterial are saccharomyces cerevisiae, mycobacteria, borrelia burgdorferi, helicobacter pylori, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and mycoplasma fermentans, but the most commonly investigated microorganism is streptococcus sanguinis. the relationship between streptococcal infections and behcet's disease is suggested by clinical observations that an unhygienic oral condition is frequently noted in the oral cavity of behcet's disease patients. several viral agents, including herpes simplex virus-1, hepatitis c virus, parvovirus b19, cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus and varicella zoster virus, may also have some role.

TI  == influence of specific amino acid side-chains on the antimicrobial activity and structure of bovine lactoferrampin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an 80 kda iron binding protein found in the secretory fluids of mammals and it plays a major role in host defence. an antimicrobial peptide, lactoferrampin, was identified through sequence analysis of bovine lactoferrin and its antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria and yeast species is well documented. in the present work, the contribution of specific amino acid  residues of lactoferrampin was examined to evaluate the role that they play in membrane binding and bilayer disruption. the structures of all the bovine lactoferrampin derivatives were examined with circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and their interactions with phospholipids were evaluated with differential scanning calorimetry and isothermal titration calorimetry techniques. from our results it is apparent that the amphipathic n-terminal helix anchors the peptide to membranes with trp 268 and phe 278 playing important roles in determining the strength of the interaction and for inducing peptide folding. in addition, the n-terminal helix capping residues (dli) increase the affinity for negatively charged vesicles and they mediate the  depth of membrane insertion. finally, the unique flexibility in the cationic c-terminal region of bovine lactoferrampin does not appear to be essential for the antimicrobial activity of the peptide.

TI  == the cariogenic characters of xylitol-resistant and xylitol-sensitive streptococcus mutans in biofilm formation with salivary bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus mutans metabolize carbohydrates, such as glucose and sucrose, to produce acid and enhance biofilm formation with the early colonizing bacteria to  induce dental caries. xylitol has been used as a reliable substitute for carbohydrate to inhibit the acid production of s. mutans. however, long-term xylitol consumption leads to the emergence of xylitol-resistance in s. mutans. the aim of this study was to investigate the cariogenic trait of xylitol-resistant (x(r)) s. mutans using biofilm formation and coaggregation of xylitol-sensitive (x(s)) and x(r) s. mutans with salivary bacteria and their glucosyltransferases expression. when x(s) or x(r) s. mutans were incubated in brain heart infusion broth with bacteria from human saliva, x(r)s. mutans exhibited reduction in biofilm formation in comparison to x(s) s. mutans. the coaggregation between x(r) s. mutans and s, gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis or s. sanguinis was less pronounced than that of x(s) s. mutans in the presence of sucrose. however, there was no difference in the coaggregation between x(r) and x(s) s. mutans in the sucrose-free condition. the level of gtfb and gtfc mrna expression of x(r) s. mutans was lower than that of x(s) s. mutans, whilst the level of gtfd mrna expression did not differ between the two strains. the reduction of biofilm formation in x(s) s. mutans due to decrease in glucosyltransferases expression suggests that x(r) s. mutans may be less cariogenic than x(s) s. mutans.

TI  == adherence to streptococci facilitates fusobacterium nucleatum integration into an oral microbial community.
AB  == the development of multispecies oral microbial communities involves complex intra- and interspecies interactions at various levels. the ability to adhere to  the resident bacteria or the biofilm matrix and overcome community resistance are among the key factors that determine whether a bacterium can integrate into a community. fusobacterium nucleatum is a prevalent gram-negative oral bacterial species that is able to adhere to a variety of oral microbes and has been implicated in playing an important role in the establishment of multispecies oral microbial community. however, the majority of experiments thus far has focused on the physical adherence between two species as measured by in vitro co-aggregation assays, while the community-based effects on the integration of f. nucleatum into multispecies microbial community remains to be investigated. in this study, we focus on community integration of f. nucleatum. we demonstrated using an established in vitro mice oral microbiota (o-mix) that the viability of f. nucleatum was significantly reduced upon addition to the o-mix due to cell contact-dependent induction of hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) production by oral community. interestingly, this inhibitory effect was significantly alleviated when f. nucleatum was allowed to adhere to its known interacting partner species  (such as streptococcus sanguinis) prior to addition. furthermore, this aggregate  formation-dependent protection was absent in the f. nucleatum mutant strain deltafn1526 that is unable to bind to a number of gram-positive species. more importantly, this protective effect was also observed during integration of f. nucleatum into a human salivary microbial community (s-mix). these results suggest that by adhering to other oral microbes, f. nucleatum is able to mask the surface components that are recognized by h(2)o(2) producing oral community members. this evasion strategy prevents detection by antagonistic oral bacteria and allows integration into the developing oral microbial community.

TI  == a five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  == background: oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. methodology/principal findings: in this study we used 385 k nimblegene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis). array hybridization was done with cdna from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. these probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude  the whole genes from the analysis. between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. the influence of streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on s. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. phenotypically, under the influence of s. mitis an increase in s.  mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media ph-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 s. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a s. mutans mono-species biofilm. several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general  and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. conclusions/significance: this new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. it may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

TI  == oral bacterial dna differ in their ability to induce inflammatory responses in human monocytic cell lines.
AB  == background: deoxyribonucleic acids (dna) of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas  gingivalis (pg) and tannerella forsythia, stimulate cytokine production in human  monocytic cells (thp-1) through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and nuclear factor-kappab signaling. fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria in periodontally diseased tissues and is reported to synergize with pg, enhancing the pathogenicity. we investigate inflammatory mediator production in thp-1 cells challenged with fn and streptococcus sanguinis (ss) dna, a non-pathogenic oral bacteria, and further assess whether cytokines triggered by whole pathogens or pg lipopolysaccharide (lps) are affected by tlr-9 signaling inhibitors (chloroquine). methods: thp-1 cells were stimulated with pg-dna (100 ng/mul), fn-dna (100 ng/mul), ss-dna (100 ng/mul), pg-lps (10 ng/mul), and heat-killed whole bacteria (multiplicity of infection, 1:100) for 16 hours with or without chloroquine pretreatment (10 mug/ml). interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. statistical analyses included analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using dunnett or tukey methods and paired t test. a value of p <0.05 was significant. results: inflammatory mediator levels were increased in response to all the stimuli with the exception of ss-dna (p <0.05). chloroquine pretreatment significantly decreased cytokine production from thp-1 cells with the exception of il-6 production triggered by whole fn and ss (p <0.05). conclusions: differences exist among oral bacterial dna in inducing immune responses. by altering the conditions in cytosolic compartments, we can interfere with cellular responses triggered by extracellular receptor activation. thus, alternative treatment approaches targeted to intracellular receptors might  be of benefit in controlling periodontal inflammation.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

AB  == objective: the antibacterial activity of casbane diterpene (cd) was evaluated in  vitro against streptococcus oralis, s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mitis and s. sanguinis. the viability of planktonic cells was analysed by susceptibility tests (mic and mbc) and antibiofilm action was assayed. methods: the minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (mic and mbc) of oral streptococcus were evaluated through microdilution tests. to assay antibiofilm activity, biofilms were generated on 96-wells polystyrene plates under the presence of cd and quantified by a crystal violet technique and colonies forming  units counting. results: the cd isolated from croton nepetaefolius showed antimicrobial effect on planktonic forms and biofilms of oral pathogens, with mic values of 62.5 mug/ml against streptococcus oralis and values between 125 and 500 mug/ml against s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mitis and s. sanguinis.  cd showed an inhibitory effect on s. mutans biofilm formation at 250 mug/ml, and  a decrease on viable cell of 94.28% compared to the normal biofilm growth. conclusions: the compound cd can be considered as a promising molecule for the treatment against oral pathogens responsible for dental biofilm.

TI  == synergistic interaction between candida albicans and commensal oral streptococci  in a novel in vitro mucosal model.
AB  == candida albicans is a commensal colonizer of the gastrointestinal tract of humans, where it coexists with highly diverse bacterial communities. it is not clear whether this interaction limits or promotes the potential of c. albicans to become an opportunistic pathogen. here we investigate the interaction between c.  albicans and three species of streptococci from the viridans group, which are ubiquitous and abundant oral commensal bacteria. the ability of c. albicans to form biofilms with streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, or streptococcus gordonii was investigated using flow cell devices that allow abiotic biofilm formation under salivary flow. in addition, we designed a novel flow cell system that allows mucosal biofilm formation under conditions that mimic the environment in the oral and esophageal mucosae. it was observed that c. albicans and streptococci formed a synergistic partnership where c. albicans promoted the ability of streptococci to form biofilms on abiotic surfaces or on the surface of an oral mucosa analogue. the increased ability of streptococci to  form biofilms in the presence of c. albicans could not be explained by a growth-stimulatory effect since the streptococci were unaffected in their growth  in planktonic coculture with c. albicans. conversely, the presence of streptococci increased the ability of c. albicans to invade organotypic models of the oral and esophageal mucosae under conditions of salivary flow. moreover, characterization of mucosal invasion by the biofilm microorganisms suggested that the esophageal mucosa is more permissive to invasion than the oral mucosa. in summary, c. albicans and commensal oral streptococci display a synergistic interaction with implications for the pathogenic potential of c. albicans in the  upper gastrointestinal tract.

AB  == the capsular polysaccharide (cps) of the important oral streptococcus streptococcus anginosus, which causes endocarditis, and the genes for its synthesis have not been clarified. in this study, we investigated the gene locus  required for cps synthesis in s. anginosus. southern hybridization using the cpse gene of the well-characterized bacterium s. agalactiae revealed that there is a similar gene in the genome of s. anginosus. by using the colony hybridization technique and inverse pcr, we isolated the cps synthesis (cps) genes of s. anginosus. this gene cluster consisted of genes containing typical regulatory genes, cpsa-d, and glycosyltransferase genes coding for glucose, rhamnose, n-acetylgalactosamine, and galactofuranose transferases. furthermore, we confirmed that the cps locus is required for cps synthesis using a mutant strain  with a defective cpse gene. the cps cluster was found to be located downstream the nrdg gene, which encodes ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase activator, as  is the case in other oral streptococci such as s. gordonii and s. sanguinis. however, the location of the gene cluster was different from those of s. pneumonia and s. agalactiae.

TI  == streptococcus sanguinis induces foam cell formation and cell death of macrophages in association with production of reactive oxygen species.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis, a normal inhabitant of the human oral cavity, is a common streptococcal species implicated in infective endocarditis. herein, we investigated the effects of infection with s. sanguinis on foam cell formation and cell death of macrophages. infection with s. sanguinis stimulated foam cell formation of thp-1, a human macrophage cell line. at a multiplicity of infection  >100, s. sanguinis-induced cell death of the macrophages. viable bacterial infection was required to trigger cell death because heat-inactivated s. sanguinis did not induce cell death. the production of cytokines interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha from macrophages was also stimulated during bacterial infection. inhibition of the production of reactive oxygen species (ros) resulted in reduced cell death, suggesting an association of ros with cell death. furthermore, s. sanguinis-induced cell death appeared to be  independent of activation of inflammasomes, because cleavage of procaspase-1 was  not evident in infected macrophages.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == the streptococcus sanguinis competence regulon is not required for infective endocarditis virulence in a rabbit model.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is an important component of dental plaque and a leading  cause of infective endocarditis. genetic competence in s. sanguinis requires a quorum sensing system encoded by the early comcde genes, as well as late genes controlled by the alternative sigma factor, comx. previous studies of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans have identified functions for the >100-gene com regulon in addition to dna uptake, including virulence. we investigated this possibility in s. sanguinis. strains deleted for the comcde or  comx master regulatory genes were created. using a rabbit endocarditis model in conjunction with a variety of virulence assays, we determined that both mutants possessed infectivity equivalent to that of a virulent control strain, and that measures of disease were similar in rabbits infected with each strain. these results suggest that the com regulon is not required for s. sanguinis infective endocarditis virulence in this model. we propose that the different roles of the  s. sanguinis, s. pneumoniae, and s. mutans com regulons in virulence can be understood in relation to the pathogenic mechanisms employed by each species.

TI  == antibiotic modulation of the plasminogen binding ability of viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the ability of viridans group streptococci to bind human plasminogen and its subsequent activation into plasmin may contribute to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis (ie) by leading to a decreased stability of the streptococcal vegetation and facilitating dehiscence of emboli. at levels greater than or equal to their mics, penicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid are efficacious in the treatment of streptococcal endocarditis. however, at sub-mics, antibiotics can modulate the expression of bacterial genes, including virulence-associated genes, which can have counterproductive effects on the treatment of endocarditis. the effects of 1/8x and 1/4x mics of penicillin, vancomycin, and linezolid on the plasminogen binding ability of ie isolates streptococcus mitis 881/956, streptococcus oralis 12601, and streptococcus sanguinis 12403 were assessed phenotypically and the expression of plasminogen receptors alpha-enolase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase of s. oralis 12601 when exposed to 1/4x mic of penicillin, was analyzed through quantitative reverse transcription (qrt)-pcr. the plasminogen binding ability of s. mitis 881/956 and s. sanguinis 12403 remained unaffected by exposure to sub-mics of all of the antibiotics tested, while that of s. oralis 12601 was significantly enhanced by all of the antibiotics tested at sub-mics. qrt-pcr analysis of s. oralis 12601 demonstrated an upregulation of the eno and gapdh genes, indicating  an overexpression of plasminogen receptors. these findings suggest that for some  endocarditis isolates, the effect of antibiotic sub-mics, in addition to a reduced antibacterial effect, may influence the clinical response to nonsurgical  therapy. it remains difficult to accurately predict isolate responses to sub-mic  antimicrobials since there appears to be interspecies variation.

TI  == in vitro effect of photodynamic therapy on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  and streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == new periodontal disease treatments are needed to prevent infection progression. photodynamic therapy (pdt) is one of the greatest pledges for this purpose. it involves the use of light of specific wavelength to activate a nontoxic photosensitizing agent in the presence of oxygen for eradication of target cells, and can be used for photokilling of microorganisms. this study evaluated in vitro the photodynamic effect of 0.01% toluidine blue-o (tbo) in combination with an algainp diode laser light source on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.)  and streptococcus sanguinis (s.s.). suspensions (2 ml) containing a.a. and s.s. at 1.5 x 108 cfu/ml concentration were prepared and divided into 3 groups: control group (no treatment), dye group (inoculum and tbo for 5 min) and dye/laser group (inoculum, tbo for 5 min and laser for 3 min). next, a dilution for subsequent subculture in 20 ml of trypic soy agar (a.a) and brucella agar (s.s.) in petri dishes (pourplate method) was done. incubation of a.a. in microaerophilia and s.s. in aerobiosis at 35oc for 48 h was performed for subsequent visual counting of cfu/ml. data were analyzed by one-way anova and tukey's hsd test at 5% significance level. for both strains, the control group showed a significantly higher (p<0.05) bacterial growth (1.5 x 108 cfu/ml), while the dye group presented no significant reduction (p>0.05) in the cfu counts. the  dye/laser group presented a significant decrease in the cfu counts (p<0.05) compared with the control group (61.53% for a.a. and 84.32% for s.s.). it may be  concluded that pdt was effective in reducing the numbers of a.a. and s.s. in vitro.

AB  == background: despite continued preventive efforts, dental caries remains the most  common disease of man. organic acids produced by microorganisms in dental plaque  play a crucial role for the development of carious lesions. during early stages of the pathogenetic process, repeated ph drops induce changes in microbial composition and favour the establishment of an increasingly acidogenic and aciduric microflora. the complex structure of dental biofilms, allowing for a multitude of different ecological environments in close proximity, remains largely unexplored. in this study, we designed a laboratory biofilm model that mimics the bacterial community present during early acidogenic stages of the caries process. we then performed a time-resolved microscopic analysis of the extracellular ph landscape at the interface between bacterial biofilm and underlying substrate. methodology/principal findings: strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and actinomyces naeslundii were employed in the model. biofilms were grown in flow channels that allowed for direct microscopic analysis of the biofilms in situ. the architecture and composition of the biofilms were analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy. both biofilm structure and composition were highly reproducible and showed similarity to in-vivo-grown dental plaque. we employed the ph-sensitive ratiometric probe c-snarf-4 to perform real-time microscopic analyses of the biofilm ph in response to salivary solutions containing glucose. anaerobic glycolysis in the model biofilms created a mildly acidic environment. decrease in ph in different areas of the biofilms varied, and distinct extracellular ph-microenvironments were conserved over several hours. conclusions/significance: the designed biofilm model represents a promising tool to determine the effect of potential therapeutic agents on biofilm growth, composition and extracellular ph. ratiometric ph analysis using c-snarf-4 gives detailed insight into the ph landscape of living biofilms and contributes to our general understanding of metabolic processes in in-vivo-grown bacterial biofilms.

TI  == mitis group streptococci express variable pilus islet 2 pili.
AB  == background: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguinis are members of the mitis group of streptococci and agents of oral biofilm, dental plaque and infective endocarditis, disease processes that involve bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host interactions. their close relative, the human pathogen s. pneumoniae uses pilus-islet 2 (pi-2)-encoded pili to facilitate adhesion to eukaryotic cells. methodology/principal findings: pi-2 pilus-encoding genetic islets were identified in s. oralis, s. mitis, and s. sanguinis, but were absent from other isolates of these species. the pi-2 islets resembled the genetic organization of the pi-2 islet of s. pneumoniae, but differed in the genes encoding the structural pilus proteins pita and pitb. two and three variants of pita (a pseudogene in s. pneumoniae) and pitb, respectively, were identified that showed approximately 20% difference in nucleotide as well as corresponding protein sequence. species-independent combinations of pita and pitb variants indicated prior intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer events. polyclonal antisera developed against pita and pitb of s. oralis type strain atcc35037 revealed that pi-2 pili in oral streptococci were composed of pita and  pitb. electronmicrographs showed pilus structures radiating >700 nm from the bacterial surface in the wild type strain, but not in an isogenic pi-2 deletion mutant. anti-pitb-antiserum only reacted with pili containing the same pitb variant, whereas anti-pita antiserum was cross-reactive with the other pita variant. electronic multilocus sequence analysis revealed that all pi-2-encoding  oral streptococci were closely-related and cluster with non-pi-2-encoding s. oralis strains. conclusions/significance: this is the first identification of pi-2 pili in mitis group oral streptococci. the findings provide a striking example of intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer. the pi-2 pilus diversity provides a possible key to link strain-specific bacterial interactions  and/or tissue tropisms with pathogenic traits in the mitis group streptococci.

TI  == canonical seca associates with an accessory secretory protein complex involved in biogenesis of a streptococcal serine-rich repeat glycoprotein.
AB  == fap1, a serine-rich repeat glycoprotein (srrp), is required for bacterial biofilm formation of streptococcus parasanguinis. fap1-like srrps are found in many gram-positive bacteria and have been implicated in bacterial fitness and virulence. a conserved five-gene cluster, secy2-gap1-gap2-gap3-seca2, located immediately downstream of fap1, is required for fap1 biogenesis. seca2, gap1, and gap3 encode three putative accessory sec proteins. seca2 mediates export of mature fap1, and gap1 and gap3 are required for fap1 biogenesis. interestingly, gap1 and gap3 mutants exhibited the same phenotype as a seca2 mutant, implying that gap1 and gap3 may interact with seca2 to mediate fap1 biogenesis. glutathione s-transferase pulldown experiments revealed a direct interaction between seca2, gap1, and gap3 in vitro. coimmunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the formation of a seca2-gap1-gap3 complex. homologues of seca2, gap1, and gap3 are conserved in many streptococci and staphylococci. the corresponding homologues from streptococcus agalactiae also interacted with each  other and formed a protein complex. furthermore, the gap1 homologues from s. agalactiae and streptococcus sanguinis rescued the fap1 defect in the gap1 mutant, indicating the functional conservation of the accessory sec complex. importantly, canonical seca interacted with the accessory sec protein complex, suggesting that the biogenesis of srrps mediated by the accessory sec system is linked to the canonical sec system.

TI  == thermal treatments modulate bacterial adhesion to dental enamel.
AB  == numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of laser-induced heat on demineralization of enamel; however, no studies have investigated the link between heat/laser-induced changes in physicochemical properties and bacterial adhesion. in this study, we investigated the effects of thermal treatment on surface properties of enamel such as hydrophobicity and zeta potential. bacterial adhesion to treated surfaces was characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy, and adhesion force was quantified by atomic force microscopy. the hydrophobicity of enamel increased after heating (p < 0.05), and the zeta potential of heated enamel became more negative than that of the control (p < 0.01). streptococcus oralis and s. mitis were more hydrophilic than s. sanguis, with more negative zeta potential (all p < 0.01). s. mitis and s. oralis occupied significantly less area on enamel after being heated (p < 0.05). heating reduced  the adhesion force of both s. mitis and s. oralis to enamel with or without saliva coating. reduction of adhesion force was statistically significant for s.  mitis (p < 0.01), whereas that of s. oralis was not statistically significant (p  > 0.05). heating did not affect the adhesion of s. sanguis with or without saliva coating. in conclusion, thermal treatment and photothermal/laser treatments may modulate the physicochemical properties of enamel, preventing the adhesion of some bacterial species.

TI  == clonal structure of streptococcus sanguinis strains isolated from endocarditis cases and the oral cavity.
AB  == a collection of streptococcus sanguinis strains from patients with endocarditis (n = 21) and from the oral cavity (n = 34) was subjected to a multi-locus sequence typing analysis using seven housekeeping genes, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase (carb), co/zn/cd efflux system component (czcd), d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase (ddl), dna polymerase iii (dnax), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (gdh), dna-directed rna polymerase, beta subunit (rpob) and superoxide dismutase (soda). the scheme was expanded by the inclusion of two the putative virulence genes, bacitracin-resistance protein (baca) and saliva-binding protein (ssab), to increase strain discrimination. extensive intra-species recombination was apparent in all genes but inter-species recombination was also apparent with strains apparently harbouring gdh and ddl from unidentified sources and one isolate harboured a soda allele apparently derived from streptococcus oralis. the recombination/mutation ratio for the concatenated housekeeping gene sequences was 1.67 (95% confidence limits 1.25-2.72) and for the two virulence genes the r/m ratio was 3.99 (95% confidence limits 1.61-8.72); recombination was the major driver for genetic variation. all isolates were distinct and the endocarditis strains did not form distinct sub-clusters when the data were analysed using clonalframe. these data support the widely held opinion that infecting s. sanguinis strains are opportunistic human pathogens.

TI  == the impact of three strains of oral bacteria on the surface and mechanical properties of a dental resin material.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if three strains of bacteria could impact the mechanical or surface properties of a dental resin material. resin material specimens were incubated at 37 degrees c in sterile saline, tryptic soy  broth supplemented with sucrose (tsbs), or tsbs inoculated with streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii, or streptococcus sanguis. the specimens were subjected to fourier transform infrared spectroscopy before and after incubation. the flexural strength test was performed once a week for 6 weeks. microhardness and scanning electron microscopy (sem) was performed on specimens at 1 and 6 weeks. differences in the area under the carbonyl peak were statistically significant for the specimens incubated in the media inoculated with either s. mutans or s. gordonii. to determine why s. sanguis did not produce changes as the other bacteria did, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, methacrylic acid, and triethylene glycol were added to bacterial cultures at increasing concentrations. both methacrylic acid and triethylene glycol reduced the number of colony-forming units of s. sanguis. specimens incubated in tsbs, saline or in culture with s. sanguis demonstrated a decrease in peak stress in week 1 of the flexure strength  test. sem demonstrated that surface topology changed for those specimens incubated in culture with s. mutans or s. gordonii. the changes in surface topology demonstrated here could contribute to the secondary caries and changes in esthetic properties seen clinically with the use of resin materials in dental  restorations.

TI  == influence of hyaluronic acid on bacterial and fungal species, including clinically relevant opportunistic pathogens.
AB  == hyaluronic acid (ha) has several clinical applications (aesthetic surgery, dermatology, orthopaedics and ophtalmology). following recent evidence, suggesting antimicrobial and antiviral properties for ha, we investigated its effects on 15 atcc strains, representative of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal species. the in vitro system employed allowed to assess optical density of broth cultures as a measure of microbial load in a time-dependent manner. the results showed that different microbial species and, sometimes, different strains belonging to the same species, are differently affected by ha. in particular, staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus mutans, two escherichia coli strains, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida glabrata and c. parapsilosis displayed a ha dose-dependent growth inhibition; no ha effects were detected in e. coli atcc 13768 and c. albicans; s. sanguinis was favoured by the highest ha dose. therefore, the influence of ha on bacteria and fungi warrants further studies aimed at better establishing its relevance in clinical applications.

TI  == the effects of titanium nitride-coating on the topographic and biological features of tps implant surfaces.
AB  == objectives: titanium nitride (tin) coating has been proposed as an adjunctive surface treatment aimed to increase the physico-mechanical and aesthetic properties of dental implants. in this study we investigated the surface characteristics of tin-coated titanium plasma sprayed (tin-tps) and uncoated titanium plasma sprayed (tps) surfaces and their biological features towards both primary human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bm-msc) and bacterial cultures. methods: 15 mmx1 mm tps and tin-tps disks (p.h.i. s.r.l., san vittore olona, milano, italy) were topographically analysed by confocal optical profilometry. primary human bm-msc were obtained from healthy donors, isolated and expanded. cells were seeded on the titanium disks and cell adhesion, proliferation, protein synthesis and osteoblastic differentiation in terms of alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin synthesis and extracellular mineralization, were evaluated. furthermore, adhesion and proliferation of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus sanguinis on both surfaces were also analysed. results: tin-tps disks showed a decreased roughness (about 50%, p < 0.05) and a decreased bacterial adhesion and proliferation compared to tps ones. no difference (p > 0.05) in terms of bm-msc adhesion, proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation between tps and tin-tps surfaces was found. conclusions: tin coating showed to modify the topographical characteristics of tps titanium surfaces and to significantly reduce bacterial adhesion and proliferation, although maintaining their biological affinity towards bone cell precursors.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on different root canal filling materials and sealers.
AB  == introduction: microbial adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation on endodontic root canal filling materials and sealers lead to survival of microorganisms in treated root canals and subsequently to endodontic treatment failures. the present study focused on initial microbial adhesion to different endodontic filling materials. methods: the following endodontic biomaterials were tested: ah-plus, tubli seal, gutta-percha, real seal se, endorez, apexit plus, guttaflow, and dentin. samples of each material were prepared. bovine dentin samples were used as a control. the initial adhesions of salivary bacteria as well as the subsequent single species were quantified by determination of colony-forming units (cfus) and visualized by scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy (clsm): enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, and prevotella nigrescens. results: initially adherent microorganisms could be detected and microscopically visualized on each of the materials tested. considering the values of the cfus and the covering grade as detected by clsm, there were significant differences among the materials. fewer bacteria tended to adhere to apexit plus, whereas real seal se and the widely used gutta-percha showed the highest number of adherent bacteria. this tendency was not detected for c. albicans. conclusions: endodontic microorganisms have a high affinity to root canal filling materials and sealers, especially to gutta-percha. because of this high level of bacterial adhesion, subsequent biofilm formation on these materials could be suggested as leading to the persistence of microorganisms in root canals.

TI  == a novel target-specific, salt-resistant antimicrobial peptide against the cariogenic pathogen streptococcus mutans.
AB  == in this study, we constructed and evaluated a target-specific, salt-resistant antimicrobial peptide (amp) that selectively targeted streptococcus mutans, a leading cariogenic pathogen. the rationale for creating such a peptide was based  on the addition of a targeting domain of s. mutans comc signaling peptide pheromone (csp) to a killing domain consisting of a portion of the marine-derived, broad-spectrum amp pleurocidin to generate a target-specific amp. here, we report the results of our assessment of such fusion peptides against s.  mutans and two closely related species. the results showed that nearly 95% of s.  mutans cells lost viability following exposure to fusion peptide imb-2 (5.65 mum) for 15 min. in contrast, only 20% of s. sanguinis or s. gordonii cells were killed following the same exposure. similar results were also observed in dual-species mixed cultures of s. mutans with s. sanguinis or s. gordonii. the peptide-guided killing was further confirmed in s. mutans biofilms and was shown  to be dose dependent. an s. mutans mutant defective in the csp receptor retained  60% survival following exposure to imb-2, suggesting that the targeted peptide predominantly bound to the csp receptor to mediate killing in the wild-type strain. our work confirmed that imb-2 retained its activity in the presence of physiological or higher salt concentrations. in particular, the fusion peptide showed a synergistic killing effect on s. mutans with a preventive dose of naf. in addition, imb-2 was relatively stable in the presence of saliva containing 1 mm edta and did not cause any hemolysis. we also found that replacement of serine-14 by histidine improved its activity at lower ph. because of its effectiveness, salt resistance, and minimal toxicity to host cells, this novel target-specific peptide shows promise for future development as an anticaries agent.

TI  == influence of gaseous ozone in peri-implantitis: bactericidal efficacy and cellular response. an in vitro study using titanium and zirconia.
AB  == dental implants are prone to bacterial colonization which may result in bone destruction and implant loss. treatments of peri-implant disease aim to reduce bacterial adherence while leaving the implant surface intact for attachment of bone-regenerating host cells. the aims of this study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of gaseous ozone on bacteria adhered to various titanium and zirconia surfaces and to evaluate adhesion of osteoblast-like mg-63 cells to  ozone-treated surfaces. saliva-coated titanium (sla and polished) and zirconia (acid etched and polished) disks served as substrates for the adherence of streptococcus sanguinis dsm20068 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc33277. the test specimens were treated with gaseous ozone (140 ppm; 33 ml/s) for 6 and 24 s. bacteria were resuspended using ultrasonication, serially diluted and cultured. mg-63 cell adhesion was analyzed with reference to cell attachment, morphology, spreading, and proliferation. surface topography as well as cell morphology of the test specimens were inspected by sem. the highest bacterial adherence was found on titanium sla whereas the other surfaces revealed 50-75% less adherent bacteria. p. gingivalis was eliminated by ozone from all surfaces within 24 s to  below the detection limit (>/=99.94% reduction). s. sanguinis was more resistant  and showed the highest reduction on zirconia substrates (>90% reduction). ozone treatment did not affect the surface structures of the test specimens and did not influence osteoblastic cell adhesion and proliferation negatively. titanium (polished) and zirconia (acid etched and polished) had a lower colonization potential and may be suitable material for implant abutments. gaseous ozone showed selective efficacy to reduce adherent bacteria on titanium and zirconia without affecting adhesion and proliferation of osteoblastic cells. this in vitro study may provide a solid basis for clinical studies on gaseous ozone treatment of peri-implantitis and revealed an essential base for sufficient tissue regeneration.

TI  == streptococcus sanguinis-induced cytokine release from platelets.
AB  == background: there is increasing evidence that both chronic and acute infections play a role in the development and progression of atherothrombotic disorders. one potential mechanism is the direct activation of platelets by bacteria. a wide range of bacterial species activate platelets through heterogeneous mechanisms. the oral micro-organism s. sanguinis stimulates platelet aggregation in vitro in  a strain-dependent manner, although there are no reports of associated cytokine production. objective: the aim of the present study was to determine whether platelet activation by s. sanguinis involved the release of pro-inflammatory and  immune modulating factors, and whether activation was enhanced by epinephrine. methods and results: four strains of s. sanguinis and one of s. gordonii stimulated the release of rantes, pf4, scd40l and pdgf-ab, whereas only one s. sanguinis strain caused the release of scd62p. epinephrine enhanced s. sanguinis-induced platelet aggregation and phosphorylation of phospholipase cgamma2 and erk, but inhibited rantes, pf4, scd40l and pdgf-ab release. wortmannin inhibited s. sanguinis-induced aggregation and release; however, only  aggregation was partially reversed by epinephrine. conclusions: the present study demonstrates that platelets respond to s. sanguinis with both prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory/immune-modulating responses. epinephrine, potentially released in response to infection and/or stress, can significantly enhance the prothrombotic response, thereby providing a putative link between bacteraemia and acute coronary events during stress. in contrast, epinephrine inhibited the pro-inflammatory/immune-modulating response by an undetermined mechanism.

TI  == initial bacterial adhesion on resin, titanium and zirconia in vitro.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the adhesion of initial colonizer, streptococcus sanguis, on resin, titanium and zirconia under the same surface polishing condition. materials and methods: specimens were prepared from z-250, cp-ti and 3y-tzp and polished with 1 microm diamond paste. after coating with saliva, each specimen was incubated with streptococcus sanguis. scanning electron microscope, crystal violet staining and measurement of fluorescence intensity resulting from resazurin reduction were performed for quantifying the bacterial adhesion. results: surface of resin composite was significantly rougher than that of titanium and zirconia, although all tested specimens are classified as smooth. the resin specimens showed lower value of contact angle compared with titanium and zirconia specimens, and had hydrophilic  surfaces. the result of scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that bound bacteria were more abundant on resin in comparison with titanium and zirconia. when total biofilm mass determined by crystal violet, absorbance value of resin was significantly higher than that of titanium or zirconia. the result of relative fluorescence intensities also demonstrated that the highest fluorescence intensity was found on the surface of resin. absorbance value and fluorescence intensity on titanium was not significantly different from those on zirconia. conclusion: resin specimens showed the roughest surface and have a significantly  higher susceptibility to adhere streptococcus sanguis than titanium and zirconia  when surfaces of each specimen were polished under same condition. there was no significant difference in bacteria adhesion between titanium and zirconia in vitro.

TI  == fibrin- and collagen-based matrices attenuate inflammatory and procoagulant responses in human endothelial cell cultures exposed to staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == infective endocarditis (ie) remains a serious complication after heart valve replacement. autologous valves constructed by matrix-based tissue engineering are under investigation to increase biocompatibility. the impact of the underlying matrix on the risk to develop ie is not known. the ie is characterized by bacterial adhesion and subsequent interactions of disseminating bacteria with endothelial cells (ecs) and monocytes, evoking endothelial proinflammatory and procoagulant activity, leading to heart valve destruction. in the current study,  we, therefore, have seeded human ecs on a fibrin versus collagen gel matrix and,  at confluence, infected them with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, and staphylococcus epidermidis. especially sta. aureus infected ecs grown on fibrin (4.2% of the inoculum) and collagen (3.7%) matrices, more than on ecs grown on noncoated plates (1.2%; p<0.01). this was associated with higher monocyte adhesion (61%; p<0.01 on fibrin and 43%; p<0.05 on collagen) versus control cultures (30%), even at comparable ec surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1. the collagen matrix attenuated the sta. aureus-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 expression  2.0-fold, compared with the noncoated control ecs. this reduction coincided with  a 4.2-5.0-fold reduction of the procoagulant activity, triggered in ecs grown on  noncoated wells, as a consequence of tissue factor (tf) expression by ecs, further stimulated by ec-bound monocytes. overall, moderate responses were seen on infection with str. sanguis and sta. epidermidis for both gel matrices. thus,  even when fibrin and collagen gel matrices equally increase bacterial adhesion, and subsequent monocyte adhesion to infected ecs, these matrices modulate ec responses to these stimuli, thus resulting in attenuated cytokine production and  attenuated adherent monocyte-dependent tf production by the ecs. further investigations will need to confirm whether also in vivo, ec-matrix interactions  can attenuate ec responses to bacteria and inflammatory cells to reduce ie at infected endovascular sites.

TI  == in situ analysis of multispecies biofilm formation on customized titanium surfaces.
AB  == many studies to identify surfaces that enhance the incorporation of dental implants into bone and soft-tissue have been undertaken previously. however, to succeed in the clinical situation, an implant surface must not support development of microbial biofilms with a pathogenic potential. as a first step in investigating this, we used two-species and three-species biofilm models with 16s ribosomal rna fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the effect of surface characteristics on biofilm formation  by species that can colonize titanium implants in vivo: streptococcus sanguinis,  actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus salivarius. surfaces blasted with al(2)  o(3) (s(a) = 1.0-2.0 mum) showed a seven-fold higher bacterial adhesion after 2 h than turned surfaces (s(a) = 0.18 mum) whereas porous surfaces, generated by anodic oxidation (s(a) = 0.4 mum), showed four-fold greater adhesion than turned  surfaces. hence, increased roughness promoted adhesion, most likely through protection of bacteria from shear forces. chemical modification of the blasted and oxidized surfaces by incorporation of ca(2+) ions reduced adhesion compared with the corresponding non-modified surfaces. after 14 h, biofilm growth occurred in the three-species model but not in the two-species consortium (containing s. sanguinis and a. naeslundii only). the biofilm biovolume on all surfaces was similar, suggesting that the influence of surface characteristics on adhesion was compensated for by biofilm development.

TI  == membrane-bound proteinase 3 and par2 mediate phagocytosis of non-opsonized bacteria in human neutrophils.
AB  == the molecular mechanisms underlying the non-opsonic phagocytosis of bacteria by neutrophils are poorly understood. we previously reported the efficient uptake of streptococcus sanguinis by human neutrophils in the absence of opsonins. to characterize the phagocytosis receptor, protein lysates from neutrophils and hl-60 cells were subjected to affinity chromatography using epoxy beads coated with s. sanguinis. denaturing electrophoresis of the eluted proteins and subsequent mass spectrometry revealed that one of the proteins eluted from neutrophils was proteinase 3 (pr3). enzymatic cleavage of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol linker of nb1, a co-receptor for membrane-bound pr3  (mpr3), significantly reduced the phagocytosis of s. sanguinis. in addition, the  neutralization of mpr3 with antibody reduced both binding and phagocytosis of s.  sanguinis. treatment of neutrophils with a serine proteinase inhibitor indicated  that protease activity is required for phagocytosis. thus, we studied whether protease-activated receptor 2 (par2) is involved in signal transmission from mpr3 during this process. indeed, neutralizing antibodies against par2 inhibited phagocytosis and s. sanguinis-induced calcium mobilization desensitized par2. furthermore, the phagocytosis of s. sanguinis and the concomitant activation of rho family gtpases were inhibited by the intracellular calcium chelator, bapta-am. collectively, mpr3 acts as a non-opsonic phagocytosis receptor for bacteria probably by activating par2 in neutrophils.

TI  == reduced-oxidized difference spectral analysis and chemiluminescence-based scatchard analysis demonstrate selective binding of myeloperoxidase to microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo), a microbicidal haloperoxidase of neutrophil leukocytes, was observed to selectively bind to bacteria. binding was quantified by dithionite-reduced minus oxidized (r-o) difference spectral analysis. escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed large mpo binding by r-o difference spectral analysis, whereas streptococcus sanguinis did not. for increased sensitivity, free and microbe-bound mpo and chloroperoxidase (cpo) activities were quantified by acid-optimum haloperoxidase-dependent chemiluminescence (cl) measurements, and these data were used for scatchard analysis. the mpo bound/free (b/f) cl ratio was 49.5 for p. aeruginosa, 14.6 for staphylococcus aureus, 2.8 for e. coli, 0.7 for candida albicans and 0.4 for s. sanguinis. by comparison, the cpo b/f cl ratio was 0.03 for p. aeruginosa, 0.09 for s. aureus, 0.31 for e.  coli, 0.18 for c. albicans and 0.16 for s. sanguinis. as a member of the lactic acid family of bacteria and a viridans streptococcus, s. sanguinis does not synthesize cytochromes and is catalase-negative. the metabolic products of s. sanguinis, i.e. lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, provide optimal acidity and substrate for mpo oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite. hypochlorite can react with organic substrates to yield dehydrogenated or chlorinated products, but when peroxide is not limiting, hypochlorite reacts with peroxide yielding singlet oxygen. the reactivity of hypochlorite is dependent on substrate availability. the microsecond half-life of electronically excited singlet oxygen restricts reactivity to within a radius of <0.25 microm; i.e. the reactivity of singlet oxygen is both substrate and half-life dependent. poor mpo binding provides protection and possibly competitive advantage to viridans streptococci.

TI  == quantification of vital adherent streptococcus sanguinis cells on protein-coated  titanium after disinfectant treatment.
AB  == the quantification of vital adherent bacteria is challenging, especially when efficacy of antimicrobial agents is to be evaluated. in this study three different methods were compared in order to quantify vital adherent streptococcus sanguinis cells after exposure to disinfectants. an anaerobic flow chamber model  accomplished initial adhesion of s. sanguinis on protein-coated titanium. effects of chlorhexidine, betadine(r), octenidol(r), and prontoral(r) were assessed by quantifying vital cells using live/dead baclight, conventional culturing and isothermal microcalorimetry (imc). results were analysed by kruskal-wallis one-way analysis of variance. live/dead staining revealed highest vital cell counts (p < 0.05) and demonstrated dose-dependent effect for all disinfectants. microcalorimetry showed time-delayed heat flow peaks that were proportioned to the remaining number of viable cells. over 48 h there was no difference in total  heat between treated and untreated samples (p > 0.05), indicating equivalent numbers of bacteria were created and disinfectants delayed growth but did not eliminate it. in conclusion, contrary to culturing, live/dead staining enables detection of cells that may be viable but non-cultivable. microcalorimetry allows unique evaluation of relative disinfectant effects by quantifying differences in  time delay of regrowth of remaining vital cells.

TI  == streptococcus sanguinis adhesion on titanium rough surfaces: effect of shot-blasting particles.
AB  == dental implant failure is commonly associated to dental plaque formation. this problem starts with bacterial colonization on implant surface upon implantation.  early colonizers (such as streptococcus sanguinis) play a key role on that process, because they attach directly to the surface and facilitate adhesion of later colonizers. surface treatments have been focused to improve osseointegration, where shot-blasting is one of the most used. however the effects on bacterial adhesion on that sort of surfaces have not been elucidated at all. a methodological procedure to test bacterial adherence to titanium shot-blasted surfaces (alumina and silicon carbide) by quantifying bacterial detached cells per area unit, was performed. in parallel, the surface properties  of samples (i.e., roughness and surface energy), were analyzed in order to assess the relationship between surface treatment and bacterial adhesion. rather than roughness, surface energy correlated to physicochemical properties of shot-blasted particles appears as critical factors for s. sanguinis adherence to  titanium surfaces.

AB  == scaffolds used in the field of tissue engineering should facilitate the adherence, spreading, and ingrowth of cells as well as prevent microbial adherence. for the first time, this study simultaneously deals with microbial and tissue cell adhesion to rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds. the cell growth  of human osteosarcoma cells (cal-72) over a time period of 3-11 days were examined on three scaffolds (plga, plla, plla-tcp) and compared to the adhesion of salivary microorganisms and representative germs of the oral flora (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, candida albicans, enterococcus  faecalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguinis). scanning electron microscopy (sem), cell proliferation measurements, and determination of the colony forming units (cfu) were performed. the cell proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp after 3, 7, and 11 days of cultivation were higher than on plga. on  day 3 the proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp, and on day 5 on plla-tcp, proved to be significantly higher compared to that of the control (culture plate). the strain which showed the most cfus on all of the investigated scaffolds was p. gingivalis, followed by e. faecalis. no significant cfu differences were determined examining p. gingivalis among the biomaterials. in contrast, e. faecalis was significantly more adherent to plga and plla compared to plla-tcp. the lowest cfu values were seen with c. albicans and p. nigrescens.  salivary born aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms adhered significantly more to  plga compared to plla-tcp. these results supported by sem point out the high potential of plla-tcp in the field of tissue engineering.

TI  == experimental alveolitis in rats: microbiological, acute phase response and histometric characterization of delayed alveolar healing.
AB  == the pathogenesis of alveolitis is not well known and therefore experimental situations that mimic some features of this disease should be developed. objective: in this study, the evolution of the experimentally induced infection in rat sockets is characterized, which leads to clinical signs of suppurative alveolitis with remarkable wound healing disturbs. material and methods: non-infected (group i) and experimentally infected sockets in rattus novergicus (group ii) were histometrically evaluated regarding the kinetics of alveolar healing. in addition, the characterization of the present bacteria in inoculation material and the serum levels of c-reactive protein (crp) were performed. the detected species were capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum ss nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, streptococcus anginosus, treponema socranskii and streptococcus sanguis. results: all experimentally infected rats developed suppurative alveolitis, showing higher levels of crp in comparison to those non-infected ones. furthermore, infected rats presented a significant delayed wound healing as measured by the histometric analysis (higher persistent  polymorphonuclear infiltrate and lower density of newly formed bone). conclusion: these findings indicate that rat sockets with experimentally induced infection produced higher levels of serum crp, showing the potential of disseminated infection and a disturb in the alveolar repair process in an interesting experimental model for alveolitis studies.

TI  == microbicidal efficacy of thiocyanate hydrogen peroxide after adding lactoperoxidase under saliva loading in the quantitative suspension test.
AB  == objective: as shown in the quantitative suspension test adding lactoperoxidase to a thiocyanate (scn(-)) hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) combination over the physiological saliva level has significant positive antimicrobial effects to a level of totally killing streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and candida albicans. the aim of this study was to evaluate this positive effect under human saliva loading. methods: the bactericidal and fungicidal effect of lactoperoxidase was evaluated in a quantitative suspension test by using two test mixtures of a 2.0% thiocyanate and 1.2% hydrogen peroxide solution, one without (group a) and one with (group b) lactoperoxidase under saliva loading. following  the quantitative suspension tests (en-13727/en-13624), the growth of surviving bacteria and fungi in a nutrient broth was measured. the exposure times were restricted to 1, 3, 5, and 15 min. all statistical analyses were carried out with spss 11.5. results: in the quantitative suspension test, the combination of thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide showed relatively low antimicrobial effectiveness on s. mutans, s. sanguinis, and c. albicans in the presence of human saliva at measured time points in comparison to the mixture with lactoperoxidase, which showed a high bactericidal activity within 15 min (s. mutans and s. sanguinis) and fungicidal activity within 3 min (c. albicans). conclusion: the antimicrobial effectiveness of the tested thiocyanate hydrogen peroxide combination was increased significantly by adding lactoperoxidase in the quantitative suspension test under human saliva loading.

AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the species distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and erythromycin-penicillin resistance mechanisms of viridans streptococci (vgs) isolates from blood cultures of adult patients with underlying diseases. fifty vgs blood culture isolates were screened for their antibiotic susceptibilities against penicillin g, erythromycin and tetracycline by e-test. clindamycin, cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, levofloxacin, linezolid and vancomycin  susceptibility were performed by broth microdilution method. erythromycin and penicillin resistance genotypes, ermb and mefa/e, pbp1a, pbp2b and pbp2x are amplified using pcr method. the clinical isolates included streptococcus mitis (n. 19), s.oralis (n. 13), s.sanguinis, s.parasanguinis (n. 6, each), s.salivarius, s.vestibularis (n. 2, each), s.constellatus, s.sobrinus (n. 1, each). the percentage resistance against erythromycin and penicillin was 36% and  30%, respectively. the genotypic carriage rate of erythromycin resistance genes were: 56% ermb, 28% mefe, 8% ermb+mefe. penicillin-resistant isolates carried pbp2b (33.3%) and pbp2x (20%) genes. twenty-four vgs isolates were recovered from patients with cancer. s.mitis and s.oralis predominated among patients with cancer who had erythromycin and penicillin resistance isolates. the importance of classical antimicrobial agents like penicillin and erythromycin warrants the continuous surveillance of invasive vgs isolates and can guide better treatment options especially in patients with underlying diseases.

TI  == [can dental problems have influence on difficulties in treating paranasal sinusitis in children?].
AB  == paranasal sinusitis is a condition that is treated by a general practitioner and  in case it fails it requires specialistic therapy. in most cases the inflammation is connected with nasal mucosa infection. however, in older children and adolescents sinusitis caused by spreading of tooth and gingiva inflammatory process can be an essential therapeutic and diagnostic problem. it is most often  connected with periapical lesions, complications following dental procedures and  oroantral fistula inflammation. inflammatory process originally concerns maxillary sinus, however, it often undergoes generalization and it affects all or most of sinuses unilaterally or bilaterally. in microbiology of odontogenic sinusitis the dominant bacteria are the bacteria typical for peridental lesions (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans and anaerobic bacteria). odontogenic sinusitis frequently causes life threatening complications that require heroic drug and surgical treatment. therapeutic and diagnostic problems are presented in case studies of 5 children aged from 10 to 17, who are treated in children's otolaryngology, audiology and phoniatrics clinic in lodz. there seems to be the need to emphasize the importance of thorough examination of oral cavity in all the children suffering from sinusitis, especially unilateral sinusitis. it is so essential on account of the gravity of  the problem and serious complications that accompany the conditions.

AB  == the diffusion of antibiotics in endocarditis vegetation bacterial masses has not  been described, although it may influence the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in endocarditis. the objective of this work was to assess the diffusion of ofloxacin in experimental endocarditis vegetation bacterial masses using synchrotron-radiation uv fluorescence microspectroscopy. streptococcal endocarditis was induced in 5 rabbits. three animals received an unique i.v. injection of 150 mg/kg ofloxacin, and 2 control rabbits were left untreated. two  fluorescence microscopes were coupled to a synchrotron beam for excitation at 275 nm. a spectral microscope collected fluorescence spectra between 285 and 550 nm.  a second, full field microscope was used with bandpass filters at 510-560 nm. spectra of ofloxacin-treated vegetations presented higher fluorescence between 390 and 540 nm than control. full field imaging showed that ofloxacin increased fluorescence between 510 and 560 nm. ofloxacin diffused into vegetation bacterial masses, although it accumulated in their immediate neighborhood. fluorescence images additionally suggested an ofloxacin concentration gradient between the vegetation peripheral and central areas. in conclusion, ofloxacin diffuses into vegetation bacterial masses, but it accumulates in their immediate neighborhood.  synchrotron radiation uv fluorescence microscopy is a new tool for assessment of  antibiotic diffusion in the endocarditis vegetation bacterial masses.

TI  == influence of surface roughness on streptococcal adhesion forces to composite resins.
AB  == objective: to determine streptococcal adhesion forces with composite resins with  different surface roughness. methods: polishing and grinding were applied to obtain smooth (roughness 20 nm), moderately rough (150 nm) and rough (350 nm) surfaces of two orthodontic, light-cured composites. adhesion forces between streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mutans and the composite surfaces were  measured using atomic force microscopy in absence or presence of a salivary conditioning film. initial adhesion forces were measured as well adhesion after 120 s of contact, as longer contact times are known to result in stronger adhesion forces ("bond-strengthening"). surface roughness in absence and presence of salivary conditioning films were compared using anova, while adhesion forces were subjected to a weibull analysis. results: initial adhesion forces in absence of a salivary conditioning film amounted between -0.7 and -0.9 nn for smooth composite resins and increased between -1.0 and -2.0 nn for the roughest surfaces. streptococcal adhesion forces after bond-strengthening were significantly stronger than upon initial contact, irrespective of the composite type. salivary conditioning films significantly decreased the surface roughness of the composites, as well as the streptococcal adhesion forces. yet, also in the presence of a conditioning film, rougher composite surfaces exerted stronger adhesion forces, irrespective of composite type or bacterial strain. conclusion:  streptococcal adhesion forces to orthodontic composite resins increase with increasing roughness of the composite surfaces. composite surface roughness less  affects adhesion forces with s. mutans than with s. sanguinis.

TI  == microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  == purpose: advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. a prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. patients and methods: this study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. results: upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. streptococcus and peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. on determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and  18.8% were resistant. coagulase-negative staphylococcus and staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. conclusion: analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region  and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.

TI  == selective killing of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans by ciprofloxacin during development of a dual species biofilm with streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == objectives: periodontal disease is associated with a pathogen-induced transition  to a chronic destructive inflammatory response. since commensals may either passively or actively contribute to immune homeostasis, therapies aimed at selectively reducing the competitive advantage of pathogens may be effective supplements to traditional methods. we developed an in vitro system to grow biofilms composed of the pathogen (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) and the commensal (streptococcus sanguinis). we used the biofilm model to determine the feasibility of selectively killing the pathogen using the fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin. design: biofilms were exposed to relevant ciprofloxacin doses during the first 24h of development, with subsequent removal of the ciprofloxacin for a 24h period. biofilm growth was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, crystal violet staining and dna abundance. results: exposure to 0.01mg/l or 0.5mg/l ciprofloxacin significantly reduced the microcolony size and  cell surface density of a. actinomycetemcomitans in the dual species biofilm over a 24h period whilst allowing uninhibited s. sanguinis biofilm formation. a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm development was insignificant over a subsequent 24h period after removal of the ciprofloxacin indicating that a. actinomycetemcomitans cells were killed. conclusions: a. actinomycetemcomitans residing in a dual species biofilm with the commensal, s. sanguinis can be selectively killed, or at least rendered metabolically inactive, by treatment with ciprofloxacin. the dual species biofilm model will be a useful tool for designing in vivo studies to determine the efficacy of selective killing agents as an adjunct treatment of localized aggressive forms of periodontal disease.

TI  == effects of compounds found in nidus vespae on the growth and cariogenic virulence factors of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == nidus vespae (honeycomb) is a kind of traditional chinese medicine that has been  demonstrated to inhibit the growth and acid-production of oral cariogenic bacteria. subsequent studies showed that the chloroform/methanol (chl/meoh) chemical extraction of nidus vespae was the most effective inhibitor of growth and acidogenicity of streptococcus mutans. in this study, we isolated the chemical compounds of the nidus vespae chl/meoh extraction, tested their antimicrobial activity against six cariogenic bacteria and further evaluated the  acid inhibition properties, anti-f-atpase activity and anti-ldh activity against  s. mutans. the isolated flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol, inhibited the growth of bacteria (s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus rhamnosus) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) ranging from 1 to 4 mg/ml and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) from 4 to 16 mg/ml. in addition, quercetin and kaempferol at sub-mic levels significantly inhibited acidogenicity and acidurity  of s. mutans cells. treated with the test agents, the f-atpase activity was reduced by 47.37% with 1mg/ml quercetin and by 49.66% with 0.5mg/ml kaempferol. the results showed that quercetin and kaempferol contained in chl/meoh extraction presented remarkably biological activity, suggesting that nidus vespae might be useful as a potential preventive and therapeutic agent in dental caries.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the microtopography and hydrophilicity of titanium (ti) substrates on initial oral biofilm formation. materials and methods: nine bacterial species belonging to the normal oral microbiota, including: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces israelii, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus sanguinis were tested on ti surfaces: pretreatment (pt [r(a) <0.2 mum]), acid-etched (a [r(a) <0.8 mum]), a modified to be hydrophilic (moda), sand-blasted/acid-etched (sla [r(a) =4 mum]), and hydrophilic sla (modsla). disks were incubated for 24 h in anaerobic conditions using a normal culture medium (cm) or human saliva (hs). the total counts of bacteria and the proportion of each bacterial species were analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: higher counts of bacteria were observed on all surfaces incubated with cm compared with the samples incubated with hs. pt, sla, and modsla exhibited higher numbers of attached bacteria in cm, whereas sla and modsla had a significant increase in bacterial adhesion in hs. the proportion of the species in the initial biofilms was also influenced by the surface properties and the media used: sla and modsla increased the proportion of species like a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. sanguinis in both media, while the adhesion of a. israelii and p. gingivalis on the same surfaces was affected in the presence of saliva. conclusions: the initial biofilm formation and composition were affected  by the microtopography and hydrophilicity of the surface and by the media used.

TI  == oxygen dependent pyruvate oxidase expression and production in streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize the oxygen dependent regulation of pyruvate oxidase (spxb) gene expression and protein production in streptococcus sanguinis (s. sanguinis). spxb is responsible for the generation of growth-inhibiting amounts of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) able to antagonize cariogenic streptococcus mutans (s. mutans). furthermore, the ecological consequence of h2o2 production was investigated in its self-inhibiting ability towards the producing strain. expression of spxb was determined with quantitative real-time rt-pcr and a fluorescent expression reporter strain. protein abundance  was investigated with flag epitope engineered in frame on the c-terminal end of spxb. self inhibition was tested with an antagonism plate assay. the expression and protein abundance decreased in cells grown under anaerobic conditions. s. sanguinis was resistant against its own produced h2o2, while cariogenic s. mutans was inhibited in its growth. the results suggest that s. sanguinis produces h2o2  as antimicrobial substance to inhibit susceptible niche competing species like s. mutans during initial biofilm formation, when oxygen availability allows for spxb expression and spx production.

TI  == the oral commensal, streptococcus gordonii, synergizes with tat protein to induce hiv-1 promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages.
AB  == trans-activator of transcription (tat) is an hiv-1 protein essential for viral replication. oral periodontopathogens (e.g. fusobacterium nucleatum) enhance hiv-1ltr promoter activation in monocytes/macrophages in absence of tat; however, some oral commensals fail to trigger this response. we sought to determine the effect of tat on hiv-1ltr promoter activation induced by the representative oral  commensal streptococcus gordonii in monocytes/macrophages. s. gordonii enhanced hiv-1ltr reactivation in thp89gfp (tat(+)), but not in bf24 (tat(-)) cells. interestingly, s. gordonii, but not streptococcus sanguinis enhanced hiv-1ltr activation in the presence of recombinant tat in bf24 cells. this response correlated with il-8 but not tnfalpha or il-6 production, and was abrogated by the nfkappab inhibitor bay 11-7082. kinetics of nfkappab-rela activation did not  explain the s. gordonii-induced hiv-1ltr activation in presence of tat. these results suggest that s. gordonii-induced hiv-1 reactivation in monocytes/macrophages is tat-dependent and appears to involve nfkappab activation.

TI  == novel model for multispecies biofilms that uses rigid gas-permeable lenses.
AB  == oral biofilms comprise complex multispecies consortia aided by specific inter- and intraspecies interactions occurring among commensals and pathogenic bacterial species. oral biofilms are primary initiating factors of periodontal disease, although complex multifactorial biological influences, including host cell responses, contribute to the individual outcome of the disease. to provide a system to study initial stages of interaction between oral biofilms and the host  cells that contribute to the disease process, we developed a novel in vitro model system to grow biofilms on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (rgpls), which enable oxygen to permeate through the lens material. bacterial species belonging  to early- and late-colonizing groups were successfully established as single- or  three-species biofilms, with each group comprising streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis; s. gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii, and fusobacterium nucleatum; or s. gordonii, f. nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. quantification of biofilm numbers by quantitative pcr (qpcr) revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of bacterial numbers in  single-species and multispecies biofilms. we evaluated cell-permeable conventional nucleic acid stains acridine orange, hexidium iodide, and hoechst 33258 and novel syto red, blue, and green fluorochromes for their effect on bacterial viability and fluorescence yield to allow visualization of the aggregates of individual bacterial species by confocal laser scanning microscopy  (clsm). substantial differences in the quantity and distribution of the species in the multispecies biofilms were identified. the specific features of these biofilms may help us better understand the role of various bacteria in local challenge of oral tissues.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == a new small molecule specifically inhibits the cariogenic bacterium streptococcus mutans in multispecies biofilms.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a major cariogenic bacterium. it has adapted to the biofilm lifestyle, which is essential for pathogenesis of dental caries. we aimed to identify small molecules that can inhibit cariogenic s. mutans and to discover lead structures that could give rise to therapeutics for dental caries. in this study, we screened a focused small-molecule library of 506 compounds. eight small molecules which inhibited s. mutans at a concentration of 4 mum or less but did not affect cell growth or biofilm formation of commensal bacteria, represented by streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii, in monospecies biofilms were  identified. the active compounds share similar structural properties, which are characterized by a 2-aminoimidazole (2-ai) or 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-abi) subunit. in multispecies biofilm models, the most active compound also inhibited  cell survival and biofilm formation of s. mutans but did not affect commensal streptococci. this inhibitor downregulated the expression of six biofilm-associated genes, ftf, pac, rela, comde, gbpb, and gtfb, in planktonic s. mutans cells, while it downregulated the expression of only ftf, pac, and rela in the biofilm cells of s. mutans. the most potent compound also inhibited production of two key adhesins of s. mutans, antigen i/ii and glucosyltransferase (gtf). however, the compound did not alter the expression of the corresponding genes in both s. sanguinis and s. gordonii, indicating that it possesses a selective inhibitory activity against s. mutans.

TI  == effect of nanoporous tio2 coating and anodized ca2+ modification of titanium surfaces on early microbial biofilm formation.
AB  == background: the soft tissue around dental implants forms a barrier between the oral environment and the peri-implant bone and a crucial factor for long-term success of therapy is development of a good abutment/soft-tissue seal. sol-gel derived nanoporous tio2 coatings have been shown to enhance soft-tissue attachment but their effect on adhesion and biofilm formation by oral bacteria is unknown. methods: we have investigated how the properties of surfaces that may be used on abutments: turned titanium, sol-gel nanoporous tio2 coated surfaces and anodized ca2+ modified surfaces, affect biofilm formation by two early colonizers of the oral cavity: streptococcus sanguinis and actinomyces naeslundii. the bacteria were detected using 16s rrna fluorescence in situ hybridization together with confocal laser scanning microscopy. results: interferometry and atomic force microscopy revealed all the surfaces to be smooth (sa</=0.22 mum). incubation with a consortium of s. sanguinis and a. naeslundii showed no differences in adhesion between the surfaces over 2 hours. after 14 hours, the level of biofilm  growth was low and again, no differences between the surfaces were seen. the presence of saliva increased the biofilm biovolume of s. sanguinis and a. naeslundii ten-fold compared to when saliva was absent and this was due to increased adhesion rather than biofilm growth. conclusions: nano-topographical modification of smooth titanium surfaces had no effect on adhesion or early biofilm formation by s. sanguinis and a. naeslundii as compared to turned surfaces or those treated with anodic oxidation in the presence of ca2+. the presence of saliva led to a significantly greater biofilm biovolume but no significant differences were seen between the test surfaces. these data thus suggest that modification with sol-gel derived nanoporous tio2, which has been shown to improve osseointegration and soft-tissue healing in vivo, does not cause greater biofilm formation by the two oral commensal species tested than the other surfaces.

AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is an oral commensal bacterium and endogenous pathogen in the blood, which is generally naturally competent to take up extracellular dna. regarded as a stress response, competence development enables s. sanguinis to acquire new genetic material. the sequenced reference strain sk36 encodes and expresses the genes required for competence (com) and uptake of dna. isolated from blood cultures of a confirmed case of infective endocarditis, strain 133-79  encodes all necessary com genes but is not transformable under conditions permissive for competence development in sk36. using synthetic competence-stimulating peptides (scsp) based on sequences of sk36 and 133-79 comc, both strains developed competence at similar frequencies in cross-transformation experiments. furthermore, downstream response pathways are similar in strains sk36 and 133-79 because platelet aggregation and biofilm formation appeared unaffected by csp. collectively, the data indicate that strains sk36 and 133-79 respond to csp similarly, strongly suggesting that endogenous production or release of csp from 133-79 is impaired.

AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is a major component of the oral flora and an important cause of infective endocarditis. although s. sanguinis is naturally competent, genome sequencing has suggested significant differences in the s. sanguinis competence system relative to those of other streptococci. an s. sanguinis mutant possessing an in-frame deletion in the comc gene, which encodes competence-stimulating peptide (csp), was created. addition of synthetic csp induced competence in this strain. gene expression in this strain was monitored by microarray analysis at multiple time-points from 2.5 to 30 min after csp addition, and verified by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. over 200 genes were identified whose expression was altered at least two-fold in at least one time point, with the majority upregulated. the 'late' response was typical of that seen in previous studies. however, comparison of the 'early' response in s. sanguinis with that of other oral streptococci revealed unexpected differences with regard to the number of genes induced, the nature of  those genes, and their putative upstream regulatory sequences. streptococcus sanguinis possesses a comparatively limited early response, which may define a minimal streptococcal competence regulatory circuit.

TI  == comparison of ultraviolet light-induced photocatalytic bactericidal effect on modified titanium implant surfaces.
AB  == purpose: titanium dioxide (tio2), a photocatalyst, is known to decompose various  organic compounds under ultraviolet (uv) illumination by generating various radicals, which is useful for killing bacteria. the purpose of the present study  was to evaluate the photocatalytic bactericidal effects of variously treated titanium surfaces on streptococcus sanguinis sl1. materials and methods: specimens were fabricated from grade 4 commercially pure titanium, 10 mm in diameter and 2 mm in thickness. three different surfaces were prepared: anodized  (ao) at 270 v, heat-treated (ht), and machined (ma). surface analysis was performed using confocal laser scanning microscope, scanning electron microscopy, and thin-film x-ray diffractometry. the antibacterial activities were assessed by comparing adhesion and survival rates of s sanguinis on various surfaces under uv illumination. results: the ao surface was rougher than the ht and ma surfaces. the ao surface showed tio2 peaks of anatase structure, while the ht surface showed tio2 peaks of rutile structure in x-ray diffractometry. ht and ao surfaces showed significantly decreased bacterial adhesion under uv illumination (ao and ht > control, ao > ma). in addition, bacterial adhesion decreased more significantly with extended uv illumination time. with respect to survival rates  of bacteria, ao and ht showed a significant reduction over time compared to ma. the photocatalytic bactericidal effect was maximal on the ao titanium, followed by ht and ma. conclusions: the photo-induced bactericidal efficacy of tio2 films  is dependent on their surface characteristics.

TI  == short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: this study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. methods: the short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (c1), acetic acid (c2), propionic acid (c3), butyric acid (c4), isobutyric acid (c4), isovaleric acid (c5), hexanoic acid (c6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (c8), capric acid (c10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (c14), palmitic acid (c16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. results: the data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared  related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. as a group the fatty acids were much less effective against c. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive  against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. conclusions: the results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (scfas), medium-chain fatty acids (mcfas), long-chain fatty acids (lcfas) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. first, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == influence of salvadora persica (miswak) extract on physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement.
AB  == aim: to investigate physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement (gic) combined with salvadora persica extract (spe). methods: spe was added to gic (fuji ix) in concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4% w/w. the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength were measured at 1 h, 24 h and 7 days. the antimicrobial effect was tested in agar dilution assay in blood agar plates with  candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius and actinomyces naeslundii as test organisms. gic containing 5% chlorhexidine served as positive control. results: significant differences were found for the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength as a result of adding spe to gic (p<0.05). gic with 2 or 4 % spe was significantly weaker than the gic control, while gic with 1% spe was not different from the control. the mean values for the 4% spe-containing specimens and the gic control group ranged from 108.7mpa to 141.1mpa for cs and from 8.2mpa to 12.5mpa for dts. the 1% spe-containing specimens were not different in physical properties compared to the control gic specimens; the 2% spe-containing  specimens were statistically slightly less strong (p<0.05), but within an acceptable range. as compared with pure gic the antimicrobial properties of the spe-containing specimens were increased significantly (p<0.01). it has been found up to a 2-fold increased inhibition compared to the gic with increasing concentrations of spe. for most microorganisms tested the spe group inhibited less than chlorhexidine, but significantly better than pure gic (p<0.01). conclusion: spe could be a promising natural material as an additive to gics. further studies should include in vivo tests and other antimicrobial and physical properties of this combination.

TI  == antimicrobial and anti-adhesive potential of a biosurfactant rufisan produced by  candida lipolytica ucp 0988.
AB  == in the last years, researches developed with biosurfactants for application in the medical area have been revealing the promising biological activities of these biomolecules. in this work the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of a biosurfactant rufisan isolated from the yeast candida lipolytica ucp 0988, growth in a medium supplemented with ground nut refinery residue was determined against  several microorganisms. the biosurfactant was able to reduce the water surface tension from 70 to 25.3 mn/m and showed a critical micelle concentration (cmc) of 0.03%. the biosurfactant was isolated after 72 h of fermentation and was tested in concentrations varying from 0.75 to 12 mg/l. the highest antimicrobial activities were observed against streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus mutans,  streptococcus mutans ns, streptococcus mutans hg, streptococcus sanguis 12, streptococcus oralis j22 at a concentration superior to the biosurfactant critical micelle concentration. moreover, the biosurfactant showed anti-adhesive  activity against most of the microorganisms tested. as far as we know, this is the first compilation of data on antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities of a  biosurfactant obtained from a candida strain against such a broad group of microorganisms. the results obtained in this work showed that the biosurfactant from c. lipolytica is a potential antimicrobial and/or anti-adhesive agent for several biomedical applications.

TI  == pili of oral streptococcus sanguinis bind to salivary amylase and promote the biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is a member of oral streptococci and one of the most abundant species found in oral biofilm called dental plaque. colonization of the  oral streptococci on the tooth surface depends on the adhesion of bacteria to salivary components adsorbed to the tooth surface. recently, we identified unique cell surface long filamentous structures named pili in this species. herein, we investigated the role of s. sanguinis pili in biofilm formation. we found that pili-deficient mutant, in which the genes encoding the three pilus proteins pila, pilb and pilc have been deleted, showed an impaired bacterial accumulation on saliva-coated surfaces. confocal microscopic observations suggested that the mutant was incapable of producing typical three-dimensional layer of biofilm. ligand blot analysis showed that the ancillary pilus proteins pilb and pilc bound to human whole saliva. additional analysis demonstrated that pilc bound to multiple salivary components, and one of which was found to be salivary alpha-amylase. these results indicate that pilus proteins are members of saliva-binding proteins of oral s. sanguinis, and suggest the involvement of pili in its colonization on saliva-coated tooth surfaces and in the human oral cavity.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.

TI  == an antimicrobial effect from silver-coated toothbrush heads.
AB  == purpose: to examine the antimicrobial effect of silver-coated toothbrush heads in vitro. methods: comparisons were made between 62 silver-coated and 62 non-coated  toothbrush heads which were contaminated by different standardized microbial suspensions. the following microorganisms were investigated: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus casei and candida albicans. for cultivation of the microorganisms as well as for the subsequent determination of the colony forming units (cfus), columbia blood agar plates or sabouraud agar were used. the cycle of daily toothbrushing was imitated by rinsing the brushes with 200 ml sterile tap water to reduce the number of microorganisms and the brushes were then placed upright to allow drying overnight. colony counts were done initially (time 0) and again at 20 hours. the rinsing fluid was also examined in order to determine the decrease of microorganisms due to this step. all experiments were done twice and  the means were calculated and statistically evaluated. results: there was no significant reduction in cfus by silver-coated toothbrushes (p > 0.05) for all of the microorganisms tested. on the contrary, the colony counts for s. sanguis (p = 0.02) and c. albicans (p = 0.01) were significantly higher on silver-coated toothbrushes compared to the controls. silver-coating in the current form did not improve any antimicrobial effects against residual bacteria present on the toothbrush head.

TI  == identification of different bacterial species in biofilms using confocal raman microscopy.
AB  == confocal raman microspectroscopy is used to discriminate between different species of bacteria grown in biofilms. tests are performed using two bacterial species, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mutans, which are major components of oral plaque and of particular interest due to their association with healthy and cariogenic plaque, respectively. dehydrated biofilms of these species are studied as a simplified model of dental plaque. a prediction model based on principal component analysis and logistic regression is calibrated using pure biofilms of each species and validated on pure biofilms grown months later,  achieving 96% accuracy in prospective classification. when biofilms of the two species are partially mixed together, raman-based identifications are achieved within approximately 2 mum of the boundaries between species with 97% accuracy. this combination of spatial resolution and predication accuracy should be suitable for forming images of species distributions within intact two-species biofilms.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == prevalence of five biofilm-related oral streptococci species from plaque.
AB  == objective: to examine the prevalence of five oral streptococci species of severe  early childhood caries (s-ecc) and caries-free (cf) groups. study design: supra gingival plaque samples were obtainedfrom 198 thai children with ages ranging from one to six years old eighty-seven subjects had no caries (dmft=0), and 111 had s-ecc. after dna extraction, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and s. gordonii were identified by standard pcr using species-specific primers. statistical analysis determined the differences among prevalence rates of each species using pearson chi-square test. the relationship among dmft score, age, sex and caries status within each group was analyzed by logistical regression (p  < or = 0.05). results: sex was not correlated with any of the species detected in both groups (mean age =3.09, mean +/- sd of dmft = 11.04 +/- 7.89). s. mutans was found at greatest prevalence in both groups followed by s. oralis. s. gordonii was detected at a high prevalence, but s. sobrinus and s. sanguinis were lower in s-ecc when compared with those from the cf group. conclusion: s. mutans was associated significantly with s-ecc (p < or = 0.05). caries prevalence was highest (56.5%) in subjects infected by s. mutans alone. s. sanguinis prevalence  was higher in the cf group, but not statiscally different. infection with ms did  not show higher caries prevalence.

TI  == novel magnesium phosphate cements with high early strength and antibacterial properties.
AB  == magnesium phosphate cements (mpcs) have been extensively used as fast setting repair cements in civil engineering. they have properties that are also relevant  to biomedical applications, such as fast setting, early strength acquisition and  adhesive properties. however, there are some aspects that should be improved before they can be used in the human body, namely their highly exothermic setting reaction and the release of potentially harmful ammonia or ammonium ions. in this paper a new family of mpcs was explored as candidate biomaterials for hard tissue applications. the cements were prepared by mixing magnesium oxide (mgo) with either sodium dihydrogen phosphate (nah(2)po(4)) or ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (nh(4)h(2)po(4)), or an equimolar mixture of both. the exothermia and setting kinetics of the new cement formulations were tailored to comply with clinical requirements by adjusting the granularity of the phosphate salt and by using sodium borate as a retardant. the ammonium-containing mpc resulted in struvite (mgnh(4)po(4).6h(2)o) as the major reaction product, whereas the mpc prepared with sodium dihydrogen phosphate resulted in an amorphous product. unreacted magnesium oxide was found in all the formulations. the mpcs studied showed early  compressive strengths substantially higher than that of apatitic calcium phosphate cements. the na-containing mpcs were shown to have antibacterial activity against streptococcus sanguinis, which was attributed to the alkaline ph developed during the setting reaction.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate female camels affected with ovarian hydrobursitis (n = 31) for hematological and biochemical findings and for bacterial and protozoal infections. blood samples were obtained and surgical ablation of the affected bursa was performed. bursal fluid, follicular fluid, and serum were subjected to hormonal and biochemical analyses. bursal fluids were cultured and colonies were identified using biomerieux vitek two compact system.  passive haemagglutination test was used for detection of trypanosoma evansi. indirect elisa technique was carried out for detection of anti-hydatid cysts anti-bodies. neutrophilia was found in the affected animals (p = 0.01) with tendencies for monocytosis (p = 0.06) and eosinophelia (p = 0.05). bursal fluid had a tendency for high estradiol-17beta concentration compared to blood serum (p = 0.07). progesterone and cholesterol concentrations were similar in bursal fluid, follicular fluid and serum. total protein, phosphorus, and magnesium concentrations were greater (p < 0.05) in the bursal fluid than in serum. oligella urethralis, alloiococcus otitis, granulicatella adicens, escherichia coli, sphingobacterium thalpophilum, streptococcus sanguinis, aeromonas salmonicida, pseudomonas stutzeri, staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus hominis, and rhizobium radiobacter were isolated from 46.7% of bursal fluids. t.  evansi was positive in 9.7% of cases. none were positive for hydatid cyst. accordingly, we suggest that the ovarian hydrobursitis syndrome is initially an inflammatory process and the accumulated bursal fluid is partially originated from follicular fluid.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the essential oil from rosmarinus officinalis and its major components against oral pathogens.
AB  == the essential oil of rosmarinus officinalis l. (rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. the rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and  beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). the antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. the essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. in the  present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil.  among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen s. mitis was the most susceptible and e. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. this is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.

TI  == anticariogenic properties of ent-pimarane diterpenes obtained by microbial transformation.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising mic values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug ml(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius,  s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent s. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). the curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a  significant reduction in the time necessary for killing s. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. however, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. in conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

AB  == background: post-transcriptional regulation by small rnas (srnas) in bacteria is  now recognized as a wide-spread regulatory mechanism modulating a variety of physiological responses including virulence. in streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen, the first srnas to be described were found in the regulon of the ciarh two-component regulatory system. five of these srnas were detected and designated csrnas for cia-dependent small rnas. ciarh pleiotropically affects beta-lactam resistance, autolysis, virulence, and competence development by yet to be defined molecular mechanisms. since ciarh is  highly conserved among streptococci, it is of interest to determine if csrnas are also included in the ciarh regulon in this group of organisms consisting of commensal as well as pathogenic species. knowledge on the participation of csrnas in ciarh-dependent regulatory events will be the key to define the physiological  role of this important control system. results: genes for csrnas were predicted in streptococcal genomes and data base entries other than s. pneumoniae by searching for ciar-activated promoters located in intergenic regions that are followed by a transcriptional terminator. 61 different candidate genes were obtained specifying csrnas ranging in size from 51 to 202 nt. comparing these genes among each other revealed 40 different csrna types. all streptococcal genomes harbored csrna genes, their numbers varying between two and six. to validate these predictions, s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis were subjected  to csrna-specific northern blot analysis. in addition, a csrna gene from s. thermophilus plasmid pst0 introduced into s. pneumoniae was also tested. each of  the csrnas was detected on these blots and showed the anticipated sizes. thus, the method applied here is able to predict csrnas with high precision. conclusions: the results of this study strongly suggest that genes for small non-coding rnas, csrnas, are part of the regulon of the two-component regulatory  system ciarh in all streptococci.

TI  == antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of two novel cross-linking antibacterial  monomers on oral pathogens.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of two novel cross-linking antibacterial monomers, 2-methacryloxylethyl dodecyl methyl ammonium bromide (mae-db) and 2-methacryloxylethyl hexadecyl methyl ammonium bromide (mae-hb) were tested in this study. design: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of unpolymerized mae-db and mae-hb against eight strains of oral bacteria were tested using a broth dilution test. time-kill determinations were performed to examine the kinetics of unpolymerized mae-db and mae-hb against streptococcus mutans ua159 and streptococcus sanguinis atcc6715. bacterial morphology was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (fe-sem). the cytotoxicity of unpolymerized two new monomers and bis-gma on the human gingival  fibroblast cell line h2620 was assessed using a methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. results: unpolymerized mae-db and mae-hb showed strong bactericidal activity against oral bacteria. the mbc value of mae-db ranged from 12.2 to 24.4mug/ml and the mbc value of mae-hb ranged from 6.2 to 48.8mug/ml. time-kill determinations indicated that unpolymerized mae-db and mae-hb had rapid killing effects against s. mutans ua159 and s. sanguinis atcc6715 at the concentration of 4x mbc. the fe-sem observation showed that mae-db and mae-hb could disturb the integrity of bacteria and cause lysis of bacterial cells. the median lethal concentration values on human gingival fibroblast for both monomers were between  10 and 20mug/ml, and greater than that of bis-gma. conclusions: unpolymerized mae-db and mae-hb monomers had strong bactericidal activity against eight strains of oral bacteria. their cytotoxicities were less than that of bis-gma.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

TI  == behcet's disease (adamantiades-behcet's disease).
AB  == adamantiades-behcet's disease (abd) is characterized by starting with oral aphthous ulceration and developing of the systemic involvements. the pathogenesis of abd is closely correlated with the genetic factors and the triggering factors  which acquire delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction against oral streptococci mediated by il-12 cytokine family. hla-b51 is associated in more than 60% of the  patients and its restricted cd8+ t cell response is clearly correlated with the target tissues. bes-1 gene encoded partial s. sanguinis genome which is highly homologous with retinal protein, and 65 kd heat shock protein (hsp-65) released from streptococci is playing an important role with human hsp-60 in the pathogenesis of abd. although hsp-65/60 has homologies with the respective t cell epitope, it stimulates peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) from abd patients. on the other hand, some peptides of hsp-65 were found to reduce il-8 and il-12 production from pbmcs of abd patients in active stage.

TI  == catabolite control protein a controls hydrogen peroxide production and cell death in streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is a commensal oral bacterium producing hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) that is dependent on pyruvate oxidase (spx) activity. in addition to its well-known role in bacterial antagonism during interspecies competition, h(2)o(2) causes cell death in about 10% of the s. sanguinis population. as a consequence of h(2)o(2)-induced cell death, largely intact chromosomal dna is released into the environment. this extracellular dna (edna) contributes to the self-aggregation phenotype under aerobic conditions. to further investigate the regulation of spx gene expression, we assessed the role of catabolite control protein a (ccpa) in spx expression control. we report here that ccpa represses spx expression. an isogenic deltaccpa mutant showed elevated spx expression, increased spx abundance, and h(2)o(2) production, whereas the wild type did not respond with altered spx expression in the presence of glucose and other carbohydrates. since h(2)o(2) is directly involved in the release of edna and bacterial cell death, the presented data suggest that ccpa is a central control element in this important developmental process in s. sanguinis.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == investigation of supragingival plaque microbiota in different caries status of chinese preschool children by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == this study aimed to detect differences in the richness of total supragingival plaque microbiota as well as the species composition of oral streptococci involved in the different stages of dental caries. forty-five plaque samples were collected from caries-moderate (cm, 4 </= dmfs </= 6), caries-susceptible (cs, dmfs >/= 10), and age-matched caries-free children separately. total dna was isolated directly from each sample, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analyses using universal and primers specific for oral streptococci were carried out. using 16s rdna pcr-dgge, 34 different species of bacteria were identified in a culture-independent manner and classified into 11 genera according to phylogenetic analysis. among them, mitis group streptococci and campylobacter, which were present in health status, no longer appeared in caries-susceptible samples. in addition, capnocytophaga, burkholderia, and prevotella were found significantly less frequently in the cs group samples (p < 0.05), while there were no significant differences among the prevalence of neisseria, leptotrichia, haemophilus, mutans group streptococci, corynebacterium, and actinomyces in the three groups. further dgge analysis of rnpb gene amplicons obtained with oral streptococci species-specific primers showed that a total of 23 species of oral streptococci were identified. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis showed a significantly higher prevalence in healthy children (p < 0.05), while that of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus did not vary among the three groups. overall, these results suggest that supragingival plaque microbiota as a  whole undergoes a more complicated shift in the caries process.

TI  == clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  == background/aims: severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. the aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. methods: dental  plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific pcr amplification for streptococcus mutans and bifidobacteriaceae species. results: children with severe caries (n =  39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16s rrna clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. using the human oral microbiome  database, 139 different taxa were identified. within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and veillonella sp. hot-780 (p < 0.01). the species associated with caries-free children included capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), lachnospiraceae sp. hot-100 (p < 0.05), streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). by specific pcr, s. mutans (p < 0.005) and bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. conclusion: clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the  association of s. mutans with caries was from specific pcr analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.

TI  == identification of hydrogen peroxide production-related genes in streptococcus sanguinis and their functional relationship with pyruvate oxidase.
AB  == hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)), an important substance produced by many members of  the genus streptococcus, plays important roles in virulence and antagonism within a microbial community such as oral biofilms. the spxb gene, which encodes pyruvate oxidase, is involved in h(2)o(2) production in many streptococcal species. however, knowledge about its regulation and relation with other genes putatively involved in the same pathway is limited. in this study, three genes--acka, spxr and tpk--were identified as contributing to h(2)o(2) production in streptococcus sanguinis by screening mutants for opaque colony appearance. mutations in all three genes resulted in significant decreases in h(2)o(2) production, with 16-31% of that of the wild-type. h(2)o(2) production was restored in the complemented strains. antagonism against streptococcus mutans by  these three s. sanguinis mutants was reduced, both on plates and in liquid cultures, indicating the critical roles of these three genes for conferring the competitive advantage of s. sanguinis. analysis by qpcr indicated that the expression of spxb was decreased in the acka and spxr mutants and significantly increased in the tpk mutant.

TI  == resistance to acidic environments of caries-associated bacteria: bifidobacterium  dentium and bifidobacterium longum.
AB  == oral bifidobacteriaceae, bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium longum, are  known to be isolated together with mutans streptococci and lactobacilli from caries lesions, suggesting that these bifidobacteriaceae are caries associated and acid resistant. this study aimed to investigate effects of acidification on b. dentium and b. longum, and to compare them with those on streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus paracasei. effects of acidification, growth ability in a complex medium at a ph of 4.0-8.0, cell viability in 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid monohydrate (mes)-koh buffer at ph 4.0, as well as stability of intracellular ph (ph(in)) at an extracellular ph of 3.5-8.0 estimated using a fluorescent dye, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate n-succinimidyl ester in mes-koh, 3-(n-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid-koh or n,n-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine-koh buffer, were investigated. b. longum grew as well as streptococcus strains over a wide ph range, whereas b. dentium grew best  in the narrow ph range around neutral. the cell viability of b. dentium decreased significantly after 2 h of acidification at a ph of 4.0, but this was significantly less than that of the streptococcus and lactobacillus species, whereas b. longum maintained almost 100% viability. the ph(in) was close to the extracellular ph at ph of 5.5-7.5 in the bifidobacterium and streptococcus strains, while at a ph of <5.0, the ph(in) was higher than the extracellular ph in all the strains, but the ph(in) maintenance ability of bifidobacterium strains was higher than that of the streptococcus strains. the high survival rate and ph(in) maintenance ability of bifidobacteria comparable to that of s. mutans in the acidic environment may account for why bifidobacteria exist as stable species in acidic caries lesions together with mutans streptococci.

TI  == subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  == the subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. we tested the hypothesis that  the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16s sequencing. smokers demonstrated greater abundance of parvimonas, fusobacterium, campylobacter, bacteroides, and treponema and lower levels of veillonella, neisseria, and streptococcus. several uncultivated peptostreptococci, parvimonas micra, campylobacter gracilis, treponema socranskii, dialister pneumosintes, and tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while veillonella sp. oral clone b2, neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, streptococcus sanguinis, and capnocytophaga sp. clone ah015 were at lower levels. the microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.

TI  == fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy of endocarditis vegetation.
AB  == the objectives of this work were to compare the infrared spectra of bacterial endocarditis vegetation with those of native valvular tissue and the infrared spectra of vegetation bacterial masses with those of surrounding vegetation tissue. streptococcal aortic endocarditis was induced in three rabbits. vegetation slices were cryo-sectioned for study by fourier transform infrared (ft-ir) microspectroscopy. valvular apparatus, vegetation, and bacterial masses within the vegetation were localized on hematoxylin and eosin (h&e) stained contiguous slices. infrared images of whole vegetations and images of bacterial masses were acquired with apertures set to 80 x 80 and 20 x 20 microm, respectively. valvular apparatus and vegetation showed different infrared spectra, mainly in the amide i and amide ii bands (1674-1518 cm(-1)), and at about 1450, 1400, 1340, 1280, 1240, 1200, 1080, and 1030 cm(-1). valvular collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans may explain these differences. bacterial masses and surrounding vegetation showed different infrared patterns, mainly in the amide i and amide ii bands and in the 1142-991 cm(-1) carbohydrate spectral range. bacterial nucleic acids and polysaccharides may partly explain these differences. study of experimental endocarditis vegetation using ft-ir microspectroscopy distinguishes (1) the vegetation from the valvular tissue, and  (2) the bacterial masses from the surrounding tissue. this study demonstrates for the first time that ft-ir microspectroscopy is able to detect bacterial growth in infected tissue. ft-ir microspectroscopy appears to be a useful tool for investigation of the biochemical structure of endocarditis vegetation.

TI  == characterization of anti-competitor activities produced by oral bacteria.
AB  == most bacteria in nature exist in multispecies communities known as biofilms. in the natural habitat where resources (nutrient, space, etc.) are usually limited,  individual species must compete or collaborate with other neighboring species in  order to perpetuate in the multispecies community. the human oral cavity is colonized by >700 microbial species known as the indigenous microflora. this indigenous flora normally maintains an ecological balance through antagonistic as well as mutualistic interspecies interactions. however, environmental perturbation may disrupt this balance, leading to overgrowth of pathogenic species, which could in turn initiate diseases such as dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontitis (gum disease). understanding the mechanisms of diversity maintenance may help development of novel approaches to manage these "polymicrobial diseases." in this chapter, we will focus on a well-characterized  form of biochemical warfare: bacteriocins produced by streptococcus mutans, a primary dental caries pathogen, and h(2)o(2) produced by streptococcus sanguinis, an oral commensal. we will describe detailed methodologies on the competition assay, isolation, purification, and characterization of bacteriocins.

TI  == nisin inhibits dental caries-associated microorganism in vitro.
AB  == nisin, produced by lactococcus lactis, is an antibiotic peptide to effectively antagonize a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, and is widely used as a safe food antimicrobial agent. in the present study, we investigated whether nisin could be used as an effective antibiotic peptide against the nine common cariogenic microorganisms, and its antimicrobial activity could be affected by the ingredients of saliva in oral cavity. in the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericide concentration (mbc) and spot-on-lawn assay, nisin displayed different mic, mbc and antimicrobial activity against the nine tested strains. there was statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin against the different tested bacteria (p<0.05), but no statistical difference between the inhibitory zone diameters of nisin dissolved in pbs and saliva (p>0.05). furthermore, morphology and membranes of streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus fermenti and lactobacillus acidophilus with nisin treatment were observed and showed different degrees of variation by a field emission scanning electron microscope (fe-sem). our findings suggested that nisin has considerable potential for prevention and treatment of dental caries.

AB  == purpose: this study evaluated the in vitro plaque inhibitory effect of triclosan-coated polyglactin 910 sutures in the absence and presence of an additional antiplaque agent commonly used after oral surgery. materials and methods: triclosan-coated sutures were incubated for 4 hours in freshly collected human saliva and, when appropriate, subsequently treated with an antiplaque rinse containing chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium as active components. sutures without a triclosan-coating served as a control. results: triclosan-coated sutures harbored similar amounts of plaque as did uncoated sutures. exposure to the antiplaque rinse caused significant decreases in viable organisms for uncoated and triclosan-coated sutures. however, after application of the antiplaque rinse, more micro-organisms were found on triclosan-coated than on uncoated sutures. conclusion: sutures coated with triclosan do not provide a sufficient antimicrobial effect to prevent in vitro colonization by oral bacteria, whereas use in combination with a chlorhexidine-cetyl pyridinium-containing antiplaque rinse appears to be counterproductive.

AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of crude etoh/h2o extracts from the leaves and stems of rosmarinus officinalis l. was evaluated against the following microorganisms responsible for initiating dental caries: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and enterococcus faecalis. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined with the broth microdilution method. the bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaf extract, which displayed the higher antibacterial activity than the stem extract, led to the identification of carnosic acid (2) and carnosol (3) as the major compounds in the fraction displaying the highest activity, as identified by hplc analysis.  rosmarinic acid (1), detected in another fraction, did not display any activity against the selected microorganisms. hplc analysis revealed the presence of low amounts of ursolic acid (4) and oleanolic acid (5) in the obtained fractions. the results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the extract from the leaves of r. officinalis may be ascribed mainly to the action of 2 and 3.

TI  == alkali production associated with malolactic fermentation by oral streptococci and protection against acid, oxidative, or starvation damage.
AB  == alkali production by oral streptococci is considered important for dental plaque  ecology and caries moderation. recently, malolactic fermentation (mlf) was identified as a major system for alkali production by oral streptococci, including streptococcus mutans. our major objectives in the work described in this paper were to further define the physiology and genetics of mlf of oral streptococci and its roles in protection against metabolic stress damage. l-malic acid was rapidly fermented to l-lactic acid and co(2) by induced cells of wild-type s. mutans, but not by deletion mutants for mles (malolactic enzyme) or  mlep (malate permease). mutants for mler (the contiguous regulator gene) had intermediate capacities for mlf. loss of capacity to catalyze mlf resulted in loss of capacity for protection against lethal acidification. mlf was also found  to be protective against oxidative and starvation damage. the capacity of s. mutans to produce alkali from malate was greater than its capacity to produce acid from glycolysis at low ph values of 4 or 5. mlf acted additively with the arginine deiminase system for alkali production by streptococcus sanguinis, but not with urease of streptococcus salivarius. malolactic fermentation is clearly a major process for alkali generation by oral streptococci and for protection against environmental stresses.

TI  == preload loss and bacterial penetration on different implant-abutment connection systems.
AB  == preload loss can favor the occurrence of implant-abutment interface misfit, and bacterial colonization at this interface may lead to implant failure. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the preload loss and bacterial penetration through the implant-abutment interface of conical and external hexagon connection systems subjected to thermal cycling and mechanical fatigue (tm). four different implant-abutment connection systems were evaluated (n=6): external hexagon with universal post, morse taper with universal post, morse taper with universal post  through bolt, and locking taper with standard abutment. the assemblies (implant-abutment) were subjected to a thermal cycling regimen (1,000 cycles of 5 degrees c and 55 degrees c) and to mechanical fatigue (1.0 million cycles, 1.0 hz, 120 n). the assemblies were immersed in tryptic soy + yeast extract broth containing streptococcus sanguinis and incubated at 37 degrees c and 10% co(2) for 72 h. detorque values were recorded. the bacterial penetration was assessed and the abutments were observed by scanning electron microscopy. the preload data were analyzed statistically by two-way anova and tukey's test at 5% significance  level. all screw abutment systems showed significantly higher (p<0.05) detorque values when subjected to tm and all conical systems presented bacterial penetration. the results show no relationship between the preload loss and the bacterial penetration.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of terpenoids from copaifera langsdorffii desf. against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of nine labdane type-diterpenes and four sesquiterpenes were investigated. among these metabolites, (-)-copalic acid (ca) was the most active compound displaying mic values very promising (ranging from 2.0 to 6.0 microg/ml) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ca against the primary causative agent (s. mutans) revealed that, in the first 12 h, this compound only inhibits the growth of the inoculum (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). also, ca did not show a synergistic effect when combined with the anticariogenic gold standard (chlorhexidine, chd) in the checkerboard assays against s. mutans. in conclusion, the results points out ca as an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == streptococcus mutans inhibits candida albicans hyphal formation by the fatty acid signaling molecule trans-2-decenoic acid (sdsf).
AB  == in the human mouth, fungi and several hundred species of bacteria coexist. here we report a case of interkingdom signaling in the oral cavity: a compound excreted by the caries bacterium streptococcus mutans inhibits the morphological  transition from yeast to hyphae, an important virulence trait, in the opportunistic fungus candida albicans. the compound excreted by s. mutans was originally studied because it inhibited signaling by the universal bacterial signal autoinducer-2 (ai-2), determined by the luminescence of a vibrio harveyi sensor strain. the inhibitor was purified from cell-free culture supernatants of  s. mutans guided by its activity. its chemical structure was elucidated by using  nmr spectroscopy and gc-ms and proved to be trans-2-decenoic acid. we show that trans-2-decenoic acid does not inhibit ai-2-specific signaling, but rather the luciferase reaction used for its detection. a potential biological role of trans-2-decenoic acid was then discovered. it is able to suppress the transition  from yeast to hyphal morphology in the opportunistic human pathogen candida albicans at concentrations that do not affect growth. the expression of hwp1, a hyphal-specific signature gene of c. albicans, is abolished by trans-2-decenoic acid. trans-2-decenoic acid is structurally similar to the diffusible signal factor (dsf) family of interkingdom-signaling molecules and is the first member of this family from a gram-positive organism (streptococcus dsf, sdsf). sdsf activity was also found in s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguinis, but not in other oral bacteria. sdsf could be relevant in shaping multispecies candida bacteria biofilms in the human body.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of 3 oral antiseptics containing octenidine, polyhexamethylene biguanide, or citroxx: can chlorhexidine be replaced?
AB  == background: use of oral antiseptics decreases the bacterial load in the oral cavity. objective: to compare the antimicrobial activity of 3 novel oral antiseptics with that of chlorhexidine, which is considered the "gold standard" of oral hygiene. design: comparative in vitro study. methods: four common oral microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans,  and fusobacterium nucleatum) were tested under standard conditions and at different concentrations, by use of a broth dilution assay and an agar diffusion  assay and by calculating the log10 reduction factor (rf). the antimicrobial activity of each antiseptic was assessed by counting the difference in bacterial  densities (ie, the log10 number of colony-forming units of bacteria) before and after the disinfection process. results: the oral antiseptics containing octenidine (with an rf in the range of 7.1-8.24 cfu/ml) and polyhexamethylene biguanide (with an rf in the range of 7.1-8.24 cfu/ml) demonstrated antimicrobial activity comparable to that of chlorhexidine (with an rf in the range of 1.03-8.24 cfu/ml), whereas the mouth rinse containing citroxx (citroxx biosciences; with an rf in the range of 0.22-1.36 cfu/ml) showed significantly weaker antimicrobial efficacy. overall, octenidine and polyhexamethylene biguanide were more active at lower concentrations.conclusion. oral antiseptics containing the antimicrobial agent octenidine or polyhexamethylene biguanide may  be considered as potent alternatives to chlorhexidine-based preparations.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == novel analysis of bacterium-substratum bond maturation measured using a quartz crystal microbalance.
AB  == studies in flow displacement systems have shown that the reversibility of bacterial adhesion decreases within seconds to minutes after initial contact of a bacterium with a substratum surface. atomic force microscopy (afm) has confirmed  that the forces mediating bacterial adhesion increase over a similar time span. the interfacial rearrangements between adhering bacteria and substratum surfaces  responsible for this bond maturation have never been studied. quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (qcm-d) senses the interfacial region in real time  and nondisruptively up to 250 nm from the sensor surface. in this paper, qcm-d is combined with real-time observation of bacterial adhesion in a flow displacement  system, in order to analyze resident-time-dependent changes in dissipation. three different streptococcus salivarius strains showed a nonlinear relation between total dissipation shift (deltad) and number of adhering bacteria, whereas inert and rigid silica particles demonstrated a linear relation between deltad and the  number of adhering particles. this suggests removal of interfacial water due to residence time dependent deformation of the nonrigid bacterium-substratum interface during bond maturation. dissipation could be described by an exponentially decaying function, which combined with adhesion data allowed extraction of the dissipation shifts per bacterium upon initial contact (deltad(0)), after bond maturation (deltad(infinity)), as well as a characteristic time constant (tau(bm)). all bacterial strains showed significant  bond maturation within one minute after their arrival at the substratum surface,  which was not observed for silica particles. dissipation analysis at the level of individually adhering bacteria would have been impossible without the simultaneous real-time analysis of bacterial adhesion numbers.

TI  == biofilm formation and virulence expression by streptococcus mutans are altered when grown in dual-species model.
AB  == background: microbial cell-cell interactions in the oral flora are believed to play an integral role in the development of dental plaque and ultimately, its pathogenicity. the effects of other species of oral bacteria on biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by streptococcus mutans, the primary etiologic agent of dental caries, were evaluated using a dual-species biofilm model and realtime-pcr analysis. results: as compared to mono-species biofilms, biofilm formation by s. mutans was significantly decreased when grown with streptococcus  sanguinis, but was modestly increased when co-cultivated with lactobacillus casei. co-cultivation with s. mutans significantly enhanced biofilm formation by  streptococcus oralis and l. casei, as compared to the respective mono-species biofilms. realtime-pcr analysis showed that expression of spap (for multi-functional adhesin spap, a surface-associated protein that s. mutans uses to bind to the tooth surface in the absence of sucrose), gtfb (for glucosyltransferase b that synthesizes alpha1,6-linked glucan polymers from sucrose and starch carbohydrates) and gbpb (for surface-associated protein gbpb,  which binds to the glucan polymers) was decreased significantly when s. mutans were co-cultivated with l. casei. similar results were also found with expression of spap and gbpb, but not gtfb, when s. mutans was grown in biofilms with s. oralis. compared to mono-species biofilms, the expression of luxs in s. mutans co-cultivated with s. oralis or l. casei was also significantly decreased. no significant differences were observed in expression of the selected genes when s. mutans was co-cultivated with s. sanguinis. conclusions: these results suggest that the presence of specific oral bacteria differentially affects biofilm formation and virulence gene expression by s. mutans.

TI  == an electron microscopy study of the diversity of streptococcus sanguinis cells induced by lysozyme in vitro.
AB  == bacterial virulence could be altered by the antimicrobial agents of the host. our aim was to identify the damage and survival of streptococcus sanguinis induced by lysozymes in vitro and to analyse the potential of oral microorganisms to shirk host defences, which cause infective endocarditis. s. sanguinis atcc 10556 received lysozyme at concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 microg/ml. cells were examined by electron microscopy. the survival was assessed by colony counting and construction of a growth curve. challenged by lysozymes, cells mainly exhibited cell wall damage, which seemed to increase with increasing lysozyme concentration and longer incubation period in the presence of ions. cells with little as well as apparent lesion were observed under the same treatment set, and anomalous stick and huge rotund bodies were occasionally observed. after the removal of the lysozyme, some damaged cells could be reverted to its original form with brain heart infusion (bhi), and their growth curve was similar to the control cells. after further incubation in bhi containing lysozyme, s. sanguinis cell damage stopped progressing, and their growth curve was also similar to the control cells. the results suggested that the s. sanguinis lesions caused by the lysozyme in the oral cavity may be nonhomogeneous and that some damaged cells could self-repair and survive. it also indicated that s. sanguinis with damaged cell walls may survive and be transmitted in the bloodstream.

TI  == role of streptococcus mutans eukaryotic-type serine/threonine protein kinase in interspecies interactions with streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == objective: interspecies interactions of oral streptococci involve the production  and excretion of antimicrobial compounds to compete successfully during colonization. bacteriocin production by streptococcus mutans and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production by streptococcus sanguinis have been demonstrated as crucial for the clinical relevant antagonism between both species. a potential target of h2o2 is the cell-envelop of s. mutans. in the present study, the role of cell-envelop associated eukaryotic serine/threonine protein kinase (stpk) in s. mutans during interspecies competition has been investigated. design: allelic  replacement via homologous recombination of the stpk encoding gene with a kanamycin resistant determinant has been constructed. the mutant has been screened for the susceptibility towards cell-envelope stress. a previously developed spotting assay was used to simulate interspecies competition. results:  the stpk(-) mutant showed an increased susceptibility towards envelop stress caused by h2o2 and was significantly more inhibited during interspecies competition assays. conclusions: s. mutans is able to sense antimicrobial compounds excreted by competing species and can potentially adjust the cell-envelop towards an increased resistance.

AB  == the aim of the research described in 'chemotherapy against streptococcus mutans'  was to increase colonization resistance against mutans streptococci by inoculating actinomyces naeslundii on the dentition. actinomyces naeslundii established better after chlorhexidine application than after dental cleansing only but did not exceed the 1% level of the total actinomyces population. this was insufficient to increase the colonization resistance against mutans streptococci. a 33% chlorhexidine varnish was developed. after a single short-term application of the varnish all plaque bacteria were erased. after several hours streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis  and streptococcus gordonii re-established on the surface. actinomyces naeslundii  recovered later, but often with higher numbers. mutans streptococci remained suppressed for months. this led to less acid production in dental plaque and caries reduction. the combination of mechanical cleansing and varnish application resulted in additional pocket reduction. recently, attention is also established  for research on the application ofprobiotics in periodotology.

AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to examine in vitro the anti-bacterial  efficacy of two different laser systems (co(2) and diode) applied to streptococcus sanguinis or porphyromonas gingivalis cells in suspensions or adhered to zirconia or titanium dental implant materials, with two different surfaces each. materials and methods: bacteria were irradiated at two different power settings with either a co(2) (lambda=10,600 nm) or a diode laser (lambda=810 nm). the lower mode is used clinically (for co(2) 100 j/cm(2), diode  50 j/cm(2)) and the higher may alter the materials' surface (for co(2) 1200 j/cm(2), diode 150 j/cm(2)). after irradiation, the number of viable bacteria was determined by culture. results: planktonic cells of both species were more resistant to the laser irradiations than bacteria that adhered to surfaces. adhered p. gingivalis were effectively killed at both wavelengths lambda=10,600 and 810 nm even at the lower settings, independent of the material. s. sanguinis  cells that adhered to either zirconia surface were effectively killed by the co(2) laser at the lower setting of 100 j/cm(2). however, the higher settings of  both lasers were needed to reduce s. sanguinis that adhered to titanium surfaces. the co(2) laser at the lower setting and the diode laser at the higher setting effectively reduced the viability of s. sanguinis or p. gingivalis that adhered to zirconia surfaces. conclusions: under irradiation conditions known not to alter zirconia implant surfaces in vitro, both co(2) laser (100 j/cm(2)) and the  diode laser (150 j/cm(2)) effectively reduced the viability of adhered s. sanguinis or p. gingivalis.

TI  == microbial leakage through the implant-abutment interface of morse taper implants  in vitro.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine and compare the frequency of bacterial leakage of streptococcus sanguinis biotype ii along the implant-abutment interface between two systems of morse taper dental implants. different methods of activation of the taper abutments were used: tapped-in (bicon) and screwed-in (ankylos). materials and methods: twenty sterile assemblies were used and attached, 10 bicon and 10 ankylos implants, according to manufacturers' specifications. they were then totally immersed within 20 test tubes containing a sterile nutrient solution brain-heart infusion (bhi). the internal part of the 20 implants was previously inoculated with 0.1 microl of s.  sanguinis ii (atcc 10557) and then connected to the respective abutments. the assemblies were incubated under anaerobic conditions for 14 days in an autoclave  at 37 degrees c. they were monitored daily for solution cloudiness resultant from microbial leakage on the interface of the assemblies. for statistical analysis, the fisher test was applied and significance was assigned at the 5% level. results: there was solution cloudiness, indicating the finding of bacterial growth inside two bicon assemblies and two ankylos assemblies 48 h after incubation. microbial leakage was further substantiated by testing the suspension for the presence of streptococcus sp. none of the sterility controls were contaminated. the frequency of bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface, with the two different morse taper implant systems, was 20% of the assemblies of each system. there were no statistical differences between them. conclusion: irrespective of which of the two morse taper implant connection systems of activation was analyzed, tapped-in (bicon) or screwed-in (ankylos), this in vitro experiment showed bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface.

TI  == investigation of bacteremia following insertion of orthodontic mini-implants.
AB  == aim: to investigate the incidence of bacteremia in the bloodstream immediately after orthodontic mini-implant insertion, which can be an invasive procedure. methods: blood samples (10 ml) were taken before and after mini-implant insertion from 40 patients (18 males, 22 females; mean age 21.3 +/- 7.7 years). these samples were inoculated into bact/alert aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles and processed in a bact/alert 9240 blood culture system. the findings were analyzed with the mcnemar test. results: no bacteremia was detected in the pretreatment samples, but it was in one of the postprocedure samples. the respective bacteria was streptococcus sanguinis, which is strongly associated with bacterial endocarditis. conclusion: orthodontic mini-implant placement might possibly be correlated to transitory bacteremia. therefore, a very careful approach seems indicated when dealing with patients who are at risk for cardiopathic complications.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of compounds from the leaf and stem of vitis amurensis against two oral pathogens.
AB  == nine compounds isolated from the leaf and stem of vitis amurensis rupr. (vitaceae) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against two oral pathogens, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis, which are associated with caries and periodontal disease, respectively. the results of several antimicrobial tests, including mic, mbc, and tbai, showed that three compounds inhibited the growth of the test bacteria at concentrations ranging from 12.5 to  50 microg/ml. among these compounds, compound 5, trans-epsilon-viniferin, displayed the strongest activity against s. mutans and s. sanguis with mic values of 25 and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. this is the first report on the antimicrobial activity of stilbenes and oligostilbenes isolated from the leaf and stem of v. amurensis. thus, this result suggests that natural antimicrobial compounds derived from v. amurensis may benefit oral health as plaque-control agents for the prevention of dental caries and periodontal disease.

TI  == pili of oral streptococcus sanguinis bind to fibronectin and contribute to cell adhesion.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is a predominant bacterium in the human oral cavity and occasionally causes infective endocarditis. we identified a unique cell surface polymeric structure named pili in this species and investigated its functions in  regard to its potential virulence. pili of s. sanguinis strain sk36 were shown to be composed of three distinctive pilus proteins (pila, pilb, and pilc), and a pili-deficient mutant demonstrated reduced bacterial adherence to hela and human  oral epithelial cells. pilc showed a binding ability to fibronectin, suggesting that pili are involved in colonization by this species. in addition, atcc10556, a standard s. sanguinis strain, was unable to produce pili due to defective pilus genes, which indicates a diversity of pilus expression among various s. sanguinis strains.

TI  == inhibiting microbial adhesion to denture base acrylic resin by titanium dioxide coating.
AB  == mechanical cleaning of dentures is effective in preventing infections such as aspiration pneumonia and denture stomatitis. for denture wearers with a physical  handicap and the elderly, however, mechanical cleaning can present problems. the  aim of this study was to investigate the effect of coating denture base acrylic resin with titanium dioxide (tio(2)) in the inhibition of oral microbial adhesion. we prepared uniformly sized acrylic resin plates (10 mm x 10 mm x 0.5 mm), which were divided into two groups (a non-coated group and a tio(2)-coated group). the plates were immersed in cultured streptococcus sanguinis or candida albicans and incubated for 24 h. after incubation, each plate was washed to remove loosely adherent microorganisms, and then incubated for a further 24 h. adenosine triphosphate (atp) content of the microorganisms was evaluated using a  reagent containing benzalkonium, which extracts intra-cellular atp. in addition,  to determine biofilm formation, we also observed each plate by scanning electron  microscopy (sem). we found that the atp content of both s. sanguinis and c. albicans was reduced by the tio(2) coating (p = 0.000). observation by sem confirmed that the tio(2) coating inhibited biofilm formation. the results indicate that a tio(2) coating on a denture base acrylic resin inhibits adhesion  of s. sanguinis and c. albicans.

TI  == [discrimination of common oral streptococcus with metabonomics method].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the feasibility of identifying oral streptococcus by comparing their metabolic profiling, and to find a convenient and rapid way to discriminate oral microorganisms. methods: the pure cultivation of streptococcus  sanguis atcc 10556 and streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (reference strain) from solid  culture were respectively inoculated in tpy liquid medium. then the growth quantity was measured periodically by turbidimetry and the growth curves of the inoculated bacteria were completed. the culture solutions in the stationary phase of the two bacteria were centrifuged, and then tested with the 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance (1h-nmr) spectrometer respectively. the gained free induction  decay (fid) data were all inputted into mestrec soft and finally transformed into metabolic profiling. the metabolic profiles were integrated segmentingly and the  results were inputted into simca-p soft for principal components analysis (pca).  results: the pca results showed the obvious clustering phenomena and the points of two group data differentially centralized in two clusters. therefore, the nmr-based metabonomics profiles can discriminate the two different kinds of bacteria. conclusion: the metabonomics can be expected to be a kind of promising  useful method in quick discrimination of oral streptococcus.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro biofilm formation on two different titanium implant surfaces.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the present in vitro and human in vivo study was twofold:  first, to evaluate the initial biofilm formation on different titanium implant surfaces by means of two highly sensitive fluorescent techniques and, second, to  correlate these findings to different surface properties. materials and methods:  in vivo biofilm formation was induced on purely machined (pt) and on sand-blasted and acid-etched titanium (prom) specimens, which were mounted buccally on individual splints and worn by six study participants for 12 h. in vitro bacterial adhesion was also investigated after incubation with streptococcus sanguinis suspension (37 degrees c, 2 h). adherent bacteria were quantified by the following fluorescence techniques: resazurin staining in combination with an  automated fluorescence reader or live/dead cell labeling and fluorescence microscopy. surface roughness (r(a)) was determined with a perthometer, and surface free energy (sfe) was measured with a goniometer. results: prom showed a  significantly higher median r(a) (0.95 microm) and a significantly lower median sfe (18.3 mj/m(2)) than pt (r(a)=0.15 microm; sfe=39.6 mj/m(2)). the in vitro and in vivo tests showed a significantly higher bacterial adhesion to prom than to pt, and the initial biofilm formation on pt corresponded to the circular surface  modifications on the machined substratum. both observations may be attributed to  the predominant influence of surface roughness on bacterial adhesion. no significant differences in the percentage of dead cells among all adhering bacteria were found between prom (23.7%) and pt (29.1%). ectopic solitary epithelial cells from the oral mucosa - strongly adhering to the substratum - were found on each prom specimen, but not on any of the pt surfaces. conclusions: initial bacterial adhesion to differently textured titanium surfaces is primarily influenced by r(a), whereas the influence of sfe seems to be of only minor importance. therefore, the micro-structured parts of an implant that are exposed  to the oral cavity should be highly polished to prevent plaque accumulation. both tested fluorometric techniques proved to be highly sensitive and reproducible in  the quantification of biofilm formation on titanium implant surfaces.

TI  == bacterial adhesion on smooth and rough titanium surfaces after treatment with different instruments.
AB  == background: newly formed biofilm after implant debridement may challenge the long-term stability of peri-implant therapy. this in vitro study aimed to assess  the roughness and adherence of streptococcus sanguinis after treatment of smooth  and rough titanium surfaces with an erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet (er:yag) laser, metal and plastic curets, and an air-powder abrasive system. methods: forty titanium disks with smooth-machined surfaces and 40 with sand-blasted and acid-etched surfaces were divided into the following treatment groups: er:yag laser; plastic curet; metal curet, and air-powder abrasive system. the surface roughness (roughness average [ra]) before and after treatments was determined using a profilometer. s. sanguinis (american type culture collection 10556) was grown on treated and untreated specimens, and the amounts of retained  bacteria on the surfaces were measured by the culture method. rough and smooth surfaces with and without a suspension of s. sanguinis were also analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: for smooth surfaces, the roughest surfaces were produced by metal curets (repeated-measures analysis of variance [anova] and tukey test; p <0.05). the rough-surface profile was not altered by any of the treatments (repeated-measures anova; p >0.05). rough surfaces treated  with metal curets and air-powder abrasion showed the lowest level of bacterial adhesion (two-way anova and tukey test; p <0.05). sem analysis revealed distinct  surface profiles produced by all devices. conclusions: metal curets are not recommended for smooth titanium surface debridement due to severe texture alteration. rough surfaces treated with a metal curet and the air-powder abrasive system were less susceptible to bacterial adhesion, probably due to texture modification and the presence of abrasive deposits.

TI  == decontamination efficacy of antiseptic agents on in vivo grown biofilms on rough  titanium surfaces.
AB  == objective: four common antimicrobial agents were evaluated for their efficacy in  reduction of aerobic bacteria intraorally grown in biofilms on rough titanium samples. the solutions investigated contained chlorhexidine, essential oil, octenidine, or citric acid. method and materials: twenty volunteers wore splints  with titanium sleeves intraorally for 10 days. following irrigation with the antiseptics, the sleeves were removed and biofilm samples were taken by swabbing. the bacteria were first examined microscopically by gram staining. these samples  from the surfaces were then cultured under aerobic conditions to identify and quantify the colonizing bacteria. results: compared to untreated controls, significant (p < .05) differences in antimicrobial efficacy were observed for the different regimens depending on bacterial species or even the subtype. the reduction rates achieved varied from 30.0% after 2 minutes of rinsing with chlorhexidine to 99.8% after 8 minutes of rinsing with octenidine. conclusion: the irrigation regimens studied in this investigation reduced bacterial colonization in a mature biofilm grown intraorally on rough titanium surfaces. the highest absolute reduction was achieved after 8 minutes, but only the 2-minute reduction rates are significant for clinical practice. taking this into  consideration, the distinct decontamination efficacy of octenidine and citric acid is evident.

AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == microbial interactions influence inflammatory host cell responses.
AB  == the inflammatory response plays an important role in the tissue destruction associated with periodontitis. bacterial species can regulate the inflammatory responses of host cells, triggered by pathogens. it was hypothesized that, in the field of oral microbiology/immunology, such effects of bacterial interactions on  inflammatory host cell responses might also be present. in this study, the effects of beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic species on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced interleukin-8 (il-8) production by human cells were investigated. the beneficial species, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis, were able to lower the il-8 production triggered by a. actinomycetemcomitans. the inhibitory effect was also achieved by the application of streptococcal supernatants. in contrast, the commensal streptococcus gordonii caused no reduction, and the pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum increased il-8 production by the host cells. these results show that bacterial species can influence the inflammatory responses of host cells triggered by infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans.

AB  == background and purpose: enterococcus faecium is a normal bowel commensal and lactic acid bacterium that is rarely found in the oral cavity. this study investigated whether a non-pathogenic and non-biofilm strain of e. faecium functioned as a probiotic strain toward biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans, which is an etiological agent for dental caries. methods: the effects of  e. faecium on streptococcal biofilm was evaluated by absorbance of safranin-stained biofilm at 492 nm in a 96-well microtiter plate. results: the e. faecium strain demonstrated cell-number-dependent inhibition of biofilm in dual cultures with 4 laboratory and 16 clinical s. mutans strains, as well as laboratory strains of streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus sanguinis, in 96-well microtiter plates. the inhibiting effects of e. faecium were not dependent on the production of bacteriocin from streptococci and e. faecium, low  ph after mix culture, or biofilm formation levels of s. mutans. a culture supernatant sample of more than 10 kda from e. faecium showed direct inhibiting effects toward s. mutans biofilm formation. treatment of heat, butanol, and phenol to a supernatant sample restored biofilm formation in culture of s. mutans with the sample. moreover, the tendencies of inhibition levels by the supernatant sample were associated with those by bacterial cells of e. faecium to s. mutans strains. conclusions: the e. faecium non-biofilm strain produced an inhibiting protein to streptococci biofilm formation, showed various susceptibilities to inhibit streptococcal biofilm, and acted as a probiotic bacterial inhibitor of streptococcal biofilm formation.

TI  == xylitol and erythritol decrease adherence of polysaccharide-producing oral streptococci.
AB  == xylitol consumption decreases counts of mutans streptococci. however, the mechanism behind this decrease is not well understood. we studied not only type strains and clinical isolates of mutans streptococci, but also other polysaccharide-forming oral streptococci. growth inhibition and adherence of cells to a smooth glass surface-reflecting synthesis of water-insoluble polysaccharides were studied in the presence of 2% (0.13 mol/l) and 4% (0.26 mol/l) xylitol. the effect of xylitol was compared to a novel polyol sweetener, erythritol. except for streptococcus mutans 10449 and s. sobrinus omz 176, the glass surface adhesion of most polysaccharide-forming streptococci was reduced by the presence of both 4% xylitol and erythritol. for the s. mutans and s. sobrinus type strains, the growth inhibition with 4% xylitol and erythritol was 36-77% and for the clinical s. mutans isolates 13-73%. of the other oral streptococci, only  s. sanguinis was inhibited with 4% xylitol (45-55%). for both polyols, the magnitude of the growth inhibition observed was not associated with the magnitude of the decrease in adherence (xylitol: r = -0.18; erythritol: r = 0.49). in conclusion, both xylitol and erythritol can decrease polysaccharide-mediated cell adherence contributing to plaque accumulation through a mechanism not dependent on growth inhibition.

TI  == bactericidal activity in filtrated supernatant of streptococcus sanguinis against multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == in the past decade, multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp) infection has become a serious clinical problem, due to the limitation of drug choices to fight against the bacteria. here we explored the bactericidal activity in the filtrated supernatant of streptococcus (s.) sanguinis against pseudomonas (p.) aeruginosa. s. sanguinis is one of the alpha-hemolytic streptococci that commonly reside in the human oral cavity. a strain of s. sanguinis, isolated from the sputum of a pulmonary-disease patient, was cultured for overnight. the filtered supernatant was tested for bactericidal effect using the minimum bactericidal concentration method on 20 strains of p. aeruginosa, including two mdrp and five  mucoid-type strains. the viable number of p. aeruginosa was decreased with time after exposing to the filtrated supernatant of s. sanguinis, and collapsed bacteria were detected with electron microscopy. of the 20 strains, 19 (95%) strains of p. aeruginosa were affected by bactericidal effect. among other species of bacteria examined, the filtrated supernatant of s. sanguinis showed remarkable bactericidal effect on 49% of indole-positive proteus species (4/9 strains) and 60% of acinetobacter (a.) baumannii (6/10 strains). we next investigated the property of bactericidal activity in filtrated supernatant by treating with proteinase k or autoclave. there was no change in the bactericidal  activity of the filtrated supernatant after each treatment, excluding the involvement of protein and plasmid. here, we identify the bactericidal activity in the filtrated supernatant of s. sanguinis against mdrp. this unexpected observation may contribute to the development of a novel therapeutic drug against p. aeruginosa.

TI  == poisson analysis of streptococcal bond-strengthening on saliva-coated enamel.
AB  == the forces responsible for bond-strengthening in initial oral bacterial adhesion  are unknown. since lifshitz-van der waals and electrostatic forces work instantaneously upon approach, it is hypothesized that bond-strengthening is governed by hydrogen bonding. poisson analysis of adhesion forces observed during the retraction of bacterial probes from surfaces in atomic force microscopy can be used to analyze the nature of the adhesion forces. streptococcal adhesion forces increased from about -0.7 to -10.3 nn when the contact time between cell surfaces and salivary films on enamel was increased from 0 to 120 sec. initial and final adhesion forces were stronger for initial colonizers of tooth surfaces  (s. mitis, s. sanguinis) than for later, more cariogenic, strains (s. sobrinus, s. mutans). retraction curves after increased contact times showed minor peaks, representative of hydrogen bonds, and poisson analyses indicated repulsive non-specific forces of around +0.3 nn and slightly more attractive hydrogen-bonding forces (-1.0 nn) for initial than for late colonizers (-0.8 nn).

TI  == angiogenic signaling triggered by cariogenic bacteria in pulp cells.
AB  == the inflammation observed in the dental pulp of teeth with deep caries lesions is characterized by a significant increase in blood vessel density. it is known that lipoteichoic acid (lta) from gram-positive cariogenic bacteria induces expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) in dental pulp cells. the hypothesis underlying this study was that lta induces vegf expression in dental pulp cells through tlr2 and pi3k/akt signaling. odontoblast-like cells (mdpc-23) and undifferentiated pulp cells (od-21) were exposed to lta from streptococcus sanguis, and the role of tlr2, pi3k/akt, and ikk signaling in lta-induced vegf expression was evaluated. these studies demonstrated that tlr2 signaling through  the pi3k-akt pathway is necessary for lta-induced vegf expression in pulp cells.  in contrast, inhibition of ikk signaling did not prevent vegf up-regulation in response to lta. understanding signaling pathways triggered by cariogenic bacteria may reveal novel therapeutic targets for the clinical management of pulpitis.

AB  == this study evaluates the effect of preincubation on delayed-entry samples for fastidious organisms including the hacek group, streptococcus species, neisseria  meningitidis, haemophilus species and corynebacterium species for the bact/alert  3d system (biomerieux) using the fa (aerobic) medium. bottles were inoculated with two different concentrations (0.5 mcfarland and a 1:100,000 dilution) of each organism and either loaded into the system immediately or stored at 4 degrees c, room temperature (rt) or 37 degrees c for 24 hours (h) prior to loading. the detection rate (dr) was 92.5% for bottles loaded immediately for both concentrations with a mean time to detection (ttd) of 26.7 h (standard deviation (sd): 14.7 h) for the low concentration and 9.21 h (sd: 5.3 h) for the  high concentration. preincubation at 4 degrees c did not affect the dr for either of the two concentrations in comparison to no preincubation. the dr at rt was 90.0% for the low concentration and 83.6% for the high concentration. at 37 degrees c the dr was 76.3% and 66.3% for the low and the high concentrations respectively. the average ttd was inversely correlated with the preincubation temperature. an incubation of four days was sufficient, with the exception of eikenella corrodens and gemella sanguinis. the serotype of streptococcus pneumoniae or neisseria meningitidis did not influence the ttd. kingella kingae remained undetected. for the retrieval of the above mentioned bacteria we recommend storage of bottles at room temperature. in case of erroneous storage at 37 degrees c subcultivation is advisable. all cases with a negative result on day four should be reevaluated and eventually new material for alternative diagnostic procedures should be retrieved.

TI  == oral streptococcus species in pre-term and full-term children - a longitudinal study.
AB  == background: despite high clinical significance, the microbiology of the dental biofilm in young children remains poorly understood. aim: the aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate five streptoccocus species commonly found in the oral biofilm of children, namely streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus salivarius to determine their relative numbers in caries-free pre-term children,  and age-matched full-term controls. design: plaque and saliva samples were obtained from 15 pre-term children and 15 age-matched controls at ages 3, 6, 12,  18, and 24 months. a quantitative real-time pcr technique was used to determine the numbers of five species of streptococcus using probes and primers specific for each bacterial species. results: all species of streptococcus generally increased from ages 3 to 24 months. the relative ratios of the bacteria remained  fairly constant at all ages studied (p > 0.1). there were no significant differences in numbers of all streptococcus species between pre-term children and full-term controls at all the ages investigated between. conclusion: the results  show that the relative numbers of s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and s. salivarius remain relatively constant from 3 to 24 months of age in caries-free pre- and full-term children.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == contemporary root canal irrigants are able to disrupt and eradicate single- and dual-species biofilms.
AB  == introduction: clinical/microbiological studies have consistently revealed the persistence of some bacteria after conventional root canal debridement. although  this was originally attributed to the complexity of the root canal anatomy and the difficulty of delivering antibacterial agents effectively, it has emerged that the biofilm encasement of bacterial cells may confer a further mechanism of  resistance. the purpose of this study was to investigate the relative disruption  and bactericidal effects of root canal irrigants on single- and dual-species biofilms of root canal isolates. methods: biofilms of streptococcus sanguinis, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were grown on nitrocellulose membranes for 72 hours and immersed in naocl, edta, chlorhexidine, and iodine for 1, 5, or 10 minutes. the number of viable and nonviable bacteria disrupted from the biofilm and those remaining adherent were determined by using a viability stain in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy. results: gram-negative obligate anaerobe species were more susceptible to cell removal than gram-positive facultative anaerobes. the majority of cells were disrupted after the first minute of exposure; however, the extent varied according to the agent and species. the most effective agent at disrupting biofilms was naocl. iodine was generally effective at bacterial killing but not disruption. conclusions: biofilm disruption and cell viability were influenced by the species, their coassociation in dual-species biofilms, the test agent, and the duration of exposure. the effectiveness of naocl as an endodontic irrigant was reinforced.

TI  == in vitro adhesion of streptococcus sanguinis to dentine root surface after treatment with er:yag laser, ultrasonic system, or manual curette.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the dentine root surface roughness and the adherence of streptococcus sanguinis (atcc 10556) after treatment with an ultrasonic system, er:yag laser, or manual curette. background  data: bacterial adhesion and formation of dental biofilm after scaling and root planing may be a challenge to the long-term stability of periodontal therapy. materials and methods: forty flattened bovine roots were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: ultrasonic system (n = 10); er:yag laser (n = 10); manual curette (n = 10); or control untreated roots (n = 10). the mean surface roughness (ra, microm) of the specimens before and after exposure to each treatment was determined using a surface profilometer. in addition, s. sanguinis  was grown on the treated and untreated specimens and the amounts of retained bacteria on the surfaces were measured by culture method. results: all treatments increased the ra; however, the roughest surface was produced by the curettes. in  addition, the specimens treated with curettes showed the highest s. sanguinis adhesion. there was a significant positive correlation between roughness values and bacterial cells counts. conclusion: s. sanguinis adhesion was the highest on  the curette-treated dentine root surfaces, which also presented the greatest surface roughness.

TI  == comprehensive evaluation of streptococcus sanguinis cell wall-anchored proteins in early infective endocarditis.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is a member of the viridans group of streptococci and a leading cause of the life-threatening endovascular disease infective endocarditis. initial contact with the cardiac infection site is likely mediated  by s. sanguinis surface proteins. in an attempt to identify the proteins required for this crucial step in pathogenesis, we searched for surface-exposed, cell wall-anchored proteins encoded by s. sanguinis and then used a targeted signature-tagged mutagenesis (stm) approach to evaluate their contributions to virulence. thirty-three predicted cell wall-anchored proteins were identified-a number much larger than those found in related species. the requirement of each cell wall-anchored protein for infective endocarditis was assessed in the rabbit  model. it was found that no single cell wall-anchored protein was essential for the development of early infective endocarditis. stm screening was also employed  for the evaluation of three predicted sortase transpeptidase enzymes, which mediate the cell surface presentation of cell wall-anchored proteins. the sortase a mutant exhibited a modest (approximately 2-fold) reduction in competitiveness,  while the other two sortase mutants were indistinguishable from the parental strain. the combined results suggest that while cell wall-anchored proteins may play a role in s. sanguinis infective endocarditis, strategies designed to interfere with individual cell wall-anchored proteins or sortases would not be effective for disease prevention.

TI  == interference with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans: colonization of epithelial cells under hydrodynamic conditions.
AB  == introduction: microbial interactions are considered to be important for bacterial colonization. interactions that inhibit colonization of pathogens could possibly  be used as a new treatment approach for periodontitis. the aim of this study was  to test this hypothesis on soft surfaces in vitro, taking into account the hydrodynamic forces continuously present in vivo. methods: cultured epithelial cells were precolonized with streptococcus sanguinis kth-4, streptococcus cristatus cc5a, streptococcus salivarius tove and streptococcus mitis bms before  aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans colonization. experiments were performed in a modified robbins-device-type flow cell. bacterial colonization and the number of epithelial cells were evaluated by microbial culturing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. results: the streptococci were able to inhibit a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization on soft tissue surfaces under flow conditions. statistically significant differences were found between streptococcal pretreatments and the controls, with the most pronounced effect caused by s. sanguinis. conclusion: these data confirm the possibility of applying beneficial  bacteria in periodontal treatment.

TI  == characterization of hydrogen peroxide-induced dna release by streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == extracellular dna (edna) is produced by several bacterial species and appears to  contribute to biofilm development and cell-cell adhesion. we present data showing that the oral commensals streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii release dna in a process induced by pyruvate oxidase-dependent production of hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)). surprisingly, s. sanguinis and s. gordonii cell integrity appears unaffected by conditions that cause autolysis in other edna-producing bacteria. exogenous h(2)o(2) causes release of dna from s. sanguinis and s. gordonii but does not result in obvious lysis of cells. under dna-releasing conditions, cell walls appear functionally intact and ribosomes are retained over time. during dna release, intracellular rna and atp are not coreleased. hence, the release mechanism appears to be highly specific for dna. release of dna without detectable autolysis is suggested to be an adaptation to the competitive oral biofilm environment, where autolysis could create open spaces for competitors to invade. since edna promotes cell-to-cell adhesion, release appears to support oral biofilm formation and facilitates exchange of genetic material among competent strains.

TI  == influence of a model human defensive peroxidase system on oral streptococcal antagonism.
AB  == streptococcus is a dominant genus in the human oral cavity, making up about 20 %  of the more than 800 species of bacteria that have been identified, and about 80  % of the early biofilm colonizers. oral streptococci include both health-compatible (e.g. streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis) and pathogenic strains (e.g. the cariogenic streptococcus mutans). because the streptococci have similar metabolic requirements, they have developed defence strategies that lead to antagonism (also known as bacterial interference). s. mutans expresses bacteriocins that are cytotoxic toward s. gordonii and s. sanguinis, whereas s. gordonii and s. sanguinis differentially produce h(2)o(2) (under aerobic growth conditions), which is relatively toxic toward s. mutans. superimposed on the inter-bacterial combat are the effects of the host defensive  mechanisms. we report here on the multifarious effects of bovine lactoperoxidase  (blpo) on the antagonism between s. gordonii and s. sanguinis versus s. mutans. some of the effects are apparently counterproductive with respect to maintaining  a health-compatible population of streptococci. for example, the blpo system (comprised of blpo+scn(-)+h(2)o(2)) destroys h(2)o(2), thereby abolishing the ability of s. gordonii and s. sanguinis to inhibit the growth of s. mutans. furthermore, blpo protein (with or without its substrate) inhibits bacterial growth in a biofilm assay, but sucrose negates the inhibitory effects of the blpo protein, thereby facilitating adherence of s. mutans in lieu of s. gordonii and s. sanguinis. our findings may be relevant to environmental pressures that select early supragingival colonizers.

TI  == effect of lactoperoxidase on the antimicrobial effectiveness of the thiocyanate hydrogen peroxide combination in a quantitative suspension test.
AB  == background: the positive antimicrobial effects of increasing concentrations of thiocyanate (scn-) and h2o2 on the human peroxidase defence system are well known. however, little is known about the quantitative efficacy of the human peroxidase thiocyanate h2o2 system regarding streptococcus mutans and sanguinis,  as well as candida albicans. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of  the enzyme lactoperoxidase on the bactericidal and fungicidal effectiveness of a  thiocyanate-h2o2 combination above the physiological saliva level. to evaluate the optimal effectiveness curve, the exposure times were restricted to 1, 3, 5, and 15 min. results: the bactericidal and fungicidal effects of lactoperoxidase on streptococcus mutans and sanguinis and candida albicans were evaluated by using two test mixtures of a 2.0% (w/v; 0.34 m) thiocyanate and 0.4% (w/v; 0.12 m) hydrogen peroxide solution, one without and one with lactoperoxidase. following the quantitative suspension tests (en 1040 and en 1275), the growth of  surviving bacteria and fungi in a nutrient broth was measured. the reduction factor in the suspension test without lactoperoxidase enzyme was < 1 for all three tested organisms. thus, the mixtures of 2.0% (w/v; 0.34 m) thiocyanate and  0.4% (w/v; 0.12 m) hydrogen peroxide had no in vitro antimicrobial effect on streptococcus mutans and sanguinis or candida albicans. however, the suspension test with lactoperoxidase showed a high bactericidal and fungicidal effectiveness in vitro. conclusion: the tested thiocyanate and h2o2 mixtures showed no relevant antimicrobial effect. however, by adding lactoperoxidase enzyme, the mixtures became not only an effective bactericidal (streptococcus mutans and sanguinis) but also a fungicidal (candida albicans) agent.

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

TI  == bacteriostatic effect of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts on dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == in this study, the bacteriostatic effect of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts on selected early dental plaque bacteria was investigated based on changes in the doubling time (g) and specific growth rates (micro). streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces sp. were cultured in brain heart infusion (bhi) in the presence and absence of the extracts. the growth of bacteria was monitored periodically every 15 min over a period of 9 h to allow for a complete growth cycle. growth profiles of the bacteria in the presence of the extracts were compared to those in the absence and deviation in the g and micro were determined and analyzed. it was found that the g and mu were affected  by both extracts. at 4 mg ml(-1) of p. betle the g-values for s. sanguinis and s. mitis were increased by 12.0- and 10.4-fold, respectively (p < 0.05). at similar  concentration p. guajava increased the g-value by 1.8- and 2.6 -fold, respectively (p < 0.05). the effect on actinomyces sp. was observed at a much lower magnitude. it appears that p. betle and p. guajava extracts have bacteriostatic effect on the plaque bacteria by creating a stressed environment that had suppressed the growth and propagation of the cells. within the context of the dental plaque, this would ensure the attainment of thin and healthy plaque. thus, decoctions of these plants would be suitable if used in the control of dental plaque.

TI  == transient acid-impairment of growth ability of oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and lactobacillus: a possible ecological determinant in dental plaque.
AB  == introduction: dental plaque ph decreases to about 4 through bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and this low ph is maintained for from several minutes to about an hour. repeated acidification causes demineralization of the tooth surface, resulting in caries formation. the acidification also influences plaque bacteria. severe acidification kills bacteria efficiently, while physiological acidification, the condition occurring in plaque, kills bacteria partially and may impair growth ability. we, therefore, investigated the effects  of physiological acidification on representative caries-related bacteria. methods: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, lactobacillus paracasei, and actinomyces naeslundii were used. effects of physiological acidification at ph 4.0 on cell viability and growth ability, as well as the growth rate of these bacteria at ph 4.0-7.0, were  investigated. results: mutans streptococci and lactobacillus grew at ph 4.0 but the growth of s. sanguinis and s. oralis ceased below ph 4.2 and ph 4.2-4.4, respectively. acidification at ph 4.0 for 1 h killed 43-89%, 45% and 35-76% of s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and actinomyces, respectively. furthermore, assessment of bacterial growth curves revealed that the growth ability of the surviving cells of s. sanguinis, s. oralis and actinomyces was impaired, but it was recovered within 2-5 h after the environmental ph had returned to 7.0. the acidification neither killed nor impaired the growth of mutans streptococci and lactobacillus.  conclusions: these results indicate that physiological and transient acidification is not sufficient to kill bacteria, but it causes a temporary acid-impairment of their growth ability, which may function as an ecological determinant for microbial composition in dental plaque.

TI  == fluoride, triclosan and organic weak acids as modulators of the arginine deiminase system in biofilms and suspension cells of oral streptococci.
AB  == introduction: the arginine deiminase system (ads) of oral bacteria is a major generator of alkali (ammonia) in dental plaque and is considered to have anticaries effects. however, many of the antimicrobial agents used in oral care products may reduce alkali production by the ads. the objective of our work was to assess the sensitivity of the ads of oral streptococci to commonly used antimicrobials, fluoride, triclosan and organic weak acids. methods: streptococcus sanguinis nctc 10904 and streptococcus ratti fa-1 were grown in suspension cultures and mono-organism biofilms. ads activity at ph values of 4, 5 and 6 was assessed, and the actions of the agents was determined in terms of reduced production of alkali from arginine, inhibition of ads enzymes and changes in uptake of arginine. results: ads activity was not greatly affected by ph changes between 4 and 6 and was greater per unit of biomass for cell suspensions  than for biofilms. naf was a poor inhibitor, while triclosan was highly effective with a 50% inhibitory dose for the two organisms between 0.03 and 0.05 and between 0.10 and 0.15 mm-h for suspension cells and biofilms, respectively. the weak acid indomethacin was nearly as potent at ph 4.0 as triclosan, while capric  and lauric acids were less potent, especially for biofilms. the methyl ester of lauric acid was slightly stimulatory. the major targets for the inhibitors appeared to be transport systems for arginine uptake, although carbamate kinase was a secondary target. conclusion: triclosan, indomethacin, caprate and laurate  can reduce ads activity in dental plaque.

TI  == increased d-lactic acid intestinal bacteria in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.
AB  == patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) are affected by symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and neurological impairment, the cause of which has yet to  be elucidated. however, these symptoms are strikingly similar to those of patients presented with d-lactic acidosis. a significant increase of gram positive facultative anaerobic faecal microorganisms in 108 cfs patients as compared to 177 control subjects (p<0.01) is presented in this report. the viable count of d-lactic acid producing enterococcus and streptococcus spp. in the faecal samples from the cfs group (3.5 x 10(7) cfu/l and 9.8 x 10(7) cfu/l respectively) were significantly higher than those for the control group (5.0 x 10(6) cfu/l and 8.9 x 10(4) cfu/l respectively). analysis of exometabolic profiles of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus sanguinis, representatives of enterococcus and streptococcus spp. respectively, by nmr and hplc showed that these organisms produced significantly more lactic acid (p<0.01) from (13)c-labeled glucose, than the gram negative escherichia coli. further, both e.  faecalis and s. sanguinis secrete more d-lactic acid than e. coli. this study suggests a probable link between intestinal colonization of gram positive facultative anaerobic d-lactic acid bacteria and symptom expressions in a subgroup of patients with cfs. given the fact that this might explain not only neurocognitive dysfunction in cfs patients but also mitochondrial dysfunction, these findings may have important clinical implications.

TI  == development of genetic tools for in vivo virulence analysis of streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == completion of the genome sequence of streptococcus sanguinis sk36 necessitates tools for further characterization of this species. it is often desirable to insert antibiotic resistance markers and other exogenous genes into the chromosome; therefore, we sought to identify a chromosomal site for ectopic expression of foreign genes, and to verify that insertion into this site did not  affect important cellular phenotypes. we designed three plasmid constructs for insertion of erm, aad9 or tetm resistance determinants into a genomic region encoding only a small (65 aa) hypothetical protein. to determine whether this insertion affected important cellular properties, sk36 and its erythromycin-resistant derivative, jfp36, were compared for: (i) growth in vitro, (ii) genetic competence, (iii) biofilm formation and (iv) virulence for endocarditis in the rabbit model of infective endocarditis (ie). the spectinomycin-resistant strain, jfp56, and tetracycline-resistant strain, jfp76,  were also tested for virulence in vivo. insertion of erm did not affect growth, competence or biofilm development of jfp36. recovery of bacteria from heart valves of co-inoculated rabbits was similar to wild-type for jfp36, jfp56 and jfp76, indicating that ie virulence was not significantly affected. the capacity  for mutant complementation in vivo was explored in an avirulent ssab mutant background. expression of ssab from its predicted promoter in the target region restored ie virulence. thus, the chromosomal site utilized is a good candidate for further manipulations of s. sanguinis. in addition, the resistant strains developed may be further applied as controls to facilitate screening for virulence factors in vivo.

AB  == polyphenols occurring in cocoa, coffee and tea can have a role in the prevention  of cariogenic processes, due to their antibacterial action. cocoa polyphenol pentamers significantly reduce biofilm formation and acid production by streptococcus mutans and s. sanguinis. in the same way, trigonelline, caffeine and chlorogenic acid occurring in green and roasted coffee interfere with s. mutans adsorption to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads. studies carried out on green, oolong and black tea indicate that tea polyphenols exert an anti-caries effect via an anti-microbial mode-of-action, and galloyl esters of (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin and (-)-gallocatechin show increasing antibacterial activities. the anti-cariogenic effects against alpha-haemolytic streptococci showed by polyphenols from cocoa, coffee, and tea suggest further studies to a possible application of these beverages in the prevention of pathogenesis of dental caries.

AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is an important cause of infective endocarditis. previous studies have identified lipoproteins as virulence determinants in other streptococcal species. using a bioinformatic approach, we identified 52 putative  lipoprotein genes in s. sanguinis strain sk36 as well as genes encoding the lipoprotein-processing enzymes prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (lgt) and signal peptidase ii (lspa). we employed a directed signature-tagged mutagenesis approach to systematically disrupt these genes and screen each mutant for the loss of virulence in an animal model of endocarditis. all mutants were viable. in competitive index assays, mutation of a putative phosphate transporter reduced in vivo competitiveness by 14-fold but also reduced in vitro viability by more than 20-fold. mutations in lgt, lspa, or an uncharacterized lipoprotein gene reduced competitiveness by two- to threefold in the animal model and in broth culture. mutation of ssab, encoding a putative metal transporter, produced a similar effect in culture but reduced in vivo competiveness by >1,000-fold. [(3)h]palmitate labeling and western blot analysis confirmed that the lgt mutant  failed to acylate lipoproteins, that the lspa mutant had a general defect in lipoprotein cleavage, and that ssab was processed differently in both mutants. these results indicate that the loss of a single lipoprotein, ssab, dramatically  reduces endocarditis virulence, whereas the loss of most other lipoproteins or of normal lipoprotein processing has no more than a minor effect on virulence.

TI  == in vitro adherence of oral streptococci to zirconia core and veneering glass-ceramics.
AB  == plaque formation on dental ceramics may cause gingival inflammation and secondary caries. this in vitro study compared the susceptibility of various dental ceramics to adhere oral streptococci, and verified the influence of substratum surface roughness and surface hydrophobicity. three zirconia ceramic materials and three veneering glass-ceramics were investigated. fifteen test specimens were prepared for each material, polished, and surface roughness and hydrophobicity were determined. after incubation with artificial saliva (2 h, 37 degrees c) for  pellicle formation, specimens were incubated with suspensions of streptococcus gordonii dsmz 6777, streptococcus mutans dsmz 20523, streptococcus oralis dsmz 20627, or streptococcus sanguinis dsmz 20068, respectively, for 2.5 h at 37 degrees c. adherent bacteria were quantified using a fluorescence dye for viable  cell quantification (alamar blue/resazurin). statistical analysis was performed using one- and two-way anova and the tukey-kramer multiple comparison test for post hoc analysis (alpha < 0.05). surface roughness and surface hydrophobicity differed significantly among the various ceramics; protein coating hydrophilized  the surfaces, and led to a homogenization of the surface hydrophobicity of the various ceramics. before protein coating, almost similar relative fluorescence intensities indicating similar adhesion of streptococci were found for the various ceramics; more distinct differences were observed after protein coating.  correlations between surface parameters and streptococcal adhesion were poor. within the limitations of these experiments, the findings of this in vitro study  indicate only little differences between zirconia and glass ceramic with regard to streptococcal adhesion. judging from these results, it is unlikely that exposed zirconia surfaces yield more plaque than glass ceramic surfaces in vivo.

TI  == activity of panduratin a isolated from kaempferia pandurata roxb. against multi-species oral biofilms in vitro.
AB  == the formation of dental biofilm caused by oral bacteria on tooth surfaces is the  primary step leading to oral diseases. this study was performed to investigate the preventive and reducing effects of panduratin a, isolated from kaempferia pandurata roxb., against multi-species oral biofilms consisting of streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of panduratin a was determined by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution assay. prevention of biofilm formation was performed on 96-well microtiter plates by coating panduratin a in mucin at 0.5-40 microg/ml, followed by biofilm formation at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the reducing effect on the preformed biofilm was tested by forming the biofilm at 37 degrees c for 24 h, followed by treatment with panduratin a at 0.2-10 microg/ml for up to 60 min. panduratin a showed a mic of 1 microg/ml for multi-species strains. panduratin a at 2 x mic for 8 h exhibited bactericidal activity against multi-species planktonic cells for 8 h. at 8 x mic, panduratin a was able to prevent biofilm formation by > 50%. biofilm mass was reduced by > 50% after exposure to panduratin a at 10 microg/ml for 15 min. panduratin a showed a  dose-dependent effect in preventing and reducing the biofilm. these results suggest that panduratin a is applicable as a natural anti-biofilm agent to eliminate oral bacterial colonization during early dental plaque formation.

TI  == tlr2 sensing of f. nucleatum and s. sanguinis distinctly triggered gingival innate response.
AB  == gingival tissue faces constant exposure to micro-organisms. it functions as part  of the host response, an anti-microbial barrier that recognizes and discriminates between commensal and pathogenic bacteria. this study aimed to evaluate and compare the effects of cell wall extracts from different periodontal bacteria, commensals streptococcus sanguinis and fusobacterium nucleatum and the pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis, on the innate immune response of gingival keratinocytes and the role of tlr2 in regulating this. we assayed mrna levels to determine the  expression of human beta-defensins (hbetad2, hbetad3), interleukin-1alpha, -1beta, 6 and 8 and matrix metalloproteinase-9. f. nucleatum extracts induced beta-defensin and inflammatory marker mrna expression at higher levels than p. gingivalis. extracts from the gram-positive commensal s. sanguinis did not upregulate the host response. tlr2 extinction inhibited the upregulation of beta-defensin and cytokine transcripts by f. nucleatum extracts but, in contrast, led to a weak induction of hbetad3 after challenge with s. sanguinis extracts. although f. nucleatum strongly induces innate immune and inflammatory mediators,  s. sanguinis limits their expression through tlr2. together, our data demonstrate that gingival keratinocytes recognize and discriminate between gram-positive and  gram-negative commensal extracts, in part through tlr2, to activate different signaling pathways of the innate immune host response.

TI  == surface characterization of dental ceramics and initial streptococcal adhesion in vitro.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the surface properties of dental ceramic materials belonging to different ceramic classes, and to correlate the findings to the initial adherence of three oral streptococcal strains. methods: rectangular specimens were prepared from different ceramic materials (glass/lithium disilicate glass/glass-infiltrated zirconia/partially sintered zirconia/hipped zirconia ceramic) and polished; surface roughness (ra) was determined. glass plates were used as a control. specimens were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline or an artificial saliva (protein mixture; 2h, 37 degrees c). surface free energy (gamma(t)) and its polar (gamma(p)) and disperse (gamma(d)) contribution were determined prior to and after artificial saliva exposure. uncoated and protein-coated specimens were incubated with streptococcus gordonii dsmz 6777, streptococcus oralis dsmz 20068  or streptococcus sanguinis dsmz 20068 suspension for 2.5h at 37 degrees c (n=15 for each treatment and strain). adherent streptococci were quantified fluorometrically. results: the lithium disilicate glass ceramic showed the highest values for ra; the lowest values were found for the glass ceramic, the partially sintered zirconia and the hipped zirconia ceramic. protein coating caused a significant increase in gamma(t) and gamma(p), but not in the control material. the control material showed higher values for streptococcal adhesion than all ceramic materials. after protein coating, only slight and random differences in streptococcal adhesion were found between the various ceramic materials. significance: dental ceramic materials show differences in terms of ra, gamma(t) and initial streptococcal adhesion; however, correlations between surface properties and streptococcal adhesion were poor.

TI  == pcr detection of bacterial genes provides evidence of death by drowning.
AB  == we have developed a sensitive and specific pcr method for detecting plankton dna  in cases of death by drowning. however, this pcr method could not be used for cases of drowning in water containing no plankton. bacteria species are normally  localized in the throat and trachea and they may invade into blood through the respiratory tract in people who have drowned as well as species localized in water. the aim of this study was to establish a novel and expedient pcr method for detecting bacterial genes in samples from drowning cases. we designed primer  pairs for streptococcus salivarius (sl1) and streptococcus sanguinis (sn1), which are common species in the throat, and for aeromonas hydrophila (ah1), which has been found in various water samples. with sl1, sn1, and ah1, we detected 10, 0.1, and 1 pg of target dna, respectively. among 19 drowned cases within 3 days postmortem, sl-dna was detected in all of the blood samples from hearts with sl1  and ah-dna was detected in several samples with ah1. in a case of drowning in a bathtub, use of the conventional acid digestion method for diatom analyses and the pcr method for identifying plankton dna revealed no plankton, but our pcr method for detecting bacterial dna showed a positive result for sl-dna in a blood sample from the heart. in conclusion, our novel pcr method is highly specific and sensitive for detecting bacterial dna and is useful for cases of death by drowning in water containing no plankton.

TI  == correlations of oral bacterial arginine and urea catabolism with caries experience.
AB  == background/aim: alkali generation by oral bacteria plays a key role in plaque ph  homeostasis and may be a major impediment to the development of dental caries. to determine if the capacity of oral samples to produce ammonia from arginine or urea was related to caries experience, the arginine deiminase system (ads) and urease activity in saliva and dental plaque samples were measured in 45 adult subjects. methods: the subjects were divided into three groups according to caries status; 13 caries-free (cf) individuals (decayed, missing, and filled teeth = 0); 21 caries-active (ca) individuals (decayed teeth >or= 4); and 11 caries-experienced (ce) individuals (decayed teeth = 0; missing and filled teeth  > 0). real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the proportion of  certain acid- or alkali-producing organisms in the samples. results: the amount of ammonia generated from the test substrates by plaque samples was generally higher than that produced by salivary samples in all groups. significantly higher levels of salivary ads activity and plaque urease activity were observed in cf subjects compared to ca subjects (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.014, respectively). the proportions of streptococcus mutans from saliva and dental plaque of ca subjects  were significantly higher than those from the cf group (p = 0.0153 and p = 0.0009, respectively). in the ca group, there was an inverse relationship between urease activity and the levels of s. mutans (p < 0.0001). conclusion: this study  supports the theory that increased caries risk is associated with reduced alkali-generating capacity of the bacteria colonizing the oral cavity; providing  compelling evidence to further our understanding of oral alkali-generation in health and disease.

TI  == analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  == intramammary infection (imi), also known as mastitis, is the most frequently occurring and economically the most important infectious disease in dairy cattle. this study provides a validation of the analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time pcr-based assay that identifies 11 major pathogen species or species  groups responsible for imi, and a gene coding for staphylococcal beta-lactamase production (penicillin resistance). altogether, 643 culture isolates originating  from clinical bovine mastitis, human, and companion animal samples were analyzed  using the assay. the isolates represented 83 different species, groups, or families, and originated from 6 countries in europe and north america. the analytical specificity and sensitivity of the assay was 100% in bacterial and beta-lactamase identification across all isolates originating from bovine mastitis (n = 454). when considering the entire culture collection (including also the isolates originating from human and companion animal samples), 4 streptococcus pyogenes, 1 streptococcus salivarius, and 1 streptococcus sanguis strain of human origin were identified as streptococcus uberis, and 3 shigella spp. strains were identified as escherichia coli, decreasing specificity to 99% in strep. uberis and to 99.5% in e. coli. these false-positive results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. specificity and sensitivity remained at 100% for all other bacterial targets across the entire culture collection. in conclusion, the real-time pcr assay shows excellent analytical accuracy and holds much promise for use in routine bovine imi testing programs. this study provides the basis for evaluating the assay's diagnostic performance against the conventional bacterial culture method in clinical field trials using  mastitis milk samples.

TI  == bacterial profiles of oral streptococcal and periodontal bacterial species in saliva specimens from japanese subjects.
AB  == objective: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have increased  understanding of the distribution of oral bacterial species in clinical specimens, though few investigations have been conducted to simultaneously detect oral streptococcal and periodontal species in the same specimens. the purpose of  the present study was to investigate the distribution and correlation of 6 oral streptococcal and 6 periodontal species in saliva specimens taken from children and their mothers. design: seventy-four pairs of children and their mothers were  approved to participate in this study. saliva specimens were collected and bacterial dna extracted, which was subjected to pcr analyses using species-specific sets of primers. the combinations of species able to be detected simultaneously were determined by statistical analyses. results: streptococcus sobrinus and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected more often in the mothers than the children. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus oralis were detected simultaneously in a significant number of specimens, while the presence of campylobacter rectus was correlated with the presence of at least one of the red complex species (p. gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythensis). on the other hand, no correlation was shown between the rates of detection of oral streptococcal and periodontal species. conclusions: our results indicate that among streptococcal and periodontal species, several are able to coexist in saliva, while the presence of both does not have an influence on each other.

TI  == fluoride released from glass-ionomer cement is responsible to inhibit the acid production of caries-related oral streptococci.
AB  == objectives: glass-ionomer cements (gics) are known to have inhibitory effects on  bacterial growth, but the biochemical mechanism of this property has not been fully understood. this study aimed to evaluate inhibitory effects of gic on the acid production of caries-related oral streptococci, and to identify the components responsible for the inhibition. methods: an eluate was prepared by immersing set gic in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 degrees c for 24h. fluoride  and other elements in the eluate were quantified by fluoride ion electrode and atomic absorption photometry, respectively. streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 and streptococcus sanguinis nctc 10556 were used to evaluate the ph fall and the rate of acid production after the addition of glucose in the presence or absence of the eluate. acidic end products from glucose were also assayed by carboxylic acid analyzer. results: the eluate contained silicon (1.24+/-0.26 mm), fluoride (0.49+/-0.02 mm) and aluminum (0.06+/-0.00 mm), and inhibited the ph fall and the acid production rate of both streptococci at acidic ph, with a concomitant decrease in lactic acid production. these effects were comparable to those of a potassium fluoride solution containing the same concentration of fluoride as the  eluate. significance: these results indicate that the gic eluate inhibits the acid production of caries-related oral streptococci at acidic ph and that the effect is due to fluoride derived from the gic. thus, adjacent to gic fillings, bacterial acid production and the subsequent bacterial growth may decrease, establishing a cariostatic environment.

TI  == effects of alpha-amylase and its inhibitors on acid production from cooked starch by oral streptococci.
AB  == this study evaluated acid production from cooked starch by streptococcus mutans,  streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis, and the  effects of alpha-amylase inhibitors (maltotriitol and acarbose) and xylitol on acid production. streptococcal cell suspensions were anaerobically incubated with various carbohydrates that included cooked potato starch in the presence or absence of alpha-amylase. subsequently, the fall in ph and the acid production rate at ph 7.0 were measured. in addition, the effects of adding alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol to the reaction mixture were evaluated. in the absence of  alpha-amylase, both the fall in ph and the acid production rate from cooked starch were small. on the other hand, in the presence of alpha-amylase, the ph fell to 3.9-4.4 and the acid production rate was 0.61-0.92 micromol per optical density unit per min. these values were comparable to those for maltose. when using cooked starch, the fall in ph by s. sanguinis and s. mitis was similar to that by s. mutans and s. sobrinus. for all streptococci, alpha-amylase inhibitors caused a decrease in acid production from cooked starch, although xylitol only decreased acid production by s. mutans and s. sobrinus. these results suggest that cooked starch is potentially acidogenic in the presence of alpha-amylase, which occurs in the oral cavity. in terms of the acidogenic potential of cooked starch, s. sanguinis and s. mitis were comparable to s. mutans and s. sobrinus. alpha-amylase inhibitors and xylitol might moderate this activity.

TI  == the two-component system bfrab regulates expression of abc transporters in streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == the putative two-component system bfrab is involved in streptococcus gordonii biofilm development. here, we provide evidence that bfrab regulates the expression of bfrcd and bfrefg, which encode two atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters, and bfrh, which encodes a caax amino-terminal protease family protein. bfrc and bfre are atp-binding proteins, and bfrd, bfrf and bfrg are homologous membrane-spanning polypeptides. similarly, bfrabss, the bfrab homologous system in streptococcus sanguinis, controls the expression of two bfrcd-homologous operons (bfrcdss and bfrxyss), a bfrh-homologous gene (bfrh1ss)  and another caax amino-terminal protease family protein gene (bfrh2ss). furthermore, we demonstrate that the purified bfra dna-binding domain from s. gordonii binds to the promoter regions of bfrcd, bfrefg, bfrh, bfrcdss, bfrxyss and bfrh1ss in vitro. finally, we show that the bfra dna-binding domain recognizes a conserved dna motif with a consensus sequence of tttctttagaaatattttagaatt. these data suggest, therefore, that s. gordonii bfrab controls biofilm formation by regulating multiple abc-transporter systems.

AB  == a defining characteristic of the suspected periodontal pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum is its ability to adhere to a plethora of oral bacteria. this distinguishing feature is suggested to play an important role in oral biofilm formation and pathogenesis, with fusobacteria proposed to serve as central 'bridging organisms' in the architecture of the oral biofilm bringing together species which would not interact otherwise. previous studies indicate that these  bacterial interactions are mediated by galactose- or arginine-inhibitable adhesins although genetic evidence for the role and nature of these proposed adhesins remains elusive. to characterize these adhesins at the molecular level,  the genetically transformable f. nucleatum strain atcc 23726 was screened for adherence properties, and arginine-inhibitable adhesion was evident, while galactose-inhibitable adhesion was not detected. six potential arginine-binding proteins were isolated from the membrane fraction of f. nucleatum atcc 23726 and  identified via mass spectroscopy as members of the outer membrane family of proteins in f. nucleatum. inactivation of the genes encoding these six candidates for arginine-inhibitable adhesion and two additional homologues revealed that only a mutant derivative carrying an insertion in fn1526 (now designated as radd) demonstrated significantly decreased co-aggregation with representatives of the gram-positive 'early oral colonizers'. lack of the 350 kda outer membrane protein encoded by radd resulted in the failure to form the extensive structured biofilm  observed with the parent strain when grown in the presence of streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556. these findings indicate that radd is responsible for arginine-inhibitable adherence of f. nucleatum and provides definitive molecular  evidence that f. nucleatum adhesins play a vital role in inter-species adherence  and multispecies biofilm formation.

TI  == factors affecting human supragingival biofilm composition. ii. tooth position.
AB  == background and objective: little is known regarding the factors that affect the microbial composition of supragingival biofilms. this study was designed to test  the hypothesis that tooth location affects the microbial composition of supragingival plaque beyond the effect due to plaque mass as reflected by total dna probe count. material and methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal aspect of each tooth in 187 subjects (n = 4745 samples). all samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences in mean species counts and proportions were determined among tooth surfaces and six tooth type categories: molars, bicuspids, incisors/canines in the mandible and maxilla  separately using the kruskal-wallis test. stepwise multiple linear regression was employed to examine the relationship between species proportions and total dna probe count, tooth location, periodontal and smoking status, age and sex. results: all species differed significantly among tooth types and among the six tooth categories. higher plaque levels were seen on molars and lower incisors. some differences observed between tooth types could be partly explained by the level of plaque. teeth with high plaque mass exhibited high levels of capnocytophaga gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, campylobacter rectus and campylobacter showae. however, certain species, such as veillonella parvula and streptococcus sanguinis, differed significantly at different tooth locations despite similarities in plaque mass. twenty of the test species exhibited a significant association with tooth location after adjusting for total dna probe count and subject level factors. conclusion: while plaque mass was associated with differences in proportions of many species in supragingival biofilms, tooth location also was strongly associated with species proportions in both univariate and multivariate analyses.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans adhesion inhibited in a flow cell.
AB  == introduction: microbial interactions are considered important in the adhesion process of pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity. this study addressed the hypothesis that a streptococcal biofilm influences the hard tissue colonization by the periodontopathogen aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans under hydrodynamic conditions. methods: the colonization of a green-fluorescent-protein-labelled a. actinomycetemcomitans strain on surfaces coated with a streptococcal biofilm, was monitored in real time using a confocal  laser scanning microscope-mounted flow cell. culture and quantitative polymerase  chain reaction data were obtained in parallel from a modified robbins device. results: colonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans was inhibited by the four tested streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus mitis). the most inhibiting species was s. sanguinis. conclusion: these results confirmed the hypothesis that some bacterial species influence a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of hard surfaces in vitro under hydrodynamic conditions.

TI  == anticaries effect of compounds extracted from galla chinensis in a multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == introduction: galla chinensis is a leaf gall known to have some antibacterial effects. using an in vitro biofilm model of dental plaque, the present study aimed to evaluate the anticaries effects of galla chinensis and its chemical fractions. methods: a four-organism bacterial consortium (streptococcus sanguis,  streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus rhamnosus) was grown  on hydroxyapatite (ha) discs, bovine enamel blocks, and glass surfaces in a continuous culture system and exposed to repeated solution pulses. galla chinensis extracts, sucrose solutions, and sodium fluoride solutions were pulsed  into different flow cells. the ph value of the planktonic phase in each flow cell was recorded and the bacteria colonizing the biofilm on the ha discs were counted. enamel blocks were observed using a polarized microscope and lesion depth was evaluated. the biofilm morphology was examined with a fluorescence microscope and the images captured were analyzed on an image analysis system. results: when galla chinensis extract, its chemical fraction, or fluoride was added to the sucrose solution, the planktonic phase ph remained higher than that  in the sucrose alone. a lower level of colonization on the ha surface was also observed in the groups to which galla chinensis and fluoride were added compared  with the control sucrose group, and this was reflected in both the total viable count and the biofilm imaging, which showed fewer cariogenic bacteria and a less  compact biofilm, respectively. enamel demineralization in both the fluoride group and the galla chinensis group was significantly less than that in the sucrose group. conclusions: galla chinensis and fluoride may inhibit the cariogenicity of the oral biofilm. galla chinensis appears to be a promising source of new agents  that may prevent dental caries.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities against cariogenic streptococci and their antioxidant capacities: a comparative study of green tea versus different herbs.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria, total antioxidant capacity and phenolic constituents of methanolic extracts from 11 herbs were investigated and compared with those of green tea (camellia sinensis). among the  12 tested herbs, eight herbal extracts could inhibit the growth of streptococcus  sanguinis. jasmine, jiaogulan, and lemongrass were the most potent, with minimum  inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 1mg/ml, while green tea was less effective, with a mic of 4mg/ml. among them, only rosemary could inhibit the growth of s. mutans at a mic of 4mg/ml. total antioxidant capacities of herbal extracts were analyzed by three different assays, including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph.) radical scavenging activity, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (orac). regardless of the assays used, green tea exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity, followed by osmanthus. wide variations in total phenolics and total flavonoids of herbal tea  extracts were observed. chlorogenic acid was detected in high amount in honeysuckle and duzhong. these data suggest that rosemary is a potent inhibitor of oral streptococci, and green tea and osmanthus may be effective potential sources of natural antioxidants.

TI  == streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis colonization correlated with caries experience in children.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the colonization of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis in the oral cavity and the association with severe early  childhood caries (s-ecc). saliva and plaque samples were collected from 14 s-ecc  children and 8 caries-free (cf) children. all s-ecc children were s. mutans positive; 100% of cf children and 93% of s-ecc children were s. sanguinis positive. the children's caries severity was positively correlated with levels of s. mutans (p < 0.001), total oral streptococci (p < 0.01), total cultivable oral  bacteria (p < 0.05), and children's age (p < 0.05). logistic regression analysis  showed that the interaction of s. sanguinis with s. mutans was a significant factor associated with the caries status in children, suggesting that the relative levels of these two microorganisms in the oral cavity play an important  role in caries development.

TI  == mlpa diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  == a multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. however, multiplex  pcr techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa)  identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube pcr. here we report a novel use of mlpa in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. we designed 9 species specific probes for: actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces odontolyticus, candida albicans, lactobacillus acidophilus, rothia dentocariosa, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral streptococci and lactobacilli based on their 16s rdna sequences. mlpa analysis of dna pooled from the strains showed the expected specific mlpa products. relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar dna showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests mlpa can be a cheaper alternative to using qpcr for quantification. we observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of mlpa products in dnas isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. furthermore, mlpa analyses of dna isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. this clearly shows the usefulness of mlpa in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if varying the percent (by weight) of  aqueous calcium hydroxide or using different vehicles had an effect on its antibacterial efficacy against common endodontic pathogens in a pour plate/traditional streak agar diffusion model. mixtures of calcium hydroxide powder and sterile saline in 40, 50 and 60 percent concentrations and the commercial preparations ultracal xs and vitapex were tested against six known endodontic pathogens with an agar diffusion method. each medicament was placed in one of five wells, in each of 10 agar plates (n = 10), for cultures of each bacterial species. zones of inhibition were measured after 48 hours incubation for aerobes and 96 hours incubation for anaerobes. multiple one-way analyses of variance and post-hoc student neuman keuls evaluated the data at alpha = 0.05. larger zones of inhibition were consistently observed for higher concentrations of calcium hydroxide with statistical significance among the bacteria, particularly between 40% and 60%. vitapex had significantly smaller zones of inhibition than all other medicaments and 35% ultracal xs with methylcellulose was nearly as effective as 50% ca(oh)(2) in inhibitory activity. formulations containing 50-60% ca(oh)(2) or 35% ca(oh)(2) with aqueous methylcellulose are recommended as endodontic interappointment medicaments.

AB  == objectives: the aim of the present study was to compare the susceptibility of one novel silorane-based and four widely used conventional methacrylate-based resin composites to adhere oral streptococci and to relate any differences to surface roughness, hydrophobicity and type of matrix. methods: specimens of restoratives  filtek silorane, filtek z250, tetric evoceram, quixfil and spectrum tph were prepared (10.0-mm diameter, 2.0-mm height). surface roughness was assessed by perthometer measurements and hydrophobicity according to water contact angles was determined by computerized image analysis. bacterial suspensions of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans  were incubated for 2.5 h at 37 degrees c with 15 test specimens for each material and adhesion was quantified with fluorescence dye alamar blue/resazurin and an automated multi-detection reader. glass served as reference. statistical analysis was performed using the mann-whitney u-test (alpha=0.05). results: median roughness values of all composites ranged between 0.04 and 0.11 microm, median contact angles between 59.7 degrees and 92.1 degrees. significantly lowest fluorescence intensities of all test materials were found on filtek silorane for  three of four streptococcal strains. the fluorescence intensities of the four conventional methacrylate resin composites were significantly higher and comparable among each other. significance: when compared against four conventional methacrylate composite resins, a general significance to a lower quantity of adhering streptococci was found on the novel silorane-based composite resin, which might result from its increased hydrophobicity. the low adhesion potential of the silorane-based composite may potentially improve the longevity of direct fillings and reduce recurrent caries.

TI  == the role of streptococcal hypersensitivity in the pathogenesis of behcet's disease.
AB  == behcet's disease (bd) is still considered as a mysterious multisystemic disorder  characterized by recurrent involvement of muco-cutaneous, ocular, intestinal, vascular and/or nervous system organs. in this review, we would like to highlight and discuss several important advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of bd based on the intrinsic genetic factors including hla-b51 and mica expression and extrinsic triggering factors. as one of the extrinsic triggering factors, we focused on the hypersensitivity against oral streptococci which might be acquired through the innate immune mechanism. it was found that hla-b51 restricted cd8 t cell response was clearly correlated with the target tissues expressing mica*009 by stress in active bd patients with hla-b51 as the intrinsic factors. bes-1 gene and hsp-65 derived from oral s. sanguinis, which is the uncommon serotype (kth-1, strain bd113-20), are supposed to play important roles  as an extrinsic factor in bd pathogenesis. the peptides of the bes-1 gene are highly homologous with the retinal protein brn3b and moreover, the bes-1 peptides were homologous with hsp-65 derived from microorganisms in association with the counterpart human hsp-60, which appeared reactively in the patients. hsp-65/60 also has high homologies with the respective t cell epitope of bd patients. although hsp-65/60 and the peptides of bes-1 gene were found to stimulate pbmcs from bd patients in the production of pro-inflammatory th1 type cytokines, some homologous peptides of hsp-65 with t cell epitopes were found to reduce il-8, il-12 and tnf-alpha produced from pbmcs of active bd patients. the findings might be correlated with the clinically therapeutic effects for bd patients with severe uveitis, who were led to immunotolerance by the peptide of human hsp-60 (336-351), as previously reported. then, the pathogenesis of bd was discussed referring to intrinsic genetic factors and extrinsic triggering factors in aspects of streptococcal hypersensitivity, which might be acquired through the innate immune mechanisms. the bd symptoms were thought to be due to vascular reactions as immune responses in correlation with monocyte expressed streptococcal agents.

TI  == structural basis of the zinc- and terbium-mediated inhibition of ferroxidase activity in dps ferritin-like proteins.
AB  == streptococcus suis dpr is an iron-binding protein involved in oxidative stress resistance. it belongs to the bacterial dps protein family whose members form dodecameric assemblies. previous studies have shown that zinc and terbium inhibit iron incorporation in listeria innocua dps protein. in order to gain structural insights into the inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium, the crystal structures of streptococcus suis dpr complexes with these ions were determined at 1.8 a and  2.1 a, respectively. both ions were found to bind at the ferroxidase center and in the same location as iron. in addition, a novel zinc-binding site formed by his40 and his44 was identified. both his residues were found to be present within all known streptococcus suis dpr variants and in streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus sanguinis dpr proteins. amino acid sequence alignment of dpr with other dps family members revealed that his44 is highly conserved, in contrast to his40. the inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium on iron oxidation in dpr was studied in vitro, and it was found that both ions at concentrations >0.2 mm almost completely abolish iron binding. these results provide a structural basis for the inhibitory effect of zinc and terbium in the dps family of proteins, and suggest a potential role of the dps proteins in zinc  detoxification mechanisms involving the second zinc-binding site.

TI  == effect of xylitol/chlorhexidine versus xylitol or chlorhexidine as single rinses  on initial biofilm formation of cariogenic streptococci.
AB  == objectives: oral bacteria implying a natural resistance may deteriorate the antibacterial efficacy of chlorhexidine on cariogenic microorganisms. xylitol, mostly applied via chewing gum, is known to possess favorable plaque-reducing properties. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a xylitol rinse formulated as pure solution or combined with chlorhexidine on the viability of streptococcus sanguis (early colonizer of human teeth) and streptococcus mutans (the most causal strain for caries) during initial steps of biofilm formation. method and materials: after exposure to the test solutions, the bacteria suspended in human sterile saliva were allowed to attach to human enamel slides for 60 minutes in a preclinical flow chamber system. the bacterial vitality of suspended and attached cells was monitored using 2 fluorescent dna stains by epifluorescence microscopy. further parameters measured were the total  bacterial cell counts on enamel slides and growth of suspended streptococci. results: the sensitivity of s mutans to pure chlorhexidine or in combination with xylitol is contrary to the natural resistance of s sanguis to chlorhexidine. the  combination of xylitol/chlorhexidine showed a statistically significant antivital effect on s sanguis cells compared to the pure agents xylitol and chlorhexidine.  the bacterial cell density on enamel and bacterial reproduction on agar plates were similarly affected by the combination of xylitol/chlorhexidine or the single substances. conclusion: the newly discovered synergistic antivital effect of xylitol combined with chlorhexidine may contribute to the favorable potential of  xylitol use for the improvement of new formulations of caries-preventive mouthrinses.

TI  == antibacterial activity of yoghurt against viridans streptococci in vitro.
AB  == objective: yoghurt consumption leads to a selective decrease in the oral level of mutans streptococci. it is not clear whether this decrease is due to the bactericidal activity of yoghurt or other mechanisms. the present study investigated the differences in susceptibility to yoghurt between several strains of viridans streptococci. design: the sources of variation were minimised, at the expense of the external validity of the study, using culture collection strains.  each strain was tested separately on five occasions in planktonic form and logarithmic growth phase. two strains of each of the following streptococcus species were tested: mutans, sobrinus, gordonii, oralis, parasanguinis and sanguinis. one millilitre [10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)] of each strain was incubated (37 degrees c, 60min) with 9ml of fat-free plain yoghurt containing streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus (10(8) and 10(7)cfu/g, respectively) in gently vortexed tubes. survival rates were calculated every 15min by dividing the number of viable cells, obtained using conventional laboratory procedures, by the baseline number. results: survival rates were 8% (s. mutans 6519t), 12% (s. mutans 31738), 35% (s. oralis 25671) and >50% (all other species tested) after 15min, and 0.01% (s. mutans) and >10% (all other species tested) after 30min. overall, s. parasanguinis and s. sobrinus were the most resistant species. when heat-treated yoghurt (<10cfu/g bacteria and inactivated bacteriocins) was used, this antibacterial activity was not found. conclusion: in vitro, yoghurt with live bacteria showed selective anti-mutans activity, suggesting that the overall decrease in mutans streptococci in vivo could be due to a bactericidal effect on s. mutans but not on s. sobrinus.

AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

AB  == in recent years, patients have benefited from the development of better and more  esthetic materials, including all-ceramics dental restorative materials. dental plaque formation on teeth and restorative materials plays an important role in the pathogenesis of oral diseases. this study investigates initial adhesion of stationary phase streptococcal species to different all-ceramics dental restorative materials. the saliva-coated materials were incubated with the bacteria for 1 h in an in vitro flow chamber which mimics environmental conditions in the oral cavity. number and vitality of adhering bacteria were determined microscopically after staining. surface roughness and the composition  of the materials had no distinctive influence on bacterial adhesion. however, s.  mutans and s. sobrinus adhered about tenfold less numerous to all materials than  the other streptococcal species. further, there was a correlation between bacterial vitality and materials' glass content. the results showed that early plaque formation was influenced predominantly by the presence of the salivary pellicle rather than by material dependent parameters whereas the composition of  the all-ceramics appeared to have influenced the percentage of viable cells during the adhesion process. this presented in vitro technique may provide a useful model to study the influence of different parameters on adherence of oral  streptococcal species.

TI  == [behcet's syndrome (a complex of mucocutaneous and ocular symptoms].
AB  == behcet's disease (bd) is a complex of symptoms, which include aphthae in the oral mucous membrane, eruptions of the skin, ulcers on genitals and eye symptoms. the  disease relapses into acute episodes for many years and involves internal organs. since 1990, bd has been diagnosed by the international diagnostic criteria. during the last 20 years, bd has varied in the disease expression. the number of  patients who fill the diagnostic criteria falls, while the number who do not fill the diagnostic criteria increases. complications of internal organs are unchanged. investigations have disclosed many new findings on the pathogenesis; the close relationship of bd with hla-51 gene and participation of streptococcus  sanguinis in the oral cavity seems to be significant for diagnosis and treatment. for these reasons, the japanese study group presented a set of new extended diagnostic criteria in 2005 with guidance for suitable treatment. bd is rare in the nordic countries, but increased communication with middle-eastern countries is likely to cause an increase in the number of bd patients. we must refresh and  renew our knowledge of bd.

TI  == ability of oral bacteria to induce tissue-destructive molecules from human neutrophils.
AB  == aim: the induction of tissue-destructive molecules from neutrophils by periodontopathic bacteria has been suggested as one of the mechanisms of periodontal destruction. the aim of this study was to determine whether the ability to stimulate neutrophils is an authentic characteristic of periodontopathic bacteria. methods: we evaluated, along with phagocytosis, the production of reactive oxygen species (ros), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (mmp-8),  and interleukin-1beta by neutrophils in response to non-periodontopathic streptococcus sanguinis and periodontopathic bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola, in the absence or presence of antibodies. phagocytosis, the  death of neutrophils, and intracellular ros production were measured by flow cytometry and the concentrations of mmp-8 and interleukin-1beta secreted into medium were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: s. sanguinis and f. nucleatum induced greater production of ros, mmp-8, and interleukin-1beta than did t. denticola. the levels of tissue-destructive molecules produced by neutrophils had a positive correlation with phagocytosis. opsonization of bacteria with antibodies significantly increased phagocytosis and ros production and release, thus increasing both bacterial clearance and potential tissue damage. conclusion: the ability of oral bacteria to induce tissue-destructive molecules from neutrophils is not an inherent characteristic of periodontopathic bacteria, which would provide a new insight into the role of  neutrophils in periodontal destruction.

TI  == comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

TI  == streptococcal antagonism in oral biofilms: streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii interference with streptococcus mutans.
AB  == biofilms are polymicrobial, with diverse bacterial species competing for limited  space and nutrients. under healthy conditions, the different species in biofilms  maintain an ecological balance. this balance can be disturbed by environmental factors and interspecies interactions. these perturbations can enable dominant growth of certain species, leading to disease. to model clinically relevant interspecies antagonism, we studied three well-characterized and closely related  oral species, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, and cariogenic streptococcus mutans. s. sanguinis and s. gordonii used oxygen availability and the differential production of hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) to compete effectively against s. mutans. interspecies antagonism was influenced by glucose  with reduced production of h(2)o(2). furthermore, aerobic conditions stimulated the competence system and the expression of the bacteriocin mutacin iv of s. mutans, as well as the h(2)o(2)-dependent release of heterologous dna from mixed  cultures of s. sanguinis and s. gordonii. these data provide new insights into ecological factors that determine the outcome of competition between pioneer colonizing oral streptococci and the survival mechanisms of s. mutans in the oral biofilm.

TI  == antimicrobial effect and ph of chlorhexidine gel and calcium hydroxide alone and  associated with other materials.
AB  == the purposes of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of 2% chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate gel, calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] and their combination with iodoform and zinc oxide powder as intracanal medications against select microorganisms, and to measure the ph changes caused by these medications. antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method. the zones of  growth inhibition were measured and the results were analyzed statistically by kruskal-wallis test (p<0.05). the ph of the pastes was measured right after preparation, after 24 h and 1 week later. the largest mean zones of microbial inhibition were produced by 2% chx gel, followed by ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel + iodoform, ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel, ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel + zinc oxide, and ca(oh)2 +  water. the mean ph of all medications stayed above 12.0 during the whole experiment, except for chx gel (ph=7.0). the results of this study showed that all medications had antimicrobial activity, but the most effective against the tested microorganisms were 2% chx gel, followed by its combination with ca(oh)2 and iodoform.

TI  == [effects of oral streptococci on biofilm formation by cariogenic bacteria in dual species cultures].
AB  == the effects of oral commensal streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius) on biofilm formation by cariogenic mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus) were investigated. cell suspensions were cultured on 96-well microtiter plates coated with or without salivary components (sc), and in flow cell systems coated with sc in tryptic soy broth including 0.25% sucrose without dextrose (tsb). the resultant biofilm formations were stained using safranin or a live/dead baclight viability kit, and examined with absorbance at 492 nm or using confocal laser scanning microscopy. mutans streptococci and s. sanguinis biofilms were formed significantly on the polystyrene surfaces in tsb.  further, in combination cultures, s. sanguinis formed a sufficient biofilm when cultured with s. mutans. however, when s. sanguinis was cultured with s. sobrinus, biofilm formation was slightly inhibited. s. gordonii also inhibited biofilm formation in the culture with s. sobrinus, but not when cultured with s.  mutans. s. mitis and s. salivarius collapsed the biofilm morphology and inhibited volume development in some conditions when cultured with s. mutans or s. sobrinus. biofilm formation by mutans streptococci was challenged and collapsed on the whole by culturing with each of the other oral streptococci. these results indicate that co-culturing of multiple species of mutans streptococci and other oral streptococci has physical effects related to previous attachment and colonization on the surface, as well as biological effects to regulate biofilm formation.

TI  == identification of streptococcus sanguinis genes required for biofilm formation and examination of their role in endocarditis virulence.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is one of the pioneers in the bacterial colonization of teeth and is one of the most abundant species in the oral biofilm called dental plaque. s. sanguinis is also the most common viridans group streptococcal species implicated in infective endocarditis. to investigate the association of biofilm and endocarditis, we established a biofilm assay and examined biofilm formation with a signature-tagged mutagenesis library of s. sanguinis. four genes that have not previously been associated with biofilm formation in any other bacterium, purb, purl, thrb, and pyre, were putatively identified as contributing to in vitro biofilm formation in s. sanguinis. by examining 800 mutants for attenuation in the rabbit endocarditis model and for reduction in biofilm formation in vitro, we found some mutants that were both biofilm defective and attenuated for endocarditis. however, we also identified mutants with only reduced biofilm formation or with only attenuation in the endocarditis model. this result indicates that the ability to form biofilms in vitro is not associated with endocarditis virulence in vivo in s. sanguinis.

TI  == periodontitis is associated with a loss of colonization by streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to estimate differences in the prevalence of oral streptococcal species in the subgingival biofilm of patients with aggressive periodontitis and of healthy controls. thirty-three patients with clinical and radiological proof of aggressive periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded in a six-point measurement per tooth. samples of the subgingival biofilm were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. alpha- and non-haemolytic, small and catalase-negative colonies were biochemically identified using a rapid id 32 strep system and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass  spectrometry. a total of 118 strains of oral streptococci (11 species) were identified and streptococcus sanguinis was found significantly more often in healthy subjects (p=0.001). conversely, the absence of s. sanguinis was associated with high values of clinical indices (p=0.001-0.002). aggressive periodontitis seems to be associated with a loss of colonization of s. sanguinis. whether or not s. sanguinis offers protection against aggressive periodontitis needs to be determined. otherwise, there were no significant differences in the distribution of oral streptococcal species in patients and healthy subjects.

TI  == interactions between salivary bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacteria: in vitro coaggregation and coadhesion assays.
AB  == coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. bifidobacterium adolescentis olb6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii jcm8350, streptococcus mitis ols3293, streptococcus sanguinis jcm5708, veillonella parvula atcc17745 or porphyromonas gingivalis ob7124, but it did coaggregate with fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532. subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using fish revealed that b. adolescentis olb6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. it did, however, adhere to biofilms of a. naeslundii, v. parvula, and f. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with a. naeslundii nor with v.  parvula. these results suggest that the adhesion of b. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. heat- or proteinase k-treated f. nucleatum could not coaggregate with b. adolescentis. similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase k-treated b. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. it is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of b. adolescentis and f. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. the data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

AB  == the second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. a simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast candida albicans, gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria sicca, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, gram-positive bacteria deinococcus radiodurans, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. a similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. the area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the wartburg law depending on exposure time. qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration  of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.

TI  == the utility of affinity-tags for detection of a streptococcal protein from a variety of streptococcal species.
AB  == there is no systematic examination of affinity tag utility in gram-positive bacteria, which limits the investigation of protein function in this important group of bacteria as specific antibodies for many of native proteins are generally not available. in this study, we utilized an e. coli-streptococcal shuttle vector pvt1666 and constructed two sets of expression plasmids pvpt-ctag  and pvpt-ntag, with each set containing five affinity tags (gst, gfp, hsv, t7 and nano) that can be fused to either the c- or n-terminus of a target protein. a putative glycosyltransferase (gtf2) essential for fap1 glycosylation was used to  demonstrate the utility of the cassettes in detection of gtf2 fusion proteins, and the biological relevance of the proteins in our working strain streptococcus  parasanguinis. gfp and t7 tags were readily expressed in s. parasanguinis as either an n- or c-terminal fusion to gtf2. only the c- terminal fusion of gst and hsv were able to be identified in s. parasanguinis. the nano tag was not detected in either e. coli or s. parasanguinis. genetic complementation experiments indicated that all the tagged gtf2 fusion proteins could restore the gtf2 function in the null mutant except for the nano-tagged gtf2 at its n-terminal fusion. using a t7-tagged gtf2 fusion construct, we demonstrated that the fusion  cassette is also useful in detection of the fusion tag expression in other streptococci including s. mutans, s. pneumoniae and s. sanguinis. therefore, the  expression cassettes we constructed will be a useful tool not only to investigate protein-protein interactions in fap1 biogenesis in s. parasanguinis, but also to  study protein functions in other gram-positive bacteria in which pvt1666 replicates.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of cigarette smoke on the growth of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis. the standard strains of s. mutans (atcc 25175) and s. sanguis (atcc 10556) were cultured on blood agar and incubated for 48 hr in three main environments: atmospheric air, carbon dioxide, and cigarette smoke. kent gold 1(nicotine: 0.1 mg, tar: 1 mg), kent lights (nicotine: 0.8 mg, tar: 9 mg) and bahman (nicotine: 1 mg, tar: 13 mg) were the brands used in the present study. afterwards, digital photographs of the colonies were taken and the diameter of colonies was measured. data were analyzed using post hoc and general linear model statistical tests. cigarette smoke and carbon dioxide environments significantly increased the growth of s. mutans. however, high nicotine/tar content cigarette smoke (bahman) had the greatest impact on s. mutans and s. sanguis. the mutans/sanguis ratio, which was 0.71 in atmospheric air, increased to 1.07 in the presence of carbon dioxide. kent gold 1, kent lights, and bahman demonstrated a mutans/sanguis ratio of 1, 0.84, and 0.98 respectively. in conclusion, it seems that the growth of s. sanguis and s. mutans is accelerated in the vicinity of cigarette smoke.

TI  == heritability of oral microbial species in caries-active and caries-free twins.
AB  == oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. we therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. an additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. an integrative computational predictive model determined  microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. the  levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in  caries-active individuals, including, a. defectiva, s. parasanguinis, s. mitis/oralis, s. sanguinis, s. cristatus, s. salivarius, streptococcus sp. clone  ch016, g. morbillorum and g. haemolysans. moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. it appears that genetic and/or  familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial  species in twins.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == stimulation of fusobacterium nucleatum biofilm formation by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background/aims: bacterial infection is a major cause of periapical periodontitis. eradication of these microorganisms from apical lesions is essential to the success of endodontic treatment. the aim of this study was to clarify the molecular interaction between fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas  gingivalis and other microorganisms associated with periapical periodontitis. methods: microorganisms isolated from periapical lesions were inoculated into type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microtiter plates and maintained at 37 degrees c under anaerobic conditions for 2 days, after which, the quantity of organized biofilm on the plates was evaluated by crystal violet staining. growth enhancement via soluble factor was evaluated by separated coculture using a 0.4-mum membrane filter. results: f. nucleatum exhibited strong adherence to type-i collagen-coated polystyrene microplates. biofilm formation by f. nucleatum was significantly enhanced by p. gingivalis. it was complemented by compartmentalized coculture with p. gingivalis. enhancement of biofilm formation  by p. gingivalis was only slightly reduced by inactivation of its autoinducer-2-producing gene luxs. conclusion: the results suggest that p. gingivalis enhances biofilm formation by f. nucleatum by releasing diffusible signaling molecules other than autoinducer-2.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  == extracts or alkaloids isolated from mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. in this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a m. aquifolium  extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the m. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. the values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. the most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == raman spectroscopic measurement of relative concentrations in mixtures of oral bacteria.
AB  == near-infrared raman spectroscopy has been used for species identification of pure microbial specimens for more than a decade. more recently, this optical method has been extended to the analysis of specimens containing multiple species. in this report, we demonstrate rapid, reagent-free quantitative analysis of a simplified model of oral plaque containing three oral bacteria species, s. mutans, s. sanguis, and s. gordonii, using near-infrared raman spectroscopy. raman spectra were acquired from bacterial mixtures in 200 seconds. a prediction  model was calibrated by the partial least squares method and validated by additional samples. on a scale from 0 to 1, relative fractions of each species could be predicted with a root mean square error of 0.07. these results suggest that near-infrared raman spectroscopy is potentially useful in quantification of  microbial mixtures in general and oral plaques in particular.

TI  == review. leukocyte and endothelial cell adhesion molecules in inflammation focusing on inflammatory heart disease.
AB  == in multicellular organisms the development of adhesion bonds, either among cells  or among cells and components of the extracellular matrix, is a crucial process.  these interactions are mediated by molecules which are named adhesion molecules and play a main role both at the early stages of the development of tissue integrity and later. cell adhesion molecules (cams) have a key role in several pathologies such as cancer and inflammatory diseases. selectins, integrins and immunoglobulin gene superfamily of adhesion receptors mediate different steps of  leukocyte migration from the bloodstream towards the inflammatory foci. leukocyte interactions with the vascular endothelium are highly orchestrated processes that include the capture of free-flowing leukocytes from the blood with subsequent leukocyte rolling, arrest, firm adhesion and ensuing diapedesis. these interactions occur under high shear stresses within venules and depend on multiple families of adhesion molecules. as a response to infection mediators, leukocyte gathering is considered to be crucial for the adequate defence of the organism to any kind of injury or infection. endothelial activation contributes significantly to the systemic inflammatory response to bacteraemia and increased  expression. release of soluble endothelial markers into the circulation has been  demonstrated together with elevated plasma levels of cams and has been reported in bacteraemic patients. it has been proposed that infection of endothelial cells with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, or staphylococcus epidermidis  induces surface expression of icam-1 and vcam-1 and monocyte adhesion. in general, leukocyte/endothelial cell interactions such as capture, rolling, and firm adhesion can no longer be viewed as occurring in discrete steps mediated by  individual families of adhesion molecules but rather as a series of overlapping synergistic interactions among adhesion molecules resulting in an adhesion cascade. these cascades thereby direct leukocyte migration, which is essential for the generation of effective inflammatory responses and the development of rapid immune responses.

TI  == adhesion of streptococcus mutans to different types of brackets.
AB  == objective: to examine the difference in the adhesion of streptococcus mutans to three different types of orthodontic brackets and the effect of the presence of an early salivary pellicle and streptococcus sanguis on adhesion. materials and methods: three adhesion experiments were performed using stainless steel, ceramic, and plastic orthodontic brackets. in the first experiment a clinical strain of s mutans adhered to the three different types of brackets (n = 6 for each). for the second, the brackets were treated with saliva before adhesion of s mutans (n = 6 per type of bracket). finally, the third experiment concerned saliva coated brackets (n = 6 per type of bracket), but before s mutans, s sanguis bacteria were allowed to adhere. the bacteria were always allowed to adhere for 90 minutes in all the experiments. adhesion was quantitated by a microbial culture technique by treating the brackets with adhering bacteria with  trypsin and enumerating the total viable counts of bacteria recovered after cultivation. results: there were consistently no differences in the adherence to  stainless steel, ceramic, or plastic brackets. the presence of an early salivary  pellicle and s sanguis reduced the number of adhering s mutans to all three types of brackets. conclusions: adhesion of bacteria to orthodontic brackets depends on several factors. the presence of a salivary pellicle and other bacterial species  seem to have a significant effect on the adhesion of s mutans, reducing their numbers and further limiting any differences between types of brackets.

TI  == guiding periodontal pocket recolonization: a proof of concept.
AB  == the complexity of the periodontal microbiota resembles that of the gastro-intestinal tract, where infectious diseases are treatable via probiotics.  in the oropharyngeal region, probiotic or replacement therapies have shown some benefit in the prevention of dental caries, otitis media, and pharyngitis, but their effectiveness in the treatment of periodontitis is unknown. therefore, this study addressed the hypothesis that the application of selected beneficial bacteria, as an adjunct to scaling and root planing, would inhibit the periodontopathogen recolonization of periodontal pockets. analysis of the data showed, in a beagle dog model, that when beneficial bacteria were applied in periodontal pockets adjunctively after root planing, subgingival recolonization of periodontopathogens was delayed and reduced, as was the degree of inflammation, at a clinically significant level. the study confirmed the hypothesis and provides a proof of concept for a guided pocket recolonization (gpr) approach in the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == innate immune responses of gingival epithelial cells to nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: we have previously reported different susceptibilities  of periodontopathic and nonperiodontopathic bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis by neutrophils. differences between the two groups of bacteria may exist also in their ability to induce immune responses from the host. therefore, we evaluated the effects of various oral bacteria on innate immune responses by gingival epithelial cells. material and methods: hok-16b cells were  cocultured with live or lysed nonperiodontopathic (n = 3) and periodontopathic (n = 5) bacterial species. the levels of human beta defensin-1, -2 and -3, and of the cathelicidin, ll-37, were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the accumulated interleukin-8 and interleukin-1 alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results:  nonperiodontopathic bacteria up-regulated some antimicrobial peptides without affecting the levels of cytokines. in the periodontopathic group, the orange-complex bacteria induced antimicrobial peptides and interleukin-8 efficiently, but the red-complex bacteria often demonstrated suppressive effects. in contrast to live bacteria, bacterial lysates had no suppressive effects. in addition, some bacterial lysates demonstrated a reduced ability to induce antimicrobial peptides compared with live bacteria. conclusion: the nonperiodontopathic, the orange-complex, and the red-complex bacteria had different effects on the innate immune responses from gingival epithelial cells,  which may affect the outcome of their host-microbial interaction in gingival sulcus.

TI  == in vitro anti-biofilm activity of macelignan isolated from myristica fragrans houtt. against oral primary colonizer bacteria.
AB  == in early dental plaque formation, oral primary colonizers such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus are initially attached to  the pellicle-coated tooth surface to form a biofilm. the study aimed to determine the efficacy of macelignan, isolated from nutmeg (myristica fragrans houtt.), in  removing each single oral primary biofilm in vitro on a polystyrene 96-well microtiter plate. four biofilm growth phases (4, 12, 20 and 24 h) were evaluated  in this study after treatment with macelignan at various concentrations (0.2, 2 and 10 microg/ml) and exposure times (5, 10 and 30 min). anti-biofilm activity of macelignan was measured as the percentage of the remaining biofilm absorbance after macelignan treatment in comparison with the untreated control. at 24 h of biofilm growth, s. mutans, a. viscosus and s. sanguis biofilms were reduced by up to 30%, 30% and 38%, respectively, after treatment with 10 microg/ml macelignan for 5 min. increasing the treatment time to 30 min resulted in a reduction of more than 50% of each of the single primary biofilms. the results indicate that macelignan is a potent natural anti-biofilm agent against oral primary colonizers.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of oral streptococci binding to the acquired pellicle by algal lectins.
AB  == aims: the initial colonization of the tooth by streptococci involves their attachment to adsorbed components of the acquired pellicle. avoiding this adhesion may be successful in preventing caries at early stages. salivary mucins  are glycoproteins that when absorbed onto hydroxyapatite may provide binding sites for certain bacteria. algal lectins may be especially interesting for oral  antiadhesion trials because of their great stability and high specificity for mucins. this work aimed to evaluate the potential of two algal lectins to inhibit the adherence of five streptococci species to the acquired pellicle in vitro. methods and results: the lectins used were extracted from bryothamnion triquetrum (btl) and bryothamnion seaforthii (bsl). fluorescence microscopy was applied to visualize the ability of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled lectins to attach to the pellicle and revealed a similar capability for both lectins. streptococcal adherence assays were performed using saliva-coated microtitre plates. bsl inhibited more than 75% of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus mutans adherence, achieving 92% to the latter. btl only obtained statistically significant results on s. mitis and s. sobrinus, whose adherence was decreased by 32.5% and 54.4%, respectively. conclusion: algal lectins are able to inhibit streptococcal adherence. significance and impact of the study: our results support the proposed application of lectins in antiadhesion therapeutics.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the transfer of bacterial doxycycline resistance between oral bacteria in subjects receiving systemic doxycycline for the treatment of periodontitis. patients and methods: streptococci were cultured before and after treatment from the subgingival plaque of two patients with periodontitis, genotyped and investigated for the presence of antimicrobial resistance determinants and conjugative transposons. results: in one subject, a strain of streptococcus sanguinis resistant to doxycycline was a minor component of the pre-treatment streptococcal flora but dominated post-treatment. in a second subject, a strain of streptococcus cristatus, which was sensitive to doxycycline before treatment, was found to have acquired a novel conjugative transposon during treatment, rendering it resistant to doxycycline and erythromycin. the novel transposon, named ctn6002, was sequenced and found to be a complex element derived in part from tn916, and an unknown element which included the erythromycin resistance gene erm(b). a strain of streptococcus oralis isolated from this subject pre-treatment was found to harbour ctn6002 and  was therefore implicated as the donor. conclusions: this is the first direct demonstration of transfer of antimicrobial resistance carried on a conjugative transposon between oral bacteria during systemic antimicrobial treatment of periodontitis in humans.

TI  == differential roles of individual domains in selection of secretion route of a streptococcus parasanguinis serine-rich adhesin, fap1.
AB  == fimbria-associated protein 1 (fap1) is a high-molecular-mass glycosylated surface adhesin required for fimbria biogenesis and biofilm formation in streptococcus parasanguinis. the secretion of mature fap1 is dependent on the presence of seca2, a protein with some homology to, but with a different role from, seca. the signals that direct the secretion of fap1 to the seca2-dependent secretion pathway rather than the seca-dependent secretion pathway have not yet been identified. in this study, fap1 variants containing different domains were expressed in both seca2 wild-type and mutant backgrounds and were tested for their ability to be secreted by the seca- or seca2-dependent pathway. the presence or absence of the cell wall anchor domain (residues 2531 to 2570) at the c terminus did not alter the selection of the fap1 secretion route. the fap1 signal peptide (residues 1 to 68) was sufficient to support the secretion of a heterologous protein via the seca-dependent pathway, suggesting that the signal peptide was sufficient for recognition by the seca-dependent pathway. the minimal sequences of fap1 required for the seca2-dependent pathway included the n-terminal signal peptide, nonrepetitive region i (residues 69 to 102), and part  of nonrepetitive region ii (residues 169 to 342). the two serine-rich repeat regions (residues 103 to 168 and 505 to 2530) were not required for fap1 secretion. however, they were both involved in the specific inhibition of fap1 secretion via the seca-dependent pathway.

TI  == adhesion of streptococcus sanguinis to glass surfaces measured by isothermal microcalorimetry (imc).
AB  == bacterial adhesion is the first step in the development of the oral biofilm, called dental plaque. plaque is the cause of caries, periodontal diseases, and periimplantitis. investigations of dental plaque, including bacterial adhesion, employ various in vivo and in vitro models using microscopic methods. microcalorimetry offers another direct approach. the model organism streptococcus sanguinis is one of the first colonizers adhering to the saliva-coated human tooth surfaces or dental materials within minutes after tooth cleaning. tam iii thermostats, equipped with microcalorimeters, were used for isothermal microcalorimetric (imc) measurements of heat production as a function of time, expressed by power-time (p-t) curves. continuous measurements of heat production  of growing s. sanguinis cells showed their overall metabolic activity and were highly reproducible. for the adhesion experiments the bacteria were allowed to adhere to different amounts of glass beads. growing s. sanguinis cells produced a characteristic p-t curve with a maximum of 500 microw at 4.5 h when reaching 10(9) cells ml(-1). the same number of stationary s. sanguinis cells, suspended in pbs produced only approximately 30 microw at 0.5 h due to adhesion. but the amount of heat increased with available glass surface area, indicating that a portion of the heat of adhesion was measured. similar results were obtained with  stationary s. sanguinis cells suspended in human saliva. this study shows that microcalorimetric evaluation of initial bacterial adhesion is indeed possible and may become a rapid, reproducible screening method to study adhesion of different  bacteria to different dental materials or to modified surfaces.

TI  == bacteria interfere with a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization.
AB  == it is known that beneficial bacteria can suppress the emergence of pathogenic bacteria, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. this study examined the potential for a similar suppression of aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus)  actinomycetemcomitans colonization of epithelial cells, due to its potential relevance in periodontal diseases. seven presumed beneficial bacteria were examined for their ability to interfere, exclude, or displace a. actinomycetemcomitans from epithelial cells in vitro. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius showed prominent inhibitory effects on either a. actinomycetemcomitans recovery or colonization. these results confirmed the hypothesis that bacterial interactions interfere with a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of epithelial cells in vitro, and demonstrated the potential beneficial effects of s. mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguinis.

TI  == production of antagonistic substance by eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == pro-inflammatory cellular immune response in behcet's disease.
AB  == several proteins are investigated as candidate auto-antigens in the pathogenesis  of behcet's disease (bd). this study aimed to screen the cellular responses to auto-antigen (alphab-crystallin, alphabc), and microorganism (streptococcus sangius kth-1 bes-1 protein) derived peptides as well as to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (ipp). peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) from 22 bd patients and 22 healthy controls (hc) were stimulated in vitro with alphabc, bes-1 peptides, ipp and ppd and induced proliferation as well as the secreted interleukin (il)-12 and interferon (ifn)-gamma production levels were measured. we did not observe any significant difference in cellular proliferation between bd patients and hc. induction of il-12 secretion with alphabc was stronger in bd  patients (p = 0.04) and in the disease subgroup with uveitis (p = 0.027) compared the hc. when responses to ppd were compared, proliferation of pmbc was lower (p = 0.03), whereas il-12 secretion was higher in bd (p = 0.04) as well as in patients under colchicum treatment (p = 0.04) and with vascular involvement (p = 0.006) compared to hc. bes-1(373-385 )peptide induced also higher il-12 productions by pbmc of bd patients (p = 0.017) and of patients with uveitis (p = 0.013). finally, ipp stimulated higher il-12 secretions from pbmc in bd patients (p = 0.035) and in patients with (p = 0.02) or without (p = 0.017) uveitis or arthritis (p = 0.04), under colchicum treatment (p = 0.01) or not receiving any immunosuppressive treatment (p = 0.007) compared to hc. these results suggest a more prominent pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion from pbmc in bd patients compared to hc in response to various antigens including alphabc protein, bes-1(373-385), ipp and ppd.

TI  == bacterial species in subgingival plaque and oral bone loss in postmenopausal women.
AB  == background: oral bacteria are widely recognized in the etiology of periodontal disease. we investigated the prevalence of subgingival bacterial infection with eight species, tested associations between infection and oral bone loss, and assessed potential confounding factors and effect modifiers of those associations in a large community-based cohort of postmenopausal women. methods: a cross-sectional study of oral health and osteoporosis in 1,256 postmenopausal women recruited from the buffalo, new york women's health initiative observational study was conducted. standardized dental radiographs were used to measure alveolar crestal height (ach). subgingival plaque samples were taken, and the presence of eight bacterial species was assessed by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy in each participant. results: the most prevalent infection was streptococcus sanguis (59.5%), followed by prevotella intermedia (43.4%), tannerella forsythensis (37.9%), capnocytophaga sp. (36.9%), eubacterium saburreum (32.7%), campylobacter rectus (17.4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (15.1%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (14.2%). infections with p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, p. intermedia, and c. rectus were associated with an increased likelihood of having oral bone loss as measured by ach, even after adjustment for age, smoking, and income. the body mass index (bmi) was a modifier of this association. overweight women with t. forsythensis infection were more likely to  have oral bone loss (or = 3.37; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.08 to 5.46) than  normal weight (or = 1.27; 95% ci: 0.82 to 1.98) or obese (or = 1.26, 95% ci: 0.72 to 2.20) women with t. forsythensis infection. conclusions: the prevalence of specific bacterial infections was determined for a large group of postmenopausal  women. those with infection were more likely to have oral bone loss. further studies should investigate potential modifying effects of bmi and/or inflammatory factors.

TI  == odontogenic bacteria in periodontal disease and resistance patterns to common antibiotics used as treatment and prophylaxis in odontology in spain.
AB  == resistance in streptococci or gram-negative bacteria is associated with antibiotic consumption. scarce information exists on the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from patients with periodontitis in countries with high antibiotic consumption, as this is an area in which microbiological testing is not performed in daily practice. the present study was undertaken to explore the susceptibility of bacterial isolates in periodontitis to antibiotics prescribed in odontology in spain as treatment for local infections or prophylaxis for distant focal infections. periodontal samples were  prospectively collected in 48 patients classified by pocket depth of <4 mm and >or=4 mm. species were identified by culture, selecting the five most frequent morphotypes per sample, and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). susceptibility was determined by e-test. a total of 261 isolates were identified: 72.9% patients had streptococcus oralis; 70.8% streptococcus mitis; 60.4% prevotella buccae; 39.6% prevotella denticola; 37.5% fusobacterium nucleatum; 35.4% prevotella intermedia; 25% capnocytophaga spp.; 23% veillonella spp.; 22.9% prevotella melaninogenica and streptococcus sanguis; and <20% other species. streptococcus viridans resistance rates were 0% for amoxicillin, approximately 10% for clindamycin, 9-22% for tetracycline, and for azithromycin ranged from 18.2% for s. sanguis to  47.7% for s. mitis. prevotella isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, with amoxicillin resistance ranging from 17.1% in p. buccae to 26.3% in p. denticola. metronidazole resistance was <6% in all prevotella species, while clindamycin resistance ranged from 0 to 21.1%. beta-lactamase production was positive in 54.1% prevotella spp., 38.9% f. nucleatum, 30% capnocytophaga spp., and 10% veillonella spp. in this study, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was the most active antibiotic against all species tested, followed by metronidazole in the case of anaerobes.

TI  == development of species-specific primers for detection of streptococcus mutans in  mixed bacterial samples.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is the major microbial pathogen associated with dental caries in children. the objectives of this study were to design and evaluate species-specific primers for the identification of s. mutans. validation of the best primer set, sm479f/r, was performed using seven s. mutans reference strains, 48 atcc non-s. mutans strains, 92 s. mutans clinical isolates, dna samples of s.  mutans-streptococcus sobrinus or s. mutans-streptococcus sanguinis, and mixed bacterial dna of saliva samples from 33 18-month-old children. all of the s. mutans samples tested positive, and no pcr products were amplified from members of the other streptococci or nonstreptococci strains examined. the lowest detection level for pcr was 10(-2) ng of s. mutans dna (c. 4.6 x 10(3) copies) in the test samples. the results of this study suggest that the sm479f/r primer pair is highly specific and sensitive for identification of s. mutans in either purified or mixed dna samples.

TI  == identification of a novel streptococcal gene cassette mediating sos mutagenesis in streptococcus uberis.
AB  == streptococci have been considered to lack the classical sos response, defined by  increased mutation after uv exposure and regulation by lexa. here we report the identification of a potential self-regulated sos mutagenesis gene cassette in the streptococcaceae family. exposure to uv light was found to increase mutations to  antibiotic resistance in streptococcus uberis cultures. the mutational spectra revealed mainly g:c-->a:t transitions, and northern analyses demonstrated increased expression of a y-family dna polymerase resembling umuc under dna-damaging conditions. in the absence of the y-family polymerase, s. uberis cells were sensitive to uv light and to mitomycin c. furthermore, the uv-induced  mutagenesis was almost completely abolished in cells deficient in the y-family polymerase. the gene encoding the y-family polymerase was localized in a four-gene operon including two hypothetical genes and a gene encoding a hdir homolog. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that s. uberis hdir binds specifically to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter region of the four-gene operon. database searches revealed conservation of the gene cassette in several streptococcus species, including at least one genome each of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus thermophilus strains. in addition, the umuc operon was localized in several mobile dna elements of streptococcus and lactococcus species. we conclude that the hdir-umuc-orf3-orf4 operon represents a novel gene cassette capable of mediating sos mutagenesis among members of the streptococcaceae.

TI  == the microbiological profiles of saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque and  dental caries in adults with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.
AB  == introduction: the relationships between suspected bacteria in saliva, yeasts in oral rinse, and supragingival and subgingival plaque versus root surface and coronal caries in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a non-diabetic group were explored. methods: one-hundred and five patients with type 2 diabetes and 103 non-diabetic subjects were recruited; their periodontal status, plaque index  and magnitude of root surface and coronal caries were assessed. saliva and an oral rinse were cultured for mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts. toothbrush samples of supragingival plaque and curette samples of subgingival plaque were assessed for 17 bacterial species using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: type 2 diabetes patients had significantly more severe periodontitis, a higher plaque index and a higher prevalence and magnitude of root surface caries than non-diabetic subjects. significantly more diabetic subjects had higher levels of treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus intermedius in their supragingival plaque than non-diabetic subjects. no significant difference  was found for the organisms in saliva, oral rinse and subgingival plaque between  the two groups. after adjustment for diabetic status, root surface caries was associated with an increased count of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts in saliva and of streptococcus mutans in supragingival plaque samples. coronal caries was only associated with lactobacilli and yeasts in saliva. conclusion: the number of cariogenic organisms in saliva and oral rinse estimated by culture demonstrated a stronger association with both root surface and coronal caries compared to those 17 species assessed with the checkerboard method in supragingival and subgingival plaque.

TI  == oral streptococcal strains isolated from odontogenic infections and their susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify at species level and to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility of oral streptococcal strains isolated from 100 pus samples collected from romanian patients with different odontogenic infections. the isolates were identified at species level using the rapid id 32 strep system  and their susceptibility was testing by the etest, against: penicillin g, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline. for the investigation of  erythromycin resistance phenotype the disk diffusion test was used. the isolates  belonged to several species, with streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis predominating. reduced susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was found only among the isolates belonging to s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups. resistance to erythromycin was detected among all species, except for: s. constellatus, s. intermedius and s. gordonii, and the m phenotype was established, while resistance to tetracycline was detected within all species but s. gordonii. in contrast, clindamycin was fully active. as most odontogenic infections are mixed  infections, often involving strictly anaerobic bacteria, which are frequently beta-lactamase producers, the association of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, like amoxiclav, is recommended when the antimicrobial treatment is necessary.

TI  == effect of 308-nm excimer laser light on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria: an  in vitro investigation.
AB  == dental implants are becoming increasingly important in prosthodontic rehabilitation. bacterial infections, however, can induce bone loss and jeopardize clinical success. recent literature has demonstrated that infrared co(2) laser light is suitable for the decontamination of exposed implant surfaces. the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308-nm excimer laser irradiation on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria in vitro. in this study, a xecl excimer laser (308 nm) was used (summit technology, boston, usa). both aerobe (streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii) and  anaerobe microorganisms (a. odontolyticus, prevotella melaninogenica) were tested. according to previous studies, a constant energy of 0.8 j/cm(2) and a constant frequency of 20 hz were used for all irradiations. colony-forming units  after laser irradiation were counted. excimer laser irradiation showed significant influence on the growth of all microorganisms. as compared to s. mutans and s. sanguis, a. naeslundii demonstrated higher sensitivity to laser irradiation. anaerobe microorganisms, in contrast, demonstrated that a total of 200 pulses were sufficient to reduce the replication of these germs for more than 99.9%. excimer laser irradiation (lambda = 308 nm) can significantly reduce both  aerobe and anaerobe microorganisms. depending on the parameters chosen, 200 pulses are sufficient for sterilization. new studies are necessary to evaluate if this wavelength is more of value in the treatment of peri-implantitis than other  wavelengths or conventional therapies.

TI  == genome of the opportunistic pathogen streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == the genome of streptococcus sanguinis is a circular dna molecule consisting of 2,388,435 bp and is 177 to 590 kb larger than the other 21 streptococcal genomes  that have been sequenced. the g+c content of the s. sanguinis genome is 43.4%, which is considerably higher than the g+c contents of other streptococci. the genome encodes 2,274 predicted proteins, 61 trnas, and four rrna operons. a 70-kb region encoding pathways for vitamin b(12) biosynthesis and degradation of ethanolamine and propanediol was apparently acquired by horizontal gene transfer. the gene complement suggests new hypotheses for the pathogenesis and virulence of s. sanguinis and differs from the gene complements of other pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci. in particular, s. sanguinis possesses a remarkable abundance of putative surface proteins, which may permit it to be a primary colonizer of the oral cavity and agent of streptococcal endocarditis and infection in neutropenic patients.

TI  == streptococcus gordonii hsa environmentally constrains competitive binding by streptococcus sanguinis to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  == competition between pioneer colonizing bacteria may determine polymicrobial succession during dental plaque development, but the ecological constraints are poorly understood. for example, more streptococcus sanguinis than streptococcus gordonii organisms are consistently isolated from the same intraoral sites, yet s. gordonii fails to be excluded and survives as a species over time. to explain  this observation, we hypothesized that s. gordonii could compete with s. sanguinis to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha), an in vitro model of the tooth surface. both species bound similarly to sha, yet 10- to 50-fold excess s. gordonii dl1 reduced binding of s. sanguinis sk36 by 85 to >95%. s. sanguinis, by contrast, did not significantly compete with s. gordonii to adhere. s. gordonii competed with s. sanguinis more effectively than other species of oral streptococci and depended upon the salivary film on ha. next, putative s. gordonii adhesins were analyzed for contributions to interspecies competitive binding. like wild-type s. gordonii, isogenic mutants with mutations in antigen i/ii polypeptides (sspab), amylase-binding proteins (abpab), and csh adhesins (cshab) competed effectively against s. sanguinis. by contrast, an hsa-deficient  mutant of s. gordonii showed significantly reduced binding and competitive capabilities, while these properties were restored in an hsa-complemented strain. thus, hsa confers a selective advantage to s. gordonii over s. sanguinis in competitive binding to sha. hsa expression may, therefore, serve as an environmental constraint against s. sanguinis, enabling s. gordonii to persist within the oral cavity, despite the greater natural prevalence of s. sanguinis in plaque and saliva.

TI  == infective endocarditis and dentistry: the legal basis for an association.
AB  == objectives: the objectives of this study were to determine on what evidence infective endocarditis (ie) could be legally linked to dental treatment. method:  the records of 319 legal cases involving dental treatment as the probable cause of ie were analysed. the medical history, type of dental operation, and whether antibiotic prophylaxis was provided were noted. the time taken for the onset of symptoms (incubation period) and hospitalisation was calculated. the identity of  the infecting micro-organism was investigated and it was also noted whether litigation was successful for the patient. results: a total of 83 patients were successful in legally linking dental treatment to the onset of infective endocarditis. in all successful cases there was a short incubation period (circa  nine days) and in 80 of the patients an oral streptococcus was isolated. the dental operations included exodontia (28), scaling (29), endodontics (12) and minor oral surgery (11). conclusions: dental treatment was deemed to be the probable cause of ie in 26% of patients who sought litigation. in the majority of legal cases clinicians did not follow recognised guidelines or keep adequate clinical notes. the three main factors which link dental procedures legally were  the dental operation, the isolation from the blood of an oral micro-organism and  a short incubation period.

TI  == sensitivity of oral bacteria to 254 nm ultraviolet light.
AB  == aim: to explore the sensitivity of bacteria commonly found in root canals to 254  nm ultraviolet (uv) light, either as individual cells or as participants of a bacterial multilayer. methodology: the sensitivity of oral bacteria, as individual cells, to uv light was tested by subjecting plates streaked with bacteria to 254 nm uv, at a fluence of 1-20 mj cm(-2). an experimental model was  designed to produce a bacterial multilayer and to study absorption of uv light by bacteria in an outer layer and its effect on the elimination of bacteria in the inner layer. results: direct exposure to relatively low doses of uv light (2-7 mj cm(-2)) effectively eliminated all bacterial strains tested. furthermore, an enterococcus faecalis strain, partially resistant to a 24 h exposure to calcium hydroxide, was effectively eliminated within several seconds of exposure to uv light (p < 0.001). uv was absorbed by a multilayer of bacteria. when 4 bacterial  cells microm(-2) were present in the light path, the uv light dose had to be increased by a factor of x10 to achieve 100% elimination of the bacteria in an inner layer. conclusions: the application of uv light to eliminate endodontic pathogens may be possible. nevertheless, its absorbance by outer layers of bacteria should be considered and the uv light dose adapted accordingly.

TI  == identification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by pyrosequencing the 16s rrna gene and by use of vitek 2.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic streptococci are very difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. in this study, a pyrosequencing method for the identification of streptococcal species based on two variable regions of the 16s rrna gene is described. almost all studied streptococcal species (n = 51) represented by their type strains could be differentiated except for some closely related species of the streptococcus bovis or s. salivarius group. the pyrosequencing results of alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood (n = 99) or from the normal pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results obtained by the vitek 2 with gp card (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). as expected, the results of  the two methods did not completely agree, but 93 (75.0%) of the isolates assigned to the same streptococcal group by both methods and 57 (46.0%) reached consistent results at the species level. however, 10 strains remained unidentified by vitek  2, and 4 isolates could not be assigned to any streptococcal group by pyrosequencing. identification of members of the s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups proved difficult for both methods. furthermore, the pyrosequencing analysis revealed great sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of the 133 isolates analyzed by pyrosequencing had sequences identical to a type strain. the variation was greatest in the pharyngeal isolates, slightly lower in the blood culture isolates, and nonexistent in invasive pneumococcal isolates (n = 17) that all had the s. pneumoniae type strain sequence. the resolution of the results obtained by the two methods is impeded by the lack of a proper gold standard.

TI  == bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis.
AB  == background: aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. the aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial dna using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)  gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. methods: universal eubacterial primers  were used to amplify 16s rrna bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. subsequently, pcr amplicons were cloned into escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity  or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in genbank. results: sequences of stenotrophomonas spp., including s. maltophilia (formerly pseudomonas homology group v) were detected in six aneurysm samples. propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and brevundimonas diminuta (formerly p. diminuta) in four samples. other species previously assigned to the pseudomonas genus such as comamonas testosteroni, delftia acidovorans, burkholderia cepacia, herbaspirillum sp., and acidovorax sp. were also detected. some clones fell into other environmental species, including methylobacterium sp. and bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria  that have not yet been cultivated. dna sequences from oral bacteria, including streptococcus sanguinis, tannerella forsythia, and leptotrichia buccalis were detected. sequences from prevotella melaninogenica and lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. additional species included dermacoccus spp. and corynebacterium vitaeruminis. conclusions: a wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development.  several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. clinical relevance: although chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. in the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. the presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at c.pneumoniae.

TI  == relationship between the ability of oral streptococci to interact with platelet glycoprotein ibalpha and with the salivary low-molecular-weight mucin, mg2.
AB  == the oral streptococci streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis are common aetiological agents of infective endocarditis, and their ability to adhere to and induce the aggregation of platelets is thought to be a virulence trait. the platelet glycoprotein gpibalpha has been implicated  as the adhesion receptor for s. sanguinis and s. gordonii, but it is not known if this is the case for s. oralis and other species. the aim of this study was to determine the gpibalpha-interactive capability of a range of oral streptococci and to determine the relationship between this capability and their ability to interact with the salivary constituents that they would encounter in their normal habitat. all platelet-adhesive s. sanguinis strains and most s. gordonii strains  adhered in a gpibalpha-dependent manner, but strains of s. oralis, streptococcus  cristatus, streptococcus parasanguinis and streptococcus mitis had no direct affinity for platelets. those strains that were able to bind gpibalpha also bound to the low-molecular-weight submandibular salivary mucin, mg2, and this interaction was sialic acid-dependent. the data suggest that s. sanguinis and s.  gordonii may be efficient colonizers of platelet vegetations because of their adaptation to recognize sialylated salivary mucins. in contrast, s. oralis does not interact with platelets and so is likely to colonize vegetations through an as yet unidentified mechanism.

TI  == antibacterial effect of two mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) preparations against enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus sanguis in vitro.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of gray-colored mta (gmta) and white-colored mta (wmta) against enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus sanguis were assessed in vitro using the tube dilution test. broth tubes were prepared and divided into experimental and control groups. aliquots of each of the tested microorganisms were taken from a stock culture and added to each experimental and positive control group. all groups were incubated at 37 degrees c and evaluated for turbidity at 0, 1, 24, 48, and 72-hour time periods. a direct correlation was found between gmta and wmta concentrations and their antibacterial effect. tubes  containing gmta in concentrations of 50, 25, and 12.5 mg/ml did not show e. faecalis growth at any of the time periods tested whereas tubes containing wmta showed e. faecalis growth at all concentrations and time periods tested. statistically significant differences were found between tubes containing gmta in concentrations of 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/ml and tubes containing similar concentrations of wmta (p < 0.001). tubes containing gmta in concentrations of 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, and 3.12 mg/ml and tubes containing wmta in concentrations of 50, 25, and 12.5 mg/ml did not show s. sanguis growth at any of the time periods  tested. statistically significant differences were found between tubes containing gmta in concentrations 6.25 and 3.12 mg/ml and tubes containing similar concentrations of wmta (p < 0.001). it appears that the susceptibility of e. faecalis and s. sanguis to mta differed and that gmta requires lower concentrations than wmta to exert the same antibacterial effect against each of the microorganisms tested.

TI  == role of streptococcus sanguinis sortase a in bacterial colonization.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis, a normal inhabitant of the human oral cavity, has low cariogenicity, though colonization on tooth surfaces by this bacterium initiates  aggregation by other oral bacteria and maturation of dental plaque. additionally, s. sanguinis is frequently isolated from infective endocarditis patients. we investigated the functions of sortase a (srta), which cleaves lpxtg-containing proteins and anchors them to the bacterial cell wall, as a possible virulence factor of s. sanguinis. we identified the srta gene of s. sanguinis by searching  a homologous gene of streptococcus mutans in genome databases. next, we constructed an srta-deficient mutant strain of s. sanguinis by insertional inactivation and compared it to the wild type strain. in the case of the mutant strain, some surface proteins could not anchor to the cell wall and were partially released into the culture supernatant. furthermore, adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and polystyrene plates, as well as adherence to and invasion of human epithelial cells were reduced significantly in the srta-deficient strain when compared to the wild type. in addition, antiopsonization levels and bacterial survival of the srta-deficient mutant were  decreased in human whole blood. this is the first known study to report that srta contributes to antiopsonization in streptococci. our results suggest that srta anchors surface adhesins as well as some proteins that function as antiopsonic molecules as a means of evading the human immune system. furthermore, they demonstrate that srta of s. sanguinis plays important roles in bacterial colonization.

TI  == multiparameter assessments to determine the effects of sugars and antimicrobials  on a polymicrobial oral biofilm.
AB  == clinical studies indicate relationships between dental plaque, a naturally formed biofilm, and oral diseases. the crucial role of nonmicrobial biofilm constituents in maintaining biofilm structure and biofilm-specific attributes, such as resistance to shear and viscoelasticity, is increasingly recognized. concurrent analyses of the diverse nonmicrobial biofilm components for multiparameter assessments formed the focus of this investigation. comparable numbers of actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, neisseria subflava, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells were seeded into multiple wells of 96-well polystyrene plates for biofilm formation. quantitative  fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) examined the influences of dietary sugars, incubation conditions, ingredients in oral hygiene  formulations, and antibiotics on biofilm components. biofilm extracellular polymeric substances (eps) were examined with an optimized mixture of fluorescent lectins, with biofilm proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids detected with specific  fluorescent stains. anaerobic incubation of biofilms resulted in significantly more biofilm eps and extractable carbohydrates than those formed under aerobic conditions (p < 0.05). sucrose significantly enhanced biofilm eps in comparison to fructose, galactose, glucose, and lactose (p < 0.05). clsm demonstrated thicker biofilms under sucrose-replete conditions, along with significant increases in biofilm eps, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, than under conditions of sucrose deficiency (p < 0.05). agents in oral hygiene formulations  (chlorhexidine, ethanol, and sodium lauryl sulfate), a mucolytic agent (n-acetyl-l-cysteine), and antibiotics with different modes of action (amoxicillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin) inhibited biofilm components (p < 0.05). multiparameter analysis indicated a dose-dependent inhibition of biofilm eps and protein by chlorhexidine and sodium lauryl sulfate, along with distinctive inhibitory patterns for subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. collectively, these results highlight multiparameter assessments as  a broad platform for simultaneous assessment of diverse biofilm components.

TI  == tigecycline (gar-936) activity against streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci including streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly s. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. tigecycline (gar-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with  a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. the studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and fewer  strains of s. gallolyticus (98 strains) and streptococcus mutans (50 strains). these strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted  by clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/ml for tigecycline per us food and drug administration). penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (s. sanguis) to 98% (s. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was  also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for s. gallolyticus. in conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and s. gallolyticus with an overall mic90 at < or = 0.06 microg/ml; the highest mic was only 0.25 microg/ml.

TI  == in vitro anti-microbial and in vivo cytokine modulating effects of different prepared chinese herbal medicines.
AB  == the toxicity, antimicrobial and cytokine modulating effects of herbal medicines in treating periodontal diseases were evaluated in this study. using the broth dilution method and disc agar diffusion test, in individual and combined decocted preparations, different concentrations of ching-wei-san and its individual herbal components, coptidis rhizoma, angelicae sinensis radix, rehmanniae radixet rhizom, moutan radicis cortex, and cimicifuga foetida, were tested for in vitro inhibitory effects on three well-known plaque-causing bacteria, porphyromonas gingivialis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mutans, and two common pathogens, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. the cytokine modulating effects were evaluated in balb/c mice. the results suggested that one milliliter  ching-wei-san at the 25,000 mg/ml concentration daily for the mice had significantly high levels in the liver function indexes in the 3-day acute toxicity test and in both the liver and kidney function indexes in the 28-day subacute toxicity test (p<0.01). the 250 mg/ml ching-wei-san is comparable to 250 mg/ml of tetracycline, and had similar inhibitory effects on the tested bacteria. coptidis rhizoma (62.5 mg/ml) was the only individual herbal component to show 100% inhibitory effects. the mean cytokine ratios of il-2, il-4, ifn-gamma, and tnf-alpha in balb/c mice treated with individual herbal components were shown to  be different from each other. ching-wei-san modulated the immunity of mice, up-regulated il-2, il-4 and tnf-alpha, but down-regulated ifn-gamma. the effects  of none of the individual herbal components alone can substitute for the cumulative effect of ching-wei-san.

TI  == [effects of chitosans with different molecular weights on streptococcus sanguis biofilm].
AB  == purpose: to investigate the effects of chitosan on streptococcus sanguis biofilm. methods: streptococcus sanguis biofilm was formed on saliva-coated glass (scg) in a flow culture system, then exposed to 2% chitosans with different molecular weights (5 cps, 80 cps, 600 cps) for 3, 10, 30 minutes. confocal laser scanning microscope and vital/dead fluorescent staining technique (vital stained green, dead stained red) were combined to observe the biofilm thickness, bacterial density. analysis of variance was used for comparison. results: the biofilm thickness and bacterial density reduced significantly after treatment by 2% chitosan. of all the treatment groups, 5 cps (low molecular weight) chitosan is most effective (p<0.01). conclusions: 5 cps (low molecular weight) chitosan seems to be most effective in detaching biofilm.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == sites in the ch3 domain of human iga1 that influence sensitivity to bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influence of regions, other than the hinge, on the susceptibility of human iga1 to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases, was examined using iga1 mutants bearing amino acid deletions, substitutions, and domain swaps. iga1 lacking the tailpiece retained its susceptibility to cleavage by all of the iga1  proteases. the domain swap molecule alpha1alpha2gamma3, in which the ch3 domain of iga1 was exchanged for that of human igg1, was resistant to cleavage with the  type 1 and 2 serine iga1 proteases of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae, but remained sensitive to cleavage with  the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. substitution of the iga1 calpha3  domain motif pro440 -phe443 into the corresponding position in the cgamma3 domain of alpha1alpha2gamma3 resulted now in sensitivity to the type 2 iga1 protease of  n. meningitidis, indicating the possible requirement of these amino acids for sensitivity to this protease. for the h. influenzae type 2 protease, resistance of an iga1 mutant in which the ch3 domain residues 399-409 were exchanged with those from igg1, but sensitivity of mutant hubovalpha3 in which the calpha3 domain of bovine iga replaces that of human iga1, suggests that ch3 domain residues glu403, gln406, and thr409 influence sensitivity to this enzyme. hence,  unlike the situation with the metallo-iga1 proteases of streptococcus spp., the sensitivity of human iga1 to cleavage with the serine iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus involves their binding to different sites specifically in the ch3 domain.

TI  == the effect of saliva or serum on bacterial and candida albicans colonization on type i collagen.
AB  == colonization of candida albicans on oral surfaces can serve as a reservoir for disseminated infections, such as aspiration pneumonia and gastrointestinal infection, particularly in the immunocompromised host. therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of salivary and serum pellicles on c. albicans, streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, lactobacillus and actinomyces colonization on type i collagen, a major organic component of periodontal ligaments. the colonization potential of two isolates each of c. albicans, s. mutans and s. sanguis, and a single isolate each of lactobacillus and actinomyces to uncoated (control), saliva-coated or serum-coated type i collagen plates (surface area 143 mm(2), cell disk; sumitomo, tokyo, japan) was examined using a  bioluminescent adenosine triphosphate assay based on firefly luciferase-luciferin system. the results revealed that with mutans streptococci, a saliva pellicle was significantly more effective in promoting bacterial colonization compared with the pellicle-free collagen disc, and the serum-coated sample significantly inhibited the colonization of streptococci (anova; p < 0b01). in contrast, in the case of c. albicans, lactobacillus and actinomyces isolates, a serum pellicle was significantly more effective in promoting the colonization, followed by saliva pellicle and uncoated specimen (anova; p < 0b01). these results suggested that crevicular fluid rich in seruminous components would promote the colonization of  candida, lactobacillus and actinomyces on type i collagen as opposed to streptococci which showed greater avidity to saliva-coated collagen.

TI  == resistance to acidic and alkaline environments in the endodontic pathogen enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == background/aims: this study aimed to investigate the biochemical mechanisms employed by the endodontic pathogen enterococcus faecalis to confer acid- and alkali-resistance and to compare these with the mechanisms of representative oral streptococci. methods: e. faecalis jcm8728, streptococcus mutans nctc10449 and streptococcus sanguinis atcc10556 were used to assess both acid- and alkali-resistance by examining: (i) growth in complex media; (ii) stability of intracellular ph (ph(in)); (iii) cell durability to leakage of preloaded bcecf (2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxy-fluorescein); and (iv) cell permeability  to sytox-green. results: growth was initiated by e. faecalis at ph 4.0-11.0, by s. mutans at ph 4.0-9.0 and by s. sanguinis at ph 5.0-9.0. the ph(in) was similar to the extracellular ph in s. mutans and s. sanguinis at ph 5-10, while the ph(in) of e. faecalis was maintained at approximately 7.5-8.5 when extracellular  ph was 7.5-10 and was maintained at levels equivalent to the extracellular ph when ph < 7.5. cell membranes of e. faecalis were resistant to bcecf leakage when extracellular ph was 2.5-12 and to sytox-green permeability at ph 4-10. the cell  membrane durability to extracellular ph in e. faecalis was higher than that observed in the streptococcus strains. conclusion: compared to s. mutans, e. faecalis was found to be equally resistant to acid and more resistant to alkalis. the results suggest that ph-resistance in e. faecalis is attributed to membrane durability against acid and alkali, in addition to cell membrane-bound proton-transport systems. these characteristics may account for why e. faecalis is frequently isolated from acidic caries lesions and from persistently infected  root canals where calcium hydroxide medication is ineffective.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine if cocoa polyphenols could interfere with  biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans or streptococcus sanguinis, and reduce  acid production from sucrose by s. mutans. the antimicrobial activity of cocoa polyphenols was assessed against cariogenic (s. mutans) and health-associated (s. sanguinis) species by minimum inhibitory concentration assays. cocoa polyphenol dimer, tetramer, and pentamer inhibited the growth of s. sanguinis, whereas the growth of s. mutans was unaffected. however, pretreatment of surfaces with cocoa  polyphenol pentamer (35 microm) reduced biofilm formation by s. mutans at 4 and 24 h, whereas the effects on s. sanguinis were less consistent. in contrast, brief exposure of preformed biofilms to pentamer either had no significant effect or resulted in increased counts of s. mutans under certain conditions. cocoa polyphenol pentamer (500 microm) significantly reduced the terminal ph, and inhibited the rate of acid production by s. mutans at ph 7.0. in conclusion, cocoa polyphenols can reduce biofilm formation by s. mutans and s. sanguinis, and inhibit acid production by s. mutans.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == the role of platelets in infective endocarditis.
AB  == there is growing evidence that platelets play an important role in the development of infective endocarditis (ie). this review focuses on interactions between bacteria and platelets. many types of microorganism are capable of causing endocarditis. the oral streptococci, particularly streptococcus sanguis and s. oralis, remain the most common causative bacteria in ie but staphylococcus aureus is becoming an increasingly important agent. several species of bacteria and fungi are able to cause platelet aggregation in vitro, and there are indications that this ability is associated with the production of severe disease. different bacteria appear to utilise different mechanisms of aggregation, and mechanisms for adhesion may be distinct from those responsible for aggregation. at least one commonly studied strain of s. sanguis apparently utilises the host's igg and complement responses to induce platelet activation. ie may therefore be among the number of diseases in which immunological activation of platelets is thought to be of importance. other bacterial strains have their own adhesins and agonists. the more virulent bacteria, notably the staphylococci, also possess proteolytic enzymes and may directly activate coagulation pathways, whereas less virulent, opportunistic pathogens, such as some streptococci and candida albicans, may rely on interactions with host factors for colonisation and proliferation. it is proposed that platelets are involved in formation of the non-bacterial thrombotic vegetation (nbtv) and are necessary for the effective adhesion of bacteria to the nbtv, and that platelets  also influence the persistence and clinical outcome of the disease through proliferation of the thrombotic vegetation. it is hypothesised that successful colonisation of the heart valves by a micro-organism depends on effective adhesion of the bacteria or fungi to platelets, in combination with the ability to induce platelet activation and aggregation.

TI  == secretory iga, salivary peroxidase, and catalase-mediated microbicidal activity during hydrogen peroxide catabolism in viridans streptococci: pathogen coaggregation.
AB  == viridans streptococci can kill methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) through the production of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). however, several hundred viridans streptococci cells are necessary to kill 1 cfu of mrsa. we analyzed the  potency of bactericidal and fungicidal effector molecules induced by catabolism of h2o2 in the oral cavity. secretory iga (siga) and an unidentified salivary component bound streptococcus sanguinis, a viridans streprococcus, and mrsa into  coaggregates. in these coaggregates, salivary peroxidase and the mrsa catalase produced singlet molecular oxygen (1o2) from h2o2 produced by viridans streptococci. siga converted 1o2 into ozone, which has potent bactericidal and fungicidal activity. we calculated that <10 cfu of streptococcus sanguinis were necessary to kill 1 cfu of mrsa in the coaggregate. siga, aspergillus niger catalase, and h2o2 in saliva killed candida albicans, which is highly resistant to reagent h2o2. together with indigenous bacteria and innate immunity, siga potentially constitutes a novel system that may sustain oral homeostasis.

TI  == multiple exposures to chlorhexidine and xylitol: adhesion and biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == growing evidence from clinical studies suggests that mothers using xylitol gums or lozenges have decreased levels of streptococcus mutans (sm) and do not transmit these cariogenic bacteria as readily to their children. to begin to determine mechanisms for these clinical findings and to explore potential synergism of antimicrobial combinations, we studied the effect of multiple exposures of chlorhexidine (chx) combined with copper gluconate (cg) or zinc gluconate (zg) followed by xylitol (xyl) on the ability of sm to adhere and form  biofilms. cell suspensions of sm were exposed two times to chx; cg; chx plus cg;  zg; and chx plus zg, and then four times to xyl. control cells were exposed six times to water or xyl or received no treatment. for biofilm assessment, glass slides were inoculated with treated cells, and numbers of bacteria were enumerated after 48 hours of incubation. to assess the ability of sm to adhere, microtiter plate wells coated with primary s. sanguinis biofilms grown in sucrose were inoculated with treated sm, and adhesion was determined. cells exposed to chx-xyl combinations exhibited significant but transient inhibition of growth. the multiple-exposure regimen groups showed significant decreases in the ability  of sm to form biofilms (p < 0.05). however, the chx-xyl group exhibited a much greater effect than the other treatment groups (p < 0.001). adhesion studies revealed that none of the multiple-exposure regimens had a significant effect on  adhesion of sm to primary biofilms of s. sanguinis. we concluded that significant inhibition of sm growth and subsequent inability to grow as biofilms in the presence of sucrose occurs after a staggered exposure regimen to chx initially and then to xyl. this may help explain the clinical data showing the decreased levels of sm in mothers treated with chx and xyl.

TI  == streptococcus massiliensis sp. nov., isolated from a patient blood culture.
AB  == an unidentified strain of the viridans group of streptococci was isolated from a  human blood sample. it was distinguished from all other recognized species of the streptococcus sanguinis group by several biochemical characteristics. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequence comparisons clustered this  strain with streptococcus ferus (mutans group) but phylogenetic analysis based on rpob and soda gene sequence comparisons included it in the s. sanguinis group. the isolate showed 95.4 and 95.2 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity to s. ferus  and s. sanguinis, respectively, confirming it as belonging to a novel taxon, for  which the name streptococcus massiliensis sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is 4401825t (=cip 108498t=ccug 49690t).

TI  == human t-cell responses to oral streptococci in human pbmc-nod/scid mice.
AB  == we investigated cellular and humoral immune responses to oral biofilm bacteria, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus sobrinus,  and streptococcus sanguinis, in nod/scid mice immunized with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hu-pbmc-nod/scid mice) to explore the pathogenicity of each of those organisms in dental and oral inflammatory diseases. hu-pbmc-nod/scid mice were immunized by intraperitoneal injections with the whole cells of the streptococci once a week for 3 weeks. facs analyses were used to determine the percentages of various hu-t cell types, as well as intracellular cytokine production of interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma. serum igg and igm antibody levels in response to the streptococci were also determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. s. anginosus induced a significant amount of the proinflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma in cd4(+) and cd8(+) t cells in comparison with the other streptococci. however, there was no significant differences between the streptococci in interleukin-4 production by cd4(+) and cd8(+) t cells after inoculation. further, s. mutans significantly induced human  anti-s. mutans igg, igg(1), igg(2), and igm antibodies in comparison with the other organisms. in conclusion, s. anginosus up-regulated th1 and tc1 cells, and  s. mutans led to increasing levels of their antibodies, which was associated with the induction of th2 cells. these results may contribute to a better understanding of human lymphocyte interactions to biofilm bacteria, along with their impact on dental and mucosal inflammatory diseases, as well as endocarditis.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

TI  == effect of water-soluble reduced chitosan on streptococcus mutans, plaque regrowth and biofilm vitality.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of a newly developed  water-soluble reduced chitosan on streptococcus mutans, plaque regrowth, and biofilm vitality. a 1.0%, water-soluble reduced chitosan, with ph ranging from 6.0 to 6.5, molecular weights between 3,000 and 5,000 da, and 70% degree of deacetylation, was used. to determine antibacterial and antiplaque potency of chitosan, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for s. mutans and s. sanguinis (formerly s. sanguis), short-term exposure to s. mutans, and clinical trial of plaque regrowth and biofilm vitality were conducted. twelve dental students volunteered to participate in the 6-week, double blind, randomized clinical trial using the classical 4-day plaque regrowth design. the mic of water-soluble reduced chitosan for s. mutans was 1.25 g/l. while the cells exposed to distilled water (dw) grew rapidly, with a maximum turbidity reached by 16 h postinoculation, s. mutans exposed to chitosan (5.0 g/l) exhibited a substantial  delay in growth and reached a maximum turbidity by 32 h postinoculation. the chitosan solution reduced the plaque index and the vitality of the plaque flora significantly when compared to dw, but this was less than the reductions found with the positive control of 0.1% chlorhexidine solution. the water-soluble reduced chitosan exhibited potent antibacterial effect on s. mutans, and displayed a significant antibacterial and plaque-reducing action during the 4-day plaque regrowth.

TI  == garenoxacin treatment of experimental endocarditis caused by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the activity of garenoxacin was compared to that of levofloxacin or penicillin in a rabbit model of streptococcus mitis group (penicillin mic, 0.125 microg/ml) and streptococcus sanguinis group (penicillin mic, 0.25 microg/ml) endocarditis. garenoxacin and levofloxacin had mics of 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, for both study isolates. rabbits with catheter-induced aortic valve endocarditis  were given no treatment, penicillin at 1.2x10(6) iu/8 h intramuscularly, garenoxacin at 20 mg/kg of body weight/12 h intravenously, or levofloxacin at 40  mg/kg/12 h intravenously. for both isolates tested, garenoxacin area under the curve (auc)/mic and maximum concentration of drug in serum (cmax)/mic ratios were 368 and 91, respectively. rabbits were sacrificed after 3 days of treatment; cardiac valve vegetations were aseptically removed and quantitatively cultured. for s. mitis group experimental endocarditis, all studied antimicrobial agents were more active than no treatment (p<0.001), whereas for s. sanguinis group endocarditis, no studied antimicrobial agents were more active than no treatment. we conclude that auc/mic and cmax/mic ratios may not predict activity of some quinolones in experimental viridans group endocarditis and that garenoxacin and levofloxacin may not be ideal choices for serious infections caused by some quinolone-susceptible viridans group streptococci.

TI  == interaction between gic and s. sanguis biofilms: antibacterial properties and changes of surface hardness.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the interaction of streptococcus sanguis with two glass-ionomer formulations (gic:a containing fluoride and gic:b without fluoride) with particular reference to bacterial growth and changes in hardness of the cement with respect to time. materials and  methods: discs of two water activated glass-ionomer cements were prepared according to the manufacturer's instruction. hydroxyapatite discs (ha) were used  as controls. 3d laser scanning technique was used to characterize surface roughness and area of the substrate prior to growing biofilms. surface hardness was evaluated before and after biofilm growth. a constant depth film fermenter system (cdff) was used to grow s. sanguis biofilms on the specimens in a similar  manner to that described previously by wilson et al. in 1995. for susceptibility  measurement, specimens were removed from cdff aseptically over periods up to 14d  after the first colonization with bacteria. counts of viable bacterial in the accumulating biofilm layer on each surface were measured and converted to colony  forming units per unit surface area. to determine the effect of storage media, hardness discs were exposed to distilled water, lactic acid ph 4, lactic acid ph  5, citric acid ph 5, artificial saliva and s. sanguis biofilms. twenty-four hours after preparing and subsequent autoclaving, specimens were transferred to a vessel containing 40 ml storage medium. the specimens were investigated for periods up to 7d. results: the viable counts of s. sanguis per mm2 on gic:a were  significantly less than those on ha and gic:b during the first 5d (p<0.05). the viable counts of bacteria on the surface of gic:b were lower during the initial 5d when compared to ha. exposure of gic:a and gic:b to different medium produced  softening to the surface of cement. it is apparent that the effects of the biofilms are significantly greater than storage in water but similar to storage in lactic acid ph 5. conclusions: this investigation showed that the growth of s. sanguis biofilms were significantly affected by both glass-ionomer formulations,  the greater reduction being noted on the surface of the fluoride containing gic.  s. sanguis biofilms produced reduction on the surface hardness of the cement equivalent to that seen after immersion in lactic acid at ph 5. this indicates that while s. sanguis biofilm is affected by the gic, there is also a decrease in hardness of the cement indicating some cement degradation.

TI  == vancomycin tolerance, a potential mechanism for refractory gram-positive bacteremia observational study in patients with cancer.
AB  == background: the clinical significance of infections caused by vancomycin-tolerant (vt) gram-positive organisms in patients with cancer remains unclear. methods: twenty-five patients with nonenterococcal gram-positive bloodstream infection, which was refractory to vancomycin therapy, were identified by reviewing the infectious diseases consultation database at the tertiary care cancer center. among these, 8 patients in whom vancomycin-tolerance was documented are described. antibiotic tolerance was defined as a > 32 times increase in minimum bactericidal concentration compared with minimum inhibitory concentration. results: eight patients with persistent fever and bacteremia of > 72 hours' duration after the initiation of vancomycin therapy were treated. the median age  of these patients, which included 3 men and 5 women, was 44 years +/- 11 years. solid tumors were more common (6 patients) and 2 patients had acute leukemia. six patients (75%) were neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3), including  2 breast cancer patients who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation.  the causative organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 3 patients), group g streptococci (n = 2 patients), and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis (1 patient each). all isolates demonstrated a minimum bactericidal concentration for vancomycin that was at least 32 times greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration. rapid defervescence (< or = 24 h) and resolution of bacteremia occurred with the addition of gentamicin (4 patients) or gentamicin plus rifampin (4 patients). none of these infections recurred after discontinuation of therapy. conclusions: lack of clinical and/or microbiologic response to vancomycin should raise the suspicion of possible infection due to vt gram-positive bacteria, and alternative bactericidal therapy  should be instituted early, especially in patients with underlying immune suppression.

TI  == effect of penicillin resistance on presentation and outcome of nonenterococcal streptococcal infective endocarditis.
AB  == background and aims: most cases of infective endocarditis are caused by nonenterococcal streptococci. the emergence of strains resistant to penicillin is increasingly recognized worldwide. this study sought to assess the effect of penicillin resistance on presentation and outcome of streptococcal endocarditis.  methods: a retrospective study was conducted in a single tertiary care hospital.  results: between august 1996 and december 2004, patients infected with nonenterococcal streptococcal endocarditis and known minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) to penicillin were included in this study. a total of 62 cases were identified: 48 (77%) cases of the streptococcal endocarditis were caused by viridans streptococci. the most common species groups identified were streptococcus mitis in 12 (19%) cases, streptococcus oralis in 9 (15%) cases, streptococcus sanguis in 7 (11%) cases and streptococcus mutans in 7 (11%) cases. there were 36 male and 26 female patients with a median age of 46 years (range: 1-85). twenty-two patients (35%) had peripheral embolization and 10 patients (16%) died in hospital. twenty-eight (45%) of the 62 patients were infected with  streptococcal strains of mics > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin. infection with streptococcal strains of mics > or =0.125 microg/ml to penicillin was associated  with a lower incidence of all-site embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality or increased frequency of surgery. conclusions: high-level penicillin resistance of the streptococci responsible for endocarditis was increasingly common and medical therapy with vancomycin had a good response. penicillin resistance was associated with a decreased risk of embolization, but was not associated with higher mortality.

TI  == role of il-12b promoter polymorphism in adamantiades-behcet's disease susceptibility: an involvement of th1 immunoreactivity against streptococcus sanguinis antigen.
AB  == adamantiades-behcet's disease (abd) is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disorder. although the precise etiology is unclear, high prevalence of human leukocyte antigen (hla)-b51 predisposition and predominantly involved t-helper type 1 cells (th1)-type proinflammatory cytokines and extrinsic streptococcal infection suggest a substantial association with an immunogenetic basis and strengthens the hypothesis that il-12, a potent inducer of th-1 immune reaction,  is a putative candidate in its pathogenesis. these clinicopathological findings led us to examine interleukin 12 p40 (il-12b) promoter polymorphism, for which the 4-base pair (bp) heterozygous insertion has been shown to affect the gene transcription and subsequent protein production. we analyzed il-12b promoter genotypes in 194 japanese subjects (92 with abd and 102 normal controls) by pcr-based restriction enzyme digestion. the frequency of the insertion heterozygosity was significantly higher in patients than in controls (49/92, 53.3% vs 39/102, 38.2%, respectively). comparing these with hla haplotype data, this trend was more significant in hla-b51-negative patients (29/42, 69.0% vs 20/50, 40.0%; p = 0.005). as assessed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-pcr and elisa, stimulation with streptococcal antigens specifically increased expression of il-12 p40 mrna and protein, in conjunction with il-12 p70 induction, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from heterozygous patients. our  results provide evidence for anti-bacterial host response toward th1-immunity mediated by il-12 in patients with abd, and the possible insight into the genetic susceptibility that is independent of hla background.

TI  == globicatella bacteraemia identified by 16s ribosomal rna gene sequencing.
AB  == background: globicatella are streptococcus-like organisms that have been rarely isolated from clinical specimens. their epidemiology and clinical significance remain largely unknown. aims: to describe two cases of globicatella bacteraemia identified by 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequencing. methods: two unidentified streptococcus-like bacteria isolated from blood cultures of patients were subject to 16s rrna gene sequencing. results: two cases of globicatella bacteraemia were  identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. in the first case, a gram positive coccus was isolated from the blood culture of an 80 year old woman with diabetes mellitus and nosocomial sepsis, who died the day after developing the bacteraemia. the bacterium was unidentified by conventional phenotypic tests, the vitek (gram positive identification) and the atb expression (id32 strep) systems. in the second case, a similar bacterium was isolated from the blood culture of a  92 year old woman with polymicrobial acute pyelonephritis complicated by septic shock, who subsequently recovered after antibiotic treatment. 16s rrna gene sequencing of the two isolates showed 0.5% nucleotide difference from that of g.  sulfidifaciens and 0.7% nucleotide difference from that of g. sanguinis, indicating that they were globicatella species. conclusions: because globicatella is rarely encountered in clinical microbiology laboratories, it may have been overlooked or misidentified in these cases. 16s rrna gene sequencing is a useful  tool to better characterise the epidemiology and clinical significance of globicatella.

TI  == interactive forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating oral bacterial pairs.
AB  == the temporo-spatial development of plaque is governed by adhesive interactions between different co-aggregating bacterial strains and species. physico-chemically, these interactions are due to attractive lifshitz-van der waals and acid-base forces, and occur despite electrostatic repulsion and with a  critical influence of temperature. the forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating pairs have never been measured, however. the aim here, thus, is to investigate, by atomic force microscopy, whether there is a difference in interactive forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating bacterial pairs  at 10 degrees c, 22 degrees c, and 40 degrees c. actinomyces naeslundii 147 was immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated tipless afm cantilevers, while streptococci were immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated glass surfaces. upon approach, a repulsive force was measured, regardless of whether a co-aggregating or non-co-aggregating pair was involved. however, upon retraction, the co-aggregating pair exhibited larger adhesive forces and energies than did the non-co-aggregating pair. adhesive interactions between the co-aggregating pair were smallest at 40 degrees c.

TI  == a role for immunoglobulin g in donor-specific streptococcus sanguis-induced platelet aggregation.
AB  == there is increasing evidence for a relationship between bacterial infections and  several cardiovascular disorders. although the precise mechanism(s) underlying this association is unknown, the direct activation of platelets by bacteria is one possibility. individual strains of s. sanguis activate platelets in a non-uniform, donor-dependent manner. in the current study, platelet aggregation profiles were obtained for fourteen donors in response to four strains of s. sanguis (2017-78, 133-79, sk112, sk108a) and one of s. gordonii (sk8) . the platelets from all donors responded to strains 2017-78 and 133-79, whereas strains sk112, sk8 and sk108a caused aggregation in one, five and twelve donors,  respectively. immunoglobulin g (igg) binding to strains 2017-78, 133-79 and sk108a were significantly greater than to strains sk112 and sk8. absorption of igg by strain 2017-78 caused significant decreases in igg binding, and platelet aggregation in response, to all strains. single-strand conformational polymorphisms were observed in the fcgamma riia gene from four donors. sequencing revealed two known and two novel point mutations, none of which correlated with the aggregation profile. thus, platelet activation to the various strains depends on a common igg and, while in most cases the level of igg binding to s. sanguis determines platelet responsiveness, neither the levels of igg nor fcgammariia polymorphisms can fully account for donor variability.

TI  == anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic streptococcus mutans. preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice  and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against s. mutans. the  anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of m. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified  as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1d-nmr, 2d-nmr and ei-ms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of macelignan against s. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis,  lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei in the mic range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. in particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated s. mutans in 1 min. the specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.

AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of an experimental 0.454% stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice on the oral sulcular microbiota in patients with various stages of oral diseases using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. material and methods:  in the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37.6) were assigned to one of four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated  moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. all four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a  day for one minute during a four-week test period. before and after the trial period, plaque indices (pii, silness and loe, 1964) and gingival indices (gi, loe and silness, 1963) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from  all patients at baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. these samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: as a result of the only one minute brushing with the stannous fluoride dentifrice, the mean pii at baseline was significantly lower (p < 0.05) from the mean pii at four weeks. no statistically significant differences were found between premolar and molar mean values. moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean gi at baseline and at four weeks. the microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2  and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i.e. a. actinomyctemcomitans p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola. over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. in groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0.05) including s. mitis, s. intermedius, and s. sanguis (p < 0.01)  suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated  bacteria. conclusion: one minute brushing with a 0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice did--after four weeks--not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis. however, the sulcular microbial profiles of mild gingivitis and caries-prone patients were affected, indicating a shift towards a gingival health associated microbiota in the sulcular region of patients not affected by attachment loss. running head: effect of stannous fluoride on sulcular microbiota.

TI  == multivariate analysis of surface physico-chemical properties controlling biofilm  formation on orthodontic adhesives prior to and after fluoride and chlorhexidine  treatment.
AB  == biofilm formation on orthodontic adhesives is a serious clinical problem, as it leads to enamel demineralization around fixed orthodontic appliances, often leaving white spot lesions after their removal. the aim of this work was to determine the influence of surface physico-chemical properties of four commonly used orthodontic adhesives (concise, fuji ortho lc, ketac cem mu, and transbond xt) on early bacterial biofilm formation. in addition, effects of two commercially available mouthrinses (0.05% sodium fluoride and 0.2% chlorhexidine  gluconate) on these properties and biofilm formation were determined. water contact angles on the adhesives decreased after fluoride and chlorhexidine treatment, concurrent with an increase in carbon and a decrease in oxygen surface concentrations, except for transbond, as determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. no fluorine was detected on any of the adhesive surfaces after fluoride treatment, while all surfaces showed chlorine after chlorhexidine treatment. surface roughness of the adhesives measured using three-dimensional optical profilometry was around 4 microm and found not to be a factor governing early biofilm formation. multiple linear regression analysis indicated that early biofilm formation by streptococcus sanguis could be explained in a model comprising hydrophobicity and the prevalence of oxygen- and nitrogen-rich components on the adhesive surfaces.

AB  == objective: to investigate the aciduric bacteria in different stages of the fissure caries in order to determine potential roles of the microflora in the development of dental caries. methods: plaque samples were taken from 10 incipient carious fissures of the first permanent molars. plaque samples were also collected from sound fissures of the first permanent molars in 10 other subjects who kept caries free over the past 2 years and from the above 10 subjects. the predominant bacteria were isolated by using both the most probable  method in media at ph7.0 and 5.2, and the conventional plating methods. streptococcus spp. was identified by means of api 20 strep commercial kit. results: s. mutans was the predominant aciduric bacteria infissures of caries-free children and more frequently recovered at neutral ph. whilst, s. sanguis was predominant at ph5.2 in sound and carious of fissures of caries-active children. the proportion of gram-positive rods at ph5.2 was 82%, significantly greater than that of 61% at ph7.0. conclusion: the ecology of plaque is complex and the composition of microflora at each stage of caries could be different. the composition of bacteria was consistent with the changes of local ph in the plaque.

TI  == interleukin 1alpha increases the susceptibility of rabbits to experimental viridans streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == major predisposing conditions for infective endocarditis (ie) are the presence of a cardiac platelet-fibrin vegetation and of circulating bacteria with relatively  low susceptibility to microbicidal activity of blood platelets. the influence of  proinflammatory conditions on development of ie is unknown. we studied the effects of the presence of a catheter, inserted to induce platelet-fibrin vegetations, and of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1alpha in rabbit experimental ie. leaving the catheter in place after challenge with viridans streptococci predisposed for experimental ie. ie susceptibility rapidly decreased between 0 to 6 h after catheter removal. the catheter did not predispose for ie by providing a site for bacterial adherence, as almost all explanted catheters were culture negative. to mimic the proinflammatory influence of the catheter, rabbits were injected with interleukin-1alpha at 24 h after catheter removal and  at 0, 1, and 3 h before bacterial challenge. interleukin-1alpha injected 3 h prior to challenge significantly increased ie incidence due to a platelet releasate-susceptible streptococcus oralis strain, with rapidly increasing numbers of bacteria within the vegetations. ie due to the streptococcus sanguis strain less susceptible to platelet releasate was not enhanced. we conclude that  proinflammatory stimuli, either a catheter or interleukin-1alpha, enhanced susceptibility to ie due to the platelet releasate-susceptible s. oralis. as with rabbits, temporary intravascular proinflammatory conditions may predispose for ie in humans at risk for this serious infection.

AB  == objective: to compare the antibacterial effect of galla chinensis with that of chlorhexidine by means of chemostat and provide experimental foundation for caries prevention with chinese medicine instead of chemicals in future. method: a multispecies consortium biofilm (bf) model was construted in the chemostat. the growth-inhibition on bacterial biofilm coated on ha was investigated by means of  the colony-forming units (cfu). acid-inhibition was inspected by continual ph-recording in the flow cells. and the profile on the biofilm treated by both experimental medicines was observed with the scanning electromicroscopy (sem). result: both of the experimental medicines could inhibit the growth of the bf bacteria. and galla chinensis had no obvious influence on the ecological composing of the bf bacteria. both of the experimental medicines could inhibit the acid producion of experimental bacteria. but the final ph of galla chinensis  was lower than that of chlorhexidine. a typical biofilm formed on ha was observed by sem. both of galla chinensis and chlorhexidine could inhibit the production of extracellular matrix and make the bf profile on the surface of the ha clearer and simpler. conclusion: galla chinensis had definite antibacterial effect. no obvious difference is found between galla chinensis (4 g x l(-1)) and chlorhexidine (0.5 g x l(-1)). therefore, it is possible for chinese medicine to  gradually replace the chemical medicine in clinic and it will give a new choice for caries prevention.

TI  == viridans streptococci isolated by culture from blood of cancer patients: clinical and microbiologic analysis of 50 cases.
AB  == clinical and microbiologic studies of 50 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients were performed. the bacteria were identified to species level by sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. at least nine streptococcus spp. were found, including s. mitis (25 strains, 50.0% of 50); currently unnamed streptococcus spp. (11 strains); s. parasanguis (five strains); s. anginosus (three strains); s. salivarius (two strains); and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, and s. vestibularis. there were no s. oralis strains. among 11 antibiotics of nine classes tested, no resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, or quinupristin-dalfopristin was seen. resistance to penicillin (mic, 4 to 12 mug/ml) was noted only among s. mitis strains (28.0%, 7/25) and not non-s. mitis strains (0/25) (p = 0.004). significantly more s. mitis strains than non-s. mitis strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones and to > or =3 classes of antibiotics. isolation of quinolone-resistant organisms was associated with the prior usage of quinolones (p = 0.002). quantitative blood cultures showed that the strains resistant to levofloxacin or gatifloxacin were associated with higher colony counts than were their corresponding nonresistant strains. the young and elderly patients also had higher levels of bacteremia caused predominantly by s. mitis. septic shock was present in 17 (34.0% of 50) patients, and 13 of those cases were caused by s. mitis (p = 0.007). these results suggest that s. mitis is the most common cause of viridans streptococcal  bacteremia in cancer patients and is more resistant to antibiotics than other species.

TI  == early biofilm formation and the effects of antimicrobial agents on orthodontic bonding materials in a parallel plate flow chamber.
AB  == decalcification is a commonly recognized complication of orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. a technology, based on a parallel plate flow chamber, was  developed to investigate early biofilm formation of a strain of streptococcus sanguis on the surface of four orthodontic bonding materials: glass ionomer cement (ketac cem), resin-modified glass ionomer cement (fuji ortho lc), chemically-cured composite resin (concise) and light-cured composite resin (transbond xt). s. sanguis was used as it is one of the primary colonizers of dental hard surfaces. artificial saliva was supplied as a source of nutrients for the biofilms. the effects of two commercially available mouthrinses (i.e. a fluoride containing rinse and chlorhexidine) were evaluated. initial colonization of the bacterium was assessed after 6 hours of growth by the percentage surface coverage (psc) of the biofilm on the disc surfaces. there were statistically significant differences in bacterial accumulation between different bonding materials (p < 0.05), concise being the least colonized and transbond xt being the most colonized by s. sanguis biofilms. all materials pre-treated with 0.05 per cent sodium fluoride mouthrinse showed more than 50 per cent reduction in biofilm formation. the 0.2 per cent chlorhexidine gluconate mouthrinse caused significant reduction of biofilm formation on all materials except ketac cem. this in vitro study showed that the use of a chemically-cured composite resin (concise) reduced early s. sanguis biofilm formation. also, fluoride had a greater effect in reducing the psc by s. sanguis biofilms than chlorhexidine. rinsing with 0.05 per cent sodium fluoride prior to placement of orthodontic appliances is effective in reducing early biofilm formation.

TI  == use of phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses to identify nonhemolytic streptococci isolated from bacteremic patients.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate molecular and phenotypic methods for the identification of nonhemolytic streptococci. a collection of 148 strains consisting of 115 clinical isolates from cases of infective endocarditis, septicemia, and meningitis and 33 reference strains, including type strains of all relevant streptococcus species, were examined. identification was performed by phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences of four housekeeping genes, ddl, gdh, rpob, and soda; by pcr analysis of the glucosyltransferase (gtf) gene; and by conventional phenotypic characterization and identification using two commercial kits, rapid id 32 strep and streptogram and the associated databases.  a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of the four housekeeping genes allowed unequivocal differentiation of recognized species and was used as the reference. analysis of single gene sequences revealed deviation clustering in eight strains (5.4%) due to homologous recombination with other species. this was particularly evident in s. sanguinis and in members of the anginosus group of streptococci. the rate of correct identification of the strains by both commercial identification kits was below 50% but varied significantly between species. the most significant problems were observed with s. mitis and s. oralis  and 11 streptococcus species described since 1991. our data indicate that identification based on multilocus sequence analysis is optimal. as a more practical alternative we recommend identification based on soda sequences with reference to a comprehensive set of sequences that is available for downloading from our server. an analysis of the species distribution of 107 nonhemolytic streptococci from bacteremic patients showed a predominance of s. oralis and s. anginosus with various underlying infections.

TI  == inability of probiotic bacterial strains lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 and bifidobacterium lactis hn019 to induce human platelet aggregation in vitro.
AB  == platelet aggregation contributes to the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis, and aggregation of platelets induced by lactobacilli is thought to be an important contributory factor in the development and progression of lactobacillus endocarditis. the main purpose of this study was to examine the effect of immunity-enhancing probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 and bifidobacterium lactis hn019 on the activation and aggregation of human blood platelets. whole blood samples from healthy individuals were incubated in vitro with hn001 or hn019 and subsequently labeled with platelet-specific monoclonal antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-cd41a (expressed on normal platelets), and phycoerythrin-streptavidin-conjugated anti-cd62p (expressed on activated platelets) before analysis by flow cytometry. platelet-rich plasma was  used to assist the gating of the platelet cluster. adp and epinephrine were used  as the physiological platelet activation agonists. platelet aggregation-inducing  strain streptococcus sanguis 133-79 was used as a positive control strain. the mean fluorescence intensity of phycoerythrin and the percentage of platelets expressing the cd62p marker were used to assess the degree of platelet activation. the percentage of cd62p-positive platelets and the light scatter profiles of the agonist-activated platelets were used to identify the occurrence  and degree of platelet aggregation. hn001 and hn019 had no effect on spontaneous  platelet activation and aggregation; they also failed to exacerbate the platelet  aggregation activity induced by adp and epinephrine. therefore, these test probiotic strains hn001 and hn019 are less likely to participate in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis or other thrombotic disorders with regard  to platelet aggregation factors.

(2) galla chinesis and sodium fluoride could prevent the descent of the planktonic ph in the flow cell, but galla chinesis was less efficient than sodium fluoride. (3) the biofilms formed after application of galla chinesis and fluoride, but the bacterial cells had less matrix than those applicated with sucrose. conclusion: galla chinesis is one kind of effective cariostatic natural agents.

TI  == oral streptococci and cardiovascular disease: searching for the platelet aggregation-associated protein gene and mechanisms of streptococcus sanguis-induced thrombosis.
AB  == background: pathogenic mechanisms in infective endocarditis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and cardiovascular events involve the aggregation of platelets into thrombi. attendant infection by oral bacteria contributes to these diseases. we have been studying how certain oral streptococci induce platelet aggregation in vitro and in vivo. streptococcus sanguis expresses a platelet aggregation-associated protein (paap), which contributes little to adhesion to platelets. when specific antibodies or peptides block paap, s. sanguis fails to induce platelet aggregation in vitro or in vivo. methods: we used subtractive hybridization to identify the gene encoding for paap. results: after subtraction  of strain l50 (platelet aggregation-negative), four strain 133-79 specific sequences were characterized. sequence agg4 encoded a putative collagen-binding protein (cbpa), which was predicted to contain two paap collagen-like octapeptide sequences. s. sanguis cbpa- mutants were constructed and tested for induction of  platelet aggregation in vitro. platelet aggregation was substantially inhibited when compared to the wild-type using platelet-rich plasma from the principal donor, but adhesion was unaffected. other donor platelets responded normally to the cbpa- strain, suggesting additional mechanisms of response to s. sanguis. in  contrast, csha- and methionine sulfoxide reductase-negative (msra-) strains neither adhered nor induced platelet aggregation. conclusions: cbpa was suggested to contribute to site 2 interactions in our two-site model of platelet aggregation in response to s. sanguis. platelet polymorphisms were suggested to contribute to the thrombogenic potential of s. sanguis.

AB  == objectives: lipoteichoic acid (lta), induces some of the clinical symptoms of behcet's disease (bd) in a rat animal model. these results led to the hypothesis  that lta may also trigger bd in humans. we investigated the humoral and cellular  immune response against lta and lipopolysaccharide (lps) in patients with bd, and compared these responses with those of patients with active chronic oral ulcers (ou) and normal controls. methods: samples were obtained from 12 active bd, 12 inactive bd, 12 active ou and 12 normal controls. anti-lta, anti-lps antibodies levels and the capacity of immune complexes anti-lta igg-lta to activate complement were studied. exposed mannose residues in anti-lta igg were analyzed in the four groups. the interleukin-8 (il-8) production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells cultures after lta and lps stimulation was also studied in all  groups. results: the capacity to bind mannan binding protein (mbp) of anti-lta iggs was significantly higher in bd and active ou patients relative to normal controls (p < 0.001). however, only active bd patients generated significantly higher levels of c5a than controls (p < 0.0001). the iggs purified from the sera  of bd patients showed a high specificity for lta from streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus faecalis. lta also stimulates the secretion of il-8 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from active bd patients. anti-lps iga and igg titers were significantly higher only in active ou patients relative to normal controls (p < 0.0018). conclusion: these results suggest a mechanism involving lta from streptococci in the pathogenesis of bd.

AB  == the aim of this study was to use molecular identification methods, such as 16s rna gene sequence and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization, for identification of the bacteria associated with dental caries and with dental health in a subset of 204 twins aged 1.5 to 7 years old. a total of 448 plaque samples (118 collected from caries-free subjects and 330 from caries-active subjects) were used for analysis. we compared the bacteria found in biofilms of children exhibiting severe dental caries, with different degrees of lesion severity, with those found in biofilms of caries-free children. a panel of 82 bacterial species was selected, and a pcr-based reverse-capture checkerboard method was used for detection. a simple univariate test was used to determine the overabundance and underabundance of bacterial species in the diseased and in the  healthy groups. features identified with this univariate test were used to construct a probabilistic disease prediction model. furthermore, a method for the analysis of global patterns of gene expression was performed to permit simultaneous analysis of the abundance of significant species by allowing cross-bacterial comparisons of abundance profiles between caries-active and caries-free subjects. our results suggested that global patterns of microbial abundance in this population are very distinctive. the top bacterial species found to be overabundant in the caries-active group were actinomyces sp. strain b19sc, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus spp., which exhibited an inverse relationship to beneficial bacterial species, such as streptococcus parasanguinis, abiotrophia defectiva, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus sanguinis.

TI  == competition and coexistence between streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis in the dental biofilm.
AB  == the human mucosal surface is colonized by the indigenous microflora, which normally maintains an ecological balance among different species. certain environmental or biological factors, however, may trigger disruption of this balance, leading to microbial diseases. in this study, we used two oral bacterial species, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguinis (formerly s. sanguis),  as a model to probe the possible mechanisms of competition/coexistence between different species which occupy the same ecological niche. we show that the two species engage in a multitude of antagonistic interactions temporally and spatially; occupation of a niche by one species precludes colonization by the other, while simultaneous colonization by both species results in coexistence. environmental conditions, such as cell density, nutritional availability, and ph, play important roles in determining the outcome of these interactions. genetic and biochemical analyses reveal that these interspecies interactions are possibly mediated through a well-regulated production of chemicals, such as bacteriocins (produced by s. mutans) and hydrogen peroxide (produced by s. sanguinis). consistent with the phenotypic characteristics, production of bacteriocins and h2o2 are regulated by environmental conditions, as well as by juxtaposition of the two species. these sophisticated interspecies interactions could play an essential part in balancing competition/coexistence within multispecies microbial communities.

AB  == background: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) does not provide information on the efficacy of antimicrobial agents against infections involving  biofilms, which are many times more resistant than planktonic forms of bacteria.  this report is on the design and initial trial of a device for growing standard biofilms and testing antimicrobial agents. methods: we constructed a durable, autoclaveable laboratory model biofilm fermenter (lmbf) that holds hydroxyapatite discs 300 microm below a surface onto which an artificial saliva medium drips at  a rate comparable to human salivary flow. inoculated with streptococcus sanguinis, the device formed biofilms that were swept with a teflon wiper under aerobic conditions. five-day-old biofilm-coated discs were aseptically removed and placed in 3 ml of sterile saline, 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate, or 0.1% phosphate-buffered chlorine dioxide mouthwash for 1 minute. the discs and test agent were immediately diluted with saline to 10 ml, vortexed for 30 seconds, serially diluted, plated on blood agar, and incubated anaerobically 2 days. bacterial counts were done, and the mic of each mouthwash was determined. results: in tests with sterile water and sterile medium, the device maintained a  closed system. after inoculation with s. sanguinis, a steady state was reached at day 5. chlorhexidine at stock concentration achieved about a 2 log10 reduction (p = 0.002), but never achieved complete killing. chlorine dioxide had no significant effect. the mic against planktonic s. sanguinis was 112.8 microg/ml for chlorhexidine and 9.0 microg/ml for chlorine dioxide. conclusions: the lmbf generates and maintains a single-species oral model biofilm to a steady state and enables in vitro tests of disinfectant mouthwashes in simulated clinical use. it  should be usable for more advanced tests of multiple species biofilms.

TI  == identification of virulence determinants for endocarditis in streptococcus sanguinis by signature-tagged mutagenesis.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is a gram-positive, facultative anaerobe and a normal inhabitant of the human oral cavity. it is also one of the most common agents of  infective endocarditis, a serious endovascular infection. to identify virulence factors for infective endocarditis, signature-tagged mutagenesis (stm) was applied to the sk36 strain of s. sanguinis, whose genome is being sequenced. stm  allows the large-scale creation, in vivo screening, and recovery of a series of mutants with altered virulence. screening of 800 mutants by stm identified 38 putative avirulent and 5 putative hypervirulent mutants. subsequent molecular analysis of a subset of these mutants identified genes encoding undecaprenol kinase, homoserine kinase, anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase, adenylosuccinate lyase, and a hypothetical protein. virulence reductions ranging from 2-to 150-fold were confirmed by competitive index assays. one putatively hypervirulent strain with a transposon insertion in an intergenic region was identified, though increased virulence was not confirmed in competitive index assays. all mutants grew comparably to sk36 in aerobic broth culture except for the homoserine kinase mutant. growth of this mutant was restored by the addition of threonine to the medium. mutants containing an insertion or in-frame deletion in the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase gene failed to grow under strictly anaerobic conditions. the results suggest that housekeeping functions such as cell wall synthesis, amino acid and nucleic acid synthesis, and the ability to survive under anaerobic conditions are important virulence factors in s. sanguinis endocarditis.

TI  == a synergistic chlorhexidine/chitosan combination for improved antiplaque strategies.
AB  == background: the minor efficacy of chlorhexidine (chx) on other cariogenic bacteria than mutans streptococci such as streptococcus sanguinis may contribute  to uneffective antiplaque strategies. methods and results: in addition to chx (0.1%) as positive control and saline as negative control, two chitosan derivatives (0.2%) and their chx combinations were applied to planktonic and attached sanguinis streptococci for 2 min. in a preclinical biofilm model, the bacteria suspended in human sterile saliva were allowed to attach to human enamel slides for 60 min under flow conditions mimicking human salivation. the efficacy  of the test agents on streptococci was screened by the following parameters: vitality status, colony-forming units (cfu)/ml and cell density on enamel. the first combination reduced the bacterial vitality to approximately 0% and yielded  a strong cfu reduction of 2-3 log(10) units, much stronger than chx alone. furthermore, the first chitosan derivative showed a significant decrease of the surface coverage with these treated streptococci after attachment to enamel. conclusions: based on these results, a new chx formulation would be beneficial unifying the bioadhesive properties of chitosan with the antibacterial activity of chx synergistically resulting in a superior antiplaque effect than chx alone.

TI  == differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == it is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) (icm) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (streptococcus criceti, streptococcus downei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus ratti, streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis), and  177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. from the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable icm mass spectra were obtained for the different species. based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and  unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to s. mutans and 16 isolates to s. sobrinus. two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16s rrna genes as streptococcus anginosus. in addition, icm indicated a misclassification for some  reference strains (aht, v 100 and e 49) and re-classified aht and e 49 as s. ratti and v 100 as s. sobrinus. this was confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing. based  on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of icm, the isolates identified as either s. mutans or s. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. in the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different s. mutans and three different s. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. icm proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.

TI  == binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == protein(s) reactive with n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. the molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kda on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  under reducing conditions. the n-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified  protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found  to react with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from different gram-negative bacteria such as esherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella abortus equi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexeneri, and serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (lta) from gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the purified protein also reacted with e. coli o26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated gram-positive bacteria such as s. aureus, b. cereus, b. subtilis, enterococcus faecium, and corynebacterum bovis. on the other hand, porcine igg isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these lps, lta, and heat-treated bacterial cells. from the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with glcnac is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

TI  == multi-target antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes.
AB  == objective: zinc is used in oral care products as an antiplaque/antigingivitis agent. our objective was to assess the antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes associated with gingivitis, specifically fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia, with focus on catabolism and oxidative metabolism. methods: the oral anaerobes were grown in complex medium in an anaerobic chamber, harvested by centrifugation and used directly for experiments with suspensions. biofilm growth involved super-infection by f. nucleatum of an initial biofilm formed by streptococcus sanguis. results: zn(2+) inhibited catabolism of glutamate, glutamyl-glutamate, glucose and fructose by f. nucleatum cells in suspensions with id(50) values, respectively, of 0.05, 0.005, 0.01 and 0.01 mm. the id(50) value for inhibition of glutamate catabolism by biofilms was 0.10 mm.  inhibition of glutamate catabolism could be related to inhibition of substrate uptake and of 2-oxoglutarate reductase. zn(2+) also inhibited catabolism of aspartate or aspartyl-aspartate by p. intermedia with id(50) values of 0.07 and about 0.03 mm, respectively. respiration of intact cells of f. nucleatum and nadh oxidase in cell extracts were sensitive to zinc with id(50) values, respectively, of about 1.0 and 1.4 mm. zinc also inhibited production of hydrogen peroxide by f. nucleatum (id(50) = ca. 0.04 mm.) but at high concentrations acted to potentiate and enhance peroxide killing of the anaerobe. conclusion: zn(2+) is a  potent inhibitor of catabolism by f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, including catabolism of peptides, which can be degraded to yield inflammatory metabolic end products. zn(2+) also inhibits o(2) metabolism of f. nucleatum by about 50% and hydrogen peroxide production nearly completely but also enhances killing by peroxide added to cells.

TI  == the influences of hinge length and composition on the susceptibility of human iga to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == the influences of iga hinge length and composition on its susceptibility to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were examined using a panel of iga hinge mutants. the iga1 proteases of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis strains sk4 and sk49, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus influenzae cleaved iga2-iga1 half hinge, an ab featuring half of the  iga1 hinge incorporated into the equivalent site in iga1 protease-resistant iga2, whereas those of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and s. sanguis strain sk1 did not. hinge length reduction by removal of two of the four c-terminal proline residues rendered iga2-iga1 half hinge resistant to all streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases but it remained sensitive to cleavage by the serine-type  iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus spp. the four c-terminal proline residues could be substituted by alanine residues or transferred to the n-terminal extremity of the hinge without affect on the susceptibility of the ab  to cleavage by serine-type iga1 proteases. however, their removal rendered the ab resistant to cleavage by all the iga1 proteases. we conclude that the serine-type iga1 proteases of neisseria and haemophilus require the fab and fc regions to be  separated by at least ten (or in the case of n. gonorrhoeae type i protease, nine) amino acids between val(222) and cys(241) (iga1 numbering) for efficient access and cleavage. by contrast, the streptococcal iga1 metalloproteinases require 12 or more appropriate amino acids between the fab and fc to maintain a minimum critical distance between the scissile bond and the start of the fc.

TI  == bacterial biofilm development on hydroxyapatite-coated glass.
AB  == glass plates are frequently used as the substratum in flow cell experiments to allow continuous non-destructive observations of biofilm development via microscopy. the aim of this study was to evaluate hydroxyapatite-coated glass as  a substratum for flow cell experiments, in comparison to plain glass, for modelling primary colonization of the tooth surface by streptococcus sanguis. glass plates were magnetron sputter coated with hydroxyapatite, producing a thin  transparent layer. biofilm development in the flow cell was recorded using image  capture from a microscope, and images were analyzed to determine percentage coverage of the substratum over 24 h. removal of biofilm by increasing the flow rate was also assessed. no statistically significant differences were detected between s. sanguis biofilms grown on the two different substratum materials. hence, this work supports the proposal that the conditioning film reduces the influence of substratum surface properties.

TI  == microcalorimetric study on the influence of temperature on bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == binding isotherms and heats of interaction have been determined at 15, 25, and 40 degrees c for a coaggregating and a non-coaggregating oral bacterial pair. heats  of interaction were measured upon three consecutive injections of streptococci into an actinomyces suspension using isothermal titration calorimetry. after each injection, the number of streptococci injected remaining free in suspension was quantified microscopically and the degree of binding between the two bacterial strains was established. the coaggregating pair shows positive cooperative binding. the highest cooperativity, at 25 degrees c, correlates with a strong, macroscopically visible coaggregation. the non-coaggregating pair shows low cooperativity and lacks macroscopically visible coaggregation. interactions between the coaggregating partners seem to be mainly due to specific, enthalpically saturable and favorable binding sites. even though the enthalpic part of the interaction is saturated, cooperativity increases with consecutive injections, implying that the coaggregation phenomenon is driven by entropy gain. the change in heat capacity (deltac(p)) is positive for the non-coaggregating pair from 15-40 degrees c as well as for the coaggregating pair beyond 25 degrees c. at lower temperatures the coaggregating pair causes a negative deltac(p). the  decrease in heat capacity together with an increase in entropy is considered to be indicative of hydrophobic interactions playing an important role in the formation of large coaggregates as observed for the coaggregating pair at 25 degrees c.

TI  == streptococcus sanguis-induced platelet activation involves two waves of tyrosine  phosphorylation mediated by fcgammariia and alphaiibbeta3.
AB  == the low-affinity igg receptor, fcgammariia, has been implicated in streptococcus  sanguis-induced platelet aggregation. therefore, it is likely that signal transduction is at least partly mediated by fcgammariia activation and a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway. in this study the signal transduction mechanisms associated with platelet activation in response to the oral bacterium, s. sanguis were characterised. in the presence of igg, s. sanguis strain 2017-78 caused the  tyrosine phosphorylation of fcgammariia 30s following stimulation, which led to the phosphorylation of syk, lat, and plcgamma2. these early events were dependent on src family kinases but independent of either txa(2) or the engagement of the alpha(iib)beta(3) integrin. during the lag phase prior to platelet aggregation, fcgammariia, syk, lat, and plcgamma2 were each dephosphorylated, but were re-phosphorylated as aggregation occurred. platelet stimulation by 2017-78 also induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of pecam-1, an itim-containing receptor that recruits protein tyrosine phosphatases. pecam-1 co-precipitated with the protein  tyrosine phosphatase shp-1 in the lag phase. shp-1 was also maximally tyrosine phosphorylated during this phase, suggesting a possible role for shp-1 in the observed dephosphorylation events. as aggregation occurred, shp-1 was dephosphorylated, while fcgammariia, syk, lat, and plcgamma2 were rephosphorylated in an rgds-sensitive, and therefore alpha(iib)beta(3)-dependent, manner. additionally, txa(2) release, 5-hydroxytryptamine secretion and phosphatidic acid formation were all blocked by rgds. aspirin also abolished these events, but only partially inhibited alpha(iib)beta(3) -mediated re-phosphorylation. therefore, s. sanguis -bound igg cross links fcgammariia and  initiates a signaling pathway that is down-regulated by pecam-1-bound shp-1. subsequent engagement of alpha(iib)beta(3) leads to shp-1 dephosphorylation permiting a second wave of signaling leading to txa(2) release and consequent platelet aggregation.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == luxs-based signaling affects streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. we examined the role  of autoinducer-2 (ai-2) on s. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a gs-5 luxs-null mutant. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxs mutant formed larger  clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfb and gtfc genes, but not the gtfd gene, in the luxs mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth  phase. furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor ai-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. the biofilm defect of the luxs mutant was complemented by strains of s. gordonii, s. sobrinus, and s. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by s. oralis, s. salivarius, or s. sanguinis. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant was also complemented by porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 but not  by a p. gingivalis luxs mutant. these results suggest that the regulation of the  glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by ai-2. furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via ai-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

TI  == a serine-rich glycoprotein of streptococcus sanguis mediates adhesion to platelets via gpib.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis is the most common oral bacterium causing infective endocarditis and its ability to adhere to platelets, leading to their activation  and aggregation, is thought to be an important virulent factor. previous work has shown that s. sanguis can bind directly to platelet glycoprotein (gp) ib but the  nature of the adhesin was unknown. here, we have shown that a high molecular weight glycoprotein of s. sanguis mediates adhesion to glycocalacin. the bacterial glycoprotein was purified from cell extracts by chromatography on gpib- and wheatgerm agglutinin affinity matrices and its interaction with gpib was shown to be sialic acid-dependent. we designated the glycoprotein serine-rich protein a (srpa). an insertional inactivation mutant lacking the srpa of s. sanguis showed significantly reduced binding to glycocalacin, reduced adherence to platelets and a prolonged lag time to platelet aggregation. in addition, under flow conditions, platelets rolled and subsequently adhered on films of wild-type  s. sanguis cells at low shear (50/s) but did not bind to films of the srpa mutant. platelets did not bind to wild-type bacterial cells at high shear (1500/s). these findings help to understand the mechanisms by which the organism  might colonize platelet-fibrin vegetations.

TI  == effect of mutations in the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge on its susceptibility to cleavage by diverse bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == components of the human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) hinge governing sensitivity to cleavage by bacterial iga1 proteases were investigated. recombinant antibodies with distinct hinge mutations were constructed from a hybrid comprised of human iga2 bearing half of the human iga1 hinge region. this hybrid antibody and all the mutant antibodies derived from it were resistant to cleavage by the iga1 proteases from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis biovar 1 strains but  were cleaved to various degrees by those of streptococcus pneumoniae, some streptococcus sanguis strains, and the type 1 and 2 iga1 proteases of haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. remarkably, those  proteases that cleave a pro-ser peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies lacking a pro-ser peptide bond in the hinge, and those that cleave a pro-thr peptide bond in the wild-type iga1 hinge were able to cleave mutant antibodies devoid of a pro-thr peptide bond in the hinge. thus, the enzymes can cleave alternatives to their preferred postproline peptide bond when  such a bond is unavailable. peptide sequence analysis of a representative antibody digestion product confirmed this conclusion. the presence of a cleavable peptide bond near the ch2 end of the hinge appeared to result in greater cleavage than if the scissile bond was at the ch1 end of the hinge. proline-to-serine substitution at residue 230 in a hinge containing potentially cleavable pro-ser and pro-thr peptide bonds increased the resistance of the antibody to cleavage by many iga1 proteases.

AB  == to examine new cytochemical aspects of the bacterial adhesion, a strain 41452/01  of the oral commensal streptococcus sanguis and a wild strain of staphylococcus aureus were grown with and without sucrose supplementation for 6 days. osmiumtetraoxyde (oso4), uranyl acetate (ua), ruthenium red (rr), cupromeronic blue (cb) staining with critical electrolytic concentrations (cecs), and the tannic acid-metal salt technique (tamst) were applied for electron microscopy. cytochemically, only rr-positive fimbriae in s. sanguis were visualized. by contrast, some types of fimbriae staining were observed in s. aureus glycocalyx:  rr-positive, oso4-positive, tannophilic and cb-positive with ceasing point at 0.3 m mgcl2. the cb staining with cec, used for the first time for visualization of glycoproteins of bacterial glycocalyx, also reveals intacellular cb-positive substances-probably the monomeric molecules, that is, subunits forming the fimbriae via extracellular assembly. thus, glycosylated components of the biofilm matrix can be reliably related to single cells. the visualization of intracellular components by cb with cec enables clear distinction between s. aureus and other bacteria, which do not produce cb-positive substances. the small quantities of tannophilic substances found in s. aureus makes the use of tamst for the same purpose difficult. the present work protocol enables, for the first  time, a partial cytochemical differentiation of the bacterial glycocalyx.

AB  == in addition to conventional treatment modalities (mechanical and chemical), the use of different lasers has been increasingly proposed for the treatment of peri-implantitis. results from both controlled clinical and basic studies have pointed to the high potential of an er:yag-laser. its excellent ability to effectively ablate dental calculus without producing major thermal side-effects to adjacent tissue has been demonstrated in numerous studies. recently, a new ultrasonic device has been used for the treatment of periodontal and peri-implantitis infections. preliminary clinical data indicate that treatment with both treatment procedures may positively influence peri-implant healing. the aim of the present review paper is to evaluate, based on the available evidence,  the use of an er:yag-laser and a newly introduced ultrasonic device for treatment of peri-implantitis in comparison to a conventional treatment approach.

TI  == differences in the subgingival microbiota of swedish and usa subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  == background: previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. method: one hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (n sweden=79; usa=79) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bop, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the  mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization (total samples=4345). % dna probe counts comprised by each species  was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was  determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking  status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in swedish than american subjects: actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); eikenella  corrodens (1.7, 1.0); tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in american (5.5) than swedish subjects (3.0). cluster  analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. five clusters  were dominated by american subjects and 2 clusters by swedish subjects. fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by  high proportions of a. naeslundii genospecies 1, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythensis and p. melaninogenica. other clusters were characterized by high proportions of actinomyces gerencseriae, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eubacterium saburreum, l. buccalis and neisseria mucosa. conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. the heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the american subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the american subjects sampled.

TI  == a comparison of decontamination methods used for dental burs.
AB  == objectives: this study investigated the bacterial and fungal contamination of used dental burs. a novel assay system for comparison of efficacy of pre-sterilisation cleaning techniques for dental burs was used to evaluate manual scrubbing, enzymic agents and washer-disinfectors. methods: thirty dental burs contaminated during cavity preparation were analysed for micro-biological total viable counts and species of bacteria and fungi present. to simulate clinically contaminated burs, a culture of streptococcus sanguis nctc 7863 was used to inoculate unused dental burs, alone and combined with blood, saliva or a mixture  of blood and saliva. contaminated burs were subjected to six pre-sterilisation cleaning techniques and the log reduction in contamination achieved by each method was assessed. results: the microbial count from used dental burs ranged from 0 to 6.92 x 10(4) cfu ml(-1). many potentially pathogenic species were identified. the decontamination assay demonstrated that autoclaving alone was not sufficient to sterilise dental burs. manual scrubbing in air was less efficacious than manual scrubbing under water (p<0.001). the most effective method of pre-sterilisation cleaning for dental burs was a washer-disinfector. conclusions: enzymic agents are suitable for soaking contaminated dental burs immediately after use. washer-disinfectors are recommended as the method of choice for pre-sterilisation cleaning of contaminated dental burs.

TI  == behcet's disease.
AB  == behcet's disease (bd) is a systemic disorder of recurrent acute inflammation, characterized by major symptoms of oral aphthous ulcers, uveitis, skin lesions and genital ulcers. involvement of intestines, vessels, and central nervous system (cns) sometimes leads to a poor prognosis. patients with bd are known to distribute along the ancient silk road. the incidence is relatively higher from eastern asia to the mediterranean area as roughly 1-10 patients in 10,000 people, whereas only 1-2 patients in 1,000,000 people in uk and north america. although etiology of the disease is still unknown, high prevalence of hla-b51, increased expression of heat shock protein 60 and th1 dominant immune responses in the patients are considered important in its pathogenesis. non-infectious neutrophil  activation and infection with streptococcus sanguis and herpes simplex virus would also be associated. because bd lacks any pathognomonic symptoms and laboratory findings, the diagnosis relies largely upon the criteria proposed by the international study group for behcet's disease in 1990. in japan, the diagnosis was also made according to the japanese criteria revised in 1987. recently, the behcet's disease research committee of japan again revised the japanese criteria in 2003 to avoid overdiagnosis. the new japanese criteria are introduced in this review. differential diagnosis excluding sweet's disease, pemphigus, erythema nodosum and crohn's disease is important, and positive laboratory data for pathergy test, prick test for dead streptococci and hla-b51 are emphasized to make appropriate diagnosis in these criteria. pathological findings of the disease-affected site such as erythematous nodosum is also stressed. treatment for the disease has been chosen according to the clinical symptoms. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids and colchicine are basically introduced. recently, effects of interferon-alpha/beta, anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody and thalidomide are encouraging, specifically in treatment for the cases with poor prognosis including eye, intestine, vessel and cns involvement. low dose weekly administration of methotraxate looks effective for the cases with cns involvement. further studies for elucidation of the etiology, improvement of the  diagnostic criteria and development of new therapy are needed to conquer the disease.

TI  == measurement of bacterial concentration fractions in polymicrobial mixtures by raman microspectroscopy.
AB  == relative concentrations of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis are important parameters in the study of dental caries, but current methods of measuring these concentrations are time consuming and prone to inaccuracies. we investigate the use of raman spectroscopy for measuring relative concentrations of these two bacterial species in solid mixtures. to our knowledge, this is the first time raman spectroscopy has been used to analyze bacterial mixtures rather  than to identify the species of a pure colony. mixtures of the two streptococcal  species in various ratios are measured for 200 s using a home-built raman microscope. spectral correlations with bacterial content were identified via partial least-squares analysis. the relative concentrations of s. mutans in subsequent samples are predicted with a root mean squared error below 5%. in clinical plaque samples, this sort of accuracy would enable discrimination between normal and dangerously elevated levels of s. mutans. samples with and without salivary proteins are predicted with equal accuracy. this result shows the potential of raman spectroscopy for analyzing mixed populations of bacteria,  such as those that occur in oral plaques.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == surface free energy and bacterial retention to saliva-coated dental implant materials--an in vitro study.
AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to compare the in vitro bacterial retention on saliva-coated implant materials (pure titanium grade 2 (cp-ti) and a titanium alloy (ti-6al-4v) surfaces), presenting similar surface roughness, and to assess the influence of physico-chemical surface properties of bacterial strain and implant materials on in vitro bacterial adherence. two bacterial strains (one hydrophilic strain and one hydrophobic strain) were used and the following were evaluated: bacterial cell adherence, sfe values as well as the lifshitz-van-der waals, the lewis acid base components of sfe, the interfacial free energy and the non-dispersive interactions according to two complementary contact angle measurement methods: the sessile drop method and the captive bubble method. our results showed similar patterns of adherent bacterial cells on saliva-coated cp-ti and saliva-coated ti-6al-4v. these findings could suggest that bacterial colonization (i.e. plaque formation) is similar on saliva-coated cp-ti and ti-6al-4v surfaces and indicate that both materials could be suitable for use as transgingival abutment or healing implant components. the same physico-chemical properties exhibited by saliva-coated cp-ti and ta6v, as shown by the sessile drop method and the captive bubble method, could explain this similar bacterial colonisation. therefore, higher values of total surface free energy of saliva-coated cp-ti and saliva-coated ta6v samples (gamma(sv) approximately 65mj/m(2)) were reported using the captive bubble method indicating a less hydrophobic character of these surfaces than with the sessile drop method  (gamma(s) approximately 44.50mj/m(2)) and consequently possible differences in oral bacterial retention according the theory described by absolom et al. the number of adherent hydrophobic s. sanguinis cells was two-fold higher than that of hydrophilic s. constellatus cells. our results confirm that physico-chemical surface properties of oral bacterial strains play a role in bacterial retention to implant materials in the presence of adsorbed salivary proteins.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases--review of publications].
AB  == nowadays periodontal diseases are treated as a one of a social diseases. the main consequences of them are: premature teeth loss and possibility of inducing, aggravating and modifying many systemic disorders, such as endo- and myocarditis, glomerulonephritis, iriditis, retinitis, rheumatic polyarthritis. the scientific  data performed in the last 10 years indicate links between periodontitis and atheromatosis, coronary heart disease and acute coronary events, including myocardial infarction. in this study reported was the epidemiological dependences between periodontal and cardiovascular diseases. there were described hypotheses  of negative influence of periodontal foci on induction and progression of inflammation in coronary vessel walls and destabilisation of atheromatous plaques, also was included theory of direct bacterial invasion and cytokine theory. there were shown results of studies which proved the presence of genetic  material of main periodontal bacterial pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, in atheromatous plaques in coronary arteries. there were noted other potential mechanisms of induction of acute coronary events connected with platelet aggregation induced by specific proteins  secreted by streptococcus sanguis and the role of helicobacter pylori infection,  the bacteria from periodontal pockets that is presently more often isolated. analysing these data it was concluded, that the co-operation between cardiologists and dentists, especially the periodontologists, is necessary during the treatment of coronary heart disease. periodontal therapy should be included as an additional element of cardiological therapy. education of patients is also  very important for prophylaxis of cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == t and nk cell subset changes with microbial extracts and human hsp60-derived peptides in behcet's disease.
AB  == objective: microorganisms such as streptococcus and autoantigens such as 60 kd heat-shock protein (hsp60) are implicated in the etiopathogenesis of behcet's disease (bd). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with bd (n = 16) and healthy controls (hc) (n = 11) were cultured for 5 days with extracts of s. sanguis-kth-1 (ss), e. coli (ec) and a mixed peptide combination from human hsp60 (aa 136-50, 179-97, 224-58 and 336-51) reported to be associated with bd. t and nk cell subset changes were determined by flow cytometry. results: in unstimulated 5-day cultures gammadelta+ (both cd4+gammadelta+ and cd8+gammadelta+), cd8+alphabeta+, cd4+cd56+ and cd8+cd11b+ cells were increased in bd compared to hc. in antigen-stimulated cultures of bd patients cd3+ and alphabeta+ t cells responded to hsp60 peptides whereas ec stimulated only cd16/ cd56+ nk cells. in the control group, similar to bd, alphabeta+ and cd4+ t cells  responded to hsp60 peptides, however ss and ec mainly activated cytotoxic t cell  subsets (cd8+cd11b and cd4+cd56+ t cells). conclusion: significant increases in unstimulated t cell subsets suggest the presence of an in vivo t cell activation  in bd. in both patients and controls similar patterns of responses were observed  against different microorganisms, however the role of human hsp60 peptides as immunodominant, crossreactive antigens could not be demonstrated.

TI  == synergistic effects of streptococcal glucosyltransferases on adhesive biofilm formation.
AB  == glucosyltransferases (gtf)-i and gtf-si of streptococcus mutans synthesize water-insoluble and both water-soluble and -insoluble glucans, respectively, and  play essential roles in the sucrose-dependent adhesion of the organism to tooth surfaces. to examine the interactions of different gtfs on artificial biofilm formed by s. mutans and other oral streptococci, we generated gtf-i- and gtf-si-hyperproducing isogenic mutant strains. transformant b42-21, which hyperexpressed gtf-si, exhibited firm adhesion in the presence of sucrose, whereas transformant b42-10, which hyperexpressed gtf-i, failed to exhibit firm adhesion. furthermore, co-culture of transformant b42-21 with water-soluble glucan-synthesizing streptococcus sanguinis yielded firm adhesion, while the addition of dextran t10 to b42-21 growing culture had no effect on adhesion. these findings suggest that gtf-si has a strong effect on sucrose-dependent adhesion and is essential for biofilm formation on smooth surfaces, in cooperation with water-soluble glucans synthesized de novo by oral streptococci that inherently lack cell adhesion ability.

TI  == streptococcus sinensis may react with lancefield group f antiserum.
AB  == lancefield group f streptococci have been found almost exclusively as members of  the 'streptococcus milleri' group, although they have been reported very occasionally in some other streptococcal species. among 302 patients with bacteraemia caused by viridans streptococci over a 6-year period, three cases were caused by streptococcus sinensis (type strain hku4t, hku5 and hku6). all three patients had infective endocarditis complicating their underlying chronic rheumatic heart diseases. gene sequencing showed no base differences between the  16s rrna gene sequences of hku5 and hku6 and that of hku4t. all three strains were gram-positive, non-spore-forming cocci arranged in chains. all grew on sheep blood agar as alpha-haemolytic, grey colonies of 0.5-1 mm in diameter after 24 h  incubation at 37 degrees c in ambient air. lancefield grouping revealed that hku5 and hku6 were lancefield group f, but hku4t was non-groupable with lancefield groups a, b, c, d, f or g antisera. hku4t was identified by the vitek system (gpi), api system (20 strep) and atb system (id32 strep) as 99 % streptococcus intermedius, 51.3 % s. intermedius and 99.9 % streptococcus anginosus, respectively. using the same tests, hku5 was identified as 87 % streptococcus sanguinis/streptococcus gordonii, 59 % streptococcus salivarius and 99.6 % s. anginosus, respectively, and hku6 as 87 % s. sanguinis/s. gordonii, 77 % streptococcus pneumoniae and 98.3 % s. anginosus, respectively. the present data  revealed that a proportion of lancefield group f streptococci could be s. sinensis. lancefield group f streptococci should not be automatically reported as 's. milleri'.

TI  == oral streptococcal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mediates interaction  with porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  == interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis with plaque-forming bacteria is necessary for its colonization in periodontal pockets. participation of streptococcus oralis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and p. gingivalis fimbriae in this interaction has been reported. in this investigation, the contribution of various oral streptococcal gapdhs to interaction with p. gingivalis fimbriae was examined. streptococcal cell surface gapdh activity was measured by incubation of a constant number of streptococci with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and analysis for the conversion of nad+ to nadh based  on the absorbance at 340 nm. coaggregation activity was measured by a turbidimetric assay. cell surface gapdh activity was correlated with coaggregation activity (r = 0.854, p < 0.01) with spearman's rank correlation coefficient. s. oralis atcc 9811 and atcc 10557, streptococcus gordonii g9b, streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556, and streptococcus parasanguinis atcc 15909 exhibited high cell surface gapdh activity and coaggregation activity; consequently, their cell surface gapdhs were extracted with mutanolysin and purified on a cibacron blue sepharose column. subsequently, their dna sequences were elucidated. purified gapdhs bound p. gingivalis recombinant fimbrillin by western blot assay, furthermore, their dna sequences displayed a high degree of homology with one another. moreover, s. oralis recombinant gapdh inhibited coaggregation between p. gingivalis and the aforementioned five streptococcal strains in a dose-dependent manner. these results suggest that gapdhs of various  plaque-forming streptococci may be involved in their attachment to p. gingivalis  fimbriae and that they may contribute to p. gingivalis colonization.

TI  == path-dependency of the interaction between coaggregating and between non-coaggregating oral bacterial pairs--a thermodynamic approach.
AB  == coaggregation, i.e. specific recognition between bacteria from different species, is a well-described phenomenon in the human oral cavity but remains physically poorly understood. with our study we aimed at elucidating some aspects of the mechanism of the coaggregation between the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis j22 and actinomyces naeslundii 147, in particular with respect to the driving force for coaggregation and its pathway-dependency. to that end, the macroscopic turbidity of the bacterial suspension, the morphology of the coaggregates, binding isotherms and heats of interaction were compared between the above-mentioned coaggregating bacterial pair and a non-coaggregating pair, streptococcus sanguis pk1889 and a. naeslundii 147. the coaggregating pair forms  large aggregates, which rapidly sediment from the suspension while the non-coaggregating pair forms only very small coaggregates that remain homogeneously suspended. coaggregation is further characterized by a high affinity between the partner cells that bind to each other in a strong cooperative mode. the interactions between both pairs occur under the release of  heat and are thus enthalpically favorable. more heat is released for the coaggregating than for the non-coaggregating pair. adding the coaggregating bacteria in steps to each other leads to saturation of enthalpically favorable binding sites. this is observed when the streptococcus is added to the actinomyces as well as when the addition is done the other way around. it is concluded that the cooperativity of the coaggregation process is based on an increase of entropy. it is furthermore shown that the density of the coaggregates as well as the heat effect of formation of these coaggregates depend on the number of steps in which the partner cells are added to each other. adding s. oralis j22 in three steps to a. naeslundii 147 results in the formation of denser coaggregates under the release of less heat, as compared to that of addition in one step. these differences point to a larger entropy increase when in a step-wise mixing the coaggregating bacteria are allowed to form more densely-packed coaggregates.

AB  == four oral bacterial strains, of which two are considered aciduric and two are considered acid-sensitive, were grown under glucose-limiting conditions in chemostats to determine whether their membrane fatty acid profiles were altered in response to environmental acidification. streptococcus gordonii dl1, as well as the aciduric strains s. salivarius 57.i, and lactobacillus casei 4646 increased the levels of mono-unsaturated membrane fatty acids. the non-aciduric strain s. sanguis 10904 did not alter its membrane composition in response to ph  values examined here. thus, in response to low ph, aciduric oral bacteria alter their membrane composition to contain increased levels of long-chained, mono-unsaturated fatty acids. this suggests that membrane fatty acid adaptation is a common mechanism utilized by bacteria to withstand environmental stress.

AB  == adherent bacterial cells on the surfaces of two dental porcelain ceramics, three  composite resins and human enamel were examined using four types of bacteria strains. their adherent cells were counted on saliva-coated and uncoated material surfaces after sonication, and contact angle and zeta potential were measured for each adherent cell tested. a correlation between contact angle and bacterial cells on an uncoated surface was found to be higher in two streptococcus sanguis  cells than in s. mutans ingbritt and s. sobrinus omz 176, whereas there appeared  to be a higher correlation between s. mutans ingbritt or s. sobrinus omz 176 and  zeta potential on the uncoated surface. on the saliva-coated surface, a significantly high correlation was found between the adherent cells, with the exception of s. sanguis atcc 10 557, and the zeta potential. contact angle and zeta potential values were small when the surfaces of the materials were coated with saliva, as compared with those on the uncoated surface. the sonication condition (120 s) of adherent cells on the surface of the material significantly  depended on the types of bacteria cells, showing that s. mutans ingbritt (>50-60%) had a greater removal percentage than the others (<50%).

TI  == an in-vitro investigation of the antibacterial effect of nisin in root canals and canal wall radicular dentine.
AB  == aim: to determine whether nisin, a bacteriocin, would be effective at killing enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus gordonii cells in solution and within the root canal system. methodology: bacterial isolates of e. faecalis and s. gordonii were grown from glycerol stocks in closed tubes containing bhy broth at 37 degrees c. the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of nisin for both bacterial species was determined by a microdilution method. extracted human teeth were decoronated to produce roots of equal length with a single canal and divided into six groups of 10 roots. the canals were prepared to a master apical size 30  file using 0.04 taper ni-ti rotary instruments. bacterial samples of each species were inoculated into three groups of prepared roots and incubated in closed tubes at 37 degrees c for 21 days. the root canals in each group were then medicated with water (control), calcium hydroxide powder mixed with sterile water [ca(oh)2], or nisin and incubated for a further 7 days. rotary ni-ti files were used to take radicular dentine samples from the walls of each canal which were then incubated in bhy broth for 24 h. optical density (od600) readings were taken as a measure of bacterial growth. results: the mbc of nisin for e. faecalis and s. gordonii was 70 and 20 mg ml(-1) respectively. calcium hydroxide and nisin medication eradicated infection within the root canal while cells remained viable in the control group. mean optical density (od600) readings from canal wall dentine shavings infected with e. faecalis were 1.32 +/- 0.98, 0.73 +/- 0.27 and  0.69 +/- 0.38 for the control, ca(oh)2 and nisin samples respectively. corresponding mean readings for s. gordonii were 1.19 +/- 0.18, 0.73 +/- 0.15 and 0.60 +/- 0.29. the ca(oh)2 and nisin group readings were significantly (p < 0.01) lower than the control for each species as tested by student's t-test and mann-whitney u statistical analysis. values for ca(oh)2 and nisin were not significantly (p > 0.01) different. conclusion: nisin was effective at eradicating e. faecalis and s. gordonii cells in pure culture and was comparable  with ca(oh)2 in the elimination of these species from within the root canal system.

TI  == bactericidal effects of a fusion protein of llama heavy-chain antibodies coupled  to glucose oxidase on oral bacteria.
AB  == enzymes such as lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase (gox) are used as antimicrobial agents in oral care products. their low specificities and substantiveness can be reduced by covalent coupling of antimicrobial molecules to antibodies. variable domains (v(hh)) derived from llama heavy-chain antibodies are particularly suited for such an approach. the antibodies are composed solely  of heavy-chain dimers; therefore, production of active fusion proteins by using molecular biology-based techniques is less complicated than production by use of  conventional antibodies. in this study, a fusion protein consisting of v(hh) and  gox was constructed and expressed by saccharomyces cerevisiae. a llama was immunized with streptococcus mutans strain hg982. subsequently, b lymphocytes were isolated and cdna fragments encoding the v(hh) fragments were obtained by reverse transcription-pcr. after construction of a v(hh) library in escherichia coli and screening of the library against mutans group streptococci and streptococcus sanguinis strains, we found two v(hh) fragments with high specificities for s. mutans strains. a gox gene was linked to the two v(hh) genes and cloned into s. cerevisiae yeasts. the yeasts expressed and secreted the recombinant proteins into the growth medium. the test of binding of fusion proteins to oral bacteria through their v(hh) fragments showed that s. mutans had been specifically targeted by gox-s120, one of the fusion protein constructs. a low concentration of the fusion protein was also able to selectively kill s. mutans within 20 min in the presence of lactoperoxidase and potassium iodide. these findings demonstrate that the fusion protein gox-v(hh) is potentially valuable in the selective killing of target bacteria such as s. mutans.

AB  == background/aims: a simple in vivo approach to examine early dental plaque formation in the human mouth and to determine the effects of common dietary and oral hygiene procedures on biofilm formation is reported. methods: a custom designed device that fits securely behind the teeth of the mandibular arch provides a surface for microbial colonization. this device is prepared with denture acrylic and can be repeatedly used by the subject, exposing a large and constant surface area for microbial accumulation. results: large numbers of oral  bacteria colonized the device by 2 h; these increased significantly by 4 h (p < 0.05). bacterial colonization increased significantly after rinsing with a sucrose solution (p < 0.05) but remained unaffected after rinsing with water, a commercially available fluoride mouthrinse without antimicrobial agents, or brushing with a fluoride dentifrice (p > 0.05). rinsing with mouthrinses formulated with chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride or triclosan/copolymer significantly inhibited colonization (p < 0.05). a dose-dependent inhibition was  noted with chlorhexidine rinses (p < 0.05). brushing with a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice significantly inhibited microbial colonization compared with a control (p < 0.05). conclusion: this simple approach was useful for examining the effects of common dietary and oral hygiene procedures. significant biofilm inhibitory effects were noted with formulations that demonstrated efficacy in previous clinical studies.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of five root canal sealers.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the antimicrobial properties of five  endodontic sealers: endo fill, endomethasone, endomethasone n, sealer 26 and ah-plus, against the following microorganisms: candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces naeslundii.  the sealers were tested immediately, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after manipulation.the direct contact method through the observation of the microbial growth in liquid medium and the agar diffusion test were used to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the sealers. the results, in both methodologies used, showed that immediately after manipulation, endo-fill and endomethasone demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with no statistically significant difference between them. sealer 26 demonstrated the lowest antimicrobial activity. at all other times after manipulation, there were no statistically significant differences among all the sealers tested. in conclusion, none of the sealers totally inhibited the growth of the microorganisms. furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of each sealer decreased with time and was dependent upon  the microbial susceptibility to them.

TI  == effects of mouthrinses with triclosan, zinc ions, copolymer, and sodium lauryl sulphate combined with fluoride on acid formation by dental plaque in vivo.
AB  == bacteriological tests demonstrated a slight synergistic effect of triclosan and sodium lauryl sulphate (sls) on the growth of streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 in vitro. a single mouthrinse with sls (17.4 mm) or sls plus triclosan (3.5 mm) significantly decreased the number of salivary mutans streptococci in a group of 12 subjects up to 90 min after rinsing. the effect on plaque ph of a mouthrinse with either 12.0 mm naf, naf plus 10.0 mm zinc acetate, naf plus 17.4 mm sls, or naf plus sls plus 3.5 mm triclosan with or without the addition of zinc ions or 0.65% w/v of a polyvinylmethyl ether/maleic  acid copolymer was investigated. the plaque ph responses to a 10% w/v sucrose mouthrinse were measured in 2-day-old plaque with microtouch ph electrodes in six groups of 10 subjects 90 min after a single mouthrinse with test solution. there  was no significant difference in plaque ph between the various mouthrinses. in conclusion, triclosan enhanced the growth-inhibitory activity of sls against oral streptococci in vitro but not against salivary mutans streptococci in vivo. neither triclosan incorporated into a mouthrinse containing sls plus fluoride, nor the addition of zinc ions or copolymer affected acid formation by dental plaque in vivo.

TI  == [purification and characterization of sanguicin--a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus sanguis].
AB  == objective: streptococcus sanguis plays an important role in maintaining the periodontal microecological balance. previous studies have demonstrated that sanguicin--a kind of bacteriocin produced by s. sanguis has a prominent function  of inhibiting the growth of putative periodontopathic bacteria (ppb). the aim of  this study was to purify sanguicin and investigate its characters. methods: the raw extract of sanguicin was obtained from cells of s. sanguis by ultrasonication, salting out and dialysis. then the diethyl-aminoethyl-sepharose  gradual washing was done in conjunction with glucosan gel filtration for in the purfication of sanguicin. the characters of purified sanguicin were determined and its inhibitiory effect on ppb was measured by agar diffusion test. results: the purifed sanguicin was obtained; it was heat labile and proteinaceous; and by  sds-page, it showed a main band with the relative molecular mass of 65 x 10(3). the purifed sanguicin had a strong inhibitory effect on p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in vitro. conclusion: our methods are useful for the  purification of sanguicin. sanguicin has inhibitory effect on ppb obviously and will have a good prospect in periodontal ecological therapy.

TI  == molecular interactions of surface protein peptides of streptococcus gordonii with human salivary components.
AB  == oral streptococci play a large role in dental biofilm formation, and several types interact as early colonizers with the enamel salivary pellicle to form the  primary biofilm, as well as to incorporate other bacteria on tooth surfaces. interactions of surface molecules of individual streptococci with the salivary pellicle on the tooth surface have an influence on the etiological properties of  an oral biofilm. to elucidate the molecular interactions of streptococci with salivary components, binding between surface protein (sspb and pag) peptides of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sobrinus were investigated by utilizing  biacore biosensor technology. the analogous peptide [change of t at position 400  to k in sspb(390-402), resulting in the sspb(390-t400k-402) peptide] from s. gordonii showed the greatest response for binding to salivary components and inhibited the binding of streptococcus sanguis by more than 50% in a competitive  inhibition assay in a comparison with other sspb and pag peptides. this peptide also bound to the high-molecular-weight protein complex of salivary components and the agglutinin (gp340/dmbt1) peptide (scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain peptide 2 [srcrp 2]). in addition, the sspb(390-t400k-402) peptide was visualized by two surface positive charges in connection with the positively charged residues, in which lysine was a key residue for binding. therefore, the region containing lysine may have binding activity in s. gordonii and s. sanguis, and the srcrp 2 region may function as a receptor for the binding. these findings may provide useful information regarding the molecular mechanism of early biofilm formation by streptococci on tooth surfaces.

TI  == changing incidence of detected streptococcal bacteraemia in north yorkshire, england.
AB  == background & objectives: streptococcal bacteraemia remains a major and challenging clinical problem throughout the world. the epidemiology of these infections appears to be changing. in the present study we analysed the data collected over a period of 20 yr (1978-1999) to throw light on this. methods: laboratory records of all patients yielding clinically significant, non-pneumococcal, nonenterococcal streptococcal bacteraemia were reviewed for the decades 1978-1988 and 1990-1999 in the two districts (combined population 260,000). results: from a total of 3134 patients with detected bacteraemia 338 (10.8%) yielded streptococci. the organisms comprised: in the beta-haemolytic group (n=169), gas (32%), gbs (34%), gcs (5%), ggs (28%), grs (1%); in the non-haemolytic/streptococcus milleri group (n=160): s. milleri (21%), s. bovis (10%), s. sanguis (30%), s.mitis (10%), s. oralis (8%) and other 'viridans' streptococci (20%); nine isolates were of anaerobic streptococci. there was a steady increase in the number of blood cultures submitted for investigation during the period and streptococcal isolations of all species rose in proportion  (approximately x 2.5) in the second decade compared with the first. complementary data on the occurrence of necrotising fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome in these districts suggested a real increase in the occurrence of serious forms of gas infection. interpretation & conclusion: an increase in the level of detected streptococcal bacteraemia was seen in this part of england over 20 yr, involving  a wide variety of different streptococcal species. this represented both improved ascertainment of infection and an increase in the burden of disease in the population.

TI  == zymographic characterization of bacteriolytic enzymes produced by oral streptococci.
AB  == zymographic analysis was performed to know the bacteriolytic enzyme profiles of 4% sds extracts of oral streptococci, streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. salivarius. we investigated the five strains in each species and found that the profile was very similar among strains of the same species except for s. salivarius(the profile was classified into two types). on the other hand, the profile was considerably different among species. two major bacteriolytic enzymes of s. mutans showing molecular mass of 80 and 100 kda were  found using sds-boiled s. mutans or s. sobrinus cells as substrate. these bacteriolytic activities were less apparent in the gel containing s. mitis or s.  salivarius, and also not detectable in the gel containing s. sanguis. s. sobrinus extract showed only one bacteriolytic band (78 kda) as strong activity using s. sobrinus cells as substrate. s. sanguis extract showed no bacteriolytic bands using any streptococcal cells. extracts of either s. mitis or s. salivarius showed weak activity by using respective strains as substrate.

TI  == a novel glucan-binding protein with lipase activity from the oral pathogen streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans produces extracellular glucosyltransferases (gtfs) that synthesize glucans from sucrose. these glucans are important in determining the permeability properties and adhesiveness of dental plaque. gtfs and the gbpa glucan-binding protein are characterized by a binding domain containing a series  of 33-amino-acid repeats, called 'a' repeats. the s. mutans genome sequence was searched for orfs containing 'a' repeats, and one novel gene, gbpd, which appears to be unique to the mutans group of streptococci, was identified. the gbpd sequence revealed the presence of three 'a' repeats, in the middle of the protein, and a novel glucan-binding assay showed that gbpd binds to dextran with  a k(d) of 2-3 nm. construction of truncated derivatives of gbpd confirmed that the 'a' repeat region was essential for binding. furthermore, a gbpd knockout mutant was modified in the extent of aggregation induced by polymers derived from sucrose. the n-terminus of gbpd has a signal sequence, followed by a region with  no homologues in the public databases, while the c-terminus has homology to the alpha/beta hydrolase family (including lipases and carboxylesterases). gbpd contains the two regions typical of these enzymes: a gxsxg active site 'lipase box' and an 'oxyanion hole'. gbpd released free fatty acids (ffas) from a range of triglycerides in the presence of calcium, indicating a lipase activity. the glucan binding/lipase bifunctionality suggested the natural substrate for the enzyme may be a surface macromolecule consisting of carbohydrate linked to lipid. the gbpd mutant was less hydrophobic than wild-type and pure recombinant gbpd reduced the hydrophobicity of s. mutans and another plaque bacterium, streptococcus sanguinis. gbpd bound to and released ffa from lipoteichoic acid (lta) of s. sanguinis, but had no effect on lta from s. mutans. these results raise the intriguing possibility that gbpd may be involved in direct interspecies competition within the plaque biofilm.

AB  == the feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna (rdna) intergenic spacer (its) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (vs) was evaluated. the its regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of vs were amplified by pcr and sequenced. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis,  s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the its lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. the intraspecies similarity scores for the its sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for s. gordonii strains.  the interspecies similarity scores for the its sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. phylogenetic analysis of the its regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of vs is not parallel to that of the 16s rrna genes. one  hundred six clinical isolates of vs were identified by the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux vitek, marcy l'etoile, france) and by its sequencing, and the  level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their its sequences. the accuracy of using its sequencing for identification of vs was verified by 16s rdna sequencing for all strains except strains of s. oralis and s. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16s rdna sequences. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by its sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of vs.

AB  == objective: to investigate the bacterial flora of the gingival plaques of pediatric dental patients in order to establish baseline data for future studies  on the complex microbiota of the oral cavity of this group of child dental patients. subjects and methods: forty subjects, aged 3-12 years, were enrolled and investigated after informed consent was obtained. during the patients' first  visit to the dental clinic supragingival plaque samples were collected from the gingival area of buccal and lingual tooth surfaces of all primary and permanent molar teeth using sterile curettes. serially diluted samples were inoculated onto a set of selective and nonselective media and then incubated at the appropriate atmospheric conditions and temperatures. representative colonies of isolates were identified by standard methods, including hemolytic characteristics on blood agar and profiling on api 20s and api 20a as appropriate. results: a total of 183 isolates (123 aerobes and 60 anaerobes) were recovered from the 40 patients with  a mean count of 3 per sample of aerobes compared to 1.5 per sample for the anaerobes. streptococcus sanguis was the predominant aerobic species (23.6%) isolated from 29 (72.5%) of the 40 patients, followed by streptococcus mitis, 19.5 and 60%, streptococcus salivarius, 17.1 and 52.5% and streptococcus mutans,  17.1 and 52.5%. the frequency of isolation of anaerobic bacteria was prevotella spp. 50% from 30 (75%) of the 40 patients, fusobacterium spp., 18.3 and 27.5%, bacteroides spp., porphyromonas spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., 6.7 and 10%, 6.7 and 10%, and 5 and 7.5%, respectively. prevotella intermedia was the single most common species. conclusion: the results show that there were more aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria than the obligate anaerobes in the dental  plaque of the pediatric dental patients in kuwait. the high prevalence of the pioneering streptococci as well as black-pigmented prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. indicates that the dental plaques of the children were in the  developing stage, a precursor to the development of periodontal diseases.

TI  == salivary receptors for the proline-rich protein-binding and lectin-like adhesins  of oral actinomyces and streptococci.
AB  == colonization of the tooth surface by actinomyces and viridans group streptococci  involves the attachment of these bacteria to adsorbed salivary components of the  acquired enamel pellicle. the hypothesis that this attachment depends on specific adhesins has now been assessed from the binding of bacteria with well-defined adhesive properties to blots of sds-page-separated parotid and submandibular-sublingual (sm-sl) saliva. streptococcus sanguis and type 2 fimbriated actinomyces naeslundii, which bound terminal sialic acid and galbeta1-3galnac, respectively, recognized only a few sm-sl salivary components,  primarily mg2. in contrast, type 1 fimbriated a. naeslundii and s. gordonii, which bound purified proline-rich proteins (prps), recognized several other components from both sm-sl and parotid saliva. significantly, bacteria that lacked prp-binding and the lectin-like activities detected by binding to mg2 failed to bind any immobilized salivary component. these findings suggest the involvement of specific adhesins in bacterial recognition of many adsorbed salivary proteins and glycoproteins.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.

AB  == oral streptococci are major constituents of dental plaque, and their prevalence is implicated in various pathologies. therefore, accurate identification of oral  streptococci would be valuable for studies of cariogenic plaque and for diagnostic use in infective endocarditis. many oral streptococci possess glucosyltransferase enzymes that synthesize glucan, which is an obligate component of dental plaque. we established a rapid and precise method to identify oral streptococci by pcr using the species-specific region from the glucosyltransferase gene. with the species-specific primers, streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and s. gordonii could be successfully distinguished. further, we developed a simple method to extract the bacterial dna from saliva. using the resultant dna as a template, the proposed pcr detection was performed. their distribution was in accord with results of conventional biochemical tests. these findings indicate that the present pcr method is useful for the analysis of oral streptococci and can be successfully used in clinical applications to identify pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious disease and/or endocarditis.

TI  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 demonstrate strain-selective activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (hbd-2 and hbd-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. a few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. however, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of hbd-2 and hbd-3 against a collection  of oral organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, and candida albicans). radial diffusion assays were used to test hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. there was significant variability in mics, which was strain specific rather than species specific. mics ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-3. hbd-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, respectively. hbd-2 and hbd-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against  the candida species evaluated. interestingly, an association between hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities was noted. this suggests that the two peptides may have similar  mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. the lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == biofilm-specific surface properties and protein expression in oral streptococcus  sanguis.
AB  == objective: oral streptococci are primary colonisers of the tooth surface and are  abundant in dental plaque biofilms. bacteria growing in these relatively dense, surface-associated communities are phenotypically quite distinct from their planktonic counterparts. the purpose of the present study was to develop a method to investigate biofilm-specific surface protein expression by streptococcus sanguis to help provide a better understanding of the critical events in plaque development. design: biofilm cells were grown on the surface of glass beads in a  biofilm device fed with mucin-containing artificial saliva. planktonic cells were grown in continuous culture at approximately the same growth rate. surface hydrophobicity of biofilm and planktonic cells was determined by hexadecane partitioning, and expression of streptococcal fibronectin adhesin csha was determined in elisa using specific antiserum. antisera raised to glutaraldehyde-fixed whole biofilm or planktonic grown cells were used to screen  an expression library of s. sanguis genomic dna, and isolated clones were sequenced. results: phenotypic analysis of biofilm and planktonic cells confirmed that mode of growth affected surface properties of s. sanguis. thus, hydrophobicity and csha expression was significantly elevated in biofilm cells. library screening with biofilm antiserum yielded 32 recombinant clones representing 21 different s. sanguis proteins involved in adhesion and colonisation, carbohydrate utilisation or bacterial metabolism. in differential analysis of four selected escherichia coli clones, biofilm antiserum reacted five times stronger than planktonic antiserum with cell-free extracts of clones encoding homologues of csha and cna collagen adhesin of staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that these surface proteins are up-regulated in biofilm cells. in contrast, both antisera reacted equally strongly with cell-free extracts of the remaining two clones (encoding dihydrofolate synthase and an unknown protein). conclusions: the method described represents a useful means for determining bacterial protein expression in biofilms based on a combination of molecular and  immunological techniques. surface expression of putative fibronectin and collagen adhesins was up-regulated in biofilm cells.

AB  == the aim of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (naoci) in preventing inoculation of periapical tissues with contaminated patency files. twenty-eight extracted human permanent teeth with single canals were used in the study. group i teeth were filled with naocl, and #15 stainless steel files contaminated with streptococcus sanguis (atcc #10556) were allowed to pass through the naoci into the culture medium. the teeth in group ii were also filled with naocl, but the contaminated files used in group ii canals were immersed in naocl for 10 s prior to being placed into the canals and  cultured. the negative control group used sterile files (0% growth), the first positive control group used contaminated patency files in teeth with empty canals (100% growth), and the second positive control group placed contaminated files into broth next to teeth filled with naocl (to evaluate potential chlorine leakage; 100% growth). the experimental results showed no positive growth of s. sanguis for groups i and ii, indicating that the naocl present in the canal after irrigation was sufficient to kill the test organism.

TI  == influence of weight on removal of co-adhering bacteria from salivary pellicles by different modes of brushing.
AB  == this study compared removal of pairs of co-adhering and non-co-adhering oral actinomyces and streptococci from salivary pellicles by manual, rotating/oscillating electric and sonic toothbrushes, applying weights up to 240  g. first, actinomyces were allowed to adhere to a pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through  the chamber at 33 degrees c. on average, 34-39% of the adhering bacteria were adhering as single organisms. for co-adhering and non-co-adhering pairs, 33 and 10% of the adhering bacteria were involved, respectively, in aggregates comprising more than 10 organisms. brushing by hand removed 82% at low weight (40 g), which was less than by electric (93%) or sonic (92%) brushing, while for all  modes of brushing bacterial removal increased with increasing weight to 95-99%. for a non-co-adhering pair, subsequent exposure of brushed pellicles to a streptococcal suspension yielded only 2-16% of bacteria involved in large aggregates, regardless of the mode of brushing. for the co-adhering pair, however, de novo streptococcal adhesion to hand-brushed pellicles yielded 34-57%  of bacteria involved in large aggregates, while electric and sonic brushing left  22-35% of the bacteria involved in large aggregates. de novo streptococcal adhesion for the co-adhering pair increased with increasing weight for the electric and sonic brush in contrast to the manual brush. since a strong influence of co-adhesion is evident in de novo streptococcal adhesion, despite nearly complete removal of all actinomyces, these observations suggest that the three modes of brushing leave footprints to which streptococci preferentially adhere.

TI  == distribution of cells between solid/liquid and liquid/liquid interfaces.
AB  == the use of aqueous two-phase systems (atpss) and each system's individual phase-forming species to prevent streptococcus sanguis attachment onto hydroxyapatite discs was explored. the strategy that we followed was to attach the cells to a solid surface in the presence of an additional interface. conditions under which, simultaneously, the phase-forming species form two phases and the cells proliferate were identified. growth curves were constructed in the  presence of various polymers and salts commonly used to prepare atpss. several aqueous two-phase systems were selected such that bacterial growth was comparable to that observed in pure medium. cells were allowed to attach to hydroxyapatite discs for 7 days in the presence of varying concentrations of media, media with polymer, media with salt, and media with atps. streptococcus sanguis attachment to the disks was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. the addition of a peg/na(2)so(4) atps to high concentrations of yeast-tryptone (yt) media (>65%) and of a peg/mgso(4) atps to nutrient-limited media reduces surface coverage of s. sanguis to less than 10%. comparison of the attachment levels for the systems  containing peg/na(2)so(4) to media containing the individual phase-forming species and to the yt reference systems indicated that nutrient availability did  not affect attachment.

TI  == the anti-adherence effect of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts on the adhesion of early settlers in dental plaque to saliva-coated glass surfaces.
AB  == the aqueous extracts of piper betle and psidium guajava were prepared and tested  for their anti-adherence effect on the adhesion of early plaque settlers (strep.  mitis, strep. sanguinis and actinomyces sp.). the saliva-coated glass surfaces were used to simulate the pellicle-coated enamel surface in the oral cavity. our  results showed that the anti-adherence activities of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts towards the bacteria were different between the bacterial species. psidium guajava was shown to have a slightly greater anti-adherence effect on strep. sanguinis by 5.5% and actinomyces sp. by 10% and a significantly higher effect on strep. mitis (70%) compared to piper betle. the three bacterial  species are known to be highly hydrophobic, and that hydrophobic bonding seemed to be an important factor in their adherence activities. it is therefore suggested that the plant extracts, in expressing their anti-adherence activities, could have altered the hydrophobic nature of the bonding between the bacteria and the saliva-coated glass surfaces.

TI  == role of oral bacterial flora in calcific aortic stenosis: an animal model.
AB  == background: calcific aortic stenosis is a major public health problem in the united states. the mechanism of calcification remains unclear. the hypothesis that low grade chronic or recurrent bacterial endocarditis with specific calcifiable bacteria is a cause of calcification of the aortic valves was investigated using an animal model. such bacteria are typically present as part of the normal human oral flora. methods: forty new zealand white rabbits were divided into four groups: group 1, control (1 ml of normal saline); group 2, corynebacterium matruchotti 100,000 colonies; group 3, streptococcus sanguis ii 10 colonies; and group 4, c matruchotti 100,000 colonies plus s sanguis ii 10 colonies. animals were inoculated with bacteria through a flexible catheter placed through the aortic valve through a right carotid cut down. inoculations were repeated every 3 days the first 2 weeks and then twice a week thereafter. at postmortem examination the aortic valves were harvested, embedded in paraffin, and stained with von kossa stain. they were also examined by scanning and transmission electron micrography. results: group 4 had 93.3% large calcifications (confluent calcium densities that are easily recognized with minimal magnification) and 6.6% small microcalcifications (dustlike microscopic particles requiring a compound microscope to appreciate) of the aortic valves. group 3 exhibited large calcification in 20% and small in 40% of the aortic valves. group 1 and group 2 had no evidence of calcification. conclusions: these  results suggest that recurrent low-grade endocarditis from calcifying oral bacteria, particularly when occurring with synergistic strains, may be one cause  of calcific aortic stenosis.

TI  == reduction of viable bacteria in dentinal tubules treated with clindamycin or tetracycline.
AB  == aim: we sought to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of clindamycin and tetracycline in bovine dentinal tubules. methods: dentinal tubules of 32 cylindrical bovine root specimens were infected with streptococcus sanguis n1. clindamycin 2% or tetracycline 2% (ledermix) was placed in the root canal for 1 week. powder dentin samples obtained from within the canal lumina by using international standards organization no. 25 to no. 31 burs were examined for the  presence of vital bacteria after the brain-heart infusion plates were inoculated  and the colony-forming units were counted. the potent effect of the medicaments was also evaluated through the use of the agar diffusion test. results: heavy bacterial infection was observed in the control bovine root specimens at the layer close to the lumen. this decreased rapidly from layer to layer up to the deepest layer tested (300-400 microm), which contained several hundred colony-forming units. clindamycin significantly reduced the amount of viable bacteria in each dentin layer compared with the positive control and tetracycline (p <.01). the agar diffusion test, wherein dilutions in increments of 1/3 and 1/9 were used, revealed that both medicaments had antibacterial activity, but clindamycin was significantly better. in the 1/27 dilution, clindamycin had a minor effect and tetracycline had no effect at all. conclusion: under the experimental conditions used in this study, the commercial preparations of clindamycin were more effective than those of tetracycline (ledermix) in the agar diffusion test and clindamycin penetrated into dentinal tubules up to 400 microm. thus, it has the potential to serve as an effective intracanal medicament in persistent infections when other medicaments fail.

AB  == the adherence and dissociation of candida albicans, c. tropicalis, streptococcus  mutans and s. sanguis to six substrates including hydroxylapatite (hap) which exhibit various hydrophobicity, was examined by the use of a bioluminescent adenosine triphosphate (atp) assay. dissolution of hap by c. albicans or s. mutans was determined spectrophotometrically by the use of o-cresolphthalein complexone. in the adherence of c. tropicalis, s. mutans and s. sanguis, the amount of adherent cells correlated with the hydrophobicity of the substrates. in contrast, the adherence of c. albicans to hap was extraordinary high, although the adherence of the fungi also correlated with the hydrophobicity of the substrates, except for hap. the yeasts attached to hap was effectively removed by high concentration of either phosphate or calcium ions. the amount of calcium-release from hap caused by c. albicans and s. mutans was 113 microg ml(-1) (final ph = 3.45), and 5.4 microg ml(-1) (final ph 4.81), respectively and the maximum growth of c. albicans and s. mutans was 10(7) cfu ml(-1) and 7.4 x 10(12) cfu ml(-1), respectively. the results, taken together, suggest that c. albicans adhere to hap specifically through electrostatic interaction, and that,  in a much smaller number (1.0/7.4 x 10(5)), c. albicans possesses the ability to  dissolve hap to a greater extent (approximately 20-fold) when compared with s. mutans.

AB  == coadhesion between oral microbial pairs is an established factor in the spatiotemporal development and prevalence of mixed-species communities in early dental plaque in vivo. this study compares removal and de novo adhesion of pairs  of coadhering and non-coadhering oral actinomyces and streptococci by sonic brushing on salivary pellicles in a non-contact mode as a function of the distance between the brush and the pellicle surface in vitro. first, actinomycetes were adhered to a pellicle surface, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were allowed to adhere. removal was examined by non-contact,  sonic brushing with a wetted brush on a either a wetted or a substratum immersed  to a depth of 7 mm. after brushing, de novo adhesion of streptococci to brushed pellicles was studied. for coadhering and non-coadhering pairs, 34% and 9%, respectively, of the adhering bacteria were involved in aggregates comprising more than 10 organisms. non-contact, sonic brushing removed up to 99% of the adhering bacteria, regardless of the state of immersion of the substratum. bacterial removal decreased with increasing distance of up to 6 mm between brush  and pellicle surface. for the non-coadhering pair, subsequent exposure of pellicles to a streptococcal suspension yielded about 6% of bacteria involved in  large aggregates. alternatively, de novo adhesion of the coadhering streptococcal strain to pellicles brushed on the wetted substratum yielded 31% of bacteria involved in large aggregates, but after brushing the immersed substratum only 12% of the adhering bacteria were found in large aggregates. it is concluded that non-contact sonic brushing, under immersion, removes high percentage of adhering  bacterial pairs up to a distance of 6 mm between the brush and the pellicle surface. however, non-contact, sonic brushing with only a thin wet film on the substratum may leave footprints to which streptococci preferentially adhere.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of semiconductor laser irradiation on implant surfaces.
AB  == purpose: this study was conducted to investigate the antimicrobial effect of an 809-nm semiconductor laser on common dental implant surfaces. materials and methods: sandblasted and acid-etched (sa), plasma-sprayed (tps), and hydroxyapatite-coated (ha) titanium disks were incubated with a suspension of s.  sanguinis (atcc 10556) and subsequently irradiated with a gallium-aluminum-arsenide (gaalas) laser using a 600-microm optical fiber with a  power output of 0.5 to 2.5 w, corresponding to power densities of 176.9 to 884.6  w/cm2. bacterial reduction was calculated by counting colony-forming units on blood agar plates. cell numbers were compared to untreated control samples and to samples treated with chlorhexidine digluconate (chx). heat development during irradiation of the implants placed in bone blocks was visualized by means of shortwave thermography. results: in tps and sa specimens, laser irradiation led to a significant bacterial reduction at all power settings. in an energy-dependent manner, the number of viable bacteria was reduced by 45.0% to 99.4% in tps specimens and 57.6% to 99.9% in sa specimens. on ha-coated disks, a  significant bacterial kill was achieved at 2.0 w (98.2%) and 2.5 w (99.3%) only (t test, p < .05). for specimens treated with chx, the bacterial counts were reduced by 99.99% in tps and ha-coated samples and by 99.89% in sa samples. discussion: the results of the study indicate that the 809-nm semiconductor laser is capable of decontaminating implant surfaces. surface characteristics determine the necessary power density to achieve a sufficient bactericidal effect. the bactericidal effect, however, was lower than that achieved by a 1-minute treatment with 0.2% chx. the rapid heat generation during laser irradiation requires special consideration of thermal damage to adjacent tissues. conclusion: no obvious advantage of semiconductor laser treatment over conventional methods of disinfection could be detected in vitro.

AB  == although chlorhexidine is one of the most efficacious antimicrobial agents used for the prevention of dental caries, side effects limit its application. the effects of gaegurin 6 (ggn6), an animal-derived cationic peptide, and its derivatives ptp6 and ptp12 on the growth of oral streptococci were investigated to assess the potential of these agents for use in the prevention of dental caries. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of the peptides for inhibition of the growth of oral streptococci (streptococcus mutans , s. sobrinus, s. sanguis and s. gordonii) ranged from 1.2 to 8.2 mum. the peptides also exhibited marked synergistic antibacterial effects with chlorhexidine or xylitol. the most effective combinations (fractional inhibitory concentration index of 0.5) were xylitol with ggn6 against s. gordonii 10558 and chlorhexidine with either ggn6 or ptp6 against s. sobrinus omz-175. these results indicate that cationic peptides alone or in combination with chlorhexidine or xylitol might prove effective for the inhibition of the growth of cariogenic oral streptococci in situ.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == effect of increasing silver content in phosphate-based glasses on biofilms of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == silver is a powerful antibacterial ion that may be useful for dealing with localized infections, such as periodontitis. however, the use of silver in this role could be significantly improved by the development of an effective means of  delivery. phosphate-based glasses may provide a means of delivering the ions in a controlled manner. in our study, we have examined the effect of increasing silver content in phosphate-based glasses on biofilms of streptococcus sanguis. glasses  of nominally the same dissolution rate were doped with silver at 1, 5,10, and 15  mol % and the number of colony-forming units (cfus) determined after 6 and 24 h in a constant depth film fermenter (cdff). the 1 mol % silver showed little change between 6 and 24 h. however, only 0.5 log cfus were present on the glass containing 5 mol % at 6 h, and this reduced to virtually zero at 24 h. few viable bacteria were found on the 10 mol % glass at both 6 and 24 h. the 15 mol % glass  was investigated in this experiment, but no viable counts were detected. in a second set of experiments, glasses with 10 and 15 mol % silver were tested in the cdff for up to 192 h. for the 10 mol % silver glass, there was approximately 0.8  log cfus on this glass, which dropped to almost zero at 50 h. this was approximately 1.5-2.0 log reduction in cfus compared to controls, and this difference was maintained for the first 50 h. after 50 h, there was a slow increase in the cfus on all samples. however, cfus on the 10 mol % silver glass were still suppressed up to 192 h compared to the controls. however, both controls also exhibited a decrease in viable counts at 50 h; this may have been due to carryover of silver into the control sample holders. however, this was minimized by the specimen layout in the cdff and by having gaps between specimen  sets. for the 15 mol % silver glass, counts for both this glass and the controls  decreased to virtually zero between 24 and 48 h, but the numbers slowly increased up to 170 h, but the number of cfus was suppressed compared to the 10 mol % glass at the same time point. the decrease seen is clearly the effect of the silver ions; however, the slow increase in cfus may be accounted for by the biofilms forming thick layers on top of the glass discs inhibiting the release of ions from the glass by forming a "sacrificial layer" through which further ions have to diffuse.

AB  == the authors report on 20 immunocompetent patients with brain abscess after 12 cases of middle ear, seven tooth and a single frontal sinus infection. the clinical aspects, hematochemical and microbiological data, the role of imaging diagnostics (ct, mr) and the type of treatment are analysed. neurosurgery was performed on 17 patients (85%), eight of whom subsequently underwent evacuation of the primary source of infection (four mastoidectomies, two timpanoplasties, two tooth extractions). mastoidectomy was eventually carried out on one of the three patients who did not undergo neurosurgery. microbiological diagnosis was possible in nine patients through culture examination: proteus mirabilis in three cases, peptostreptococcus sp. in two, micrococcus varians, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus viridans not typed in single cases. the pus was sterile in eight patients (47.1% of those operated). an association of two antimicrobial agents was used in 18 patients, while in two cases monotherapy  was preferred, based on the isolated bacteria. treatment lasted on average 38 days. the most frequently used therapy regimen (75%) was the association of a beta-lactam drug with chloramphenicol or metronidazole. therapy was successful in 19/20 patients; one patient died. there was no significant difference in prognostic terms with regard to sex, age, duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis, clinical picture at onset, number and size of abscesses or type of treatment. recognising the first clinical signs and symptoms (headache, fever, alterations in consciousness, focal neurological deficit, epileptic seizures) is  extremely important for prompt diagnosis of brain abscess.

TI  == enthalpy of interaction between coaggregating and non-coaggregating oral bacterial pairs--a microcalorimetric study.
AB  == bacterial adhesion and coaggregation are involved in the development of oral biofilms, called dental plaque. although various techniques have already been used to study different aspects of these bacterial interactions, microcalorimetry has not yet been applied. this paper describes how isothermal reaction calorimetry can be employed to determine the enthalpy of coaggregation between two oral bacterial pairs. for most biological processes, the enthalpy tends to reach a minimum value, reflecting the most stable state, which is directly related to the heat content of the system. the calorimeter consists of four measuring units where reaction ampoules are filled with 1.5 ml of an actinomyces  naeslundii 147 suspension, while reference ampoules are filled with buffer only.  after equilibration at 25 degrees c, 80 microl of a streptococcal suspension was  titrated into the reaction ampoules. to study possible saturation of the binding  sites on the actinomyces surface, three consecutive injections with streptococcal suspensions were done. following each injection, a 20-microl aliquot was taken from the ampoule kept outside the calorimeter and the number of free (s(f)) and bound (s(b)) streptococci was determined microscopically. experiments were carried out with a coaggregating streptococcal strain (streptococcus oralis j22)  and a non-coaggregating strain (streptococcus sanguis pk1889), serving as a control. the coaggregation enthalpy was exothermic, that is, heat was released in the reaction ampoule upon coaggregation and the heat released by the coaggregating pair minus the heat released by the non-coaggregating pair yielded  a coaggregation enthalpy of -0.015 x 10(-6) mj/bound streptococcus for the first  injection. upon consecutive injections, the coaggregation enthalpy decreased to -0.0004 x 10(-6) mj/bound streptococcus. comparison with enthalpy changes reported for lectin-carbohydrate binding suggests that a huge number of binding sites are involved in the formation of one bacterial coaggregate.

TI  == comparative antistreptococcal activity of photobactericidal agents.
AB  == in order to establish a comparative order of efficacy among established photosensitising compounds currently under investigation, the in vitro photobactericidal activities of six commercially available photosensitisers were  investigated at equal concentration against streptococcus sanguis using a helium  neon (hene) laser (632.8 nm). of the photosensitisers used, the four phenothiazinium compounds were efficient photobactericidal agents as was the protoporphyrin ix salt. however, the zinc phthalocyaninetetrasulfonate was less effective. of the active agents, 1,9-dimethyl methylene blue (dmmb) was notable in achieving complete bacterial kill when used at a concentration of 40.85 microm in conjunction with a light energy dose of 21.8 j cm(-2), although there was inherent dark activity associated with this compound. since each of the photosensitisers is well known to produce singlet oxygen, the relative activities exhibited are thought to be due to differences in bacterial cell uptake, which in turn are related to the physicochemical properties of the photosensitisers, in particular, to the combination of lipophilicity and ionic character.

AB  == aim: to determine whether 'mgp' gutta-percha (westport, ct, usa), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. methodology: inocula of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

TI  == identification of streptococcus sanguinis with a pcr-generated species-specific dna probe.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to design a pcr-generated dna probe and determine the specificity of the probe for the identification of clinical isolates of streptococcus sanguinis. to do this, we examined over 200 arbitrarily primed pcr (ap-pcr) amplicon patterns obtained with dna from clinical isolates of s. sanguinis. a 1.6-kb dna amplicon that was common to all ap-pcr profiles was extracted from agarose gels and then cloned and sequenced. a search for a similar sequence in the genbank database with the blastn program revealed that the 1.6-kb dna fragment comprised an intergenic region between two housekeeping genes, uncc  (proton-translocating atpase) and mura (udp-n-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase). three digoxigenin-labeled dna probes were synthesized on the basis  of the sequence of the 1.6-kb fragment: the sequence of probe ssa-1 contained the proton-translocating atpase (uncc) and the entire intergenic region, the sequence of probe ssa-2 contained only the intergenic region, and the sequence of probe ssa-3 contained an internal region of the mura gene. dot blot hybridization showed that the three probes displayed signals for hybridization to both s. sanguinis strain atcc 10556 and the s. sanguinis clinical isolates. probe ssa-1,  however, hybridized to dna from s. oralis and s. mitis. probe ssa-3 hybridized to dna from s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, and s. vestibularis. the probe ssa-2-specific intergenic region appeared to be specific for s. sanguinis. the results from this study suggest that probe ssa-2 may serve as a species-specific dna probe for the identification of clinical isolates of s. sanguinis.

AB  == background: in recent years, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis has been enhanced by the use of echocardiography. we sought, therefore, to review its effect on the management of endocarditis in children. methods: we reviewed all the patients presenting to our institution for evaluation for infective endocarditis from may 1994 to january 2002. the patients were stratified according to whether or not they had congenitally malformed hearts. results: of the 90 referred patients identified, 46 (51%) had positive ultrasonic findings. of these, we excluded 26 patients because of the presence of indwelling lines. the remaining 20 patients with features of endocarditis had a median age of 6.5 years, and a range from 0.14 to 8.5 years. there were 4 patients with normal hearts, and 16 with congenital cardiac malformations. we identified rupture of a  sinus of valsalva in four patients, with rupture into the left ventricle in two,  and into the right ventricle and right atrium in one each. the mitral valve was involved in six patients, the aortic valve in another six, including all four with rupture of the sinus of valsalva, both mitral and aortic valves in three, the pulmonary trunk in three patients, and the tricuspid valve and a blalock-taussig shunt in one patient each. organisms isolated included streptococcus mitis in 4 patients, streptococcus pneumoniae in 2 patients, streptococcus sanguis in 1, staphylococcus aureus in 3, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, and enteroccocus in 2. cultures proved negative in 7 patients.  surgical intervention was needed in 12 patients, and one died (5%). only the left-sided chambers were involved in those with normal hearts. both patients infected with streptococcus pneumoniae had rupture of a sinus of valsalva. conclusion: involvement of the left-sided chambers is more likely in structurally normal hearts, and in cases with rupture of a sinus of valsalva, in which case infection with streptococcus pneumonia should be suspected.

TI  == stress as a determinant of saliva-mediated adherence and coadherence of oral and  nonoral microorganisms.
AB  == objective: the mucosal secretory proteins, such as the salivary proteins, play a  key role in the acquisition and regulation of the mucosal microflora. most notably, some microorganisms utilize the host's secretory proteins to adhere to the mucosa; a first step in colonization and infection. the secretory proteins also influence colonization by affecting the binding among microorganisms, a process denoted as coadherence. previously we reported that acute stressors cause specific changes in saliva composition. the present study investigated to what extent these changes influence saliva-mediated microbial adherence and coadherence (ex vivo). methods: thirty-two male undergraduates provided unstimulated saliva before and during a control condition and two stressors: a memory test and a surgery video presentation. we used saliva-coated microplates to test the adherence of bacteria for which the oral cavity is either a natural reservoir (eg, viridans streptococci) or a portal of entry (eg, helicobacter pylori). we also tested the saliva-mediated co-adherence between streptococcus gordonii and the yeast candida albicans. correlation analyses were performed to determine the relationships between changes in microbial adherence and the concentrations of potential salivary ligands, viz. cystatin s, the mucins muc5b and muc7, s-iga, lactoferrin, alpha-amylase, and total salivary protein. results: during the memory test, saliva-mediated adhesion of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and h. pylori increased, whereas the coadherence of c. albicans with s. gordonii decreased. during the surgical video presentation the saliva-mediated adherence of h. pylori, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis increased. these changes were independent of salivary flow rate, but correlated with specific changes in salivary protein composition. conclusion: the results show that even moderate stressors, by altering the activity of the mucosal secretory glands, may affect microbial colonization processes such as adherence and coadherence. this study hereby presents a mechanism by which stress may affect the mucosal microflora and susceptibility to infectious disease.

TI  == real-time interaction of oral streptococci with human salivary components.
AB  == oral streptococci are present in large numbers in dental plaque and several types interact with the enamel salivary pellicle to form a biofilm on tooth surfaces. the respective affinity of individual streptococci for salivary components has an influence on the etiologic properties of oral biofilm in the development of dental caries. we studied real-time biospecific interactions between oral streptococci and salivary components utilizing biosensor technology to analyze surface plasmon resonance. streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans showed  significant responses for binding to salivary components, in comparison with other bacteria. further, the association rates (4.1 x 10-11/bacterium) and dissociation rate (5.7 +/- 0.9 x 10-3 second(s)-1) were higher for s. sanguis than for s. mutans (2.4 x 10-11 and 2.9 +/- 0.8 x 10-3) and streptococcus mitis (1.3 x 10-11 and 3.5 +/- 1.3 x 10-3). however, the association equilibrium constants (8.2 s/bacterium) for s. mutans was 2 times higher in than s. mitis (3.8) and slightly higher than s. sanguis (7.2). these findings may provide useful information regarding the mechanism of early biofilm formation by streptococci on the tooth surface.

TI  == glucan-binding proteins of the oral streptococci.
AB  == the synthesis of extracellular glucan is an integral component of the sucrose-dependent colonization of tooth surfaces by species of the mutans streptococci. in investigators' attempts to understand the mechanisms of plaque biofilm development, several glucan-binding proteins (gbps) have been discovered. some of these, the glucosyltransferases, catalyze the synthesis of glucan, whereas others, designated only as glucan-binding proteins, have affinities for different forms of glucan and contribute to aspects of the biology of their host  organisms. the functions of these latter glucan-binding proteins include dextran-dependent aggregation, dextranase inhibition, plaque cohesion, and perhaps cell wall synthesis. in some instances, their glucan-binding domains share common features, whereas in others the mechanism for glucan binding remains unknown. recent studies indicate that at least some of the glucan-binding proteins modulate virulence and some can act as protective immunogens within animal models. overall, the multiplicity of gbps and their aforementioned properties are testimonies to their importance. future studies will greatly advance the understanding of the distribution, function, and regulation of the gbps and place into perspective the facets of their contributions to the biology  of the oral streptococci.

AB  == the effect of chlorhexidine (chx) on the viability of streptococcus sanguinis was investigated in a preclinical biofilm model separately on cells in the planktonic or attached life form. saliva-coated human enamel and glass slides were exposed to the streptococci suspended in sterile saliva for 30 min and 60 min in the flow chamber system. the chx exposition was performed in two parts: pretreatment of the planktonic bacteria before their attachment to enamel or glass, and treatment of bacteria already attached to enamel. the susceptibility measured by vitality percentages was determined by fluorescence microscopy using vital/dead cells. after chx pretreatment of planktonic cells, the mean values of the vitality percentages after adhesion were 14-18% (enamel) and 24-25% (glass). in contrast,  the mean vitality percentages of untreated attached streptococci reached 70-75% (enamel) and 68% (glass). the vitality percentages of chx-exposed bacteria dropped markedly to 2-5%, whereas those of untreated attached cells remained at 65-66%. the exposure of initially attached streptococci to chx resulted in greater reduction of bacterial viability than with the planktonic counterparts. this preclinical biofilm model allows the investigation of various bacterial life forms and can furthermore be used to select efficient antiplaque therapeutics which might be beneficial for clinical plaque control.

TI  == in vitro assay for the screening of the plaque-reducing activity of antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria grown in biofilms are less susceptible to antimicrobial agents than planktonic bacteria. one of the most common biofilms in humans is dental plaque.  to investigate the antimicrobial activity against dental bacteria grown in biofilms, biofilms were generated with streptococcus sanguis on hydroxyapatite disks to mimic the tooth surface. after 48 h of aerobic incubation at 37 degrees  c in a continuous flow culture, a biofilm consisting of streptococcus sanguis became visible on the surface of the disks. the disks were removed from the growth chamber and placed in different vessels containing either chlorhexidine digluconate (cas 55-56-1, 0.1% or 1.0%), polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine (1.5% or 7.5%), or octenidine dihydrochloride (cas 70775-75-6, 0.05% or 0.1%) for 5 or 30  min. in addition, the antiseptics were applied to the bacterial suspension in the growth chamber. a significant difference was observed in the antimicrobial activity against bacteria in the suspension liquid compared to the bacteria grown in biofilms. the best reduction factors were obtained with chlorhexidine (1.0%, 30 min) for either sessile (3.97 ig) or planktonic bacteria (> or = 5.58 ig). clear relationships between the doses and times of action were found for the assessed agents. therefore, the authors conclude that the present in vitro assay  is a quick and cost-effective model to screen the activity of antimicrobial agents against bacteria grown in biofilms.

TI  == invasion and killing of human endothelial cells by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == colonization of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci can result in infective endocarditis and possibly atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. we investigated the ability of  selected oral streptococci to infect monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) in 50% human plasma and to produce cytotoxicity. planktonic streptococcus gordonii ch1 killed huvec over a 5-h period by peroxidogenesis (alpha-hemolysin) and by acidogenesis but not by production of protein exotoxins. huvec were protected fully by addition of supplemental buffers and bovine liver catalase to the culture medium. streptococci were also found to  invade huvec by an endocytic mechanism that was dependent on polymerization of actin microfilaments and on a functional cytoskeleton, as indicated by inhibition with cytochalasin d and nocodazole. electron microscopy revealed streptococci attached to huvec surfaces via numerous fibrillar structures and bacteria in membrane-encased cytoplasmic vacuoles. following invasion by s. gordonii ch1, huvec monolayers showed 63% cell lysis over 4 h, releasing 64% of the total intracellular bacteria into the culture medium; however, the bacteria did not multiply during this time. the ability to invade huvec was exhibited by selected  strains of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. mitis, and s. oralis but only weakly by s. salivarius. comparison of isogenic pairs of s. gordonii revealed a requirement for several surface proteins for maximum host cell invasion: glucosyltransferase, the sialic acid-binding protein hsa, and the hydrophobicity/coaggregation proteins csha and cshb. deletion of genes for the antigen i/ii adhesins, sspa and sspb, did not affect invasion. we hypothesize that peroxidogenesis and invasion of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci are integral events in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.

TI  == pathogenesis of adamantiades-behcet's disease.
AB  == the aetiology of adamantiades-behcet's disease remains unknown and its pathogenesis is not fully understood. linked intrinsic and extrinsic factors are  thought to contribute to the development of the disease, which probably occurs by environmental triggering of a genetically determined disorder. transmission is solely vertical, indicating that the disease is not contagious. genetic factors have been investigated and a significant link of hla-b51, especially of hla-b5101, has been identified. however, none of the functional correlates of the disease appear to be restricted by hla-b51. recently, the role of the genes encoding tnf, tap proteins and mica has been emphasised. extrinsic pathogenetic candidates have been identified, including bacterial ( streptococcus sanguis, mycoplasma fermentas) and viral (human herpes virus) antigens and environmental pollution, which may cross-react with oral mucosal antigens and induce immunological mechanisms. a common factor linking some of the possible pathogenetic agents is extrinsically induced tissue stress or heat shock proteins, which react with host tissues and elicit significant th1 cell responses. neutrophils may also play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease, as they are attracted by macrophages and activated endothelial cells, which release cytokines and chemokines (especially il-8) at the site of the lesions, and thus contribute to tissue damage and self maintenance of inflammation. endothelial activation leading to a chronic local inflammation process together with platelet and serum factors enhance coagulation and thrombosis.

TI  == will triclosan in toothpaste select for resistant oral streptococci?
AB  == the aims of the study were to determine the in vitro sensitivity of triclosan against viridans streptococci and the impact of triclosan on the normal oral microflora. nine subjects used a triclosan-containing toothpaste for 2 weeks. saliva samples were collected on days 0 and 14 and were analyzed quantitatively.  the minimum inhibitory concentrations of triclosan and of several antimicrobial agents were determined for the streptococci isolated on days 0 and 14. no major changes occurred in the normal oral microflora during the study period. there were no differences in susceptibility between streptococcal strains collected at  days 0 and 14 against triclosan or antimicrobial agents. short-term use of triclosan has no major impact on normal oral microflora or on streptococcal susceptibility of antimicrobial agents. the effects of long-term use should be evaluated.

TI  == prevalence of csh-like fibrillar surface proteins among mitis group oral streptococci.
AB  == the prevalence of csh-like fibrillar surface proteins among oral streptococci was investigated by elisa and by immunoelectron microscopy using antiserum raised to  recombinant fragments of csha of streptococcus gordonii dl1. the majority of s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis strains tested elaborated short (ca. 50-80 nm long) surface fibrils and reacted with antiserum to the amino acid repeat region of csha, demonstrating the widespread nature of csh-like proteins among these species. in contrast, reactivity with antiserum raised to the adhesion-mediating non-repetitive region of csha was more restricted. on the basis of the elisa results, several isolates were selected for immunogold analysis using csha antisera. immunogold-negative staining showed a surface distribution of 10 nm gold particles consistent with antibody binding to  short fibrils. long fibrils (>150 nm long), where present, were not significantly labelled with gold. the results suggest that some of the short peritrichous fibrils on many mitis group streptococci comprise csh-like fibrillar protein. further, the data are consistent with our hypothesis that the antigenically conserved amino acid repeat region of csh-like proteins forms a scaffold for cell-distal presentation of the amino-terminal non-repetitive region that, at least in s. gordonii dl1, functions as an adhesin.

AB  == kuwanon g was isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of methanol extract of morus alba and its structure was elucidated by 13c-nmr, 1h-nmr and fab-ms. antibacterial activity of kuwanon g was investigated by the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) test and the viable cell count method. mic of kuwanon g against streptococcus mutans causing dental caries was determined to be 8.0 microg/ml. the bactericidal test showed that kuwanon g completely inactivated s.  mutans at the concentration 20 microg/ml in 1 min. kuwanon g also significantly inhibited the growth of other cariogenic bacteria such as streptococcus sobrinus  and streptococcus sanguis, and porpyromonas gingivalis causing periodontitis. transmission electron microscopy (tem) of kuwanon g treated cells demonstrated remarkable morphological damage of the cell wall and condensation of the cytoplasm.

TI  == comparison of antiadhesive and antibacterial effects of antiseptics on streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  == three antiseptic (chlorhexidine, olaflur, octenisept) and one putative antiadhesive (chitosan) agent were investigated for their effect on viable planktonic and attached streptococcus sanguinis cells. the bacterial pretreatment with each chemotherapeutic was performed in two steps: (i) after the exposure of  planktonic streptococci to the antiseptics, the cells were suspended in human sterile saliva and allowed to attach to human enamel for 60 min; (ii) after 60 min in the flow chamber system, initially attached streptococci were treated with these agents. the microbial viability was monitored by the percentage of vital streptococci determined by fluorescence microscopy and cell reproduction. in comparison with the negative control nacl, the non-bactericidal chitosan derivative showed distinctive antiadhesive properties. for both treatment procedures, the efficacy of the antiseptics in reducing the viability of planktonic and attached streptococci was octenisept > olaflur > chlorhexidine > saline > chitosan. further studies appear warranted to develop new antiplaque/antibiofilm strategies involving highly efficient bactericidals with antiadhesive formulations.

TI  == in vitro testing of xylitol as an anticariogenic agent.
AB  == a number of studies involving xylitol chewing gum have demonstrated that xylitol  is both noncariogenic and anticariogenic. the ability of xylitol to act as an anticariogenic agent most likely is due to its ability to be transported into caries-causing oral bacteria and inhibiting fermentation either by depleting the  cell of high-energy phosphate or by poisoning the glycolytic system. in vitro tests were conducted to determine the concentration of xylitol required to inhibit the growth of three strains of oral streptococcus (s. mutans, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis). all three strains were inhibited significantly at xylitol concentrations of 12.5% and higher; however, only s. mutans was inhibited significantly at a xylitol concentration of 1.56%.

TI  == the diagnosis and management of recurrent aphthous stomatitis: a consensus approach.
AB  == background: recurrent aphthous stomatitis, or ras, is a common oral disorder of uncertain etiopathogenesis for which symptomatic therapy only is available. this  article reviews the current data on the etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and management of ras in a primary care setting. methods: the authors reviewed publications on medline from 1995 through 2000, the period since the last major reviews were published. results: ras may have an immunogenetic background owing to cross-reactivity with streptococcus sanguis or heat shock protein. predisposing factors seen in a minority include haematinic (iron, folate or vitamin b12) deficiency, stress, food allergies and hiv infection. while topical  corticosteroids remain the mainstay for therapy, a number of other immunomodulatory modalities now are available. conclusions: there is still no conclusive evidence relevant to the etiopathogenesis of ras, and therefore therapy can attempt only to suppress symptoms rather than to address the basic issues of susceptibility and prevention. clinical implications: in the majority of patients, symptomatic relief of ras can be achieved with topical corticosteroids alone, with other immunomodulatory topical agents or by combination therapy.

TI  == bactericidal effects of different laser wavelengths on periodontopathic germs in  photodynamic therapy.
AB  == this study was an attempt to clarify whether the bactericidal effects of photodynamic therapy (pdt) are wavelength or dose-dependent. we also attempted to create an optimised protocol for a light-based bactericidal modality to eliminate periodontal pathogens. cultures of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus sanguis, were exposed to a he-ne laser (632.8 nm) with a 30 mw power output, a 100 mw diode laser at 665 nm, or a 100 mw diode laser at 830 nm,  in the presence or absence of methylene blue (mb) as a photosensitiser. a control group was also used with exposure to mb alone without laser exposure. the cultures were analysed by viable counts. the results indicated that exposure to the 100 mw laser light could eliminate up to 40% of bacteria on average. in particular, the most effective killing occurred with exposure to laser light in combination with the mb photosensitiser. the results of kinetic studies indicated that the best pdt response rate was achieved with a 60 s (energy density 21.2 j/cm(2)) exposure to the 665 nm wavelength diode laser in the presence photosensitiser. in this condition, approximately 95% of a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, and 99-100% of the black-pigmented bacteria ( p. gingivalis and p. intermedia) and s. sanguis were eliminated. these results showed that both wavelength and energy density are important factors, and that a low power laser of optimal wavelength and dosage, in combination with an appropriate photosensitiser, is a practical bactericidal modality. we concluded that using a  diode laser of proper power and wavelength to deliver 60 s of irradiation could be a useful adjunct with mechanical debridement in the prevention of the re-colonisation of subgingival lesions by pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == a rapid solid-phase fluorimetric assay for measuring bacterial adherence, using dna-binding stains.
AB  == in this report, we describe the validation of a rapid, single-step, microtiter plate method for quantifying bacterial adherence, based on fluorescent labeling of microorganisms with cell-permeable fluorescent dna-binding probes. we have tested the binding to saliva-coated microtiter plates of bacteria, including helicobacter pylori and viridans streptococci (s. mitis, s. gordonii, s. sanguis), known to interact with salivary components. furthermore, we tested the  short-term and longer-term temporal stability of a saliva-mediated adherence of these bacteria in a healthy population (n=30). the assay exhibited excellent reliability statistics, yielding within-assay variability coefficients ranging from 4.9% to 11%. a range of approximately 5 x 10(4)-1 x 10(7) cells could be detected. this method may be generally applicable to study surface binding of virtually any microbial species, while obviating the need of radioactive materials or specific antibodies for quantification, thus providing a procedure that is useful to both basic and clinical research.

AB  == background and objectives: to investigate the bactericidal effect of an 809 nm semiconductor laser alone, and in combination with naocl/h(2)o(2) irrigation in root canals in vitro. study design/materials and methods: a total of 72 human single-rooted teeth extracted for periodontal reasons were included. the crowns were removed, the roots shortened to a length of 12 mm, and the canals enlarged up to an apical size of #50 file. the specimens were autoclaved and incubated with a suspension of streptococcus sanguinis (atcc 10556). laser irradiation was  performed on a pc-controlled xy translation stage. a 200 micron optic fiber was used. twelve specimens were irradiated at a power output of 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 w in the cw-mode. the total irradiation time was 60 seconds per canal. twelve specimens were rinsed with naocl and h(2)o(2) only, 12 were rinsed and laser treated, and 12 served as untreated controls. after laser treatment, the specimens were sonicated and the bacterial growth was examined by counting colony forming units on blood agar plates. temperature changes at the outer root surface during irradiation were registered by means of thermocouples. treated and control specimens were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy. results: mean bacterial reductions of 0.35 log steps at a power output of 1.5 w, 1.44 at 3.0 w, and 2.84 at 4.5 w were calculated. bacterial reduction by the naocl/h(2)o(2) solution alone was 1.48 and comparable to that achieved by irradiation at 3.0 w. with a log kill 2.85, the combination of rinsing and laser  irradiation at 3.0 w resulted in a further significant bacterial reduction as compared to rinsing alone (p = 0.004). irradiation did not result in excessive heat generation at the root surface. carbonization of the root canal wall was observed in single teeth at 3.0 and 4.5 w and no controlled sealing of the dentinal tubules could be achieved in the root canal. conclusions: the application of the diode laser might be an adjunct to conventional endodontic treatment when used in combination with a naocl/h(2)o(2) solution.

TI  == amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by streptococcal iga1 proteases.
AB  == the amino acid sequence requirements in the hinge of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) for cleavage by iga1 proteases of different species of streptococcus were  investigated. recombinant iga1 antibodies were generated with point mutations at  proline 227 and threonine 228, the residues lying on either side of the peptide bond at which all streptococcal iga1 proteases cleave wild-type human iga1. the amino acid substitutions produced no major effect upon the structure of the mutant iga1 antibodies or their functional ability to bind to fcalpha receptors.  however, the substitutions had a substantial effect upon sensitivity to cleavage  with some streptococcal iga1 proteases, with, in some cases, a single point mutation rendering the antibody resistant to a particular iga1 protease. this effect was least marked with the iga1 protease from streptococcus pneumoniae, which showed no absolute requirement for either proline or threonine at residues  227 to 228. by contrast, the iga1 proteases of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis had an absolute requirement for proline at 227 but not for threonine at 228, which could be replaced by valine. there was evidence in s. mitis that proteases from different strains may have different amino acid requirements for cleavage. remarkably, some streptococcal proteases appeared able to cleave the hinge at a distant alternative site if substitution prevented efficient cleavage of the original site. hence, this study has identified key residues required for the recognition of the iga1 hinge as a substrate by streptococcal iga1 proteases, and it marks a preliminary step towards development of specific enzyme inhibitors.

TI  == the effect of increasing copper content in phosphate-based glasses on biofilms of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == this paper reports the effect of a series of phosphate-based glasses based on the na(2)o-cao-p(2)o(5) system doped with increasing amounts of copper and the effect of this increasing copper content on the viability of an in vitro biofilm of streptococcus sanguis over an 8 day period in a constant depth film fermenter. the addition of copper to the glass caused the solubility to change, so the glasses were adjusted in order that their solubility in artificial saliva was nominally the same (0.3062 +/- 0.07 mg cm(-2) h(-1)). initial experiments on glasses with 1.5% and 10% copper showed that after 6 h there was no statistical difference between the copper containing glasses and the non-copper containing glass and ha in terms of the viability of the biofilms. however, at 24 h there was an approximately 0.8-0.9 log reduction in viability of the biofilms grown on  the 5% copper glass and an approximately 1.0-1.3 log reduction for the 10% copper containing glass. further experiments on the glass with 10% copper and another glass with 15% copper were carried out in a time dependent study. for both glasses a clear decrease in viable counts at 24 h was found but for both glasses  these returned to levels similar to those of controls. the initial decrease in viability during the first 24 h is likely to be due to the antibacterial effect of the copper and this could be correlated with copper content. the recovery after 24 h is probably due to the dead cells forming a barrier, making diffusion  of the antibacterial ions, increasingly difficult. this study has shown that phosphate-based glasses could potentially be used to deliver antibacterial ions to help combat oral infections. copper, which has been shown to have antibacterial properties, could be incorporated but some development of the glasses used in this investigation may be required. further work is needed to determine the effectiveness of copper containing glasses on oral bacterial communities.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of the f-atpase operon from streptococcus sanguis 10904.
AB  == oral streptococci utilize an f-atpase to regulate cytoplasmic ph. previous studies have shown that this enzyme is a principal determinant of aciduricity in  the oral streptococcal species streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. differences in the ph optima of the respective atpases appears to be the main reason that s. mutans is more tolerant of low ph values than s. sanguis and hence pathogenic. we have recently reported the genetic arrangement for the s. mutans operon. for purposes of comparative structural biology we have also investigated  the f-atpase from s. sanguis. here, we report the genetic characterization and expression in escherichia coli of the s. sanguis atpase operon. sequence analysis showed a gene order of atpebfhagdc and that a large intergenic space existed upstream of the structural genes. activity data demonstrate that atpase activity  is induced under acidic conditions in both s. sanguis and s. mutans; however, it  is not induced to the same extent in the nonpathogenic s. sanguis. expression studies with an atpd deletion strain of e. coli showed that s. sanguis-e. coli hybrid enzymes were able to degrade atp but were not sufficiently functional to permit growth on succinate minimal media. hybrid enzymes were found to be relatively insensitive to inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, indicating loss of productive coupling between the membrane and catalytic subunits.

AB  == aims: synthetic sodium alpha,beta-polyaspartate (pa) has been investigated as a moderator of adhesion and the subsequent biofilm formation by oral bacteria. methods and results: the inhibition of bacterial adhesion by pa was assessed by (i) a 30-min incubation with streptococcus sanguis in a microtitre assay with the wells coated with hydroxyapatite (hap) and (ii) an 18-h challenge with human salivary microflora in a hap disc assay. in contrast to hap-coated surfaces, clean polystyrene surfaces in the microtitre assay exhibited no anti-adhesion properties. it has been found that pa significantly and similarly adsorbs onto hap surfaces in the presence and absence of salivary coating. the hap disc assay  also showed that pa, both in aqueous solutions and in toothpaste, reduced the level of adhered microflora and this effect was enhanced by added propylene oxide-ethylene oxide copolymers. conclusion: the principal finding from this work is the potential role for pa as an inhibitor of dental plaque formation. pa may significantly modify the salivary pellicle. significance and impact of the study: this work indicates the use of pa in controlling the development of dental plaque and the formation of bacterial biofilm in general.

AB  == objectives/hypothesis: the observation that during otitis media many different types of micro-organisms have been cultured from effusions indicate that, once present in the middle ear cavity, most types of micro-organisms are able to trigger an inflammatory reaction leading to otitis media. the present study was designed to determine the middle ear response after injection of different substances into the middle ear cavity. study design: to determine whether and to  what extent an inflammatory response of the middle ear depends on the entering agent, the response in the tympanic cavity was studied by otomicroscopy and histological examination after inoculation of various substances. methods: lewis  rats were inoculated in transtympanic fashion either with live or heat-killed bacteria (pathogenic and nonpathogenic), keyhole limpet hemocyanin, active charcoal, or saline. the mucosal response of the challenged middle ears was studied histologically. results: irrespective of the inoculated substance, no essential differences in the mucosal response were found. the intensity of the inflammatory response was greater when live bacteria were inoculated. conclusions: the present study demonstrates that any substance reaching the middle ear cavity is likely to induce otitis media. these observations emphasize  the role of the eustachian tube as "porte d'entree" in the pathogenesis of this disorder. determination of specific aspects of the eustachian tube involved in protection or in facilitating bacterial translocation will be important for the understanding of the pathogenesis of otitis media and the subsequent development  of new therapeutic strategies. in addition, elucidation of bacterial factors involved in the process of colonization and translocation will be of equal importance.

TI  == [investigation on interaction between streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis in specific pathogen-free rats].
AB  == objective: to examine whether endogenous s. sanguis could prevent, or reduce the  colonization of the virulent p. gingivalis strain. methods: first, 10 specific pathogen-free wistar rats were divided into 2 groups. doxycycline was administered in the drinking water for 7 days. successful implantation of the endogenous strain of s. sanguis, isolated from one of the rats before doxycycline administration, and p. gingivalis 381 within 14 days of observation were demonstrated in the rats of each group respectively. then, 30 spf rats were divided into 6 groups. doxycycline was administered in the drinking water for 7 days to all the rats. afterwards, the rats in group a and b were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with p. gingivalis, the rats in group c and e were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with s. sanguis. then, the rats in group  a were inoculated for 5 days with s. sanguis, and rats in group c and d were inoculated for 5 days with p. gingivalis. the rats in group f served as negative  control. after inoculation, the levels of s. sanguis and p. gingivalis in the mouths of the rats were determined after 12, 24, 36 hours, 7 days and 14 days. results: both pre-colonization of s. sanguis and superinfection with s. sanguis did reduce the level of p. gingivalis in experimental rats. however, the reduction only maintained quite short time, about 36 hours. it was not caused by  the decreased level of s. sanguis after 36 hours because the level of s. sanguis  kept stable during the observation period of 14 days. conclusion: that s. sanguis function as the effector strain requires the successful implantation of s. sanguis as well as s. sanguis producing antagonistic action efficiently in vivo.

TI  == bacterial colonization of zirconia ceramic surfaces: an in vitro and in vivo study.
AB  == purpose: the microbial colonization of new ceramic materials developed for abutment manufacturing was assessed. materials and methods: the materials used in these experiments were disks of 'as-fired' and 'rectified' ceramic material made  of tetragonal zirconia polycrystals stabilized with yttrium (y-tzp) and commercially pure grade 2 titanium (ti) with corresponding eluates. they were tested in vitro with the following bacteria: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, and porphyromonas gingivalis. proliferation  was evaluated on plates by inhibitory halos around pits, previously inoculated with eluates obtained from the materials. bacterial adhesion on materials was quantified by spectrophotometric evaluation of the slime production by the same bacteria. moreover, early bacterial adhesion was evaluated in human volunteers and observed with sem. results: no inhibition of bacterial proliferation using eluates was observed. in vitro as-fired and rectified y-tzp showed significantly  more adherent s. mutans than did ti disks, while s. sanguis seemed to adhere easily to ti specimens. no differences were noted for actinomyces spp and p. gingivalis. in vivo y-tzp accumulated fewer bacteria than ti in terms of the total number of bacteria and presence of potential putative pathogens such as rods. no differences were observed between rectified and as-fired y-tzp. discussion: overall, y-tzp accumulates fewer bacteria than ti. conclusion: y-tzp  may be considered as a promising material for abutment manufacturing.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

TI  == bactericidal effect of the er:yag laser on dental implant surfaces: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: the aim of the in vitro study was to examine the bactericidal effect  of an er:yag laser on common dental implant surfaces. methods: seventy-two titanium platelets with 3 different surfaces--sandblasted and acid-etched (sa), titanium plasma-sprayed (tps), and hydroxyapatite-coated (ha)--were incubated with a suspension of streptococcus sanguinis (atcc 10556). irradiation at pulse energies of 60 and 120 mj and a frequency of 10 pps was performed on a computer-controlled xy translation stage. after laser treatment the specimens were sonicated and the bacterial growth examined by counting colony forming units on blood agar plates. temperature elevations during irradiation were investigated using k-type thermocouples. laser treated implant surfaces were analyzed by means of electron microscopy. results: compared to non-irradiated specimens, mean bacterial reductions of 99.51% (sa), 98.39% (ha), and 99.6% (tps) at a pulse energy of 60 mj and 99.92% (sa), 99.85% (ha), and 99.94% (tps) at 120 mj were calculated. at these laser parameters, no excessive temperature elevations or morphological implant surface alterations were detected. conclusions: even at low energy densities, the er:yag laser has a high bactericidal potential on common implant surfaces. clinical studies are justified to evaluate the applicability and efficacy of the er:yag laser in the treatment of peri-implantitis.

TI  == selective lethal photosensitization of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus using an igg-tin (iv) chlorin e6 conjugate.
AB  == objectives: the growing resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) to conventional antimicrobial agents necessitates the development of alternative approaches to preventing and treating infections. one such approach is photodynamic therapy, whereby target cells are treated with light-activated drugs (photosensitizers). this investigation aimed to determine whether the ability of mrsa to express the igg-binding protein, protein a, could be exploited to enable selective lethal photosensitization of the organism with a photosensitizer [tin (iv) chlorin e6; snce6] linked to igg. methods: various strains of mrsa were exposed to light from a helium/neon laser in the presence of an igg-snce6 conjugate and the survivors enumerated by viable counting. controls  consisted of suspensions irradiated in the presence or absence of the conjugate and suspensions kept in the dark in the presence of the conjugate. similar experiments were also carried out using the unconjugated photosensitizer. the experiments were repeated using a suspension consisting of both emrsa-16 and streptococcus sanguis. results: emrsa-16 was killed by igg-snce6 and snce6 in a light-dose- and photosensitizer-dependent manner. greater kills were achieved with the igg-snce6 than with the unconjugated snce6 using the same light energy dose and photosensitizer concentration. furthermore, the igg-snce6 conjugate, but not snce6, was able to kill emrsa-16 selectively in a suspension that also contained s. sanguis without any reduction in the viable count of the latter. conclusion: these results demonstrate that selective lethal photosensitization of mrsa can be achieved using an igg-tin (iv) chlorin e6 conjugate. the effectiveness of killing was dependent, in part, on the particular mrsa strain used, with the clinically important emrsa-16 strain being the most susceptible.

TI  == increased proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and t cells to streptococcus mutans and glucosyltransferase d antigens in the exacerbation stage of recurrent aphthous ulcerations.
AB  == background and purpose: cytotoxic t lymphocyte-induced lysis of virus-infected oral epithelial cells has been shown to be a cause of early ulcer formation in recurrent aphthous ulcerations (rau). to test whether bacteria and their associated antigens are involved in the disease process of rau, the proliferative response (pr) to different streptococcal species in peripheral blood mononuclear  cells (pbmc) and t cells isolated from rau patients at the exacerbation stage was determined. methods: pbmc and t cells were isolated from 39 patients with rau, 21 patients with erosive oral lichen plaus (eolp, disease control group), and 22 healthy subjects (normal control group). streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and their associated antigen, glucosyltransferase d (gtfd), were used to stimulate isolated pbmc and t cells in in vitro proliferation assays. results: pbmc and t cells isolated from rau patients at the exacerbation stage showed a significantly higher pr to s. mutans antigen and gtfd than those isolated from eolp patients or healthy control subjects (p < 0.05). gtfd was a more potent stimulation antigen than s. mutans. however, elevated prs to s. mutans antigen and gtfd were transient and present only in the exacerbation stage of rau. these elevated prs declined to normal levels in the postexacerbation and convalescence stages of rau. furthermore, the gtfd-stimulated pr in pbmc and t cells was correlated with  the severity of rau. conclusion: in addition to viral infections, streptococci and their associated antigen, gtfd, may be involved in the disease process of rau, especially in the exacerbation stage.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == monocytes maintain tissue factor activity after cytolysis of bacteria-infected endothelial cells in an in vitro model of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == intravascular infection with staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, or streptococcus sanguis can initiate fibrin formation on endocardial tissue, causing bacterial endocarditis. the ability of these bacteria to injure intact endothelial cells (ecs) and to aggravate tissue factor (tf)-dependent coagulation in the presence of blood leukocytes was investigated. cytolysis of ecs occurred after infection with s. aureus and, with membrane-bound monocytes or granulocytes present, also after infection with s. sanguis or s. epidermidis. monocytes that subsequently bound to the resultant bacteria-infected subcellular ec matrix (ecm) elicited tf mrna, tf antigen, and tf activity (tfa). this was most pronounced in  ecm prepared after the cytolysis of ecs by infection with s. aureus or s. epidermidis. we demonstrate that monocytes continue and intensify fibrin formation after lysis of bacteria-infected ecs, which suggests that, during the course of intravascular infection, early fibrin formation shifts from being mediated by ec-derived tfa to being mediated by tfa of monocytes bound to bacteria-infected ecm.

TI  == enhanced neutrophil emigration and porphyromonas gingivalis reduction following pgg-glucan treatment of mice.
AB  == periodontal disease is the consequence of a mixed gram-negative infection in the  gingival sulcus and has been associated with deficits in the neutrophil response. a novel, and heretofore untested, alternative approach to therapy is the use of biological-response modulators that enhance the neutrophil response. poly-beta1-6-glucotriosyl-beta1-3-glucopyranose glucan (pgg-glucan) is an immunomodulator, derived from yeast, which specifically enhances neutrophil priming, phagocytosis and bacterial killing while failing to induce inflammatory  cytokine expression. the hypothesis tested was that pgg-glucan could enhance host resistance to a gram-negative periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. chambers were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsolumbar region of c57bl/6j mice and allowed to heal for 14 days. pgg-glucan was administered subcutaneously to one-half of the animals and saline to the other half. in the first set of experiments the chambers were inoculated with p. gingivalis (a7436) at 4 x 10 (6), 4 x 10 (7), and 4 x 10 (8) colony-forming units (cfu). in the second set of  experiments the chambers were inoculated with 5 x 10 (8) cfu of either p. gingivalis or streptococcus sanguis, a gram-positive oral microbe that is not periodontopathic. chambers were sampled over the following 2 weeks. the results demonstrated that: (1). bacterial cfu and neutrophils increased with increasing bacterial inoculum (p<0.02); (2). bacterial cfu were lower in the pgg-glucan-treated animals than in the saline controls (p<0.02); and (3). neutrophil counts were higher in the pgg-glucan-treated animals than in the saline controls (p<0.01). these results indicate that pgg-glucan significantly enhances neutrophil emigration and bacterial killing, thus decreasing the bacterial infection in this model system.

AB  == the occurrence of 36 environmentally regulated genes of streptococcus suis strain 10 among all 35 s. suis serotypes was determined by using hybridization with the  amplified genes as probes. in addition, the distribution of these genes among the virulence phenotypes of serotypes 1 and 2 was assessed. hybridization was also performed with various other streptococcal species and nonstreptococcal bacterial species which may be present in pigs. interestingly, probe ivs-25/iri-1, similar  to agra and sapr, hybridized only with s. suis serotype 1 and 2 strains with virulent phenotypes and is therefore suitable as a diagnostic parameter. only one probe was specific for s. suis. this probe's sequence was identical to the epf gene, a putative virulence factor of s. suis. probe ivs-31 was similar to a virulence factor of s. suis, namely, a gene encoding a fibronectin- and fibrinogen-binding protein. this probe hybridized only with oral streptococci. nearly half of the probes (45%) hybridized with the oral streptococci (s. oralis, s. milleri, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis) and with streptococcus pneumoniae. this indicates a close relationship between s. suis, the oral streptococci, and s. pneumoniae with respect to the selected environmentally regulated genes. one probe only hybridized with gram-negative species and therefore seems to be obtained by s. suis from a gram-negative organism by horizontal transfer.

TI  == groesl sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the full-length sequences of the groesl genes (also known as cpn10/60) of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordonii, and  streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groesl genes of streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius were determined. the lengths of the groes genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groel determined for  4 species (s. anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. the intergenic region (spacer) between the groes and groel genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. the variation of the groes sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groel sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). phylogenetic analysis of the groes and groel genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of  the 16s rrna gene. the intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. the groesl sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.

TI  == haemophilus segnis polymicrobial and monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s  ribosomal rna gene sequencing.
AB  == this paper reports a case of haemophilus segnis polymicrobial bacteraemia and a case of h. segnis monomicrobial bacteraemia identified by 16s ribosomal rna gene  sequencing. in the first case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated with streptococcus intermedius and s. sanguis from the blood culture of a 32-year-old intravenous drug addict with left thoracic empyema. in the second case, a gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus was isolated from the blood culture of an 82-year-old woman with clostridium difficile colitis and septicaemic shock. both gram-negative coccobacilli grew on chocolate agar as colonies of 1 mm in diameter after incubation for 24 h at 37 degress c in air with co2 5%, but only to pinpoint sizes on blood agar under the same incubation conditions. both strains were factor v-dependent, but not factor x-dependent. for the first isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 56% likely to be actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 40% neisseria subflava; whereas the api  system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. for the second isolate, the vitek system (nhi) showed that it was 95% likely to be h. influenzae viii; whereas the api system (nh) showed that it was 58% likely to be h. aphrophilus/paraphrophilus and 42% h. parainfluenzae. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there were four base differences between isolate 1 and h. segnis and two base differences between isolate 2 and h. segnis, indicating that both isolates most closely resembled a strain of h. segnis. only two cases of h. segnis bacteraemia were found in the english scientific literature, one in a case of infective endocarditis and the other in a case of pancreatic abscess. including the present two cases, the overall mortality of h. segnis bacteraemia was 50%.

TI  == streptococcus sanguis modulates type ii collagen-induced arthritis in dba/1j mice.
AB  == native type ii collagen is tolerogenic when given orally or i.p. to dba/1j mice and induces autoimmune arthritis when given s.c. in cfa. the tolerogenic epitope  is contained in cyanogen bromide fragment 11 (cb11) and is structurally mimicked  by pgeqgpk within the platelet aggregation-associated protein (paap) on streptococcus sanguis. to learn whether s. sanguis modulates transmucosally the ag-specific development of autoimmune arthritis, dba/1j pups were given live s. sanguis, cb11, or type ii collagen intragastrically. feeding s. sanguis at 6 days postpartum delayed the onset of arthritis, and reduced the rate, final severity,  and percentage of affected limbs. next, paap(+) s. sanguis and type ii collagen were tested for t cell cross-reactivity. t cells primed with the tolerogenic epitope of type ii collagen proliferated more when incubated with paap(+) s. sanguis than with paap(-) streptococcus gordonii or type ii collagen, suggesting  an ag-specific transmucosal tolerogenic effect. in neonatal mice, therefore, bacterial surface ags that mimic self can transmucosally stimulate ag-specific inhibitory t cells. in adult mice immunized with type ii collagen, these ag-specific inhibitory t cells manifest later as attenuated arthritis. the paap(+) s. sanguis appear to activate adult memory, rather than naive, type ii collagen-specific t cells, suggesting that systemic challenge with commensal self-mimicking microorganisms may perpetuate existing autoimmunity, but not initiate autorecognition.

TI  == the relationship between odontogenic bacteraemia and orthodontic treatment procedures.
AB  == the purpose of this research was to estimate the prevalence and intensity of bacteraemia associated with orthodontic treatment procedures. the four procedures investigated were: an upper alginate impression, separator placement, band placement, and adjustment of an archwire on a fixed appliance. eighty-one children undergoing general anaesthesia (ga) for dento-alveolar surgery related to their orthodontic treatment were randomly allocated to the impression or separator group. a further 61 children, receiving treatment in the outpatient department, were included and randomly allocated to the banding or archwire adjustment groups. a cannula was inserted into either the left or right antecubital fossa using an aseptic technique. a baseline 6 ml sample of blood was taken before treatment and a second 6 ml sample was taken 30 seconds after the procedure. there was no significant difference in the number of positive blood cultures between baseline (nine, 23 per cent), and following an upper alginate impression (twelve, 31 per cent); between baseline (twelve, 27 per cent), and placement of a separator (fifteen, 36 per cent); between baseline (nine, 36 per cent), and fitting or placement of a band (eleven, 44 per cent); or between baseline (twelve, 33 per cent), and archwire adjustment (seven, 19.4 per cent). for the separator group only the mean total number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria combined, isolated from the blood samples (cfu of bacteria per ml of blood), was significantly greater following the placement of a separator (2.2, sd 9.1), compared with baseline (0.9, sd 0.2; p < 0.02). this investigation demonstrates that the only orthodontic treatment procedure that causes a significant bacteraemia is the placement of a separator.

TI  == intracellular and extracellular phs of streptococcus mutans after addition of acids: loading and efflux of a fluorescent ph indicator in streptococcal cells.
AB  == a ph-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2', 7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 and 6-carboxyfluorescein (bcecf), was used to determine intracellular ph (ph(in)). the efflux of bcecf loaded into oral streptococcal cells was determined after incubation of the cells at 35 degrees c for 20 min in the presence and absence of glucose. in the absence of glucose, the fluorescence of intracellular bcecf in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sobrinus decreased only very slightly, indicating that the dye could be useful for ph(in) determination. in the presence of glucose, however, the fluorescence decreased by 57%. thus, the ph(in) of s. mutans cells was measured by the bcecf method in the absence of glucose at various acidic ph levels by adding lactic, acetic and hydrochloric acids to the cell suspensions. the ph(in) was almost equal to the extracellular ph (ph(out)) for ph(out) values  of between 8 and 5, indicating that protons permeated easily across the s. mutans cell membrane. for ph(out) between 5 and 4, ph(in) was constant at around 5, suggesting that the cell membrane was impermeable to protons, or that a cytoplasmic buffering system functioned. ph(in) decreased at ph(out) values of <  4. the constant ph(in) at acidic ph(out) levels could protect intracellular components, such as proteins, against acidification by sugar fermentation.

TI  == influence of secondary colonizers and human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.
AB  == the influence of secondary colonizers (fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces naeslundii) and the effect of human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. hydroxyapatite (hap) discs coated with streptococcus sanguis were immersed in a 3h-labeled bacterial cell suspension of  f. nucleatum or a. naeslundii and then in a 14c-labeled p. gingivalis cell suspension. bacterial cells on the discs were pyrolysed to quantify the radioisotopes released. the cell numbers of secondary colonizers on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in significantly elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. these two secondary colonizers had very similar positive effects on the adherence of p. gingivalis. human plasma significantly inhibited the adherence of p. gingivalis and secondary colonizers to s. sanguis-coated hap discs. adherence of p. gingivalis and a. naeslundii was  strongly inhibited by plasma, while that of f. nucleatum was affected the least.  treatment with plasma, after immersion of streptococcal-coated discs in individual cell suspension of secondary colonizers, also reduced subsequent adherence of p. gingivalis. the rate of decrease was much smaller in f. nucleatum. these results indicate that both f. nucleatum and a. naeslundii enhance the adherence of p. gingivalis, and that the former may play a more important role in the establishment of p. gingivalis in dental plaque where plasma-derived components are present.

TI  == roles of salivary proteins in the adherence of oral streptococci to various orthodontic brackets.
AB  == knowledge of salivary pellicles on orthodontic brackets provides a better understanding of microbial adherence. the aim of this study was to analyze the effects of bracket pellicles on the adherence of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans. bracket pellicles were formed by the incubation of 4 kinds  of orthodontic brackets with unstimulated whole saliva for 2 hrs, and analyzed by electrophoresis, immunodetection, and amino acid analysis. binding assays were then performed by the incubation of tritium-labeled streptococci with the pellicle-transfer blots and orthodontic brackets. the results showed that low-molecular-weight mucin, alpha-amylase, secretory iga, acidic proline-rich proteins, and cystatins adhered to all kinds of brackets, though the amino acid composition of pellicles differed between bracket types. some of these proteins increased the binding of s. gordonii to saliva-coated brackets. however, salivary pellicles decreased the binding of s. mutans. collectively, salivary pellicles were found to play a significant role in the initial adhesion of oral streptococci to orthodontic brackets.

TI  == a role for glycoprotein ib in streptococcus sanguis-induced platelet aggregation.
AB  == numerous studies have implicated bacteria in cardiovascular disease, but there is a paucity of information on the mechanism involved. in this study we show how the common oral bacterium streptococcus sanguis can directly interact with platelets, resulting in activation and aggregate formation. platelet aggregation was dependent on glycoprotein iib/iiia (gpiib/iiia) and thromboxane. platelets could  also directly bind to s sanguis, but this interaction was not inhibited by gpiib/iiia antagonists. antibodies to gpib could inhibit both platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion to bacteria. this suggested a direct interaction between gpib and s sanguis; however, this interaction did not require von willebrand factor, the normal ligand for gpib. by use of a range of monoclonal antibodies to gpib and the enzyme mocharagin, which cleaves gpib at amino acid 282, the interaction was localized to a region within the n-terminal 1-225 portion of gpibalpha. furthermore s sanguis failed to induce aggregation of platelets from a patient with bernard-soulier disease, the organism bound to chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the gpibalpha gene but did not bind  to mock-transfected cells and biotin-labeled s sanguis cells bound to purified gpib in ligand blots. it is suggested that the interaction between s sanguis and  gpib is important in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and may also play a contributory role in some cases of myocardial infarction.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

TI  == simultaneous measurement of the viability, aggregation, and live and dead adherence of streptococcus crista, streptococcus mutans and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in human saliva in relation to indices of caries, dental plaque and periodontal disease.
AB  == salivary proteins have multiple functions and many share similar functions, which may be why it has been difficult to relate variations in their concentrations to  oral health and ecology. an alternative is to focus on variations in the major functions of saliva. an hydroxyapatite-coated microplate model has been developed that simultaneously measures saliva-promoted bacterial viability, bacterial aggregation, and live and dead bacterial adherence, while simulating oral temperature and shearing forces from swallowing. that model was applied to resting whole and stimulated parotid saliva from 149 individuals, using representative strains of streptococcus crista, s. mutans, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. two major factors were defined by multivariate analysis (this was successful only for whole-saliva). one factor was correlated with aggregation, live adherence and dead adherence for all three strains; the other was correlated with total viability of all three strains. participants were grouped <25th percentile and >75th percentile for each factor. those groups were  compared for clinical indices of oral health. caries scores were significantly lower in those with high scores for aggregation-adherence, regardless of whether  total viability scores were low or high. live bacteria always predominated on surfaces when live and dead adherence scores were expressed as ratios. however, participants with high scores for aggregation-adherence showed significantly more dead adherent bacteria than those with low scores (these ratios were uncorrelated with total viability). this finding may indicate that extreme differences in the  ability to kill bacteria on surfaces can influence caries risk.

TI  == particulate bioglass reduces the viability of bacterial biofilms formed on its surface in an in vitro model.
AB  == 45s5 bioglass is a bioactive implant material which, in its particulate form, is  used in the repair of periodontal defects. the surface reactions undergone by this material in an aqueous environment may exert an antibacterial effect that would be beneficial to periodontal surgical treatment. biofilms of streptococcus  sanguis, an early plaque former, and mixed species biofilms from a salivary inoculum grown under conditions similar to those associated with periodontal implants, were grown on particulate bioglass in a constant depth film fermenter (cdff). control biofilms were grown on inert glass particulates. at sample times  of 3, 24 and 48 hours the viability of biofilms of s. sanguis grown on bioglass was significantly lower than for those grown on inert glass. in the experiments with subgingivally-modelled mixed species biofilms, the total anaerobic counts were significantly lower on bioglass after 24 and 48 hours, but not 96 or 168 hours, compared to inert glass. thus, particulate bioglass has the potential to reduce bacterial colonisation of its surface in vivo, a feature relevant to post-surgical periodontal wound healing.

AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to determine if the application of 1% chlorhexidine-containing wax on primary molars during the period of eruption of the first permanent molars could prevent the transfer of certain oral flora, namely streptococcus mutans, to the permanent molars. methods: fourteen children  with a mean age of 6.5 years (7 males and 7 females) were assigned into two groups: a chlorhexidine group (n=9) in which 1% chlorhexidine-containing wax was  painted on primary molars on one side of the mouth; and a placebo wax group (n=5) in which a similar wax, but without chlorhexidine, was painted on primary molars  on the other side of the mouth. baseline saliva samples and pooled plaque samples from the primary molars on both sides of the dentition were obtained from the two treatment groups. following treatment, plaque samples from the occlusal fissures  of the first permanent molars on both sides of the dentition were obtained. the levels of s.mutans and other members of the oral flora on the treated sides (chlorhexidine or placebo) were compared with those on the untreated sides. results: the results showed that the proportions of s.mutans to s.sanguinis were  significantly lower in the chlorhexidine-treated sides compared to the untreated  (p=0.04) and in the chlorhexidine-treated patients compared to placebo (p=0.029). conclusions: since lower mutans to sanguinis ratios have been associated with lower caries experience, treating primary molars with 1% chlorhexidine wax during eruption of permanent first molars may be a simple means for shifting the fissure flora of the permanent molars towards a more favorable balance.

AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == effects of compounds found in propolis on streptococcus mutans growth and on glucosyltransferase activity.
AB  == propolis, a resinous bee product, has been shown to inhibit the growth of oral microorganisms and the activity of bacterium-derived glucosyltransferases (gtfs). several compounds, mainly polyphenolics, have been identified in this natural product. the present study evaluated the effects of distinct chemical groups found in propolis on the activity of gtf enzymes in solution and on the surface of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) beads. thirty compounds, including flavonoids, cinnamic acid derivatives, and terpenoids, were tested for the ability to inhibit gtfs b, c, and d from streptococcus mutans and gtf from s. sanguinis (gtf ss). flavones and flavonols were potent inhibitors of gtf activity in solution; lesser effects were noted on insolubilized enzymes. apigenin, a 4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone, was the most effective inhibitor of gtfs, both in solution (90.5 to 95% inhibition at a concentration of 135 microg/ml) and on the  surface of sha beads (30 to 60% at 135 microg/ml). antibacterial activity was determined by using mics, minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), and time-kill studies. flavanones and some dihydroflavonols, as well as the sesquiterpene tt-farnesol, inhibited the growth of s. mutans and s. sobrinus; tt-farnesol was the most effective antibacterial compound (mics of 14 to 28 microg/ml and mbcs of 56 to 112 microg/ml). tt-farnesol (56 to 112 microg/ml) produced a 3-log-fold reduction in the bacterial population after 4 h of incubation. cinnamic acid derivatives had negligible biological activities. several of the compounds identified in propolis inhibit gtf activities and bacterial growth. apigenin is a novel and potent inhibitor of gtf activity, and tt-farnesol was found to be an effective antibacterial agent.

TI  == fluoride and organic weak acids as respiration inhibitors for oral streptococci in acidified environments.
AB  == oxygen metabolism (respiration) of streptococcus mutans gs-5 involving nadh oxidases, mainly of the h(2)o-producing type, was found to be acid sensitive, as  was nadh oxidase activity of cell extracts. respiration of intact cells in acidified media was also highly sensitive to fluoride, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of about 0.02 mm at ph 4. in contrast, nadh oxidases in cell extracts were fluoride insensitive. fluoride inhibition of respiration of intact  cells was related to weak-acid effects leading to enhanced proton permeability of cells, cytoplasmic acidification and resultant acid inhibition of nadh oxidases and glycolysis. organic weak acids, such as indomethacin and benzoate, were also  effective inhibitors. h(2)o(2) production by intact cells of streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904, a peroxide producer, was similarly inhibited by fluoride or organic weak acids in acidified media. thus, weak acids act as respiratory inhibitors for oral streptococci indirectly by acidifying the cytoplasm rather than acting as direct inhibitors of nadh oxidases.

TI  == repressed respiration of oral streptococci grown in biofilms.
AB  == the respiratory activities of oral streptococci grown in biofilms were found to be markedly repressed compared with those of cells from aerobic culture, or for streptococcus mutans gs-5, even for those grown in static culture. respiration rates generally reflected levels of nadh oxidase activities in cell extracts. superoxide dismutase levels were somewhat reduced in biofilm cells. however, sensitivities to oxidative damage caused by h2o2, t-butylhydroperoxide, or 8-hydroxyquinoline were not greatly different for cells from suspension cultures  and those from either intact or dispersed biofilms. the capacities of s. sanguis  and s. gordonii to produce h2o2 also were markedly repressed by biofilm growth, and presumably this repression would affect the ecology of dental plaque by reducing oxidative stresses under crowded conditions.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of indigenous indians of central america.
AB  == objective: to define the subgingival microbial profiles of adult subjects from a  previously identified rural community of indigenous indians in guatemala, central america. materials and methods: a full-mouth periodontal examination was performed in 114 adult subjects from 45 families. plaque samples were collected from both deep and shallow periodontal pockets and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to identify 17 species previously associated with periodontitis or health. results: plaque deposits and gingivitis were universal and widespread, and periodontal pocketing > or =5 mm was highly prevalent (84% of subjects). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and fusobacterium nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in shallow sites. at the subject level, actinomyces naeslundii and peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more prevalent in periodontally-healthy subjects. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any sample. conclusion: there was no association between periodontal disease status and presence of suspected periodontal pathogens. these latter results conflict somewhat with those from treated populations. however, in this population where extensive plaque deposits  and gingivitis are universal, the presence of putative pathogens may be more reflective of the local environment.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., a novel species isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis.
AB  == a bacterium was isolated from the blood culture of a patient with infective endocarditis. the cells were facultative anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive cocci arranged in chains. the bacterium grows on sheep blood agar as alpha-hemolytic, gray colonies of 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees c in ambient air. growth also occurs in 10 or 40% bile and on bile esculin agar but not in 6% nacl. no enhancement of growth is observed in 5% co(2). it is nongroupable with lancefield groups a, b, c, d, f, or g antisera and is resistant to optochin and bacitracin. the organism is aflagellated and is nonmotile at both 25 and 37 degrees c. it is voges-proskauer  test positive. it produces leucine arylamidase and beta-glucosidase but not catalase, urease, lysine decarboxylase, or ornithine decarboxylase. it hydrolyzes esculin and arginine. it utilizes glucose, lactose, salicin, sucrose, pullulan, trehalose, cellobiose, hemicellulase, mannose, maltose, and starch. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that there were 3.6, 3.7, 4.3, 4.7, and 5.9% differences between the 16s rrna gene sequence of the bacterium and those of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus anginosus, respectively. the g+c content of it (mean plus minus standard deviation) was 53.0% plus minus 2.9%. based on phylogenetic affiliation, it belongs to the mitis or anginosus group of streptococcus. for these reasons a new species, streptococcus sinensis sp. nov., is proposed, for which hku4 is the type strain. further studies should be performed to ascertain the potential of this bacterium to become an emerging cause of infective endocarditis.

TI  == the effect of tissue molecules on bacterial invasion of dentine.
AB  == bacterial invasion of dentinal tubules is a critical step in the pathogenesis of  dental caries and pulp and periapical disease. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect some molecules commonly found in saliva and dentinal tubule  fluid may have on the bacterial invasion of dentine. the results showed that invasion of streptococcus gordonii or enterococcus faecalis cells was inhibited when the bacterial cells were in solution with mucin, immunoglobulin g (igg) and  serum, and this was related to bacterial cell aggregation, as a result of interaction with agglutinins, and/or inhibition of collagen binding. when dentine was soaked in growth media containing fibrinogen, igg, albumin or serum prior to  inoculation, bacterial invasion was inhibited. it is suggested that this may be due to reduced dentine permeability as a consequence of the deposition of the compounds within dentinal tubules.

TI  == initial characterization of the streptococcus gordonii htpx gene.
AB  == examination of the streptococcus gordonii chromosomal region, which lies immediately upstream of the glucosyltransferase positive regulatory determinant rgg, revealed two open reading frames. based on nucleotide sequences, these genes were similar to the listeria monocytogenes lema gene, which is involved in antigen presentation, and the escherichia coli htpx heat shock gene, which has an unknown function. northern hybridization analysis indicated that s. gordonii lema and htpx genes were associated with a ca. 1.7-kb polycistronic transcript. although levels of the lema/htpx transcript did not increase in response to heat  to levels seen with dnak controls, insertional inactivation of htpx resulted in changes in adhesiveness, cellular morphology and detergent-extractable surface antigens in cells grown at 41 degrees c, implying that htpx may be involved in surface protein expression. insertional inactivation of lema and htpx indicated that, despite their proximity to rgg and the structural gene, gtfg, these upstream genes do not affect s. gordonii glucosyltransferase activity.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in italy.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

TI  == current status of taxonomic groups of oral streptococci in endocarditis. can virulence factors discriminate between endocarditis and non-endocarditis strains?
AB  == objective: infective endocarditis is frequently caused by oral streptococci, especially streptococcus sanguis. in this group, many strains have recently been  reclassified on the basis of new taxonomic schemes. the purpose of this study was to classify oral streptococci from patients with infective endocarditis and, further, to assess the importance of specific virulence factors for the development of streptococcal endocarditis. methods: twenty-eight previously identified and 10 new streptococcal isolates from infective endocarditis were classified according to kilian et al (1989) and compared to 30 streptococcal isolates from the oral cavities of periodontal patients without endocarditis. subsequently, surface hydrophobicity was assessed by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, production of extracellular dextran was determined by precipitation, and non-specific proteolytic activity was evaluated by determination of hydrolysis of gelatin, and casein-precipitating activity. results: eight streptococcal species were represented in the endocarditis isolates. most strains were highly hydrophobic and none showed non-specific proteolytic activity. dextran was produced with similar frequency in endocarditis and non-endocarditis isolates. conclusions: the present study showed that infective endocarditis may be caused by a variety of oral streptococcal species.  the possible virulence factors investigated were found in the same proportions in endocarditis and non-endocarditis isolates, and thus did not seem to be crucial for development of endocarditis.

TI  == streptococcus sanguis secretes cd14-binding proteins that stimulate cytokine synthesis: a clue to the pathogenesis of infective (bacterial) endocarditis?
AB  == streptococcus sanguis is the major causative organism of infective (bacterial) endocarditis but, surprisingly, almost nothing is known about how it induces endocardial inflammation. in earlier studies we have shown that many bacteria secrete potent cytokine-inducing or -inhibiting proteins. we have therefore isolated the material secreted by s. sanguis grown on blood agar or in broth culture and have tested its ability to induce human peripheral blood monocytes to synthesize pro-inflammatory cytokines. the activation of monocytes by the secreted components of s. sanguis was almost totally blocked by heat and trypsin  treatment but not by the lipopolysaccharide-inactivating antibiotic, polymyxin b, suggesting that activity is due to secreted proteins. the activity of the secreted material was significantly reduced by anti-cd14 monoclonal antibodies suggesting that the active protein (or proteins) was binding to the cd14/toll-like receptor (tlr)4 complex. fractionation of the secreted proteins by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) identified two proteins as being responsible for the majority of the cytokine induction: a manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase and a 190 kda protein, which could not be sequenced, but which was neither csha nor the pi/ii proteins. these proteins, or the receptors to which they bind, may be therapeutic targets and may allow the development of adjunctive therapies to prevent endocardial damage during the often prolonged treatment of infective endocarditis with antibiotics. in addition, blocking of cd14 may have some therapeutic benefit.

TI  == vitality status of microorganisms in infected human root dentine.
AB  == aim: this experimental study was initiated to establish a method for characterizing the vitality status of bacteria in infected human root dentine by  differentiating between viable and dead microorganisms. methodology: twenty-four  root segments of extracted human teeth were infected with either streptococcus sanguinis or enterococcus faecalis for 8 weeks. baseline samples from root dentine (rd) were collected after 4 weeks. these were compared with samples taken at week 8 (control group: n = 12) and with samples collected at week 12 after calcium hydroxide treatment for four weeks (test group: n = 12). after marking viable and dead bacterial cells by two fluorescent dyes, the portion of viable bacteria (pvb) was determined, as well as the number of colony-forming units (cfu). results: viable and dead bacteria were identified in all "rd" samples. pvbrd values were lower than pvb values of the bacterial suspension in the root canal lumen. in the control group, pvbrd and cfurd did not markedly differ at week 4 and at week 8, regardless of the strain used. in the test group, viable but non-culturable sanguinis streptococci (mean pvbrd = 27%; cfurd = 0) were detected, despite calcium hydroxide treatment. the viability of e. faecalis was not affected by calcium hydroxide. conclusions: fluorescence labelling of bacteria in human root dentine gives valuable additional information about their  vitality status compared to the parameter cfu. the method may be suitable for following the fate of bacteria in dentinal tubules, for example in the presence of intracanal dressings.

AB  == in streptococcus sanguinis (sanguis) induced experimental endocarditis, we sought evidence that the development of aortic valvular vegetation depends on the availability of fibrin. endocarditis was induced in new zealand white rabbits by  catheter placement into the left ventricle and inoculation of the bacteria. fibrin was localized in the developing vegetation with 99mtechnetium (tc)-labeled anti-fibrin antibody one or three days later. when rabbit anti-fibrin antibody was given intravenously on day 1, the mass of aortic valvular vegetation was significantly reduced at day 3; infusion of non-specific rabbit igg showed no effect. the 99mtc-labeled anti-fibrin antibody also labeled kidneys that showed macroscopic subcapsular hemorrhage. to learn if the deposition of fibrin in the kidneys was a consequence of endocarditis required a comparison of farm-bred and  specific pathogen-free rabbits before and after the induction of endocarditis. before induction, the kidneys of farm-bred rabbits were labeled, but specific pathogen-free rabbits were free of labeling and signs of macroscopic hemorrhage.  after 3 days of endocarditis, kidneys of 10 of 14 specific pathogen-free rabbits  labeled with 99mtc-labeled anti-fibrin antibody and showed hemorrhage. kidney lesions were suggested to be a frequent sequellae of s. sanguinis infective endocarditis. for the first time, fibrin was shown to be required for the continued development of aortic valvular vegetations.

TI  == [susceptibility to penicillin and 13 antimicrobial agents in erythromycin-resistant viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures].
AB  == from march 1998 to june 1999, we studied 63 sequential blood culture isolates of  viridans group streptococci which showed a 49% resistance to erythromycin. a high level of resistance to penicillin (46%) was also found. a statistically significant correlation was detected between the two types of resistance. the erythromycin-resistant strains were phenotypically and genotypically characterized, and no differences were found between the resistance to penicillin and the m or mls(b) phenotypes. the penicillin-erythromycin-resistant strains included: 16 s. mitis, five s. sanguis and one s. salivarius. the rank order of activity (% of susceptibility) for all 14 agents against 31 erythromycin- resistant isolates was the following: vancomycin = rifampicin (100) > chloramphenicol (98) > meropenem (65) > cefotaxime (61) > amoxicillin- clavulanic acid (42) > cefepime = ciprofloxacin (39) > tetracycline = trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (36) > cefuroxime (32) > penicillin = ampicillin =  cefaclor (29). the species s. milleri and s. bovis were the most susceptible. the most resistant strains were two s. mitis and one s. sanguis and showed multiresistance to six different groups of antimicrobial agents. the frequent association between macrolide resistance and resistance to other antimicrobial agents suggests that the susceptibility of all clinically significant isolates needs to be evaluated and alternative agents for the prevention and treatment of  viridans group streptococci infections should be identified.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == dysregulation of monocyte oxidative burst in streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == background: streptococcal subacute endocarditis is characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation. although structural cardiac defects are pivotal, phagocytic cells, i.e. monocytes and neutrophils, are involved in the induction and the course of bacterial endocarditis. decreased production of reactive oxygen metabolites was described in long-lasting infections. we hypothesized that the oxidative burst of phagocytes induced by the infecting organism is defective in patients with streptococcal endocarditis. patients and methods: the monocytes and neutrophils of 11 patients with streptococcal native valve endocarditis were challenged with the respective pathogens and two control streptococcal strains, and the oxidative burst was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. these experiments were done before any antibiotic therapy was administered, and repeated at least 12 months after recovery. eight volunteers served as healthy controls. results: the monocyte response to the respective pathogens was decreased in the patient groups compared to the response to the control streptococci. after cure the monocyte response to the pathogens was not different to the response to the control strains. the monocyte response of the healthy volunteers did not show any differences between the patients' pathogens and the control strains. the neutrophil oxidative burst to the pathogens was similar to that to the control streptococci in both patient and the volunteer group. conclusion: the decreased response of patient monocytes to the pathogens may contribute to the low-grade inflammatory response and to the course of streptococcal endocarditis.

TI  == plaque formation on surface modified dental implants. an in vitro study.
AB  == bacterial adhesion on titanium implant surfaces has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome of dental implants. parameters like surface roughness and chemical composition of the implant surface were found to have a significant impact on plaque formation. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of two physical hard coatings on bacterial adhesion in comparison with  control surfaces of equivalent roughness. two members of the oral microflora, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis were used. commercially pure titanium discs were modified using four different surface treatments: physical vapour deposition (pvd) with either titanium nitride (tin) or zirconium nitride (zrn), thermal oxidation and structuring with laser radiation. polished titanium  surfaces were used as controls. surface topography was examined by sem and estimation of surface roughness was done using a contact stylus profilometer. contact angle measurements were carried out to calculate surface energy. titanium discs were incubated in the respective bacterial cell suspension for one hour and single colonies formed by adhering bacteria were counted by fluorescence microscopy. contact angle measurements showed no significant differences between  the surface modifications. the surface roughness (ra) of all surfaces examined was between 0.14 and 1.00 microm. a significant reduction of the number of adherent bacteria was observed on inherently stable titanium hard materials such  as tin and zrn and thermically oxidated titanium surfaces compared to polished titanium. in conclusion, physical modification of titanium implant surfaces such  as coating with tin or zrn may reduce bacterial adherence and hence improve clinical results.

TI  == co-adhesion and removal of adhering bacteria from salivary pellicles by three different modes of brushing.
AB  == this study compares removal of pairs of co-adhering and non-co-adhering oral actinomyces and streptococci by hand, electric and sonic brushing from salivary pellicles. in addition, re-deposition of a co-adhering and non-co-adhering streptococcal strain to brushed pellicles was studied. first, actinomyces were allowed to adhere to a pellicle in a flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through the chamber at 33 c. pellicles with adhering bacterial pairs were brushed and the number of bacteria remaining determined. whereas sonic brushing removed nearly all adhering bacteria, greater  numbers of larger aggregates of the co-adhering pair, involving streptococcus oralis j22, were left behind after hand and electric brushing than of the non-co-adhering pair with streptococcus sanguis pk1889. re-deposition of streptococci to electrically and sonically brushed pellicles, however, was two-fold higher for the co-adhering pair than for the non-co-adhering pair. this  demonstrates a role for co-adhesion in de novo plaque formation. removal by the three different modes of brushing was not affected by the presence of fluoride, indicating that fluoride is not able to disrupt calcium bridges between co-adhering pairs. in contrast, in the presence of lactose only small aggregates  of co-adhering pair were left behind.

TI  == proteolytic degradation of oral biofilms in vitro and in vivo: potential of proteases originating from euphausia superba for plaque control.
AB  == this paper deals with enzymatic removal of dental plaque, in vitro as well as in  vivo, using proteases from the antarctic krill shrimp (euphausia superba), referred to as krillase. krillase exhibits both endo- and exopeptidase activity but has no microbicidal effect. in model systems with pure cultures of oral microorganisms. krillase demonstrated inhibition of microbial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. furthermore, a protocol for the growth of reproducible in vitro plaque films has been developed, and effects of krillase on the plaque film were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (sem). the results showed that krillase efficiently released microorganisms from plaque  in vitro, the effect being dependent on the enzymatic activity. the surface energy of the substratum had a minor influence on the formation and removal of plaque in vitro. ellipsometric studies on the formation and enzymatic removal of  a salivary pellicle indicated that the enzymatic effect on plaque may partly depend on degradation of the salivary pellicle. krillase was also able to remove  plaque accumulated on dentures in vivo. our results demonstrate the potential of  krillase for plaque control, and that these enzymes are worthy of further investigations including clinical studies and work to find a suitable vehicle.

TI  == plaque removal characteristics of electric toothbrushes using an in vitro plaque  model.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the study was to investigate and quantify the efficacy of plaque removal by commercially available electric toothbrushes using  an in vitro system based on artificial plaque grown on glass slides. material and methods: artificial plaque based on streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans was cultured in a series of phosphate buffer solution, sucrose solution and brain heart infusion on sterile glass slides, for a period of 5 weeks. 7 different electric toothbrushes of current designs were operated in contact with  the glass slides under loads of 1 or 2n for 10 s after which image analysis of the brushed slides was undertaken to calculate the absolute and relative areas of removal. results: the electric toothbrushes showed a larger area of plaque removal as loading force increased from 1 to 2n. the area of biofilm removed also depended on the head design and ranged from 258 mm(2) (1n, interplak) and 314 mm(2) (2n, interplak), to 30 mm(2) (1n, braun 3d), and 148 mm(2) (2n, blend-a-dent). the area of biofilm removal was significantly different among all  electric toothbrushes at p<0.01 (anova). all electric toothbrushes removed more biofilm than the actual contacting tufted area of the head. conclusion: the artificial plaque model system under different loading conditions showed differences in the absolute area of removal per electric toothbrush and also differences in the relative removal per unit contact bristle area. these differences on operating variables should be considered when evaluating new electric toothbrushes.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == dna relatedness, phenotypic characteristics, and antimicrobial susceptibilities of globicatella sanguinis strains.
AB  == dna-dna reassociation was performed on 15 strains of globicatella sanguinis to compare their taxonomic status with phenotypic characterization. all 15 strains selected for dna-dna reassociation readily met the criteria for species relatedness. the relative binding ratio was 81% or greater at the optimal temperature and 76% or greater at the stringent temperature, and the divergence was less than 3% for all strains hybridized with the type strain. these strains included nine strains from the centers for disease control streptococcus laboratory culture collection that were previously included in comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing studies as well as six additional phenotypically variant isolates. dna-dna relatedness was less than 18% at the optimal reassociation temperature to aerococcus viridans, enterococcus avium, and streptococcus uberis, which are phenotypically similar to g. sanguinis. this study confirms these globicatella strains were previously misidentified as s. uberis or s. uberis-like strains based on biochemical characteristics. the biochemical data from 28 strains was compiled to further define the phenotypic criteria for identification of this species. a revised description of the species should be variable reaction for pyrrolidonylarylamidase production (75% positive), positive reaction for the  bile esculin test (100%), growth at 45 degrees c (96%), variable reaction for acid production from arabinose (45% positive), and negative starch hydrolysis (0% positive). we also evaluated four rapid identification systems, the biomerieux rapid id32 strep (id32), the crystal rapid gram-positive identification (cry4), the bbl crystal gram-positive identification (cry24), and the remel ids rapid str (ids) systems for their ability to identify these strains.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  == antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (pc) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain pc as determined by reactivity with pc-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (igg) g anti-pc are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. these data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-pc responses. recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for pc are elevated in apoe-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ldl) (oxldl) in atherosclerotic plaques. these data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-pc could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxldl, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. we therefore examined the ability of human anti-pc to bind to pc-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition  assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-pc to  pc-bearing actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. our results indicated that pc-bearing strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed  up to 80% of anti-pc igg antibody from human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc  bound to a pc-bearing strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a pc-negative strain. oxldl also absorbed anti-pc from human sera, and oxldl but not ldl reacted with up to 80% of the anti-pc in human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc bound directly to oxldl but not to ldl. the data indicate that pc-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxldl. we propose that pc-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to pc that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.

AB  == this study compared the detachment by supernates of nine different dentifrices of four oral bacterial strains adhering to a salivary pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber. ultra-thin bovine enamel slabs were coated for 1.5 h with human whole saliva. following buffer rinsing, a bacterial suspension of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans or actinomyces naeslundii was perfused through the flow chamber at a shear rate of 30 s-1 for four hours, and the number of adhering bacteria n4h was enumerated by image analysis after buffer rinsing at the same shear rate. then, a 25 wt%-dentifrice/water supernate was perfused through the flow chamber for four minutes, followed by eight minutes of  buffer rinsing and another enumeration of the number of bacteria that had remained adhering nad. finally, an air-bubble was passed through the flow chamber to mimic the occasionally high detachment forces occurring in the oral cavity, and the adhering bacteria nab were counted again. on average, s. sanguis was the  easiest to detach (73% averaged over all dentifrice supernates), while a. naeslundii was the most difficult (22% on average). the combined detachment of bacteria by dentifrice supernates and air-bubble ranged from a low of 16% to a high of 80%. dentifrices containing pyrophosphate and polymeric polyphosphate (hexametaphosphate) surface active ingredients appeared to produce the most consistent and strongest desorption effects on plaque bacteria. factors apparently important to bacterial detachment from pellicle-covered tooth surfaces by dentifrice formulations include the nature of adhesion of bacterial strains and chemical composition of the dentifrice formulations, including ph, surfactant system and the effect of added ingredients (dispersants, metal ions, peroxides, baking soda).

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to identify a possible mechanism that would explain how e. faecalis could survive and grow within dentinal tubules and reinfect an obturated root canal. methodology: cells of streptococcus gordonii dl1, streptococcus mutans ng8, or e. faecalis jh2-2 were grown in brain heart infusion broth containing various amounts of human serum for 56 days. the ability of the three species to invade dentine and bind to immobilized type i collagen in the presence of human serum was assessed by dentine invasion and microtitre well  experiments. results: all three species remained viable over the period of the experiment when grown in human serum. cells of all three bacteria were able to invade dentine and bind to immobilized collagen. both of these properties were inhibited by the presence of collagen in the cell solution. human serum inhibited dentine invasion and collagen adhesion by s. gordonii dl1 and s. mutans ng8, whilst dentine invasion by e. faecalis jh2-2 was reduced in the presence of serum, but not inhibited, and binding to collagen was enhanced. conclusions: it is postulated that a virulence factor of e. faecalis in failed endodontically treated teeth may be related to the ability of e. faecalis cells to maintain the  capability to invade dentinal tubules and adhere to collagen in the presence of human serum.

AB  == a surface protein antigen (pac) of streptococcus mutans, particularly the a-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components  on the tooth surface. it might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of  antibodies against the adherence of s. mutans to the tooth surface. we investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) obtained by immunization of synthetic pac peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the a-region. these moabs recognize several core b-cell  epitopes in the sequence. two (kh5 and sh2) of these antibodies reacted with both s. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, but not with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis or lactobacillus casei. they clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of s. mutans to salivary components in  a biosensor. kh5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of s. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. these results suggested that the core b-cell epitope (-y---l--y----) recognized by kh5  was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of pac protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. therefore, the amino acid residues were  found to be important in the initial attachment of s. mutans to the tooth surface. these results provide for the mechanism of pac molecule in the initial attachment of s. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of s. mutans and s. sobrinus from the oral cavity.

TI  == investigation of bacteremia after orthodontic banding and debanding following chlorhexidine mouth wash application.
AB  == this study investigates the prevalence of bacteremia after orthodontic banding and debanding, following the application of a 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash. the banding and debanding groups were each composed of 40 young adult  patients. in the banding group, patients were asked to rinse their mouth with chlorhexidine gluconate for 60 seconds just prior to fitting of the bands. in the debanding group, they were asked to use the mouthwash immediately before removal  of bands and brackets. in both groups pre- and post-treatment blood samples were  obtained with a strict aseptic technique. in the banding group, no bacteremia was detected in the pretreatment sample and 2.5% post-treatment bacteremia was detected in the post-treatment sample. in the debanding group, 2.5% bacteremia was found in both the pre- and post-treatment samples. the prevalence of post-treatment bacteremia found in the present study were compared with the findings of 2 preliminary studies in which the prevalence of bacteremia had been  investigated after banding and debanding without a prior application of chlorhexidine mouthwash. the application of chlorhexidine mouthwash resulted in a decrease in the prevalence of bacteremia after banding and debanding, but the decrease was not statistically significant.

TI  == the effect of oral bacteria on candida albicans germ-tube formation.
AB  == a total of eight bacterial isolates belonging to six species, and a select group  of 12 oral candida albicans isolates, were used to study the effect of bacteria on germ-tube formation. briefly, each bacterial suspension (10(5-6) cells/ml) was mixed with a c. albicans suspension (10(7) cells/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees  c for 90 min with bovine serum, and the percentage germ-tube-positive candida cells was quantified using a haemocytometer, under light microscopy. in general,  out of eight bacteria, streptococcus sanguis sk21a, streptococcus salivarius sk56, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and s. salivarius obu3 suppressed germ-tube formation to varying degrees, with different c albicans isolates. porphyromonas gingivalis pg 50, lactobacillus casei atcc 7469 and prevotella intermedia obu4 elicited significant enhancement of germ-tube formation, whereas s. sanguis obu 2 had no effect. e. coli atcc 25922 was the only organism to show statistically significant suppression of germ-tube formation (p=0.0312). a significant increase in the germ tube production of c. albicans isolated from hiv-infected compared with hiv-free individuals was also noted. the current results tend to suggest that commensal and transient oral bacterial populations may selectively influence the differential expression of germ-tube-forming ability of c. albicans isolates.

TI  == predominant cultivable subgingival microbiota of healthy and hiv-infected ethnic  chinese.
AB  == although clinically distinctive types of periodontal disease are known to be associated with hiv infection, the pathogenesis remains unclear. in the present study, the subgingival microflora of 21 hiv-infected and 11 hiv-free ethnic chinese were studied using the direct microscopic and anaerobic culture methods.  motile curved rods were found to be three times higher in the hiv-infected group  under direct microscopy. otherwise, there were no significant differences between the diseased and healthy groups when analyzed either in relation to the morphotype distribution or gram stain morphology or oxygen tolerance. the most common bacteria isolated were capnocytophaga species followed by prevotella loescheii, streptococcus sanguinis, lactobacillus spp. and fusobacterium spp. although there were 20 bacterial species that were strictly limited to the hiv-infected group, and 5 limited to the healthy group, none of the species was a predominant isolate in either group (p>0.05). these findings agree with previous  studies which report that subgingival bacteria of hiv-infected individuals (with  or without periodontal disease) are similar to those found in healthy hiv-free individuals (with or without periodontal disease). further work examining the subgingival microflora from patients with specific and/or severe forms of hiv-associated periodontal disease is required to shed light on the pathogenesis  of this complex clinical entity.

TI  == antibacterial activity of particulate bioglass against supra- and subgingival bacteria.
AB  == particulate bioglass is a bioactive material used in the repair of periodontal defects. this material undergoes a series of surface reactions in an aqueous environment which lead to osseointegration. the aim of this study was to determine whether these reactions exerted an antibacterial effect on a range of oral bacteria. streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus were suspended in nutrient broth (nb), artificial saliva (as) or dulbecco's modified eagle medium plus 10% foetal calf serum (dmem + 10%fcs), with or without particulate bioglass. all bacteria showed reduced viability following  exposure to bioglass in all the media after 1 h. this antibacterial effect increased after 3 h. porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were suspended in  either bm broth or 40% horse serum (hs) in rpmi. a considerable reduction in viability was observed with all bacteria tested, in both media, compared to inert glass controls. in further experiments it was found that the viability of s. sanguis was significantly reduced following exposure to nb pre-incubated with bioglass. additionally, it was found that neutralisation of this highly alkaline  solution eliminated the antibacterial effect. moreover, a solution of nb and naoh (of equivalent ph) exerted an antibacterial effect of similar magnitude to that of the solution pre-incubated with bioglass. thus, particulate bioglass exerts an antibacterial effect on certain oral bacteria, possibly by virtue of the alkaline nature of its surface reactions. this may reduce bacterial colonisation of its surface in vivo.

TI  == a case-control study of respiratory disease in thoroughbred racehorses in sydney, australia.
AB  == in order to investigate the role of infectious agents in the aetiology of lower respiratory tract disease in thoroughbred racehorses, a matched case-control study was conducted. cases were identified by the presence of coughing, and were  compared to a control population matched on time of sample collection and location within the same training establishment. tracheal wash samples were collected from 100 cases and 148 controls. case horses were more likely than controls to have endoscopic and cytological evidence of airway inflammation. there was no significant association between serological evidence of infection by commonly implicated respiratory viruses and coughing. similarly, mycoplasma were  rarely isolated and were not associated with disease. in contrast, there was a strong association between isolation of greater than a total of 10(3) colony-forming units/ml of tracheal wash and coughing. individual bacterial species associated with disease included streptococcus zooepidemicus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus suis, streptococcus sanguis, pasteurella  spp and bordetella bronchiseptica. this study provides evidence of the role of bacterial infection in the aetiology of lower respiratory tract inflammation in racehorses. however, in 58% of cases, few or no bacteria were isolated. hence, at the time of identification of disease, there was no evidence of viral, bacterial  or mycoplasmal infection in the majority of coughing horses. the aetiology of the signs observed in these horses requires further investigation.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == investigation on interaction between streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis in specific pathogen-free rats.
AB  == objective: to examine whether endogenous streptococcus can prevent or reduce the  colonization of the virulent porphyromonas gingivalis strain. methods: successful implantation of the endogenous strain of s. sanguis and p. gingivalis 381 within  14 days was demonstrated in the study rats following administration of doxycycline for 7 days. thirty specific pathogen-free (spf) rats were divided into 6 groups. after administration of doxycycline for 7 days, groups a and b were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with p. gingivalis. group c and e were inoculated orally once a day for 5 days with s. sanguis. then, group a was inoculated for 5 days with s. sanguis, and rats in group c and d were inoculated  for 5 days with p. gingivalis. group f served as a negative control. after inoculation, the levels of s. sanguis and p. gingivalis in the mouths of the rats were determined at 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 7 days, and 14 days. results: both precolonization of s. sanguis and superinfection with s. sanguis reduced the level of p. gingivalis in experimental rats. however, the reduction was maintained for only 24 to 36 hours. the level of s. sanguis remained stable during the 14-days observation period. conclusion: s. sanguis to function as the  effector strain, the successful implantation of s. sanguis and the antagonistic action efficiently produced in vivo by s. sanguis is required.

TI  == interleukin-10 regulates the tissue factor activity of monocytes in an in vitro model of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == monocytes are important effector cells in the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis since they provide the tissue factor that activates the coagulation  system and maintains established vegetations. monocytes secrete cytokines that can modulate monocyte tissue factor activity (tfa), thereby affecting the formation and maintenance of vegetations. in this study, we show that monocytes cultured for 4 h on a streptococcus sanguis-infected fibrin matrix mimicking the  in vivo vegetational surface express high levels of tfa. this was accompanied by  secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), interleukin-1 alpha (il-1 alpha), and il-1 beta. after a 24-h incubation period the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 could also be detected. our data show that, whereas tnf-alpha and il-1 have a minor role in the induction of tfa by monocytes cultured on a fibrin matrix, tnf-alpha but not il-1 plays an  important role in the induction of il-10 by these cells. in turn, our data show that il-10 is an important factor in the downregulation of monocyte tfa. in summary, we conclude that il-10 is an important factor in the control of monocyte tfa in endocardial vegetations.

TI  == monocytes augment bacterial species- and strain-dependent induction of tissue factor activity in bacterium-infected human vascular endothelial cells.
AB  == in bacterial endocarditis (be), intravascular infection with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, or staphylococcus epidermidis can lead to formation of a fibrin clot on the inner surface of the heart and cause heart dysfunction. the events that start the coagulation in the early stage of the disease are largely unknown. we have recently shown that human endothelial cells  (ec) upon binding and internalization of s. aureus, but not s. sanguis or s. epidermidis, express tissue factor (tf)-dependent procoagulant activity (tfa). the present study shows that infection of ec with these three pathogens induces surface expression of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (vcam-1) and monocyte adhesion. subsequent coculture of  these cells synergistically enhanced tfa, which was exclusively dependent on tf molecules that were expressed on ec during coculture. tfa induction required direct contact between monocytes and bacterium-infected ec, but the signals for this response were not generated by the binding of monocytes through their beta(2)- or alpha(4)-integrins to icam-1 or vcam-1, respectively, on infected ec. the mechanism by which monocytes induce tfa in bacterium-infected ec was partly mediated by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 produced by the cells during coculture. endogenous tumor necrosis factor alpha was not involved. this modulating effect of monocytes on species- and strain-dependent tfa of bacterium-infected ec supports our hypothesis that in an early stage in the pathogenesis of be, as well as other intravascular infections that lead to detrimental fibrin formation, the coagulation cascade can be activated on the surfaces of ec as a consequence of specific interactions between pathogenic bacteria, ec, and monocytes.

TI  == oral colonization and cariogenicity of streptococcus gordonii in specific pathogen-free tan:spfom(om)br rats consuming starch or sucrose diets.
AB  == the significance of streptococcus gordonii in dental caries is undefined, as is that of other alpha-amylase-binding bacteria (abb) commonly found in the mouth. to clarify the ecological and cariological roles of s. gordonii our specific pathogen-free osborne-mendel rats, tan:spfom(om)br, were fed either diet 2000 (containing 56% confectioner's sugar, most of which is sucrose) or diet 2000cs (containing 56% cornstarch, in lieu of confectioner's sugar) and inoculated with  s. gordonii strains. uninoculated rats were free of both indigenous mutans streptococci (ms) and abb, including s. gordonii, as shown by culture on mitis salivarius and blood agars of swabs and sonicates of dentitions after weanlings had consumed these diets for 26 days. abb were detected by radiochemical assay using [125i]-amylase reactive to alpha-amylase-binding protein characteristic of  the surface of s. gordonii and other abb. no abb were detected (detection limit < 1 colony-forming units in 10(6) colony-forming units). thus the tan:spfom(om)br colony presents a 'clean animal model' for subsequent study. consequently, s. gordonii strains challis or g9b were used to inoculate weanling rat groups consuming either the high-sucrose diet 2000 or the cornstarch diet 2000cs. two additional groups fed each of these diets remained unioculated. recoveries of inoculants were tested 12 and 26 days later by oral swabs and sonication of the molars of one hemimandible of each animal, respectively. uninoculated animals were reconfirmed to be free of abb and mutans streptococci, but inoculated ones eating diet 2000cs had s. gordonii recoveries of 1-10% or, if eating diet 2000, 10-30% of total colony-farming units in sonicates. there were no statistically significant differences among the inoculated and uninoculated animal groups' caries scores when they ate the cornstarch diet. lesion scores for sucrose-eating rats were, however, from 2.4-5.1-fold higher than for cornstarch-eating rats, p < 0.001, and were still higher if animals had been inoculated with either challis (1.41-fold) or g9b (1.64-fold), than if uninoculated, both p < 0.001, so long as  the rats ate the sucrose diet. therefore, tan:spfom(om)br rats do not harbour abb or s. gordonii but can be colonized by s. gordonii. colonization levels of s. gordonii on the teeth are higher in the presence of high sucrose than with high starch-containing diets. caries scores are augmented by sucrose compared with starch, and are further augmented by s gordonii colonization. s. gordonii is thus cariologically significant in the presence of sucrose, at least in this rat.

AB  == streptococcus gordonii and other viridans streptococci (vs) are primary etiologic agents of infective endocarditis, despite being part of the normal oral microflora. recently, a surface-bound glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) has been found on the cells of all tested streptococcal species, where it has been implicated as a virulence factor. in contrast, we observed that a soluble extracellular gapdh was the major secreted protein from s. gordonii fss2, an endocarditis strain. the biochemical properties and gene sequence of s. gordonii gapdh are almost identical to those of other streptococcal gapdhs. growth at defined phs showed that secretion of gapdh is regulated by environmental ph. gapdh was primarily surface-associated at growth ph 6.5 and shifted to > 90% secreted at growth ph 7.5. others have identified s. gordonii promoters that are up-regulated by a ph shift similar to that experienced by organisms entering the blood stream (neutral) from the oral cavity (slightly acid). analysis of our results suggests that secretion of gapdh may be a similar  adaptation by s. gordonii.

TI  == streptococcus parasanguis fimbria-associated adhesin fap1 is required for biofilm formation.
AB  == the sanguis streptococci are primary colonizers of the tooth surface and thus form the foundation for the complex multiple species biofilm known as dental plaque. in addition, these bacteria can colonize native and prosthetic heart valves and are a common cause of endocarditis. little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing multiple or single species biofilm development within this group of organisms. using an in vitro assay for biofilm formation, we determined that (i) streptococcus parasanguis fw213 can form biofilms on inert surfaces such as polystyrene and (ii) environmental and nutritional factors, such as glucose, affect s. parasanguis biofilm formation. several isogenic mutants of  fw213 were tested in the biofilm assay. strains containing mutations in fap1, a gene encoding a protein required for assembly of fimbriae, were deficient in biofilm formation. mutants defective in reca, pepo endopeptidase activity, or the production of a fimbriae-associated protein, fima, were still capable of biofilm  formation. phase-contrast microscopy was used to follow biofilm development by wild-type and fap1 mutant strains on plastic coverslips over time. wild-type fw213 attached to the surface, formed aggregates of cells, and eventually formed  a dense layer of cells that included microcolonies. in contrast, few fap1 mutant  cells were observed attached to the surface, and no cell aggregates or microcolonies were formed. these results suggest that the long peritrichous fimbriae of fw213 are critical for the formation of biofilms on solid surfaces.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

AB  == to produce a bonding system which has both high bond strength and antibacterial properties, an antibacterial agent (vancomycin: vcm or metronidazol: mn) was added to the pmma powder of 4-meta/mma-tbb resin (cb). the influence of the addition of an antibacterial agent on tensile bond strength to dentin and the antibacterial effect were investigated in this study. forty-seven freshly extracted bovine first or second incisors were used to measure the tensile bond strength to dentin. the bond strengths to bovine dentin were not significantly decreased by addition of vcm (1%, 2%, 5%), or mn (1%) to cb (p < 0.05). the antibacterial effect of cb containing antibacterial agent on six strains of bacteria was investigated by the agar plate diffusion method, analyzing the appearance of the inhibition zone around a resin disk following anaerobic culturing. the resin disks containing vcm showed antibacterial effects on all of  the strains examined; the widths of the inhibition zones were 4-15 mm. the resin  disks containing mn showed antibacterial effects on three strains; the widths of  the inhibition zones were 0-4 mm. it was thus possible to produce a bonding system with both antibacterial effect and high tensile bond strength by addition  of vcm to pmma powder.

AB  == sodium doecyl sulfate (sds) is widely used as a detergent in dentifrices. it has  been shown to interfere with the protein adsorption to hydroxyapatite (ha), and inhibit acquired pellicle formation. the aim of the present study was to examine  the effects of sds on the artificial dental plaque in chemostat. the amount of the 3h-labelled bacteria adhered on the enamel fragment surface was determined with scintillometer. the artificial dental plaque was observed under the scanning electron microscope. the results showed that enamel fragments treated with sds adsorbed less bacteria than untreated ones, and had no plague formed. it suggested that sds can inhibit the bacterial adherence on enamel surface and thus reduce dental plaque formation.

TI  == [the effect of chlorhexidine varnish system on streptococcus mutans in fissure plaques].
AB  == a chlorhexidine varnish system and a controlled releasing varnish were prepared by the authors. the release rate of chlorhexidine in vitro and the effects on s.  mutans and s. sanguis in vivo were determined. the results showed that the system could selectively inhibit the growth of s. mutans in fissure plaque and had no effect on s. sanguis. the period of interaction between the layer of varnish and  plaque was prolonged by the control-releasing reagent. the study suggests that the chlorhexidine varnish system is effective of anticaries and can maintain microflora balance in oral bacteria.

TI  == utilization and acid production of beta-galactosyllactose by oral streptococci and human dental plaque.
AB  == beta-galactosyllactose is a trisaccharide containing the beta-galactosidic linkage at the nonreducing end. the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral streptococci could utilize four kinds of beta-galactosyllactoses. three of four beta-galactosyllactoses were unable to support growth of the oral streptococci and to be a substrate for producing acid  from the cell suspensions and dental plaque. 4'-beta-galactosyllactose supported  growth of streptococcus sanguis atcc 35105, atcc 49298, streptococcus mitis atcc  15914, streptococcus oralis atcc 35037, atcc 10557 and streptococcus milleri 10707 and produced acid from dental plaque. although beta-galactosidase activities were observed in all the strains, 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could not  be used as a carbon source for the growth of mutans streptococci. enzymes metabolizing 4'-beta-galactosyllactose were induced when s. oralis atcc 10557 was cultured in medium containing galactose. these results suggested that 4'-beta-galactosyllactose could be as cariogenic as lactose if it is consumed frequently and retained for a long period in the mouth.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == post-ph effect in oral streptococci.
AB  == objectives: to study the post-ph effect (pphe) in 11 strains of oral streptococci belonging to streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, s. gordonii, s. mutans and s. sobrinus by using the bact/alert microbial detection system. methods: the bacterial cultures were exposed to a different ph (3.6, 4.0, 4.6, 5.0, 5.6, 7.0,  7.5, 8.0 and 8.6) for 1 h, and then returned to a neutral medium. the automated bact/alert system determined resumed microbial growth by measuring co2 generation. the pphe expresses the time difference between resumed growth (after  ph shock) and optimal growth (ph 7.0 used as the control). results: pphe was found to be minimal for alkaline ph values, and to be strain and species dependent. conclusions: the pphe may be useful as an ecological determinant or as an indicator of the cariogenicity of oral streptococci.

TI  == selection of oral microbial adhesion antagonists using biotinylated streptococcus sanguis and a human mixed oral microflora.
AB  == a microtitre assay has been developed using hydroxyapatite-coated wells and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 at 10(7) cells per ml. a number of models representing toothpaste and mouthwash usage were adopted to detect the anti-adherent efficacy of a polyvinylmethylether maleic acid copolymer (pvm/ma),  polyoxypropylene/polyoxyethylene block copolymer (po/eo), two casein-derived peptides and selected silicones. the results not only confirmed the anti-adherence property of the selected components but also indicated possible molecular interactions leading to the observed performance. to account for the diversity of oral microbial cells in vivo, a further testing system was developed. this involved submerging a hydroxyapatite disc in a mixed culture of human salivary microbial cells, and exposing it to different treatments using the active component either in an aqueous dispersion or in a toothpaste. the effect of toothpastes containing po/eo, dimethicone copoyol or pvm/ma was investigated over a 4-h incubation with microflora. these tests showed that in a toothpaste formulation the anti-adherent efficacy may be reduced when compared with an aqueous dispersion containing the same or nearly the same concentration of the active component.

TI  == commercial preparations of lipoteichoic acid contain endotoxin that contributes to activation of mouse macrophages in vitro.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (lta), cell wall components of gram-positive bacteria, have been reported to induce various inflammatory mediators and to play a key role in  gram-positive-microbe-mediated septic shock. in a large number of these studies,  investigators used commercially available lta purified from a variety of gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, and streptococcus sanguis. we report here that, although these commercially available lta could be readily shown to stimulate production of nitric oxide (no) in raw 264.7 mouse macrophages, the activity was dramatically inhibited by polymyxin b,  a relatively specific inhibitor of endotoxin biological activity. one-step purification of the commercially available s. aureus lta using hydrophobic interaction chromatography resulted in two well-separated peak fractions, one highly enriched for lta and a second highly enriched for endotoxin. the lta-enriched fractions did not induce production of no in raw 264.7 macrophages,  although they caused a dose-dependent induction of no in the presence of low concentrations of gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) (which by itself induced little no), regardless of the presence of polymyxin b. in contrast, the endotoxin-enriched fractions by themselves inhibited in high levels of no in raw  264.7 macrophages but activity was almost completely inhibited in the presence of polymyxin b. consistent with these findings, our data also indicate that commercial lta preparations from s. aureus, b. subtilis, and s. sanguis were not  able to induce no from lipopolysaccharide-hyporesponsive c3h/hej mouse peritoneal macrophages, but in the presence of ifn-gamma, these lta preparations were able to induce relatively high levels of no from c3h/hej macrophages. these results indicate that commercially available lta can contain contaminating and potentially significant levels of endotoxin that can be expected to contribute to the putative macrophage-stimulating effects of lta as assessed by no production.  the fact that the purified lta, by itself, was not able to induce significant levels of no secretion in raw 264.7 macrophages supports the conclusion that caution in attributing high-level biological activity to this microbial cell wall constituent should be exercised.

TI  == the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole in sites with and without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole (orn) in sites with or without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients. methods: two pooled bacterial samples consisting of 4 sites each (scaled and non-scaled sites) were obtained from 30 individuals exhibiting eop. all patients received oral hygiene instruction (ohi), supragingival scaling and orn. subgingival scaling and root planing (srp) was carried out only in scaled sites. bacterial samples were taken at baseline (bl) and 1 week and 2, 6, and 12 months after systemic ornidazole administration (500 mg/bid for 7 days). one more sample was taken at scaled sites, one week after srp. results: one week following srp (scaled sites)  gram-negative facultative and anaerobic rods were significantly reduced while gram-positive facultative cocci were significantly increased. after orn administration, p. gingivalis, p. denticola, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, c. rectus, and s. sputigena were no longer detectable in either scaled or non-scaled sites. a statistically significant long-term (2, 6, and 12 months) reduction of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, b. forsythus, and c. rectus and a pronounced increase of s. milleri, s. oralis, and s. sanguis counts in both scaled and non-scaled sites were detected in comparison to baseline. a sustained  reduction of bleeding tendency and of probing depth was also observed in both scaled and non-scaled sites. conclusions: orn combined with srp effects beneficial shifts in the bacterial population associated with substantial clinical improvement, thereby indicating that orn is effective adjunct in the treatment of eop deep periodontal pockets where anaerobic bacteria are predominant.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis platelet aggregation activity: outer membrane vesicles are potent activators of murine platelets.
AB  == recent evidence has established an association between chronic periodontitis and  cardiovascular disease. periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a small group of gram-negative bacteria, of which porphyromonas gingivalis is considered an important causative agent. it has been proposed that dental plaque  bacteria and their products can disseminate into the bloodstream from the site of infection and promote thromboembolic events associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. in this regard, streptococcus sanguis and p. gingivalis have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. here we report that p. gingivalis was able to induce platelet aggregation, and that oral strains of actinobaillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and trepenoma denticola failed to  aggregate platelets when tested for platelet aggregation activity under similar conditions. additionally, we show that vesicles (outer membrane evaginations that are shed into the environment by the bacteria) of p. gingivalis are potent inducers of mouse platelet aggregation in vitro. in summary, our data show that i) initial adherence of the bacterium to platelet may be facilitated by p. gingivalis fimbriae and ii) p. gingivalis vesicles possess platelet aggregation-inducing activity.

TI  == the galu gene of streptococcus pneumoniae that codes for a udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase is highly polymorphic and suitable for molecular typing and phylogenetic studies.
AB  == the enzyme utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, udpg:pp) is synthesized by practically all organisms, although prokaryotic udpg:pps are evolutionarily unrelated to the eukaryotic counterparts. the primary structure of prokaryotic udpg:pps is well conserved, although little  information exists on the polymorphism of the genes coding for these enzymes. it  has been reported that the galu gene encoding the streptococcus pneumoniae udpg:pp is absolutely required for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide,  a sine qua non prerequisite for virulence. a 594 bp fragment covering 66% of the  galu gene from 37 pneumococcal isolates and the type strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sobrinus has been amplified by pcr and sequenced. up to 21 different alleles were found in s. pneumoniae. they possess a mosaic-like structure and belong to, at least, two evolutionarily distinct families that show a sequence divergence of 15-20%. in spite of its marked polymorphism, phylogenetic relationships among pneumococcal strains deduced from the galu gene matched those previously established by using alternative approaches. comparison of the pneumococcal galu alleles with those from other streptococci indicated the existence of a complex network of genetic interchange. the galu gene represents an informative marker to be used alone or in conjunction with other molecular typing methods.

TI  == postantibiotic effects and postantibiotic sub-mic effects of amoxicillin on streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == amoxicillin is one of the most frequently recommended antibiotics for prophylaxis of infective endocarditis in dental/oral procedures. in this study, the postantibiotic effect (pae), postantibiotic sub-mic (pasme) and sub-mic effect (sme) of amoxicillin on oral streptococci, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguis, which are two of the major etiological agents in infective endocarditis, were investigated. the pae was induced by 10 x mic of amoxicillin for 2 h and the antibiotic was eliminated by washing. the pasmes were studied by  addition of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 x mics during the postantibiotic phase of the bacteria, and the smes were studied by exposing bacteria to amoxicillin at the sub-mics only. the pae of amoxicillin was 2.0 h with s. gordonii dl1 and 0.7 h with s. sanguis mpc1. the pasme and sme of amoxicillin were observed both for s.  gordonii dl1 and for s. sanguis mpc1. however, the durations of effects for s. sanguis mpc1 were shorter than those for s. gordonii dl1. the pasme values for both strains increased as the concentration of amoxicillin increased. the pasme values for both strains were substantially longer than the sme values. the present study illustrates the existence of pae, pasme and sme for amoxicillin against s. gordonii and s. sanguis, thereby extending the pharmacodynamic advantages of amoxicillin for these bacteria in the prophylaxis procedures of infective endocarditis.

TI  == properties of streptococcus sanguinis glucans formed under various conditions.
AB  == the aim of our study was to determine whether the structure of glucans formed by  glucosyltransferase from streptococcus sanguinis (gtfss) on a surface differ from those formed in solution and to explore the effects of antiserum to gtfs, control normal rabbit serum, starch hydrolysates (sth) and dextran on s. sanguinis (gtfss) glucan. linkage analyses showed that solution-formed glucans are predominantly alpha-1,6-linked and have a small amount of alpha-1,3-linked glucose. surface-formed glucans have enhanced susceptibility to mutanase. solution- and surface-formed glucans made in the presence or absence of sera, sth, and dextran contain linkages which differ in both amount and type from control glucans. the gtfss enzyme in solution exposed to antiserum behaves as if  it is adsorbed to a surface. binding of streptococcus mutans gs-5 and actinomyces viscosus omz105e (ny1) to s. sanguinis glucan differs if the glucan is formed in  the presence of antiserum. the information could help to define the role of glucans in the formation of pellicle, colonization of tooth surfaces and the accumulation of dental plaque.

TI  == strain-related acid production by oral streptococci.
AB  == acid production, in particular at low ph, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. the aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different ph levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. the bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a ph-stat system at ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. at all ph values, the mean velocity of acid production (v(ap)) by streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; anova) than that of the other oral streptococci, including s. mitis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. vestibularis. however, the v(ap) of some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis, particularly at ph values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of s. mutans. the v(ap) decreased with ph for all strains, but some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. the results suggest that some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric  species. the study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.

TI  == similarity of bacteriocin activity profiles of mutans streptococci within the family when the children acquire the strains after the age of 5.
AB  == it has been shown that there is a window of infectivity for mutans streptococci between the ages of 19 and 31 months, when many children acquire mutans streptococci transmitted from their mothers. part of the children that escape this window acquire mutans streptococci at a later age. in this group, maternal transmission is expected to be less prevalent. the present study compared the bacteriocin activity profiles of mutans streptococci isolated from mothers, fathers and children when the children acquired the mutans streptococci between the ages of 5 and 11. twelve families were randomly selected from a group of 11-year-old children who were known to have acquired mutans streptococci during this age period. from the saliva of the mothers (n = 12), fathers (n = 8) and children (n = 12) approximately 30 mutans streptococci strains were isolated. all isolates were tested twice for bacteriocin activity against 21 indicator strains  with a double-layer technique. bacteriocin activity of strains was considered to  be different when the number of strains against which bacteriocin was produced differed >1 or when the width of one or more inhibition zones differed > or =4 mm. in 7/12 mother-child pairs similar profiles were found. in the 8 father-child pairs similar profiles were only found on 2 occasions. in these 2 families, all 3 ( mother, father and child) harboured strains with a similar profile. in 4/8 father-mother pairs similar profiles were found. there was no correlation between the prevalence of mutans streptococci strains, the number of indicator strains against which the strains made bacteriocin, nor the mean size of the inhibition zones and the presence of similarity of bacteriocin activity profiles of mutans streptococci within the family members. the results show that even when a child acquires mutans streptococci after the age of 5, there may be similarity between  mutans streptococci in mother, father and child, indicating that transmission between the family members occurs.

AB  == objectives: to examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. methods: the antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and  cetylpyridinium chloride. two organisms each belonging to streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. a checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (fic) and summation operator fic index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. appropriate controls were included. the summation operator fic index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. results: the data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. using summation operator fic values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by the american society for microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. however, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. conclusions: according to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial  agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. however, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range  of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.

TI  == sensitization of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus sanguis in biofilms and suspensions to acid damage by fluoride and other weak acids.
AB  == fluoride and other weak acids, such as benzoate, indomethacin, salicylate and sorbate, were found to be sensitizers for acid killing of cells of actinomyces naeslundii atcc 19246 and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 in suspensions or in mono-organism biofilms on glass slides. these bacteria are among the more acid-sensitive organisms from dental plaque and were killed when acidified to ph  values between 3.5 and 4.0. biofilm cells were more resistant than cells in suspensions, especially in terms of the fraction of the initial population surviving acidification. the mechanism for sensitization to acid killing by fluoride and the other weak acids involved enhanced transmembrane transport of protons, reflected by increases in measured proton permeabilities of the cells. thus, the weak acids thwarted the functions of f(h+)-atpases in extruding protons and protecting cells against acid damage. fluoride sensitization of biofilms or cells in suspensions to acid damage occurred rapidly. there was a delay in sensitization of biofilms by indomethacin and higher molecular weight acids which was interpreted in terms of diffusion limitation of sensitizer penetration. overall, it seemed that weak-acid sensitization to acid killing is a general phenomenon that occurs not just for oral bacteria but also for organisms in food, soil, and other acidified environments.

AB  == the present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. results are shown for six taxa (actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prev. nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii/strep. oralis/strep. sanguis, strep. sobrinus, and veillonella dispar/ v. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation  coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. this work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == effects of apis mellifera propolis on the activities of streptococcal glucosyltransferases in solution and adsorbed onto saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  == propolis, a resinous hive product collected by apis mellifera bees, has been used for thousands of years in folk medicine. ethanolic extracts of propolis (eep) have been shown to inhibit the activity of a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase (gtf) enzymes in solution. these enzymes synthesize glucans from sucrose, which are important for the formation of pathogenic dental plaque. in the present study, the effects of propolis from two different regions of brazil on the activity of separate, purified gtf enzymes in solution and on the surface of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) beads were evaluated. the eep from minas gerais (mg; southeastern brazil) and rio grande do sul (rs; southern brazil) were tested for their ability to inhibit the enzymes gtfb (synthesis of insoluble glucan), gtfc (insoluble/soluble glucan) and gtfd (soluble glucan). the effects of propolis on gtf from streptococcus sanguis (soluble glucan synthesis) was also explored. the eep from both regions effectively inhibited the activity of all gtfs in solution (75-95%) and on the surface of sha beads (45-95%) at concentrations between 0.75 and 3.0 mg of propolis/ml. however, the two samples of propolis showed different levels of inhibition on each of the enzymes tested.  in general, eep rs demonstrated a significantly higher inhibitory activity on gtfb and c activities (both solution and surface assays) than eep mg at concentrations between 0.047 and 0.187 mg/ml (p<0.05). eep mg, on the other hand, exhibited a greater inhibitory effect on the activities of surface gtfd (at 0.375, 0.75 and 1.5 mg/ml) and s. sanguis gtf (at 1.5 and 3.0 mg/ml; p<0.05). these data indicate that eep is a potent inhibitor of gtf enzymes in solution and adsorbed on an experimental pellicle; however, its effect on gtf activity is variable depending on the geographical origin of the propolis samples. there is a need to identify the active compounds of propolis.

TI  == effects of antibodies to glucosyltransferase on soluble and insolubilized enzymes.
AB  == objective: previous studies have shown that glucosyltransferase enzymes (gtfs) of streptococcus mutans adsorbed to saliva coated hydroxyapatite (sha) have distinct properties from the same enzymes in solution. the purpose of the present study was to determine the effects on enzyme activity of polyclonal antibodies raised to gtfs in a soluble form and bound to sha. materials and methods: antiserum was  raised in six new zealand white rabbits using the purified glucosyltransferase enzymes (gtfs) of s. mutans, gtfb, gtfc, or gtfd as soluble antigens or adsorbed  to hydroxyapatite (ha, insolubilized). the antisera were examined for their ability to react to these gtfs and gtf from streptococcus sanguis (gtfss) in western blot formats as well as inhibit enzyme activity in solution and insolubilized. results: antibodies raised against gtfb or gtfc detected all gtf enzymes examined in western blots; antibodies raised to gtfd reacted strongly to  gtfd and gtfss, poorly to gtfc, and was non-reactive with gtfb. antibodies to gtfb or gtfc inhibited activity of gtfb and gtfc in solution by 90% or more. enzyme activity adsorbed to sha was inhibited from 70% to 80% by the same antisera. these same antibodies possessed no specific effect on the activities of either gtfd or gtfss. antibodies raised to the gtfd enzyme inhibited activity of  gtfd (80% to 90% inhibition) and gtfss activity (50% to 80%) in solution. in contrast the gtfd antibodies had no effect on the activity of either gtfb or gtfc enzymes in solution. modest inhibitory effects were noted on gtfc and gtfss enzymes bound to sha, but no inhibition was observed for sha-bound gtfb or gtfd.  conclusion: these data show that some antibodies effective against enzymes in solution may have significantly lesser inhibitory effects against the same enzymes insolubilized. further, presentation of gtf antigen immobilized to ha has only a minor influence on the production of antibodies inhibitory to gtf activity.

TI  == presence of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna gene segments in human intestinal lymph follicles.
AB  == background: there is currently no information regarding microbial agents inside the intestinal lymph follicles. methods: biopsy or resected specimens, mostly from macroscopically normal areas, were sectioned with a cryostat. dna was extracted from microdissected samples, exclusively from the lymph follicle. amplification of dna was performed using universal primers designed from conserved regions of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna (rrna). several clones with inserts of around 400 base pairs were subjected to dna sequence analysis followed by a database homology search. results: bacterial 16s rrna gene segments were detected in the lymph follicle in 2 of 14 (14%) non-inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) cases, 4 of 14 (28%) crohn disease cases, and in 2 of 5 (40%) ulcerative colitis cases. nineteen 16s rrna gene segments were recognized in the eight positive cases. five segments showed 100% identity to known bacterial 16s rrnas,  namely staphylococcus species, streptococcus sanguis, and paracoccus marcusii. however, the other 14 segments showed below 100% identity, indicating either the  presence of unknown bacteria or of bacteria without known dna data. no single identified or unidentified bacterium, characteristic of ibd, including mycobacterium paratuberculosis and listeria monocytogenes, was detected. conclusions: the present study confirms the presence of bacterial 16s rrna gene segments in human intestinal lymph follicles and paves the way for new investigations into the microbiology of the lymph follicle. whether or not bacteria inside the lymph follicle is a primary stimulus in ibd has yet to be clarified.

TI  == antibody-targeted lethal photosensitization of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that porphyromonas gingivalis is susceptible to killing by toluidine blue o (tbo) when irradiated with light from a helium-neon (hene) laser. the aim of this study was to determine whether a tbo-antibody conjugate (ab-tbo) could be used to specifically target p. gingivalis to lethal photosensitization in the presence of streptococcus sanguis or human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs). when a mixture of p. gingivalis and s. sanguis was exposed to 4 microg of tbo/ml and irradiated with hene laser light, there were 1.5- and 4.0-log(10)-unit reductions in the viable counts, respectively. in contrast, when tbo was conjugated with a murine monoclonal antibody against p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, the reductions in viable counts of p. gingivalis and s. sanguis amounted to 5.0 and 0.1 log(10) units, respectively. lethal photosensitization of p. gingivalis in the presence of hgfs using unconjugated tbo resulted in a 0.7-log(10)-unit reduction in p. gingivalis viable counts and a 99% reduction in the incorporation of tritiated thymidine ([(3)h]tdr) by the hgfs. in contrast, when the ab-tbo conjugate was used, there was a 100% reduction in p. gingivalis viable counts but no significant reduction in the incorporation  of [(3)h]tdr by hgfs. these results demonstrate that specific targeting of p. gingivalis can be achieved using tbo conjugated to a monoclonal antibody raised against a cell surface component of this organism.

TI  == trovafloxacin treatment of viridans group streptococcus experimental endocarditis.
AB  == the activity of trovafloxacin was compared with those of vancomycin and penicillin in a model of streptococcus sanguis species group (trovafloxacin mic,  0.125 microg/ml) and streptococcus mitis species group (trovafloxacin mic, 0.125  microg/ml) experimental endocarditis. rabbits with catheter-induced aortic valve  vegetations were given no treatment, trovafloxacin at 15 mg/kg of body weight three times a day (t.i.d.), vancomycin at 15 mg/kg twice a day, or penicillin at  1. 2 x 10(6) iu t.i.d. after 3 days of treatment, the animals were sacrificed; cardiac valve vegetations were aseptically removed and cultured quantitatively. penicillin was as active as vancomycin as measured by in vivo clearance of bacteria. trovafloxacin was less active (p < 0.05) than vancomycin or penicillin  against s. sanguis species group infection but had similar efficacy against s. mitis species group infection. quinolones, despite mics in the susceptible range, may not be active for serious infections caused by some viridans group streptococci.

TI  == taxonomic study of "tufted mitior" strains of streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis biotype 11); recognition of a new genospecies.
AB  == the taxonomic position of tufted strains of streptococci, phenotypically resembling streptococcus mitis and previously referred to as 'tufted mitior' was  investigated. by 16s rrna sequence analysis, it was clear that the "tufted mitior" strains belonged to the mitis group of species within the genus streptococcus. it was confirmed that these strains were taxonomically independent at the species level, sharing less than 43%, dna-dna similarity with all established species of the mitis group. however biochemical test data obtained, using three commercial identification kits (rapid id32 strep, streptogram, and biolog gp-plate) together with in-house biochemical tests employing 4-muf-linked  fluorogenic substrates did not reveal sufficient differential tests with which to identify the "tufted mitior" strains unequivocally. from these data, we conclude  that these "tufted mitior" strains represent a new taxon within the mitis group of the genus streptococcus, and propose that they should be considered as a genospecies until differential phenotypic characteristics are found for their identification.

TI  == effect of the interleukin-1 genotype on monocyte il-1beta expression in subjects  with adult periodontitis.
AB  == an association has been reported between polymorphisms in the genes encoding il-1alpha (-889) and il-1beta (+3953) (periodontitis susceptibility trait, pst),  and an increased severity of periodontitis (18). the il-1beta polymorphism was reported to correlate with increased il-1beta expression by monocytes in response to bacterial stimulants. in the present study, we determined if pst positive subjects with periodontitis exhibit elevated production of il-1beta, compared to  pst negative periodontitis patients. peripheral blood monocytes were obtained from 10 pst+ and 10 pst- age- and disease-balanced subjects with adult forms of periodontitis. monocytes were cultured with a panel of bacterial stimulants, including escherichia coli and porphyromonas gingivalis lps, and whole formalinized periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and prevotella intermedia, and health-associated organisms veillonella parvula and streptococcus sanguis. our results demonstrate that monocytes from pst+ and pst-  patients showed no significant differences in il-1beta production in response to  any stimulant tested. in addition, the periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. intermedia failed to stimulate higher il-1beta responses compared to health-associated species v. parvula and s. sanguis. a marked interindividual variation in production of il-1beta was seen, with high, low and  intermediate responders present in both pst+ and pst- groups. we conclude that genetic loci other than the pst polymorphisms are also important regulators of monocyte il-1 responses.

TI  == colorimetric indicators of microbial contamination in corneal preservation medium.
AB  == purpose: to compare acid-base and oxidation-reduction indicators and to investigate the effect of buffer and temperature on the colorimetric detection of microbial growth in corneal preservation media. methods: corneal preservation media containing gentamicin, without or with hepes buffer, were prepared with either phenol red or alamarblue indicators (accumed international, westlake, oh,  u.s.a.). both media were inoculated with staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, or candida albicans and then incubated at 4 degrees c, 22 degrees c, or 35 degrees c. the ph or percent reduction were determined hourly for eight hours, then daily for one week. results: the length of time before a confirmed change in ph or reduction occurred varied by microorganism, storage temperature, and buffering capacity. at 4 degrees c, none of the microorganisms caused a detectable ph change in buffered medium within one day after inoculation, although two bacterial species reduced alamarblue within four hours. at 22 degrees c and 35 degrees c, all bacteria except p. aeruginosa produced a ph shift within a few hours, and all tested bacterial species reduced alamarblue. for bacteria producing detectable ph changes, hepes-buffered medium took longer to change than medium without hepes. c. albicans was not detectable in hepes-buffered medium at any temperature by phenol red and was only detectable by alamarblue after 2-3 days at 22 degrees c and 35 degrees c. conclusion: acidic shifts in refrigerated corneal preservation  medium do not occur during contamination by several microorganisms. alamarblue, a redox indicator, is more sensitive than phenol red in detecting some bacteria. c. albicans is not reliably detected by ph or redox indicators.

TI  == adaptation of oral streptococci to low ph.
AB  == the strategies employed by oral streptococci to resist the inimical influences of acidification reflect the diverse and dynamic niches of the human mouth. all of the oral streptococci are capable of rapid degradation of sugar to acidic end-products. as a result, the ph value of their immediate environment can plummet to levels where glycolysis and growth cease. at this point, the approaches for survival in acid separate the organisms. streptococcus mutans, for example, relies on its f-atpase, to protect itself from acidification by pumping  protons out of the cells. s. salivarius responds by degrading urea to ammonia and s. sanguis produces ammonia by arginolysis. the mechanisms by which these organisms regulate their particular escape route are now being explored experimentally. the picture that emerges is that the acid-adaptive regulatory mechanisms of the oral streptococci differ markedly from those employed by gram-negative bacteria. what remains to be elucidated are the breadth of the acid-response systems in these organisms and how they permit the microbes to sustain themselves in the face of low ph and the bacterial competition present in their respective niches. in this article, we summarize reports concerning the means by which oral streptococci either utilize acidification to subdue their competitors or protect themselves until ph values return to a more favorable level.

TI  == role of monocytes in experimental staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.
AB  == in the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis (be), the clotting system plays a cardinal role in the formation and maintenance of the endocardial vegetations. the extrinsic pathway is involved in the activation of the coagulation pathway with tissue factor (tf) as the key protein. staphylococcus aureus is a frequently isolated bacterium from patients with be. we therefore investigated whether s. aureus can induce tf activity (tfa) on fibrin-adherent monocytes, used as an in vitro model of be. we also assessed in vivo in rabbits with catheter induced vegetations, the effect of s. aureus infection on vegetational tfa. in vitro experiments showed that adherent s. aureus induced tfa on fibrin-adherent monocytes which was optimal at a bacterium/monocyte ratio of 1 to 1. monocyte damage occurred when this ratio exceeded 4 to 1 (visually) or 6 to 1 (propidium iodide influx) consequently, tfa decreased. in vivo s. aureus led to very high bacterial numbers in the vegetations and a significant increase of their weight.  however, tfa of infected vegetations was the same as of sterile ones. this may be due to the high bacteria to monocyte ratio as well as bacterium-induced monocyte  damage. teicoplanin treatment of infected rabbits reduced bacterial numbers in the blood and in the vegetations. two-day treatment resulted in an increase of vegetational tfa, but after four-day treatment vegetational tfa dropped, most probably due to a suboptimal bacterium/monocyte ratio. s. aureus endocarditis in  etoposide (vepesid)-treated rabbits, leading to a selective monocytopenia, caused a rapid death of the animals. in these rabbits no vegetations were found at all.  we conclude that, like streptococcus sanguis and staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus is able to induce tfa in fibrin-adherent blood monocytes. in addition, monocytes have a protective effect during the course of s. aureus endocarditis.

TI  == studies concerning the glucosyltransferase of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == we have shown in previous studies that the glucosyltransferase (gtf) enzymes of streptococcus mutans have distinct properties when adsorbed to a surface. in the  present study, we compared the activity of gtf from streptococcus sanguis, designated gtfss, in solution and on the surface of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  (sha) beads, and determined the ability of its product glucan to support the adherence of oral microorganisms. gtf from s. sanguis 804 nctc 10904 was purified from culture supernatant fluids by means of hydroxyapatite chromatography. enzyme and the substrate were prepared in buffers at ph values from 3.5 to 7.5. maximum  activity of gtfss occurred between ph 5.5 and ph 6.5, whether in solution or adsorbed onto a surface. the solubilized and insolubilized enzymes showed highest activity at 40 degrees c; activity was reduced by 50(+/-2)% at 20 and 30 degrees  c. the enzyme did not form glucans in either phase at 10 or 60 degrees c. the k(m), determined from lineweaver-burk plots, for the enzyme in solution was 4.3(+/-0.4) mmol/l sucrose, and the k(m) for the enzyme on sha beads was 5.0(+/-1.0) mmol/l sucrose. the ability of the gtfss glucan synthesized on the surface of sha beads to support the adherence of oral bacteria was investigated.  (3)h-thymidine-labeled bacteria (s. mutans gs-5, s. sobrinus 6715, s. sobrinus 6716, s. sanguis 10904, actinomyces viscosus omz105e, a. viscosus 2085, and a. viscosus 2086) were incubated with sha beads coated with gtfss glucan. s. mutans  gs-5 displayed the highest level of binding numerically. these results show that  the gtfss of s. sanguis is active on sha beads, that the ph optimum for activity  on a surface differs slightly from that in solution, and that its product glucan  can support the adherence of oral microorganisms.

TI  == ib-367, a protegrin peptide with in vitro and in vivo activities against the microflora associated with oral mucositis.
AB  == although the microflora associated with oral mucositis initiated by cytotoxic therapy is not well characterized, several studies suggest that reduction of the  microbial load in the oral cavity has some clinical benefit. the mics of ib-367,  a synthetic protegrin analog, ranged from 0.13 to 64 microgram/ml for gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and staphylococcus aureus) and from 0.06 to 8 microgram/ml for gram-negative species (klebsiella, escherichia, and pseudomonas). ib-367 exhibited rapid, microbicidal activity against both log- and stationary-phase cultures of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. at concentrations near the mics for these two organisms (4 and 2 microgram/ml, respectively), ib-367 reduced viability by more than 3 logs in less than 16 min. similarly, ib-367 effected a 4-log reduction of the endogenous microflora in pooled human saliva within 2 min at 250 microgram/ml, a concentration readily attained by local delivery. after nine serial transfers at  0.5x the mic, the mic of ib-367 for mrsa and p. aeruginosa increased only two to  four times. in a phase i clinical study with healthy volunteers, ib-367 was well  tolerated, with no detectable systemic absorption. one hour after treatment with  9 mg of ib-367, the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria and yeast was reduced, and the density of the predominant gram-positive oral flora was decreased 1,000 times. ib-367's properties (speed of killing, breadth of spectrum, and lack of resistance) make the compound a strong candidate for the prophylaxis of oral mucositis. phase ii clinical trials with ib-367 are under way for this indication in immunocompromised subjects.

TI  == natural history of streptococcus sanguinis in the oral cavity of infants: evidence for a discrete window of infectivity.
AB  == the heterogeneous group of oral bacteria within the sanguinis (sanguis) streptococci comprise members of the indigenous biota of the human oral cavity. while the association of streptococcus sanguinis with bacterial endocarditis is well described in the literature, s. sanguinis is thought to play a benign, if not a beneficial, role in the oral cavity. little is known, however, about the natural history of s. sanguinis and its specific relationship with other oral bacteria. as part of a longitudinal study concerning the transmission and acquisition of oral bacteria within mother-infant pairs, we examined the initial  acquisition of s. sanguinis and described its colonization relative to tooth emergence and its proportions in plaque and saliva as a function of other biological events, including subsequent colonization with mutans streptococci. a  second cohort of infants was recruited to define the taxonomic affiliation of s.  sanguinis. we found that the colonization of the s. sanguinis occurs during a discrete "window of infectivity" at a median age of 9 months in the infants. its  colonization is tooth dependent and correlated to the time of tooth emergence; its proportions in saliva increase as new teeth emerge. in addition, early colonization of s. sanguinis and its elevated levels in the oral cavity were correlated to a significant delay in the colonization of mutans streptococci. underpinning this apparent antagonism between s. sanguinis and mutans streptococci is the observation that after mutans streptococci colonize the infant, the levels of s. sanguinis decrease. children who do not harbor detectable levels of mutans streptococci have significantly higher levels of s. sanguinis in their saliva than do children colonized with mutans streptococci. collectively, these findings suggest that the colonization of s. sanguinis may influence the subsequent colonization of mutans streptococci, and this in turn may suggest several ecological approaches toward controlling dental caries.

TI  == differential patterns of apoptosis in resolving and nonresolving bacterial pneumonia.
AB  == infection with either streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus pneumoniae type 25 causes acute pneumonitis in rats. pneumonia caused by s. sanguis resolves over the course of 8 d, whereas pneumonia caused by s. pneumoniae type 25 progresses to fibrosis. to examine the role of apoptosis in these models, we performed assays with the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-uridine nucleotide end-labeling technique on tissue sections from rat lungs at various times, and quantified the results with image analysis. apoptosis was a feature of both the acute and resolving stages of pneumonia. the pattern and extent of apoptosis were similar in both models during the acute stage, and the number of apoptotic nuclei increased in both models through 4 d after infection. although there were differences in the cellular pattern of apoptosis after 2 d and 4 d of infection,  the extent of apoptosis was the same in both models. after 8 d, major differences were observed. in the resolving model, apoptosis was limited primarily to an abscess in the base of the lung. in the nonresolving model, apoptosis was persistent. we also found that cyclin-dependent kinase-5 expression is upregulated during apoptosis induced by bacterial infection. these data indicate  that the location and timing of apoptosis may determine whether pneumonia resolves or progresses to fibrosis.

AB  == background: with an increasing body of data suggesting an association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease, studies have been conducted to elucidate potential mechanisms by which oral bacteria might exert systemic effects. 2 oral bacteria, streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis, have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. this study was conducted to determine the effect of treatment with an essential oil mouthrinse (listerine  antiseptic) on the platelet-aggregating activity of these organisms. method: bacteria were grown under standard culture conditions. s. sanguis atcc strain 10556 was exposed for 3 min to the essential oil mouthrinse at either full strength or a 1:1 dilution, while p. gingivalis fdc strain 381 was exposed to the essential oil mouthrinse at a 1:10 dilution. positive control cells were treated  with hanks balanced salt solution (hbss). aggregation was measured using a recording platelet aggregometer. the assay of each organism in its respective mouthrinse dilution(s) or hbss was repeated 5 times. results: in all cases, the hbss-treated organisms induced platelet aggregation, with mean(+/-s.e.) lag times of 12.30 (+/-1.36) min and 11.36 (+/-0.58) min for p. gingivalis and s. sanguis,  respectively. in contrast, treatment with the essential oil mouthrinse completely inhibited the platelet aggregating activity of p. gingivalis and of s. sanguis exposed to the 1:1 mouthrinse dilution in all assays; the aggregating activity of s. sanguis treated with full-strength mouthrinse was completely inhibited in 4 of 5 assays, and inhibited by 75% in the 5th, for a mean inhibition of 95 +/- 1.5%.  conclusion: this study provides additional evidence that the essential oil mouthrinse can interfere with bacterial cell surface-associated activities which  may have clinical relevance.

TI  == comparison of gyra and parc mutations and resistance levels among fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates and laboratory-derived mutants of oral streptococci.
AB  == laboratory-derived fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants were obtained by serial passage of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus anginosus isolates on agar containing increasing concentrations of old and new fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin and du-6859a, respectively. sequencing of an s. sanguis isolate exposed to du-6859a showed that resistance was associated with two mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (qrdr) of the gyra gene (ser83-->phe; glu87-->lys), and with a mutation in the parc gene (ser79-->ile). however, different mutations in the gyra gene (ser83-->tyr) and parc gene (ser79-->phe) were found in a s. sanguis isolate exposed to ofloxacin. a fluoroquinolone-resistant isolate, qr-95101, from a dental infection, had a single mutation in the gyra gene (ser83-->phe) and in the parc gene (ser79-->phe). two fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants, qs-701ofm and qs-701dum, were obtained from s. anginosus qs-701, by exposure to ofloxacin and du-6859a, respectively. these mutants showed a common substitution at codon 83 (ser-->phe)  in the gyra gene but had different substitutions at codon 87 (qs-701ofm, glu-->gln; qs-701dum, glu-->lys). they also had different substitutions at codons 79 and 135 in the parc gene (qs-701ofm, ser79-->leu but no change at glu135; qs-701dum, ser79-->ile and glu135-->gln). the resistance levels of the du-6859a-selected resistant s. sanguis mutant qs-951dum to du-6859a, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were higher than those of the ofloxacin-selected resistant mutant qs-951ofm. however, ampicillin susceptibilities of these mutants were not different from the parental strains. in s. anginosus, the du-6859a-selected fluoroquinolone-resistant mutant qs-701dum was resistant to all the fluoroquinolones tested, while the ofloxacin-selected mutant qs-701ofm was resistant to three fluoroquinolones, but not du-6859a. the results indicate that  different fluoroquinolones select distinct mutations in the qrdr of the gyra and  parc genes in oral streptococci. the gyra or parc mutation in oral streptococci may determine the levels of fluoroquinolone resistance.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == purification, characterization, and molecular analysis of the gene encoding glucosyltransferase from streptococcus oralis.
AB  == streptococcus oralis is a member of the oral streptococcal family and an early-colonizing microorganism in the oral cavity of humans. s. oralis is known to produce glucosyltransferase (gtase), which synthesizes glucans from sucrose. the enzyme was purified chromatographically from a culture supernatant of s. oralis atcc 10557. the purified enzyme, gtase-r, had a molecular mass of 173 kda  and a pi of 6.3. this enzyme mainly synthesized water-soluble glucans with no primer dependency. the addition of gtase markedly enhanced the sucrose-dependent  resting cell adhesion of streptococcus mutans at a level similar to that found in growing cells of s. mutans. the antibody against gtase-r inhibited the glucan-synthesizing activities of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguis, as well as s. oralis. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of gtase-r exhibited no similarities to known gtase sequences of oral streptococci. using degenerate pcr primers, an 8.1-kb dna fragment, carrying the gene (gtfr) coding for gtase-r and its regulator gene (rgg), was cloned and sequenced. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed that the rgg genes of s. oralis and s. gordonii exhibited a close similarity. the gtfr gene was found to possess a species-specific nucleotide sequence corresponding to the n-terminal 130 amino acid residues. insertion of erm or apha into the rgg or gtfr gene resulted in decreased gtase activity by the organism and changed the colony morphology of these transformants. these results indicate that s. oralis gtase may play an important role in the subsequent colonizing of mutans streptoccoci.

TI  == namibian chewing stick, diospyros lycioides, contains antibacterial compounds against oral pathogens.
AB  == the twigs of diospyros lycioides, a plant commonly known as "muthala", are frequently used as chewing sticks for the cleaning of teeth by rural and urban people in namibia. preliminary studies showed that a methanol extract of d. lycioides inhibited growth of selected oral pathogens. subsequent bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of four novel bioactive naphthalene glycosides, diospyrosides a, b, c, and d (1-4), and two known bioactive naphthoquinones, juglone (5) and 7-methyljuglone (6). the structures of the new compounds were elucidated using spectroscopic techniques including 1d and 2d nmr. these compounds inhibited the growth of oral cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis) and periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) at minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.019 to 1.25 mg/ml. juglone exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity among these compounds.

TI  == salivary film expresses a complex, macromolecular binding site for streptococcus  sanguis.
AB  == teeth in the oral cavity are coated with a salivary film or pellicle, which lacks apparent intermolecular organization. this heterogeneous film facilitates binding of early commensal colonizing bacteria, including streptococcus sanguis. to test  the hypothesis that sufficient intermolecular organization exists in salivary films to form binding sites for s. sanguis, an in vitro model of saliva-coated teeth was probed with murine anti-idiotypical monoclonal antibodies (mab2, anti-ids). the anti-ids were harvested from hybridomas that were developed in response to first generation murine hybridomas that produced anti-s. sanguis adhesin monoclonal antibodies (mab1). the anti-ids (i) reacted with experimental  salivary films and inhibited s. sanguis adhesion in a dose-dependent fashion. in  western blots, the anti-ids (ii) recognized a high molecular weight salivary antigen and (iii) secretory iga (siga) light chain and alpha-amylase. after isolation by gel filtration from whole saliva or mixed secretory iga and alpha-amylase, the high molecular weight component, containing amylase activity and siga, bound to hydroxyapatite to promote adhesion of s. sanguis. therefore, a complex enriched in secretory immunoglobulin a and alpha-amylase forms a s. sanguis-binding site.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == epithelial cell response to challenge of bacterial lipoteichoic acids and lipopolysaccharides in vitro.
AB  == accumulating dental plaque at the gingival margin contains lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. in subgingival plaque associated with periodontal disease the amount of lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from gram-negative bacteria increases. as the gingival junctional epithelium (je) is an important structural and functional tissue, participating in the first line defence against apical advancement of dental plaque, this study examined the direct effects of ltas (from streptococcus mutans and s. sanguis) and lpss (from  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and escherichia coli) on two epithelial cell lines (hacat and erm) and  a culture model for human je. the cells were exposed to the ltas or lpss (10-50 microg/ml) for variable periods of time. none of the bacterial surface components had any effect on primary adhesion or on the epithelial attachment of the je cultures. however, cell growth and mitotic activity were consistently reduced in  all cultures treated with ltas. in contrast, lpss showed only slight or no effects on cell growth and mitotic activity depending on the epithelial cells used. this suggests that lpss, despite their established role as modulators of inflammation, do not have direct harmful effects - at the concentrations found in dental plaque and gingival crevicular fluid - which would explain the mechanism of epithelial degeneration and detachment from the tooth surface. however, the ltas appear to inhibit the renewal of epithelium and may thus contribute to degeneration of coronal je and subgingival colonisation by periodontal pathogens.

TI  == the in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == co-aggregation as a virulent factor of streptococcus sanguis isolated from infective endocarditis.
AB  == the pathogenicity of strains of the streptococcus sanguis group, isolated from infective endcarditis, was studied by measuring the development of subcutaneous abscesses in mice after infection with s. sanguis and actinomyces viscosus either singly or as co-aggregated pairs. the pathogenicity of the co-aggregates was also examined in various viable combinations of the two bacterial species. more abscesses were formed by a. viscosus than the s. sanguis group including clinical isolates. abscess formation by co-aggregates of combinations of each isolate and  a. viscosus produced a higher percentage of abscess formation than those caused by infection with a pure suspension of a. viscosus or tested streptococci. co-aggregated cells were more resistant to phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils in vivo. these results indicated that s. sanguis group streptococci isolated from infective endocarditis are able to co-aggregate and resist phagocytosis. the ability of co-aggregation of s. sanguis may serve as a survival mechanism in a host defense system and may be linked with virulence of this bacteria.

TI  == effects of organic acid anions on growth, glycolysis, and intracellular ph of oral streptococci.
AB  == oral streptococci produce large quantities of organic acids as the end-products of carbohydrate fermentation. in an approach to determine if oral streptococci exhibit differential sensitivities to organic acid anions, we determined the effects of formate, lactate, and acetate on intracellular ph maintenance, glycolysis, and growth of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis. growth  was determined as maximum culture optical density in the presence of the organic  acid anions at ph 7.1, 6.7, 6.3, and 6.1, and the effects of the anions on glycolytic activity and intracellular ph were determined at ph 7.0 and 5.0. at ph 7.1, the organic acid anions had little effect on growth of either species. at the lower ph values, all of the anions reduced the maximum culture optical density of both species in a ph- and concentration-dependent manner, with s. sanguis being more sensitive to growth inhibition than s. mutans. the organic acid anions had little or no effect on glycolytic activity of either species at ph 7.0. however, all of the organic acid anions tested reduced glycolytic activity at ph 5.0 in a concentration-dependent manner, with s. sanguis being more sensitive than s. mutans. the inhibition of glycolysis could be related to the pka of the organic acid, with formate and lactate being more inhibitory than  acetate. the organic acid anions decreased the intracellular ph of s. mutans and  s. sanguis, glycolyzing at an extracellular ph of 5.0, such that the reduction in glycolytic activity caused by the organic acid anions could be directly attributed to the fall in intracellular ph. in conclusion, the production of lactic acid in plaque would not only lower ph, thereby having a disadvantageous effect on less aciduric oral streptococci, such as s. sanguis, but would also increase their sensitivity to the effects of low ph, helping s. mutans to become  more dominant.

AB  == the aim of our study was to evaluate the leakage of four cements (cavit, irm, term, and fermit) using a two-compartment model system and streptococcus sanguis  as bacterial marker. access cavities in premolars were filled with cement and the teeth immersed in culture medium in the model system. half of the teeth were thermocycled on day 2. bacterial percolation into the upper compartment was measured at regular intervals (days 2, 7, 14, and 21). cement thickness was measured at the end of the study. in the nonthermocycled group, cavit was more leakproof than the other cements at day 2 (p = 0.011), than term and irm at day 7 (p = 0.043). fermit was more leakproof than irm at day 7 (p = 0.043). in the thermocycled group, cavit was more leakproof than the other cements at day 7 (p = 0.041). thermocycling did not significantly affect leakage. cement thickness averaged 4.1 mm and did not significantly affect leakage. these results should be considered when using cements as temporary fillings.

AB  == objectives: to improve reliability of salivary bacterial cultures as a surrogate  for plaque levels of cariogenic bacterial species by reporting the salivary cfus  of these organisms as a function of the number of teeth. design: cross-sectional  collection of data in a convenience sample of adults over 60 years of age. setting: hospital dental clinic, university bacteriology laboratory. subjects: 523 older dentate subjects, average age 70, including 412 subjects who were in an independent living status and 111 in a dependent-living situation. main outcome measures: subjects were examined for decay and the presence of salivary factors including the levels of s. mutans, lactobacilli, yeast and other bacteria. the salivary levels of the bacteria were adjusted for the number of teeth in the mouth, and the resultant values were entered into multivariable logistic regression models along with clinical and other salivary parameters. results: mutans streptococci levels reported as cfus/ml saliva per tooth were significantly associated with coronal surface decay, and lactobacilli, reported in a similar way, were significantly associated with root surface decay. salivary levels of yeasts, which had previously been associated with decay in this population, were no longer significant using this construct. conclusions: this construct of reporting salivary bacteriological data as a function of tooth number and per ml saliva could improve the reliability of bacteriological data obtained in epidemiological studies investigating the role of bacteria in dental  decay in the elderly.

AB  == the dodecapepetide sequence r-l-c-r-i-v-v-i-r-v-c-r with a disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues found in bovine neutrophils was synthesized by solid-phase procedures. its antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus gordonii was examined, and its structural features were examined by cd and determined by two-dimensional (2d) nmr. the strains p. gingivalis (w50 and 381), a. actinomycetemcomitans (y4 and 67), s. gordonii (dl1), and s. mutans (gs5) are found to be highly sensitive to this peptide at 2-2.5 microm concentrations, suggesting that the dodecapeptide is a potent antibiotic for oral pathogens. the weak negative n-sigma* band observed at approximately 265-270 nm in the cd spectra of this peptide provides evidence for  the presence of a disulfide bridge. the negative n-pi* band at approximately 200  nm and the positive pi-pi* band at 185 nm suggest a folded structure for this peptide. the negative n-pi* shifts from 200 to 206 nm with an increase in intensity in dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine vesicles, suggesting that the peptide might associate to form higher order aggregates in lipid medium. the assignment of backbone and side-chain proton resonances has been accomplished by the combined analysis of 2d total correlated and nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy. the temperature dependence of amide nh chemical shifts and (1)h-(2)h exchange effect on amide nh resonances indicate the involvement of amide nh groups of cys3, ile5, ile8, val10, and arg12 in intramolecular hydrogen  bonding. the coupling constant (j(nh-c(alpha)h)) values, the set of medium-, short-, and long-range nuclear overhauser effects, and the results of restrained  structure calculation using the distance geometry algorithm for nmr applications  provide evidence for a folded, loop-like structure with a type i (iii) beta-turn  involving ile5, val6, val7, and ile8, and two antiparallel beta-strands involving the n-terminal arg1, leu2, cys3, and val4 and the c-terminal arg9, val10, cys11,  and arg12 residues. the structure of the dodecapeptide mimics the amphiphilic structure of large 30-35 residue defensins and the peptide appears to exhibit similar antimicrobial potency.

TI  == [effects of surface roughness of two restorative materials on early streptococcus sanguis adhesion in vitro].
AB  == this was an in vitro study aimed at the surface roughness of two kinds of commonly used restorative materials resin and alloy necessary to affect the adhesive behavior of streptococcus sanguis(s. s) on them after 24 h. the surface  roughness(sr) of each tested sample was evaluated with a profilometer quantitatively and observed with scanning electron microscope (sem) morphologically. then the adhesive microbial amount was determined by the clone forming unit counting method, and adhesion morphology was analyzed with sem. the  result showed a positive linear relation between the adhesion amount of s. s and  the sr. the relative coefficients were rresin = 0.46(p < 0.01) and ralloy = 0.25(p < 0.01) respectively. these suggest the sr of the restorative material is  important for the early adhesion of oral microbes in vitro. therefore, before the prothesis is inserted in the patient's oral cavity, its surface should be polished as smoothly as possible so that the bacterial adhesive amount on its surface can be decreased, and hence the patient may keep in good oral health and  have a prolonged use of the prothesis.

TI  == adhesion of candida albicans to oral streptococci is promoted by selective adsorption of salivary proteins to the streptococcal cell surface.
AB  == adhesion of candida albicans to saliva-coated surfaces is an important early step in the colonization of the oral cavity. c. albicans cells also adhere to several  species of oral streptococci including streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguinis in what are believed to be multi-modal interactions. it is now demonstrated that incubation of streptococcal cells of these species with human parotid saliva further promotes the adhesion of c. albicans cells by up to 2-3-fold. various species of streptococci were shown to adsorb different protein components of parotid saliva to their cell surfaces. the basic proline-rich proteins (bprps), to which c. albicans cells bind on nitrocellulose blot overlay, were strongly adsorbed to the surface of s. gordonii cells but not to s. oralis cells. parotid saliva that was pre-adsorbed with s. gordonii cells and then applied to hydroxylapatite beads was <50% effective at supporting adhesion of c. albicans compared with control (non-adsorbed) saliva, demonstrating that bprps are major pellicle receptors. c. albicans cells did not  adsorb bprps from fluid-phase parotid saliva. following size-exclusion chromatography of parotid saliva samples, pooled fractions enriched in bprps promoted maximal adhesion of c. albicans to s. gordonii cells. the results demonstrate that c. albicans cells recognize only surface-bound forms of bprps and suggest that these proteins adsorbed to enamel or to streptococcal surfaces promote c. albicans adhesion and oral colonization.

TI  == cleavage of a recombinant human immunoglobulin a2 (iga2)-iga1 hybrid antibody by  certain bacterial iga1 proteases.
AB  == to understand more about the factors influencing the cleavage of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) by microbial iga1 proteases, a recombinant human iga2/iga1 hybrid molecule was generated. in the hybrid, termed iga2/a1 half hinge, a seven-amino-acid sequence corresponding to one half of the duplicated sequence making up the iga1 hinge was incorporated into the equivalent site in iga2. insertion of the iga1 half hinge into iga2 did not affect antigen binding capacity or the functional activity of the hybrid molecule, as judged by its ability to bind to iga fcalpha receptors and trigger respiratory bursts in neutrophils. although the iga2/a1 hybrid contained only half of the iga1 hinge, it was found to be cleaved by a variety of different bacterial iga1 proteases, including representatives of those that cleave iga1 in the different duplicated halves of the hinge, namely, those of prevotella melaninogenica, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. sanguis, neisseria meningitidis types 1 and 2, n. gonorrhoeae types 1 and 2, and haemophilus influenzae type 2. thus, for these enzymes the recognition site for iga1 cleavage is contained within half of the iga1 hinge region; additional distal elements, if required, are provided by either an iga1 or an iga2 framework. in contrast, the iga2/a1 hybrid appeared to be resistant to cleavage with s. oralis and some h. influenzae type 1 iga1 proteases, suggesting  these enzymes require additional determinants for efficient substrate recognition.

AB  == background: behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. the aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. methods: thirty-three patients with behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. serum igg antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. results: significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  oralis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with behcet's disease than in controls (p <0.001-0.05). in contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 compared to controls (p <0.01). conclusions: our data indicate that the patients with behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.

AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == systemic doxycycline administration in the treatment of periodontal infections (ii). effect on antibiotic resistance of subgingival species.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). saliva samples as  well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. all subjects received full mouth srp and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. control subjects were sampled at the same time points. samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in pras ringer's solution and plated on enriched trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the mann whitney test and over time within each group using the quade test. the mean % (+/-sem) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to  25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. in saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling  to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. the % of resistant isolates did  not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. for all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus constellatus, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus gordonii, eikenella corrodens and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. doxycycline resistant strains of these  species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.

TI  == efficacy of levofloxacin in the treatment of experimental endocarditis caused by  viridans group streptococci.
AB  == levofloxacin was investigated against viridans group streptococci in vitro and in rats with experimental aortic endocarditis. the mic(90)s of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin for 20 independent isolates of such bacteria were 1 and 8 mg/l, respectively. rats were infected with two types of organism: either fully susceptible to levofloxacin mic < or = 0.5 mg/l) or borderline susceptible (mic 1-2 mg/l). fully levofloxacin-susceptible bacteria comprised one penicillin-susceptible (mic 0.004 mg/l) streptococcus gordonii, and one penicillin-tolerant as well as one intermediate penicillin-resistant (mic 0.125 mg/l) isogenic strains. borderline levofloxacin-susceptible bacteria comprised one penicillin-susceptible streptococcus sanguis and one highly penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis (mic 2 mg/l). rats were treated for 5 days with drug dosages simulating the following treatments in humans: (i) levofloxacin 500 mg orally once a day (q24 h), (ii) levofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day (q12 h), (iii) levofloxacin 1 g orally q24 h, (iv) ciprofloxacin 750  mg orally q12 h, and (v) ceftriaxone 2 g iv q24 h. levofloxacin was equivalent or superior to ceftriaxone, and was successful in treating experimental endocarditis irrespective of penicillin resistance. nevertheless, standard levofloxacin treatment equivalent to 500 mg q24 h in human was less effective than twice daily 500 mg or once daily 1 g doses against borderline-susceptible organisms. ciprofloxacin, used as a negative control, was ineffective and selected for resistant isolates. this underlines the importance of mic determinations when treating severe streptococcal infection with quinolones. in the case of borderline-susceptible pathogens, total daily doses of 1 g of levofloxacin should be considered.

TI  == the transfer of bacteria to, and survival on, dental records.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to ascertain whether viable bacteria could be transferred from gloves to laboratory cards in dental records and, if so, to determine whether bacteria could survive on the paper. the thumbs and forefingers of two types of glove (biogel d and microtouch) were inoculated with streptococcus sanguis and left for various periods of time. a sterile dental laboratory card was then held with the gloves and the number of bacteria surviving on the card determined after various periods of incubation of the card  at room temperature. bacteria were transferred to the laboratory cards and remained viable for up to 72 h. more viable bacteria were transferred from the microtouch gloves than from the biogel d gloves, and this was attributable, in part, to the latter gloves exerting a bactericidal effect. the results demonstrated that bacteria can be transferred from gloves to laboratory cards and that these organisms can remain viable for long periods of time. dental records may, therefore, represent a possible route of cross-infection.

TI  == experimental uveitis induced by intravitreal or intravenous lipoteichoic acid in  rabbits.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the role of lipoteichoic acid (lta), one of the cell wall components in gram-positive bacteria in uveitis. methods: intraocular inflammation in rabbit eyes was induced by intravitreal or intravenous injections of lta from staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus sanguis. the inflammation was  monitored progressively with the laser flare-cell photometer, and examined by periodic clinical observations. histological examinations were performed 24 hours after administration, and aqueous protein concentrations and cell counts were also determined. results: intraocular inflammation appeared within 6-9 hours of lta intravitreal injection. became maximal at about 24-48 hours postinjection, and lasted for nearly 6 days. intraocular inflammation was also induced by intravenous injection of lta at a higher dose. inflammation reached a peak 4-5 hours after injection, and rapidly disappeared in 24 hours. no cellular response  was observed in intravenous lta-treated eyes. conclusions: this study demonstrates that ltas from gram-positive bacteria have the biological activity to induce intraocular inflammation in rabbits by intravitreal or intravenous injection. therefore, we suggest that lta may play a role in the pathogenesis of  uveitis as one of the etiological factors.

TI  == prevalence of the amylase-binding protein a gene (abpa) in oral streptococci.
AB  == salivary amylase binds specifically to a number of oral streptococcal species. this interaction may play an important role in dental plaque formation. recently, a 585-bp gene was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus gordonii challis encoding a 20.5-kda amylase-binding protein (abpa). the goal of this study was to determine if related genes are present in other species of oral streptococci. biotinylated abpa was used in southern blot analysis to screen genomic dna from several strains representing eight species of oral streptococci. this probe hybridized with a 4.0-kb hindiii restriction fragment from all 13 strains of s. gordonii tested. the probe did not appear to bind to any restriction fragments from other species of amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus mitis (with the exception of 1 of 14 strains), streptococcus crista (3 strains),  streptococcus anginosus (1 strain), and streptococcus parasanguinis (1 strain), or to non-amylase-binding oral streptococci including streptococcus sanguinis (3  strains), streptococcus oralis (4 strains), and streptococcus mutans (1 strain).  primers homologous to sequences within the 3' and 5' ends of abpa yielded products of 400 bp following pcr of genomic dna from the southern blot-positive strains. several of these pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the levels of similarity of these cloned products to the abpa of s. gordonii challis ranged from 91 to 96%. these studies reveal that the abpa gene appears to be specific to s. gordonii and differs from genes encoding amylase-binding proteins from other species of amylase-binding streptococci.

AB  == objective: this study investigated the biosynthesis of p-aminobenzoic acid by streptococcus sanguis and the role of p-aminobenzoic acid in the interaction between streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. methods: a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic technique was used to analyze the p-aminobenzoic acid synthesized by streptococcus sanguis in an anaerobic atmosphere. results: the results showed, that (1) the chromatographic method established in this study had good linear relation and the average recovery of p-aminobenzoic acid was 80%, and (2) streptococcus sanguis did synthesize p-aminobenzoic acid, and the mean concentration of p-aminobenzoic acid was 1.23 micrograms/ml. conclusions: the results of this study will help further studies of the factors that may have effects on p-aminobenzoic acid synthesis by streptococcus sanguis and on the role of p-aminobenzoic acid in the microbial homeostasis of dental plaque.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

TI  == membrane locus and ph sensitivity of paraben inhibition of alkali production by oral streptococci.
AB  == parabens were found to be potent inhibitors of alkali production from arginine by oral streptococci such as streptococcus rattus, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii. for example, 2 mumol butylparaben per ml completely and irreversibly inhibited arginolysis by intact cells of s. rattus fa-1 and was lethal for the organism. in contrast, butylparaben was not a very effective inhibitor of ureolysis by intact cells of streptococcus salivarius 57.i, although it did kill the cells. butylparaben irreversibly inhibited the cytoplasmic enzymes arginine deiminase, carbamate kinase and urease in permeabilized cells or isolated form. however, inhibition of arginolysis by intact cells appeared to be  due primarily to irreversible inhibition of transport systems for arginine uptake, because butylparaben added to intact cells did not reduce levels of arginine deiminase when the cells were subsequently permeabilized after washing.  the insensitivity of ureolysis by intact cells to butylparaben can be related to  the known high permeability of cell membranes to urea and the cytoplasmic location of urease. the potency of butylparaben as an inhibitior of arginolysis or glycolysis and as a lethal agent was found to be greater at acid ph that at neutral or alkaline ph.

TI  == efficacy of levofloxacin for experimental aortic-valve endocarditis in rabbits infected with viridans group streptococcus or staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == levofloxacin is among the more active fluoroquinolones against streptococci and staphylococci. it is effective against moderately severe infections caused by these organisms, but its efficacy in the treatment of bacteremia and serious infections such as endocarditis is not well defined. we compared the efficacy of  levofloxacin to those of standard agents in the rabbit model of aortic-valve endocarditis caused by fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains including a penicillin-susceptible strain of streptococcus sanguis, a penicillin-resistant strain of streptococcus mitis, a methicillin-resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus, and a methicillin-susceptible strain of s. aureus. levofloxacin administered intramuscularly at dosages of 20 to 40 mg/kg of body weight twice daily (b.i.d.) was completely ineffective against the penicillin-susceptible strain, with mean vegetation titers after 3 days of therapy not statistically significantly different from those for controls. levofloxacin was no more effective than penicillin against the penicillin-resistant strain. levofloxacin administered for 4 days at a dosage of 20 mg/kg b.i.d. was at least as effective  as vancomycin administered intravenously at a dosage of 25 mg/kg b.i. d. against  the methicillin-resistant s. aureus strain and was as effective as nafcillin administered intramuscularly at 100 mg three times daily against the methicillin-susceptible strain. emergence of resistance to levofloxacin in vitro  was less likely to occur than resistance to ciprofloxacin, and resistance to levofloxacin was not observed in vivo. levofloxacin-rifampin combinations were antagonistic in vitro and in vivo. levofloxacin was highly effective as a single  agent against experimental staphylococcal endocarditis but was surprisingly ineffective against streptococcal endocarditis, suggesting that it has a potential role as treatment for serious s. aureus but not viridans group streptococcal infections in humans.

TI  == multiple infections in carotid atherosclerotic plaques.
AB  == background: chlamydia pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and recently, periodontal disease, have been associated with human atherosclerosis. porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus sanguis are major pathogens associated with periodontitis, a common chronic inflammatory condition in adults. investigators have found that these infectious agents may influence vascular cell functions by inducing thrombus formation, vascular cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell death. methods and results: the main purpose of our study was to investigate the relation between the presence of multiple infectious agents in human carotid endarterectomy specimens and pathoanatomic features of the corresponding carotid plaques. histologically, plaque rupture of the fibrous cap  and communication of the luminal thrombus with the central necrotic lipid core was seen in or at proximity to the macrophage-rich shoulder (unstable plaque region). thrombus within the lipid core without plaque rupture was occasionally found near the internal elastic lamina, associated with increased vascularity and lymphocytic infiltrate. apoptosis, as detected by both the immunohistochemical staining of apoptosis-related proteins and in situ labeling of internucleosomally degraded dna, was common in atherosclerotic plaques. immunostainings for c pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus-1, p gingivalis, and s sanguis  were positive in the carotid plaques. from 1 to 4 organisms were found in the same specimen. the micro-organisms were immunolocalized in plaque shoulders and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, associated with ulcer and thrombus formation, and adjacent to areas of strong labeling for apoptotic bodies. conclusions: our data  provide evidence that multiple infectious agents may be found in atherosclerotic  plaques, and sometimes in the same specimen. the current study is the first to report the detection of 2 major odontopathogens, p gingivalis and s sanguis, in atherosclerotic plaques. the immunolocalization of these micro-organisms within unstable plaque regions and their association with plaque ulceration, thrombosis, and apoptosis in vascular cells are intriguing. multiple infectious agents may alter vascular cell function and provide a "trigger" for acute ischemic stroke events. further evidence from human studies and animal models will be needed.

TI  == bacterial species- and strain-dependent induction of tissue factor in human vascular endothelial cells.
AB  == a cardinal process in bacterial endocarditis (be) is the activation of the clotting system and the formation of a fibrin clot on the inner surface of the heart, the so-called endocardial vegetation. the processes that lead to the activation of the clotting system on endothelial surfaces upon exposure to bacteria are largely unknown. in the present study, we investigated in an in vitro model whether infection of human endothelial cells (ec) with bacteria that  are relevant to be, such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus sanguis, and staphylococcus epidermidis, leads to induction of tissue factor (tf)-dependent procoagulant activity (tfa) and whether this process is influenced by host factors, such as interleukin-1 (il-1), that are produced in response to the bacteremia in vivo. the results show that s. aureus binds to and is internalized  by ec, resulting in expression of tf mrna and tf surface protein as well as generation of tfa within 4 to 8 h after infection. no tfa was found when ec were  exposed to uv-irradiated s. aureus or bacterial cell wall fragments. s. sanguis and s. epidermidis, although also binding to ec, did not induce endothelial tfa.  this indicates a species and strain dependency. ec also expressed tfa after exposure to il-1. the enhanced tfa of ec after exposure to s. aureus was not prevented by il-1 receptor antagonist, arguing against an auto- or paracrine contribution of endogenous il-1. when il-1 was applied together with bacteria, this had a synergistic effect on the induction of ec tfa. this was found in particular with s. aureus but also, although to a lesser degree, with s. sanguis  and s. epidermidis. this influence of il-1 on the species- and strain-dependent induction of ec tfa suggests that bacterial factors as well as host factors orchestrate the induction of coagulation in an early stage in the pathogenesis of endovascular disease, such as be.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  == thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. all 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent  extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection)  with free flap reconstruction. a total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial translocation was found more  often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional  lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). as the gingival carcinoma group includes more t4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved  nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. oral streptococci (streptococcus intermedius, strep. constellatus, strep. oralis, strep. mitis, strep. sanguis, strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. aerobic enteric bacteria (enterococcus, escherichia, klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. among the anaerobic bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer  might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain  the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.

(12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == inhibitory effects of oolong tea extract on caries-inducing properties of mutans  streptococci.
AB  == the inhibitory effects of oolong tea extract (ote) on the caries-inducing properties of mutans streptococci were examined in vitro. ote reduced the rate of acid production by mutans streptococci accompanied with the retardation of growth rate of mutans streptococci, while the action by chromatographically isolated oolong tea polyphenol (otf6) was weak. on the other hand, both oolong tea products decreased cell surface hydrophobicity of almost all the oral streptococci examined in the present study, and also induced cellular aggregation of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus gordonii. in these reactions, otf6 showed a more pronounced activity than ote. furthermore, the oolong tea products inhibited the adherence of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. these results suggest that otf6 may inhibit bacterial adherence to the tooth surfaces by reducing the hydrophobicity of mutans streptococci, and ote may inhibit caries-inducing activity of mutans streptococci by reducing the rate of acid production.

TI  == spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci: three cases and a review of the literature.
AB  == three cases of spondylodiscitis caused by viridans streptococci were observed within the course of 1 month. although streptococci have been reported as the third most frequent cause of spondylodiscitis after staphylococci and gram-negative bacteria, alpha-haemolytic streptococci are rarely seen. the three  patients presented with symptoms of low back pain; they felt well and did not have a fever or chills. laboratory examinations revealed inflammation. further examinations such as scintigraphy, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were done. bacteriological diagnosis was established by blood cultures in two cases and by needle biopsy of the disco-vertebral space in one. in one patient endocarditis was also documented. because the prevalence of endocarditis  was found to be higher in our cases of spondylodiscitis due to streptococcus viridans than for other bacteria, the exclusion of this diagnosis must be pursued aggressively. these observations lead us to question if the spectrum of bacteria  causing spondylodiscitis is undergoing a change. an aetiological agent could be isolated in 1168 patients (85.4%): in 48% a staphylococcus, in 28% a gram-negative bacterium and in only 10% a streptococcus. there were two cases of  viridans streptococci (0.2%). these two cases together with other single case reports [14-22] account for 15 cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic  streptococci. differentiation of the organisms to the species level was accomplished in six cases: s. mitis (3), s. sanguis (2) and s. anginosus (1). although a multitude of organisms, bacterial as well as fungal, causing spondylodiscitis has been reported in recent years, almost all were single cases  [23-42]. the unusual observation of three cases of spondylodiscitis due to alpha-haemolytic streptococci within 1 month prompted us to review the clinical and laboratory findings and to compare these cases with those caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == automatic enumeration of adherent streptococci or actinomyces on dental alloy by  fluorescence image analysis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to develop an automated image analysis method to quantify adherence of streptococcus sanguinis or actinomyces viscosus on surfaces of a currently used dental alloy. counting such bacterial strains was difficult because of their arrangement, thus s. sanguinis being a coccus arranged in chains or pairs, and a. viscosus a long complexly arranged polymorph rod. direct counting of fluorescently stained adherent bacteria was done visually and with image analysis methods. to differentiate these two morphotypes, two programs were developed: (i) for streptococci, thresholding and selection of the object maxima, and (ii) for actinomyces, two step thresholding and processing of the characteristic points of the object skeletons. the triplicate enumerations for each bacterial strain were not significantly different (p > 0.005) and correlations between visual counting and automated counting were significant (r = 0.91 for s. sanguinis and r = 0.99 for a. viscosus, p <00.0001). these rapid and  reproducible methods, allowed us to count either cocci or rods, adherent on an inert substratum, in high density conditions.

AB  == adhesive interactions between candida albicans and oral bacteria are generally thought to play a crucial role in the microbial colonization of denture acrylic,  which may lead to denture stomatitis. this study investigated the influence of saliva on the adhesive interactions between c. albicans and streptococcus sanguis or actinomyces naeslundii on denture acrylic. first, bacteria were allowed to adhere to the acrylic surface from a flowing suspension, and subsequently yeasts  were flowed over the acrylic surface. the organisms were assayed in the presence  or absence of human whole saliva. all experiments were carried out in a parallel  plate flow chamber and enumeration was done in situ with an image analysis system. in the absence of adhering bacteria, adhesion of c. albicans from buffer  was more extensive than from saliva. however, in the presence of adhering bacteria, yeast adhesion from saliva was increased with respect to adhesion of yeasts from buffer, indicating that specific salivary components constitute a bridge between bacteria and yeasts. in all cases, yeast aggregates consisting of  3 to 5 yeast cells were observed adhering to the surface. a surface physico-chemical analysis of the microbial cell surfaces prior to and after bathing the microorganisms in saliva, suggests that this bridging is mediated by  acid-base interactions since all strains show a major increase in electron-donating surface free energy parameters upon bathing in saliva, with no  change in their zeta potentials. the surface physico-chemical analysis furthermore suggests that s. sanguis and a. naeslundii may use a different mechanism for adhesive interactions with c. albicans in saliva.

TI  == in vitro activities of fluoroquinolones against antibiotic-resistant blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci from across canada.
AB  == among 418 blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci obtained between  1995 and 1997, the in vitro rates of nonsusceptibility to penicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were 28, 29, 24, and 14%, respectively. the most prevalent group (125 strains) was streptococcus mitis, followed by streptococcus sanguis (56 strains). for 236 (56%) strains resistant to one or more antibiotics, the ciprofloxacin mic at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic(90)) was 4 microg/ml, whereas the mic(90)s of trovafloxacin, grepafloxacin, and gatifloxacin were 0.25 microg/ml.

AB  == the proportion of vital as compared with dead streptococcus sanguinis cells attached to glass surfaces was monitored and related to varying proportions of planktonic vital as compared with dead strep. sanguinis cells. in a flow chamber  with six parallel-mounted glass plates, strep. sanguinis was suspended in pretreated sterile human saliva. deposition of strep. sanguinis took place, with  a proportion of vital sanguinis streptococci in saliva (%vss) of 90%, 45% or 22.5%. after exposure times of 30, 60, 90, 120 and 240 min, adherent microorganisms were labelled with two fluorescence stains to differentiate between vital and dead bacteria. proportions of vital attached streptococci (%vsa) were determined microscopically. dead bacteria were detected on all glass  plates. the %vsa at 30 min and 60 min was significantly lower than the baseline %vss. during the course of a single run the %vsa frequently increased after either 30, 60 or 90 min without exceeding the %vss at 4 h. %vss was the only variable exerting a significant effect on %vsa at 30 and 60 min. it is suggested  that during the initial events of microbial attachment the dead rather than vital strep. sanguinis cells attach preferably to solid surfaces.

TI  == antiphosphorylcholine antibody levels are elevated in humans with periodontal diseases.
AB  == human immunoglobulin g2 (igg2) serum concentrations and the igg2 antibody response to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans can be influenced by genes, by environmental factors such as smoking, and by periodontal disease status. examination of the igg2 response to phosphorylcholine (pc), a response thought to be mainly induced by the c polysaccharide of streptococcus pneumoniae, suggested  that periodontal disease status was also associated with this response. this prompted the hypothesis that pc is an important oral antigen associated with organisms in the periodontal flora and that anti-pc antibody is elevated as a consequence of periodontal disease. subjects in various periodontal disease diagnostic categories in which attachment loss is exhibited were tested for anti-pc in serum. those with adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis, generalized early-onset periodontitis, and gingival recession all  had similar levels of anti-pc igg2 serum antibody which were significantly greater than in the group of subjects with no attachment loss. analysis of plaque samples from subgingival and supragingival sites in all diseases categories for reactivity with the anti-pc specific monoclonal antibody tepc-15 revealed that a  substantial proportion of the bacteria in dental plaque (30 to 40%) bear pc antigen; this antigen was not restricted to morphotypes resembling only cocci but was also present on rods and branched filamentous organisms. we found that s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. sanguis, as well as oral actinomycetes, including a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii, incorporated substantial amounts of  [(3)h]choline from culture media. further analysis of antigens derived from these organisms by western blot indicated that s. oralis, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. odontolyticus, and a. israelii contained tepc-15-reactive antigens. the data show that many commonly occurring bacterial species found in dental plaque contain pc  antigen and that immunization with plaque-derived pc antigens as a consequence of inflammation and periodontal attachment loss may influence systemic anti-pc antibody concentrations.

TI  == cure of implantable venous port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients without catheter removal.
AB  == the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of port-associated bloodstream infection without device removal has not been systematically studied. we analyzed the outcome of 43 consecutive port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients. etiologies included staphylococcus epidermidis (30) and staphylococcus aureus (6). antibiotics were given through the port for a median of 11 days. four ports were removed within 72 hours. in 36 (92%) of the remaining 39 episodes, there was a response to antibiotic therapy (defervescence  and negative blood culture). in 78% of episodes in which there was a response (excluding two in which the catheters were removed because of mechanical problems), the infections were cured without port removal. two of the four relapses were cured with a second course of antibiotics. the cure rate was 92% for s. epidermidis infections and 67% for s. aureus infections. thus, the majority of port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients can be cured without device removal.

TI  == polymicrobial etiology of dental caries.
AB  == the present study was carried out to establish the normal bacterial oral flora and the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora from deep seated dental caries, and to determine the antimicrobial sensitivity of the clinical isolates so obtained streptococcus mutans (48%) and streptococcus sanguis (20%) were the main aerobic  isolates whereas lactobacillus spp. (52%), veillonella spp. (24%) and actinomyces spp. (12%) were the major anaerobic isolates. hundred percent of the samples from dental caries yielded polymicrobial isolates while in two samples from healthy individuals s. mutans was the sole isolate. as the flora changed from healthy tooth to dental caries it changed from one predominated by anaerobic gram-positive cocci to anaerobic gram-positive bacilli. all the anaerobes isolated were sensitive to metronidazole and cefotaxime, whereas all the isolated streptococci were sensitive to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin. incorporation of the antibiotics in baseline restoration, if technically feasible, has been advocated.

TI  == effect of oleanolic acid-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds on dental caries by in  vitro experiment and rat-caries model.
AB  == earlier work in vitro showed that oleanolic acid (oa) was a potential inhibitor of insoluble glucan (isg) synthesis from mutans streptococci (ms). in this study, two oleanolic acid-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds (oa-cds), oleanolic acid-g1-beta-cyclodextrin (oa-g1-beta cd) and oleanolic acid-beta-cyclodextrin (oa-beta cd), were assayed for their effects on isg synthesis from streptococcus  mutans mt8148r, and on the growth of oral bacteria. oa-beta cd inhibited isg synthesis by 55.3 and 37.4% at 62.5 and 15.6 micrograms/ml of oa, respectively. both oa-cds inhibited the growth of ms, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius at 4 to 8 micrograms/ml of oa. the anticariogenic effect of the oa-beta cd was examined in  a rat-caries model. rats in the infected control groups showed the highest caries score. the infected treatment group b (0.5% oa in diet) showed lower scores than  the control group. these results suggest that oa-beta cd is a potential anti-caries agent.

AB  == transfer of fluoroquinolone (fq) resistance determinants between streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans streptococci was explored by transformation in vitro. one-step fq-resistant parc mutants were selected, and resistance could be transferred from dna from s. oralis, s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. constellatus to s. pneumoniae, with frequencies of 10(-3) to <10(-7) in correlation with the homologies of their quinolone resistance determining region sequences (95%, 91%,  85%, and 81%, respectively). reciprocal transfers of mutated parc from dna from s. pneumoniae to s. mitis and s. oralis were also observed. simultaneous transfer of mutated parc and gyra genes from s. mitis to s. pneumoniae yielded high-level-resistant pneumococcal transformants in one step at low frequencies. the pare-parc region of the type strain s. mitis 103335t had >90% homology with that of s. pneumoniae. the efficient interspecific transfer of quinolone resistance determinants in vitro leads us to anticipate their dissemination in the clinical setting.

TI  == increased interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by tonsillar mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha-streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris.
AB  == in vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interleukin (il)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of il-1alpha and il-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but il-4 and il-5 were not detected in  any supernatants from 21 donors tested. in 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from streptococcus, (s.) sanguis, s. salivarius and s. mitis induced production of il-6. ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. however, no  significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen  in 13 donors without ppp. no significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the ppp and non-ppp subjects, when stimulated with s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus cowan i and pokeweed mitogen.  in the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in  purified t-cells. but not in b-cells. these data suggest that il-6, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through  increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which t-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ppp.

TI  == the effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  == susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. we investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. in a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a  continuous culture system comprised of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/ml of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. for ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. in both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.

TI  == emergence of antibiotic resistant streptococcus sanguis in dental plaque of children after frequent antibiotic therapy.
AB  == purpose: in the pediatric population, several different antibiotic regimens are currently recommended for the treatment of otitis media. this study investigated  whether therapy for otitis media was associated with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant oral bacteria. methods: streptococcus sanguis (s. sanguis) was isolated from supragingival dental plaque of children after a recent course of antibiotic. the isolated strains were tested for resistance to penicillin, amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin and compared to isolated strains from age- and sex-matched control subjects, who had received no  antibiotics within two years before sampling. results: while control subjects harbored no resistant strains of s. sanguis, about 60% of children who had received antibiotics harbored s. sanguis which were resistant to at least one of  the tested antibiotics. nearly half of these strains were resistant to two or more antibiotics. resistance to penicillin and amoxicillin decreased with the age of the child and with the length of time since exposure to the antibiotic. however, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or erythromycin showed no relationship to the age of the child or the length of time since exposure to the  antibiotic. conclusion: the data show that children who had been treated for otitis media with common antibiotic protocols do harbor antibiotic-resistant oral streptococci which may complicate prophylactic and therapeutic regimens for bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == infective endocarditis: an epidemiological review of 128 episodes.
AB  == objectives: the objective was to determine the current epidemiology of infective  endocarditis. patients and methods: all microbiologically positive episodes of infective endocarditis treated at the university hospital of wales over a 9-year  period from march 1987 to march 1996 was reviewed. patients originated from the catchment area of the university hospital of wales or were referred from other hospitals in wales. data extraction was from records held in the microbiology department and, whenever possible, from patients' casenotes. the epidemiological  parameters were: (1) age and sex of patients; (2) distribution of affected sites; (3) frequency of predisposing risk factors (cardiac and extracardiac); (4) incidence of early prosthetic valve endocarditis; and (5) mortality rates. results: there were 128 microbiologically positive episodes of endocarditis in 125 patients. the mean age of the population was 53.1 years and the aortic valve  was the most frequently involved site of infection (51.6%). a presumed source of  infection was identified in 20% if episodes. the commonest predisposing cardiac risk factor in native valve episodes was bicuspid aortic valve (16.7%) but there  was no identifiable cardiac risk factor in a much larger proportion (37.7%) of native valve episodes. there was a low incidence (0.6%) of culture positive early prosthetic valve episodes and low mortality rates for both native and prosthetic  valve endocarditis (12.3% and 24.5%) in this study. viridans streptococci were the predominant organisms. in prosthetic valve episodes with onset after the 60th postoperative day but within one postoperative year the identity of the isolate suggested, in most cases, perioperative valve contamination. conclusions: the epidemiology of infective endocarditis has undergone significant change. inability to detect clinically common predisposing lesions, and the frequent absence of any identifiable predisposing cardiac risk factor mean that initial diagnosis is often difficult and demands a high index of suspicion. there was a low incidence of culture positive early prosthetic valve episodes and there were  low mortality rates for both native and prosthetic valve endocarditis; these figures suggest improvements in cardiac care. the microbiological evidence indicates that the duration of the postoperative time period used for classifying prosthetic valve endocarditis into 'early' and 'late' episodes should be extended from 60 days to 1 year.

TI  == effects of hydrogen peroxide on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == in this study we first evaluated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) on growth and selected properties of porphyromonas gingivalis, and compared them with those obtained by a reducing agent (cysteine). the growth of p. gingivalis was only moderately affected when h2o2 was added at concentrations up to 30 mm in a complex culture medium. however, when a defined basal medium was used, h2o2 at  a concentration of 3 mm completely inhibited growth of p. gingivalis. incorporation of cysteine at concentrations up to 30 mm in both media had no effect on growth. the effects of h2o2 and cysteine on cell-associated hemagglutinating and arg-gingipain activities were evaluated using bacteria grown in the complex culture medium. both activities were strongly decreased when h2o2  was added in the assay mixtures. this inhibitory effect of h2o2 was reversible. on the other hand, including cysteine in the assay mixtures increased both activities. h2o2 and cysteine had no effect on the expression of heat shock protein (hsp)-68 and hsp-75 by p. gingivalis, as determined by sds-page and western immunoblotting analysis. in the second part of the study, we tested whether growth of selected oral bacterial species may modify the oxidation-reduction potential (eh) of the environment. it was found that certain  species were able to either decrease (p. gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus mutans) or increase (streptococcus sanguis) the eh of the medium. our study provides evidence that an oxidizing agent such as h2o2 may affect the biology of p. gingivalis. moreover, growth of some members of the oral microflora can generate oxidizing and reducing conditions, and thus potentially influence the ecology of subgingival sites by affecting strictly anaerobic bacteria such as p. gingivalis.

TI  == cell wall-anchored csha polypeptide (259 kilodaltons) in streptococcus gordonii forms surface fibrils that confer hydrophobic and adhesive properties.
AB  == it has been shown previously that inactivation of the csha gene, encoding a major cell surface polypeptide (259 kda) in the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii,  generates mutants that are markedly reduced in hydrophobicity, deficient in binding to oral actinomyces species and to human fibronectin, and unable to colonize the oral cavities of mice. we now show further that surface fibrils 60.7 +/- 14.5 nm long, which are present on wild-type s. gordonii dl1 (challis) cells, bind csha-specific antibodies and are absent from the cell surfaces of csha mutants. to more precisely determine the structural and functional properties of  csha, already inferred from insertional-mutagenesis experiments, we have cloned the entire csha gene into the replicative plasmid pam401 and expressed full-length csha polypeptide on the cell surface of heterologous enterococcus faecalis jh2-2. enterococci expressing csha exhibited a 30-fold increase in cell  surface hydrophobicity over e. faecalis jh2-2 carrying the pam401 vector alone and 2.4-fold-increased adhesion to human fibronectin. csha expression in e. faecalis also promoted cell-cell aggregation and increased the ability of enterococci to bind actinomyces naeslundii cells. electron micrographs of negatively stained e. faecalis cells expressing csha showed peritrichous surface  fibrils 70.3 +/- 9.1 nm long that were absent from control e. faecalis jh2-2(pam401) cells. the fibrils bound csha-specific antibodies, as detected by immunoelectron microscopy, and the antibodies inhibited the adhesion of e. faecalis cells to fibronectin. the results demonstrate that the csha polypeptide  is the structural and functional component of s. gordonii adhesive fibrils, and they provide a molecular basis for past correlations of surface fibril production, cell surface hydrophobicity, and adhesion in species of oral "sanguis-like" streptococci.

TI  == primary bacterial colonization of implant surfaces.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of modifying titanium surfaces, in terms of wettability, roughness, and mode of sterilization, on the ability of the oral bacterium streptococcus sanguis to colonize. an in vitro model system was developed. all surfaces were colonized by the bacteria, but to significantly different levels. titanium samples that exhibited rough or hydrophobic (low wettability) surfaces, along with all autoclaved surfaces, were  preferentially colonized (p < .01). titanium surfaces that had been repeatedly autoclaved were colonized with the levels of bacteria 3 to 4 orders of magnitude  higher than other modes of sterilization. this may have implications relative to  the commonly used method of autoclaving titanium implants, which may ultimately enhance bacterial biofilm formation on these surfaces.

TI  == acid-induced acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci.
AB  == acid tolerance and acidogenicity of non-mutans streptococci and their capacity of acid adaptation were studied. the cells of non-mutans streptococci (streptococcus sanguis [streptococcus sanguinis], streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mitis) grown at ph 7.0 showed 0.0088% to 71% viability after acidification at ph 4.0 for 60 min, whereas the cells of mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans) were not killed by the acidification. washed cells of non-mutans streptococci lowered ph to 4.04-4.33 in the presence of glucose, while mutans streptococci cells lowered ph to 3.70. when the growth ph was shifted to 5.5 for 30-90 min, the viability of non-mutans streptococci after the acidification at ph 4.0 for 60 min increased (0.25% to 91%) and the minimum ph values of the cells in the presence of glucose decreased (3.90 4.19). along with  the increase in acid tolerance and acidogenicity, non-mutans streptococci increased activities of h(+)-atpase and arginine deiminase and amounts of stress  proteins cross-reacting with 60 kda and 70 kda heat shock proteins (hsp60 and hsp70). these results indicate that non-mutans streptococci were capable of increasing their acid tolerance and acidogenicity in response to environmental acidification. furthermore, it is suggested that the acid adaptation observed in  non-mutans streptococci cells could involve the induction of h(+)-atpase, arginine deiminase and stress protein syntheses. the strains of non-mutans streptococci, which are pioneer bacteria for dental plaque formation and predominant in plaque microbial flora, may play a significant role in shifting the dental plaque environment toward acidic and consequently promoting the colonization of more acid-tolerant and acidogenic bacteria such as mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.

TI  == cumulative correlations of lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase, s-iga, amylase, and total protein concentrations with adherence of oral viridans streptococci to microplates coated with human saliva.
AB  == redundancy refers to the observation that many salivary proteins exhibit similar  properties in vitro. it is possible that bacterial adherence to salivary pellicle occurs as a cumulative effect of multiple proteins. this study determined the joint and individual contributions of salivary amylase, s-iga, lysozyme, salivary peroxidase, lactoferrin, and total protein concentrations to adherence by oral viridans streptococci in microplates coated with whole saliva from 123 persons. strains used were: streptococcus gordonii blackburn, 10558, streptococcus mitis 10712, 903, streptococcus oralis 10557, 9811, and streptococcus sanguis 10556, 13379. rabbit antibody against 13379 was used for the detection of adherence. this antibody cross-reacted with all strains. absorbance was standardized against saliva pooled from five donors. all saliva samples had been previously assayed for amylase, lactoferrin, lysozyme, secretory iga, peroxidase, and total protein. adherence scores for all strains except 13379 were significantly and positively correlated. salivas binding high or low levels of one strain tended to bind others correspondingly. multiple regression indicated significant contributions to 10558 adherence from total protein and lactoferrin (positive), and peroxidase  and lysozyme (negative). similar results were obtained for blackburn and 903. significant individual correlations were seen for 9811 and total protein (positive), 10557 and peroxidase (negative), and 13379 and lactoferrin (negative). salivas with high adherence scores contained significantly more protein and lactoferrin, and significantly less peroxidase, than salivas with low adherence scores. these findings support the hypothesis that multiple proteins contribute to the adherence of streptococcal strains in vivo.

AB  == it was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  n-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. the ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. when saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with n-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. growth in n-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. no effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. in contrast to what observed with s. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. these results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting s. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.

TI  == the importance of fimbriae in the virulence and ecology of some oral bacteria.
AB  == cumulative evidence indicates that bacterial adherence to mucosal and tooth surfaces as well as bacterial coaggregation are essential steps for colonization  of various oral bacterial species. bacterial fimbriae have been shown to play an  important role in the interaction between bacteria and host cells or among bacterial cells. the properties of fimbriae from selected species of oral bacteria are discussed in terms of virulence traits and ecological significance.  among others, porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae have been most extensively studied. the fimbrial structure is composed of 41-kda fimbrillin proteins. dna sequencing of the fimbrillin gene (fima) from nine strains of p. gingivalis suggests intraspecies variation in the structure of fima, while retaining common  immunochemical specificities. p. gingivalis fimbriae exhibit a wide variety of biological activities including immunogenicity, binding to various host proteins, stimulation of cytokine production and promotion of bone resorption, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans also possesses fimbriae; however, little is  known concerning their chemical, genetical, and biological properties. fimbriae of prevotella intermedia are shown to induce hemagglutination reaction, while those of prevotella loescheii are found to cause coaggregation with other bacteria, i.e., actinomyces viscosus and sanguis streptococci. fimbriae from gram-positive oral bacteria such as oral actinomyces and sanguis streptococci are described. these fimbriae may participate in coaggregation, binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite or glycoprotein of the surface layer of oral epithelial cells. taken together, fimbriae are key components in cell-to-surface  and cell-to-cell adherence of oral bacteria and pathogenesis of some oral and systemic diseases.

TI  == lipoteichoic acid acts as an antagonist and an agonist of lipopolysaccharide on human gingival fibroblasts and monocytes in a cd14-dependent manner.
AB  == cd14 has been implicated as a receptor of lipoteichoic acid (lta) and other bacterial components as well as lipopolysaccharide (lps). since the structures of ltas from various gram-positive bacteria are heterogeneous, we analyzed the effects of ltas on the secretion of interleukin-8 (il-8) by high- and low-cd14-expressing (cd14(high) and cd14(low)) human gingival fibroblasts (hgf).  while bacillus subtilis lta had an il-8-inducing effect on cd14(high) hgf which was considerably weaker than that of lps, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans ltas had practically no effect on the cells. b. subtilis lta had only a weak effect on cd14(low) hgf, as did lps. s. sanguis and s. mutans ltas at a 1,000-fold excess each completely inhibited the il-8-inducing activities of both  lps and a synthetic lipid a on cd14(high) hgf. the effect of lps was also inhibited by the presence of an lps antagonist, synthetic lipid a precursor iva (la-14-pp), with a 100-fold higher potency than s. sanguis and s. mutans ltas and by anti-cd14 monoclonal antibody (mab). s. sanguis and s. mutans ltas, la-14-pp,  and anti-cd14 mab had no significant effect on phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated il-8 secretion by hgf. these ltas also inhibited the il-8-inducing activity of b. subtilis lta on cd14(high) hgf, as did la-14-pp and  anti-cd14 mab. the antagonistic and agonistic functions of ltas were also observed with human monocytes. binding of fluorolabeled lps to human monocytes was inhibited by s. sanguis lta, although the inhibition was 100 times weaker than that of lps itself, and anti-cd14 mab inhibited fluorolabeled lps and s. sanguis lta binding. binding of ltas to cd14 was also observed with nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results indicate that ltas act as antagonists or agonists via a cd14-dependent mechanism, probably due to the heterogeneous structure of ltas, and that an antagonistic lta might be a useful agent for suppressing the periodontal disease caused by gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == disinfection of the optical fibre of a nd-yap laser used in dental care.
AB  == in order to set up a disinfection protocol, the tip of the optical fibre of an nd-yap laser, lambda=1.34 mum, was contaminated in vitro with: mycobacterium smegmatis (cip 7326), candida albicans (atcc 2091), bacillus stearothermophilus (atcc 7953) or streptococcus sanguis (atcc 10556). it was then treated with various biocidal solutions, septinol((r)) v, glutaraldehyde 2%, ethanol 95 degrees and naocl 6%, using one of two protocols: 10 s of contact, or 5 s of contact followed by 5 s of wiping. the latter technique proved to be the most effective. whatever the biocidal solution used, all the bacteria adhering to the  fibre were eliminated. the protocol was checked in vivo in the canals of 10 teeth presenting root canal infections. no bacteria withstood the treatment with septinol((r)) v. this treatment does not alter the qualities and performance of the fibre as far as light transmission is concerned.

TI  == turning on and turning off the arginine deiminase system in oral streptococci.
AB  == the arginine deiminase system in oral streptococci is highly regulated. it requires induction and is repressed by catabolites such as glucose or by aeration. a comparative study of regulation of the system in streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558, streptococcus rattus fa-1, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 showed an increase in activity of the system in s. sanguis of some 1467-fold associated with induction-depression of cells previously uninduced-repressed. the activity of the system was assayed in terms of levels of arginine deiminase, the signature enzyme of the system, in permeabilized cells. increases in enzyme levels associated with induction-depression were less for the other two organisms, mainly because of less severe repression, especially for s.  rattus fa-1, which was the least sensitive to catabolite repression or aeration.  regulation of the arginine deiminase system involving induction and catabolite repression was demonstrated also with monoorganism biofilms composed of cells of  s. sanguis adherent to glass slides. fully uninduced-repressed cells from suspension cultures or biofilms were compromised in their abilities to catabolize arginine to protect themselves against acid damage. however, it was found that the system can be rapidly turned on or turned off, although induction-depression  did appear to require cell growth. still, the system could respond rapidly to the availability of arginine to reestablish high capacity for alkali production.

AB  == background and objective: the aim of this study was to assess co2 laser ability to eliminate bacteria from titanium implant surfaces. the changes of the surface  structure, the rise in temperature, and the damage of connective tissue cells after laser irradiation were also considered. study design/materials and methods: streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis on titanium discs were irradiated by an expanded beam of co2 laser. surface alteration was observed by a light, and a scanning electron, microscope. temperature was measured with a thermograph. damage of fibroblastic (l-929) and osteoblastic (mc3t3-e1) cells outside the irradiation spot and adhesion of the cells to the irradiated area were also estimated. results: all the organisms (10(8)) of s. sanguis and p. gingivalis were killed by the irradiation at 286 j/cm2 and 245 j/cm2, respectively. furthermore, laser irradiation did not cause surface alteration, rise of temperature, serious damage of connective tissue cells located outside the irradiation spot, or inhibition of cell adhesion to the irradiated area. conclusion: co2 laser irradiation with expanded beam may be useful in removing bacterial contaminants from implant surface.

TI  == structures of biologically active muramyl peptides from peptidoglycan of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the structures of major muramyl peptides derived from peptidoglycan of the oral pathogen streptococcus sanguis were determined and the biological activity of the peptides was tested in vitro on human monocytes. the muramyl peptides, produced by muramidase digestion of the purified peptidoglycan, were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, either in their native form or after reduction with sodium borohydride. chemical structures of the peptides were elucidated by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis, post-source decay analysis and edman sequencing. the study revealed two distinct  monomers: n-acetylglucosaminyl-n-acetylmuramyl-ala-igln-lys(ala-ala) (1), where the ala-ala is connected to the epsilon-amino group of lysine, and n-acetylglucosaminyl-n-acetylmuramyl-ala-igln-lys(ala-ala)-ala-ala (2), where an  additional dialanyl residue is attached to the lysine alpha-carboxyl group. two sets of higher oligomers (di-, tri- and tetramers), related structurally to monomers 1 or 2 were also detected. in these oligomers, the monomeric subunits are linked together by ala-ala-ala bridges. the native muramyl peptides primed human monocytes in vitro for the increased production of the microbicidal superoxide radical.

TI  == efficacy of trovafloxacin in treatment of experimental staphylococcal or streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == the efficacy of trovafloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and viridans group streptococci was investigated in vitro and in an experimental model of endocarditis. the mics at which trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin inhibited 90% of  clinical isolates of such bacteria (mic90s) were (i) 0.03 and 2 mg/liter, respectively, for 30 ciprofloxacin-susceptible s. aureus isolates, (ii) 32 and 128 mg/liter, respectively, for 20 ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus isolates, and (iii) 0.25 and 8 mg/liter, respectively, for 28 viridans group streptococci.  rats with aortic vegetations were infected with either of two ciprofloxacin-susceptible but methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains (strains col and p8), one penicillin-susceptible streptococcus sanguis strain, or one penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain. rats were treated for 3 or 5 days with doses that resulted in kinetics that simulated those achieved in humans with trovafloxacin (200 mg orally once a day), ciprofloxacin (750 mg orally twice a day), vancomycin (1 g intravenously twice a day), or ceftriaxone (2 g intravenously once a day). against the staphylococci, the activities of both trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equivalent to that of vancomycin, and treatment of endocarditis with these drugs was successful (p < 0.05). however, ciprofloxacin selected for resistant derivatives in vitro and in vivo, whereas trovafloxacin was 10 to 100 times less prone than ciprofloxacin to select for resistance in vitro and did not select for resistance in vivo. against the two streptococcal isolates, trovafloxacin significantly (p < 0.05) decreased bacterial counts in the vegetations but was less effective than the control drug, ceftriaxone. thus, a simulated oral dose of trovafloxacin (200 mg per day) was effective against ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylococci and was less likely than ciprofloxacin to select for resistance. the simulated oral dose of trovafloxacin also had some activity against streptococcal endocarditis, but optimal treatment of infections caused by such organisms might require higher doses of the drug.

TI  == construction and analysis of a streptococcus parasanguis reca mutant: homologous  recombination is not required for adhesion in an in vitro tooth surface model.
AB  == pcr was used to amplify an internal region of the reca gene from streptococcus parasanguis fw213. the pcr fragment was used as a probe to recover the entire streptococcal reca gene from an s. parasanguis genomic library, and the sequence  of the gene was determined. the deduced product of the s. parasanguis reca gene showed a high degree of amino acid identity with other prokaryotic reca proteins. the cloned reca sequence was disrupted in vitro by insertional mutagenesis, and the mutated allele was then introduced into the s. parasanguis chromosome by homologous recombination. results of southern hybridizations confirmed the replacement of the wild-type reca gene with the mutated allele. the reca mutant strain was considerably more sensitive to uv light than the parental strain, and  this phenotype was consistent with a mutation in reca. the s. parasanguis reca mutant showed no reduction in its ability to adhere in the in vitro tooth surface model, saliva-coated hydroxylapatite (sha), or in its ability to express the fimbria-associated adhesin fap1. these results demonstrate that in vitro attachment of s. parasanguis fw213 to sha and expression of fap1 are reca independent.

AB  == background and aims: the main bacterial species present in pulpal and periapical  microbic flora is alpha-hemolytic streptococci. they are regarded as facultative  anaerobes which prefer to grow in anaerobiosis. canal irrigation plays an important role in the success of endodontic treatment given that, on the one hand, it encourages the gradual elimination of the smear layer, and on the other  it neutralises microbic flora in the root canal. the aim of this study was to test the microbiological efficacy of sodium hypochlorite 1% and s new generation  irrigant based on chlorhexidine 0.2% and cetrimide 0.2%. methods: the test was performed on the following alpha-hemolytic streptococci bacteria (dasit, cornaredo, italy): streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. the working concentration (cfu/ml) was defined as 0.5 mc farland which corresponds to a concentration of microorganisms of approximately 1.5 x 10(8) bacteria. the following canal irrigants were used: 1) cetrimide 0.2% + chlorhexidine 0.2% (cetrexidin vebas, s. giuliano milanese, italy); 2) naocl 1% (ogna, milan, italy). each individual substance remained in contact with the bacterial species  used in the test for 10'-20'-30'. results: the results obtained show the bactericidal efficacy of both the irrigants used, even after a short period of contact. conclusions: this does not mean that all irrigants are equal and/or promise the same results. this was a microbiological study, but it is nonetheless important to take other variables into account, such as contact time. moreover, in order to increase the probabilities for the success of endodontic treatment, canal irrigants must also present other characteristics, namely: biocompatibility, scarce toxicity, high proteolytic power.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

AB  == twenty isolates resembling viridans streptococci, 16 from blood and four from gastric aspirates, from 17 cases of early onset neonatal sepsis were identified by the api20 strep, rapid id 32 strep and conventional tests plus hydrolysis of methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrates. nineteen of the isolates were identified as species of viridans streptococci and one as a leuconostoc sp. ten of the isolates were streptococcus oralis, three s. mitis biotype 1, two s. mitis biotype 2 and one each of s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius and s. intermedius. the rapid id 32 strep and conventional plus methylumbelliferyl tests gave the same species identity for 17 of the isolates. s. intermedius was identified by the rapid id 32 strep as s. constellatus and s. salivarius as s. equinus, with s. salivarius at lower probability. the api20 strep failed to identify s. vestibularis and identified s. salivarius as s. defectivus. the absence of certain critical tests, including urea hydrolysis, does not allow the  api20 strep to identify all the currently recognised species of viridans steptococci. the species distribution was unexpected and the incidence of s. oralis and other viridans streptococci in vaginal swabs from prenatal patients is being investigated further.

TI  == proliferative response of cd8+ gamma delta+ t cells to streptococcus sanguis in patients with behcet's disease.
AB  == to analyze the pathogenesis of behcet's disease (bd), we investigated the immune  response of peripheral blood t cell subsets from patients with bd to streptococcus sanguis (s. sanguis) strain kth-i, a bacteria suggested to be associated with the etiology of bd. cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) of patients with bd activated by lyophilized whole bacterium of s. sanguis were assayed by two-color flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies (mabs) specific for gamma delta+ t cell receptor, cd4 or cd8 molecules. the lymphostimulatory activity of s. sanguis to either gamma delta+ cd4-cd8-, gamma delta+ cd4-cd8+, gamma delta-cd4+cd8-, or gamma delta-cd4-cd8+ t cells was evaluated. the absolute number of gamma delta+ t cells from patients with bd (n = 8) as well as from healthy controls (n = 7) significantly increased after stimulation with s. sanguis, whereas gamma delta- t cells from both groups showed no response to s. sanguis. the absolute number of gamma delta+ cd8+ t cells from  patients with bd significantly increased after stimulation with s. sanguis compared with healthy controls (p < 0.05). peripheral gamma delta+ cd8+ t cells from patients with bd showed a significantly higher proliferative response to s.  sanguis compared with healthy controls.

TI  == a streptococcal adhesion system for salivary pellicle and platelets.
AB  == a streptococcus sanguis 133-79 adhesin identified by the monoclonal antibody 1.1  (mab 1.1) binds both saliva-coated hydroxylapatite (sha) and platelets. the complementary binding site(s) for the adhesin was identified by the anti-idiotypical mab 2.1. to learn if this adhesion system, marked by the antiadhesin mab 1.1 and anti-binding site mab 2.1, is commonly used by strains within the sanguis group and other viridans group streptococci, 42 strains from seven species were tested. strains that bind to both sha and platelets use the same adhesin and binding site epitopes. strains that do not adhere to platelets rely on other adhesin specificities to bind to sha.

TI  == composition of pellicles formed in vivo on tooth surfaces in different parts of the dentition, and in vitro on hydroxyapatite.
AB  == saliva from the major salivary glands dominates different areas of the mouth. the parotid (ps) and submandibular/sublingual (sms) saliva differ in their protein composition, and thus, the composition of pellicles formed in various parts of the dentition might vary. in this study, proteins incorporated in 60-min pellicles from the premolar and front regions of the mouths of 4 subjects were examined using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using antibodies to amylase, albumin, iga, parotid saliva agglutinin, low molecular weight sms mucin (mg2) and proline-rich proteins. pellicles formed in vitro on hydroxyapatite using ps, sms and whole saliva from the subjects were examined in a similar manner. the pellicles formed in vitro and in vivo showed a major difference in the appearance of albumin. bands of albumin  were clearly stained in the samples of in vivo pellicles but were not observed or hardly visible in western blots from the experimental, in vitro pellicles. the sites in the dentition from which a specific protein was recovered could differ between the 4 individuals. the overall protein pattern of the pellicles showed, however, characteristics typical of the saliva which may prevail in the part of the mouth where the pellicles were formed. thus, parotid saliva agglutinin, a receptor for streptococcus mutans, was primarily found in the premolar part of the dentition. the mucin mg2, which may mediate the adherence of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis, was in no case clearly seen in pellicles from the premolar region of the upper jaw. the observed variations might be important  to the establishment of microflora and tooth-related disease patterns in various  parts of the dentition.

TI  == dental plaque, platelets, and cardiovascular diseases.
AB  == cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and myocardial ischemia, occur as a result of a complex set of genetic and environmental factors. during periodontitis, dental plaque microorganisms may disseminate through the blood to  infect the vascular endothelium and contribute to the occurrence of atherosclerosis and risk of myocardial ischemia and infarction. myocardial ischemia and infarction are often preceded by acute thromboembolic events. in an  in vitro model of thrombosis, certain dental plaque bacteria induce platelets to  aggregate. aggregation of platelets is induced by the platelet aggregation-associated protein [paapj expressed on plaque bacteria, including streptococcus sanguis and porphyromonas gingivalis. intravenous infusion of s. sanguis into rabbits has been shown previously to cause changes in the electrocardiogram (ecg), heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility. these changes are consistent with the occurrence of myocardial infarction. the ecg changes are now shown to begin within 30 seconds after infusion of paap+ s. sanguis, followed by alterations in blood pressure and respiratory rate. these changes occurred intermittently over a 30-minute period and changed within one heartbeat to a normal pattern and suddenly back to abnormal. intermittent ecg abnormalities were seen in 13 of 15 rabbits, including left axis deviation, st-segment depression, preventricular contractions, alternans, and bigemnia. dose-dependent thrombocytopenia, accumulation of 111indium-labeled platelets in the lungs, and tachypnea also occurred. no changes occurred with the paap- strain. the data indicated that papp+ s. sanguis interacts with circulating platelets, inducing thromboemboli to cause the pulmonary and cardiac abnormalities. during periodontitis, therefore, paap+ s. sanguis and p. gingivalis bacteremia may contribute to the chance of acute thromboembolic events.

TI  == antibacterial temporary filling materials: the effect of adding various ratios of ag-zn-zeolite.
AB  == the effect of a new type of antibacterial temporary filling material was evaluated. ag-zn-zeolite (bactekiller, kanebo, japan) and sio2 filler were incorporated into urethane acrylate monomer paste in amounts of 5/55, 10/50, 20/40 and 30/30 wt%, respectively. the present study was designed to use a dye penetration test to measure direct inhibition of bacterial growth of four oral bacteria (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis). the amounts of silver and zinc ions released from these materials were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the results indicated that the occurrence of marginal leakage was low in all of these materials. these materials exhibited prominent in-vitro antibacterial activity against s. mutans and s. mitis. the ag-zn-zeolite in these materials was able to  release very small but detectable amounts of ag and zn even 4 weeks after the immersion started. the larger the amounts of ag-zn-zeolite that were incorporated, the greater the release of silver and zinc. however, it appears that increasing antibacterial activity is not promoted by the higher ratio of ag-zn-zeolite.

TI  == in vitro studies of the effect of antiseptic-containing mouthwashes on the formation and viability of streptococcus sanguis biofilms.
AB  == the aims of this study were to evaluate the growth of streptococcus sanguis on hydroxyapatite, bovine enamel and polytetrafluoroethylene substrata in a constant depth film fermentor, and to determine the effects of three antimicrobial-containing mouthwashes on biofilm formation and bacterial viability on hydroxyapatite and enamel. there was little difference in the final cell density (5 x 10(4) cfu mm-2) of the strep. sanguis biofilm on the three substrata. when hydroxyapatite-grown biofilms were exposed to the mouthwashes for 1 min, the one containing triclosan (t) proved the most effective. the chlorhexidine-containing mouthwash (cx) also achieved significant kills. the t-containing mouthwash was the most effective at killing biofilms grown on enamel. pre-treatment of hydroxyapatite with cx, cetylpyridium chloride (cpc) or  t for 1 min resulted in undetectable biofilm formation after 8 h. after 8 h of growth, only biofilms grown on enamel discs pre-treated with cx showed a reduction in the number of viable organisms. in conclusion, the results of this study have shown that while growth of strep. sanguis on hydroxyapatite and enamel were similar, the ability of antimicrobial agents to prevent the accumulation of  viable bacteria depended on the nature of the substratum.

TI  == detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16s rrna gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. the use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. the aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16s rrna gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. one hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), enterococcus faecium (n = 2), streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), streptococcus mitis (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detected bacterial dna in nine of 11  blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for pcr; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the  conventional identification of the cultured isolates. bacterial dna was detected  in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures,  18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. the species presumptively identified by partial 16s rrna gene  sequencing were as follows: pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); escherichia spp. (n = 3); moraxella spp. (n = 3); staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); neisseria spp. (n = 1); and bacillus spp. (n = 1). the results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.

TI  == antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  == bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. in an aqueous environment, ca2+, na+, po4(3-) , and si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in ph and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. since these are factors  that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass s53p4 on the oral microorganisms actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. this was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass s53p4 in powder form. a. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within  10 min under the experimental conditions. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and s. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. also for s. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass s53p4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.

TI  == development of a novel in vitro co-culture system for studying host response to native bacterial antigens.
AB  == we have developed a novel co-culture system in which murine splenocytes are cultured with live bacteria in the presence of a bacteriostatic antibiotic. superantigens, like staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb) are important factors in bacterial pathogenicity. research has shown that superantigens affect numerous immune cell types, either directly or indirectly, yet their involvement in pathogenic mechanisms remains poorly defined. in these studies, we utilize the co-culture system to study how superantigen pretreatment affects interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) production by splenocytes co-cultured with gram-positive bacteria. streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis and bacillus subtilis were tested for susceptibility to a panel of antibiotics. spectinomycin was found to maintain a bacteriostatic state of approximately 10(5) bacteria ml(-1) at optimal concentrations for each bacterial strain. co-culturing splenocytes with bacteria  did not affect splenocyte viability and cultured splenocytes responded to mitogenic stimulation as expected. two days after seb pretreatment, isolated splenocytes cultured with either streptococcus species produced 10-15 times more  ifn-gamma than splenocytes from sham-injected controls; however, no differences in cd4+ or cd8+ t cell populations appeared in cultures with or without bacteria. splenocytes isolated four days after seb treatment did not produce significant amounts of ifn-gamma in co-culture. co-cultures containing live bacteria produced four times more ifn-gamma than cultures containing heat-killed bacteria. splenocytes depleted of natural killer (nk) cells prior to seb treatment produced 25% less ifn-gamma after 20 h co-culturing with s. mutans. t lymphocytes were identified to be the major producer of ifn-gamma at this time point by intracellular cytokine staining. apparently seb exposure primes a response to live bacteria and the response is evident two days after initial exposure. the in vitro co-culture system allows us to observe host responses to bacteria in the context of the multicellular interdependent immune response. with this assay we can more closely 'mimic' in vivo events, particularly immune cell interactions in microfloral environments, to study how the pathogenic effects of superantigens alter this response.

TI  == mutacin production by streptococcus mutans may promote transmission of bacteria from mother to child.
AB  == the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, mutacins, by mutans streptococci varies among isolates. to find if the degree of mutacin activity of  an isolate was related to its transmission between mother and her child, 19 mothers and their 18-month- to 3-year-old children were sampled for their oral mutans streptococci. in addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5-year-old children in 5- to 7-year follow-up studies. a total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin  typed by the stab culture technique. mutacin was produced by 88% of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus mutans  isolates showed more inhibitory activity than did streptococcus sobrinus isolates. identical ribotypes had similar mutacin activity profiles within a subject, initially and in the follow-up studies, in all but two cases. the mothers harbored a total of 37 different mutans streptococcal ribotypes. six children were negative for mutans streptococci. transmission was probable in 9 of 20 mother-child pairs on the basis of the presence of identical strains, as determined by ribotyping and bacteriocin (mutacin) typing. s. mutans strains shared between a mother and her child showed a broader spectrum of inhibitory activity than did nontransmitted strains. in conclusion, the mutacin activity of  clinical isolates is reasonably stable, and this virulence factor seems to be of  clinical importance in early colonization by s. mutans.

TI  == extraction, assay, and analysis of antimicrobials from plants with activity against dental pathogens (streptococcus sp.)
AB  == many dental and periodontal diseases are largely a question of bacterial etiology. dental caries develop due to an increase of strongly acidogenic and aciduric gram-positive bacteria while common forms of periodontal disease are linked to anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in subgingival plaque. many plants and plant-derived antimicrobial components are used in folklore therapeutics for the  treatment of periodontal disorders and for the purposes of oral hygiene. some have been evaluated for possible use in modern medicine, while thousands of other potentially useful/plants have not been tested. in this study, we evaluated the feasibility of screening for antibacterials isolated from plants with activity against three representatives of oral streptococci. we developed and tested the following methodologies: (1) extraction of antibacterial components from plants;  (2) assays for antibacterial activity; (3) chromatographic methods for initial analysis of compounds of interest. the screening process for plant antimicrobials consisted of extraction of plant material and assay of antibacterial activity using a spotting test with the selected oral streptococci as indicator strains. in addition, we developed chromatographic procedures that allow characterization  and optimization of initial isolation steps. depending on the indicator microorganisms used, the screening assay can target additional pathogens including other streptococci (group a and b, and pneumococci) and periodontal pathogens such as porphyromonas. also, we noted that the activity of some extracts varied against different oral bacteria. our conclusion, supported by extensive data, was that the screening for antimicrobials from plants is a feasible approach to the identification of natural compounds with antimicrobial properties against dental pathogens.

TI  == streptococcus sanguis bacteremia and colorectal cancer.
AB  == streptococcal bacteremia is an uncommon presentation for colorectal malignancy, yet most physicians are aware of the association between streptococcus bovis infection and these malignancies. many are unaware, however, that other streptococcal species are associated with colon and rectal cancers. in this case  report and brief review, we highlight this association and discuss a case of streptococcus sanguis bacteremia associated with an early invasive rectal cancer.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == time-dependent interfacial tension of whole saliva and saliva-bacteria mixes.
AB  == using a tensiometer in accordance with the drop volume principle, the surface tension decrease with time was determined for whole and for 2%, 10%, and 50% aqueous solutions of saliva from one healthy donor. the reduction of surface tension with time was also measured for 10% and 20% saliva solutions with added samples of streptococcus salivarius krf2, s. sanguis krf3, and actinomyces naeslundii 2t-55. the results show that 1) there is a time dependence of the surface tension reduction of both whole saliva and diluted saliva, 2) an increase of the concentration of whole saliva in salivary solutions gives rise to larger and more rapid surface tension reduction, 3) the proteinaceous components of saliva appear to have a dominant contribution on surface tension in whole saliva  and diluted saliva, and 4) the surface-active proteinaceous components in saliva  have the ability to dominate the air-saliva interface also in the presence of high concentrations of salivary bacteria.

TI  == the effect of fluoride on streptococcus sanguis 7863 iga1 protease production and activity.
AB  == fluoride was found to affect the production of the bacterial iga1 protease but to have no effect on iga1 protease activity. the concentrations of fluoride that do  affect streptococcus sanguis growth and iga1 protease production are higher than  those normally seen in vivo under normal circumstances. the concentrations of fluoride in dental plaque following use of a fluoride rinse or dentifrice would be sufficient to reduce strep. sanguis iga1 protease production.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == role of monocytes and bacteria in staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis.
AB  == the endocardial vegetation which is formed in the course of bacterial endocarditis (be) contains tissue factor (tf)-dependent procoagulant activity. earlier studies showed that monocytes are the main source of tf in the vegetations. the tf activity (tfa) of vegetations isolated from streptococcus sanguis-infected rabbits depended on the numbers of bacteria as well as monocytes in the vegetation. in this study, we investigated whether for staphylococcus epidermidis, a frequent pathogen in be, an effect similar to that found for s. sanguis could be shown. in vitro, s. epidermidis was found to stimulate tfa of fibrin adherent monocytes significantly. this stimulation was maximal at a bacterium-to-monocyte ratio of 7. in vivo, tfa was found to be significantly higher in s. epidermidis-infected than in sterile catheter-induced vegetations. reduction of vegetational bacterial numbers by teicoplanin treatment lead to a small but significant decrease of tfa. reduction of monocyte numbers by etoposide did not affect vegetational tfa. comparison of data for s. epidermidis and s. sanguis revealed that at equivalent bacterial numbers, vegetational tfas were approximately the same for both microorganisms. combining the results of the present study with those of a previous study using s. sanguis, we conclude that the main factor determining monocyte-dependent vegetational tfa is the number of  vegetation-associated bacteria. the lower tfa found for s. epidermidis-infected than for s. sanguis-infected vegetations can be explained by the significantly lower bacterial numbers in the infected vegetations and consequently a lower stimulation of vegetation-associated monocytes.

TI  == anaerobic killing of oral streptococci by reduced, transition metal cations.
AB  == reduced, transition metal cations commonly enhance oxidative damage to cells caused by hydroperoxides formed as a result of oxygen metabolism or added externally. as expected, the cations fe2+ and cu+ enhanced killing of streptococcus mutans gs-5 by hydroperoxides. however, unexpectedly, they also induced lethal damage under fully anaerobic conditions in a glove box with no exposure to o2 or hydroperoxides from initial treatment with the cations. sensitivities to anaerobic killing by fe2+ varied among the organisms tested. the oral streptococci streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558, streptococcus rattus fa-1, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 were approximately as sensitive as s. mutans gs-5. enterococcus hirae atcc 9790, actinomyces viscosus omz105e, and actinomyces naeslundii wvu45 had intermediate sensitivity, while lactobacillus casei atcc 4646 and escherichia coli b were insensitive. killing of s. mutans gs-5 in response to millimolar levels of added fe2+ occurred over a wide range of temperatures and ph. the organism was able to take up ferrous iron, but ferric reductase activity could not be detected. chelators, uric acid, and thiocyanate were not effective inhibitors of the lethal damage. sulfhydryl compounds, ferricyanide, and ferrocyanide were protective if added prior to fe2+ exposure. fe2+, but not fe3+, acted to reduce the acid tolerance of glycolysis by intact cells of s. mutans. the reduction in acid tolerance appeared to be related directly to fe2+ inhibition of f-atpase, which could be assayed with permeabilized cells, isolated membranes, or f1 enzyme separated from membranes. cu+ and cu2+ also inhibited f-atpase and sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acid. all of these damaging actions occurred anaerobically and thus did not appear to involve reactive oxygen species.

TI  == colonic perforation by ventriculoperitoneal shunt tubing: a case of suspected silicone allergy.
AB  == background: a case of colonic perforation by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is presented in a patient with several previous complications associated with shunt  tubing. case description: initially managed by intravenous antibiotics, shunt externalization, and colonoscopy, the entire ventriculoperitoneal shunt system was subsequently replaced after cerebrospinal fluid cultures had grown propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus sanguis organisms. the patient has had  three episodes of skin breakdown over his shunt tubing (two prior and one subsequent to colonic perforation) without evidence of shunt infection or malfunction. conclusions: the etiology of these complications is consistent with  silicone tubing allergy. replacement with a polyurethane system produced no similar complications thus far, which further supports a possible silicone allergy to the ventriculoperitoneal shunt and possible etiology of this patient's colonic perforation.

TI  == a comprehensive genetic study of streptococcal immunoglobulin a1 proteases: evidence for recombination within and between species.
AB  == an analysis of 13 immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease genes (iga) of strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus sanguis was carried out to obtain information on the structure, polymorphism, and phylogeny of this specific protease, which enables bacteria to  evade functions of the predominant ig isotype on mucosal surfaces. the analysis included cloning and sequencing of iga genes from s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1, sequencing of an additional seven iga genes from s. sanguis biovars 1 through  4, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analyses of iga genes of another 10 strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and 6 strains of s. oralis. all 13 genes  sequenced had the potential of encoding proteins with molecular masses of approximately 200 kda containing the sequence motif hemth and an e residue 20 amino acids downstream, which are characteristic of zn metalloproteinases. in addition, all had a typical gram-positive cell wall anchor motif, lpntg, which, in contrast to such motifs in other known streptococcal and staphylococcal proteins, was located in their n-terminal parts. repeat structures showing variation in number and sequence were present in all strains and may be of relevance to the immunogenicities of the enzymes. protease activities in cultures of the streptococcal strains were associated with species of different molecular  masses ranging from 130 to 200 kda, suggesting posttranslational processing possibly as a result of autoproteolysis at post-proline peptide bonds in the n-terminal parts of the molecules. comparison of deduced amino acid sequences revealed a 94% similarity between s. oralis and s. mitis iga1 proteases and a 75  to 79% similarity between iga1 proteases of these species and those of s. pneumoniae and s. sanguis, respectively. combined with the results of rflp analyses using different iga gene fragments as probes, the results of nucleotide  sequence comparisons provide evidence of horizontal transfer of iga gene sequences among individual strains of s. sanguis as well as among s. mitis and the two species s. pneumoniae and s. oralis. while iga genes of s. sanguis and s. oralis were highly homogeneous, the genes of s. pneumoniae and s. mitis showed extensive polymorphism reflected in different degrees of antigenic diversity.

TI  == effects of triclosan and triclosan monophosphate on maximum specific growth rates, biomass and hydrolytic enzyme production of streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga gingivalis in continuous culture.
AB  == dental plaque species, streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga gingivalis, were  grown in continuous culture with progressively increasing concentrations of triclosan or its phosphorylated derivative, triclosan monophosphate (tmp). for both organisms, the maximum specific growth rates decreased with increasing concentrations of triclosan or tmp until complete inhibition of growth occurred,  which for s. sanguis was at 20 mg/l and 50 mg/l, and for c. gingivalis was at 10  mg/l and 5 mg/l for triclosan and tmp respectively. for both species, biomass levels remained approximately constant or, in some cases, increased slightly at low levels of triclosan or tmp. however, biomass levels then decreased significantly as the triclosan or tmp concentrations approached lethal levels. for s. sanguis, levels of hydrolytic enzymes (acid phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase and esterase) generally remained approximately constant or increased with increasing concentrations of triclosan or tmp until close to inhibitory levels where enzyme levels were reduced. the ratio of extracellular soluble enzymes to cell-bound enzymes remained constant or increased slightly with increasing levels of triclosan or tmp. for c. gingivalis, production of hydrolytic enzymes (neutral phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase and trypsin-like  protease) remained constant or were reduced when grown with low levels of triclosan and tmp but in some cases increased with higher levels of agents. the proportion of extracellular soluble activity increased significantly when concentrations of agent neared inhibitory levels. the results taken together show that the physiology of cells is significantly altered and that hydrolytic enzymes are released from the cells when these are grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of triclosan or tmp. enzyme release is more pronounced in the gram-negative c. gingivalis and indicates that triclosan or tmp can cause membrane perturbation with subsequent release of membrane-located (s. sanguis) or periplasmic (c. gingivalis) hydrolytic enzymes. s. sanguis was more sensitive to  triclosan than tmp while c. gingivalis was more sensitive to tmp. this suggests that, in c. gingivalis, tmp may diffuse into the cell wall more easily than triclosan and then be converted to triclosan by phosphatase activity within the cell wall complex, where it may give rise to high localized concentrations and subsequent cell damage.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of gv129606, a new broad-spectrum trinem.
AB  == gv129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. it combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for gv129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes,  including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, gv129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. gv129606 showed an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, gv129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed mic90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family enterobacteriaceae with mic90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. against these species, gv129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with mic90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of proteus rettgeri and providencia stuartii).  haemophilus spp., moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of gv129606. gv129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. it was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). the in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ed50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. gv129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ed50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.

TI  == empyema thoracis and lung abscess caused by viridans streptococci.
AB  == we retrospectively studied the bacteriology and clinical features of empyema thoracis and lung abscess caused by viridans streptococci in 72 patients seen from january 1984 to september 1996. a total of 76 strains of viridans streptococci were isolated, of which the most common isolates were streptococcus  constellatus (21 strains), s. intermedius (17), and s. sanguis (10). species belonging to the s. milleri group accounted for the majority (68%) of isolates. in 38 (53%) patients these organisms were recognized as the sole pathogens. of the 72 patients, 53 had empyema, 14 had lung abscesses, and five had both empyema and lung abscess. forty-six (64%) patients had underlying diseases. of these, malignancies were the most common (17 patients), followed by diabetes mellitus (12 patients) and central nervous system diseases (10 patients). of the 48 patients who underwent chest-tube drainage, 27 (56%) received further treatments, including intrapleural streptokinase (18 cases), surgery (9), and both intrapleural streptokinase and surgery (3). two (14%) of the patients with lung abscess alone underwent surgical treatment. although all viridans streptococcal isolates were susceptible to penicillin, the patients in the study had a high mortality (21%). univariate and multivariate analysis of data for patients with empyema alone (n = 53) showed a significantly increased risk of death in those with underlying malignancy (or = 16.0, p = 0.023) and those with non-s. milleri-group isolates (or = 3.72, p = 0.030). these data imply a strong clinical significance of viridans streptococci in the pathogenesis of empyema and lung abscess, as well as the need for species identification of viridans streptococci  in patients with pleuropulmonary diseases.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == on the role of human salivary micelle-like globules in bacterial agglutination.
AB  == the hypothesis to be tested in this in vitro study was that the salivary micelle-like globules (smgs) have a role in the agglutination of some oral bacteria. an attempt to determine the mechanisms for the interactions involved was also carried out. 4 laboratory and 4 native streptococci strains were tested. human whole (hws) and parotid (hps) saliva was collected from 4 subjects, and smgs were isolated from both salivas, and agglutination was recorded in the various bacterial suspensions over time. hps, hws and smgs isolated from hps and  hws caused typical agglutination patterns for the mutans strains. salivary supernatants (without smgs) caused a much delayed or no agglutination. electron microscopy showed smg-like structures on the surface of the agglutinated bacteria. addition of pyrophosphate to hps prevented agglutination, whereas guanidine hcl prevented normal agglutination of a sanguis strain, and urea had no obvious effect. together, these results indicate that the smgs are important in the agglutination of streptococci, and that both calcium-dependent, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions may be involved.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == structural and antigenic types of cell wall polysaccharides from viridans group streptococci with receptors for oral actinomyces and streptococcal lectins.
AB  == lectin-mediated interactions between oral viridans group streptococci and actinomyces may play an important role in microbial colonization of the tooth surface. the presence of two host-like motifs, either galnac beta1-->3gal (gn) or gal beta1-->3galnac (g), in the cell wall polysaccharides of five streptococcal strains accounts for the lactose-sensitive coaggregations of these bacteria with  actinomyces naeslundii. three streptococcal strains which have gn-containing polysaccharides also participate in galnac-sensitive coaggregations with strains  of streptococcus gordonii and s. sanguis. each gn- or g-containing polysaccharide is composed of a distinct phosphodiester-linked hexa- or heptasaccharide repeating unit. the occurrence of these polysaccharides on 19 additional viridans group streptococcal strains that participate in lactose-sensitive coaggregations  with actinomyces was examined. negatively charged polysaccharides that reacted with bauhinia purpurea agglutinin, a gal and galnac binding plant lectin, were isolated from 17 strains by anion exchange column chromatography of mutanolysin-cell wall digests. results from nuclear magnetic resonance and immunodiffusion identified each of 16 polysaccharides as a known gn- or g-containing structural type and one polysaccharide as a new but closely related  gn-containing type. unlike the reactions of lectins, the cross-reactions of most  rabbit antisera with these polysaccharides were correlated with structural features other than the host-like motifs. gn-containing polysaccharides occurred  primarily on the strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis while g-containing polysaccharides were more common among the strains of s. gordonii and s. mitis examined. the findings strongly support the hypothesis that lectin-mediated recognition of these streptococci by other oral bacteria depends on a family of antigenically diverse gn- and g-containing cell wall polysaccharides, the occurrence of which may differ between streptococcal species.

TI  == effect of radiotherapy on the levels of secretory immunoglobulin a against indigenous and virulent streptococci.
AB  == it is well known that the frequency of upper respiratory infection is clinically  increased after radiotherapy of the head and neck region. this study found higher antibacterial secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) activity against three indigenous streptococci (streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis i) and s. pneumoniae in patients who had undergone radiation therapy of the head and neck region than in control subjects. this showed no relation to the extent of the radiation field. compared with before radiotherapy, the s-iga titer against s. pneumoniae and its ratio to the activities against the indigenous streptococci were significantly higher in patients with fully irradiated major salivary glands. these results indicated that the radiotherapy promoted the antigen-specific s-iga production of virulent streptococci in most patients with  head and neck cancer, even more than 6 months after radiotherapy. the resulting altered balance in the s-iga system of normal indigenous streptococci may also impair the ability to maintain the stable bacterial interference between normal indigenous and virulent streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavity.

TI  == exclusion of bioactive contaminations in streptococcus pyogenes erythrogenic toxin a preparations by recombinant expression in escherichia coli.
AB  == the streptococcal erythrogenic exotoxin a (spea) belongs to the family of bacterial superantigens and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a toxic shock-like syndrome and scarlet fever. concerning its biological activity, mainly t-cell-stimulatory properties, conflicting data exist. in this study, we show that most of the spea preparations used so far contain biologically active contaminations. natural spea from the culture supernatant of streptococcus pyogenes ny-5 and recombinant spea purified from the culture filtrate of s. sanguis are strongly contaminated with dnases. we show that natural spea induces  more tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) than recombinant spea, but we also show that dnases are able to induce tnf-alpha. in commercial spea preparations, we identified a highly active protease, which was shown not to be speb. to exclude these contaminations, we overexpressed spea cloned in the effective high-level expression vector pin-iii-ompa2 in escherichia coli. the expressed spea shows the same amino acid composition as natural spea, whereas functional studies reported so far were carried out with toxins containing an incorrect amino terminus. we describe the rapid purification of lipopolysaccharide-, dnase-, and protease-free spea in two steps from the host's periplasm and its structural characterization by circular dichroism. our results represent for the  first time the production in e. coli of recombinant spea with the authentic n-terminal sequence and a proven superantigenic activity. collectively, our results indicate that immunological studies of superantigens require highly purified substances free of biologically active contaminations.

AB  == streptococcus sanguis binds to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite (sha), an in vitro model of the enamel pellicle. to learn if more than one adhesin functions during  adhesion, 12 reactive monoclonal antibodies (mabs) were isolated by screening against both adhesive and nonadhesive strains. two of these mabs, 1.1 and 1.2, inhibited adhesion in a dose-dependent fashion, although maximum inhibition with  either was only 37%. when these two mabs plus a polyclonal antibody to p1-like adhesin were combined, the inhibition was additive to about 82%. these data indicated that there were at least three distinct, functional adhesion epitopes on the surface of s. sanguis. western blot analyses of s. sanguis surface macromolecules showed antigens at 36 and 56 (with mab 1.2), 87 and 150 (with both mab 1.1 and mab 1.2), and 100, 130, and 170 kda (with anti-p1 antibody). the antigens were eluted from gels. isolated antigens and corresponding antibodies inhibited adhesion similarly. additivity experiments suggested the distinct epitopes were in three groups: (i) 36/56 kda, (ii) 87/150 kda, and (iii) 100/130/170 kda. the 150-kda antigen reacting with both mabs was isolated from gels and digested with trypsin. the digestion revealed a series of tryptic bands. a band at 38 kda reacted with mab 1.1 whereas a band at 54 kda reacted with mab 1.2 in western blot analysis, indicating two distinct adhesive epitopes on the 150-kda antigen. these data strongly suggest that s. sanguis adhesion to sha is maximized when several adhesin epitopes are coexpressed on surface antigens of different sizes.

AB  == a pcr assay that allows identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (streptococcus gordonii, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis) to the species level and identification of milleri group streptococci (s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. intermedius) to the group level was developed. this assay was based on specific amplification of internal fragments of genes encoding d-alanine:d-alanine ligases which are species specific and ubiquitous in prokaryotes possessing peptidoglycan. the specificity of this assay was tested on 9 reference strains and 91 characterized  clinical isolates. this assay offers a specific and rapid alternative to phenotypic or dna-dna hybridization methods for identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci.

TI  == ribotyping of bacteria from root canal and blood of patients receiving endodontic therapy.
AB  == dna restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of 26 bacterial isolates (propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis) recovered from patients with infected root canals and their peripheral blood, collected during and after endodontic therapy, were examined. eleven additional reference strains including type strains were also examined. purified dna was digested with bgli,ecori, and hindiii. hybridization was carried out with a digoxigenin-labeled cdna probe obtained by reverse transcription of escherichia coli 16s + 23s rrna. ribotypes of the bacteria recovered from root canal and blood showed identical characteristics within the patients, and differed between the patients. the results were confirmed when the similarity coefficient (s(ab)) of the ribotypes from the isolates were assessed by the dendron computer-assisted system. these results suggested that the bacteria isolated from the blood originated from the root canal.

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci to an immobilized antimicrobial agent.
AB  == an antimicrobial agent, 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride, was immobilized on silica. interaction between the material (termed) oais) and various oral bacterial species were then studied. seven species of streptococcus and two actinomyces were investigated for their ability to adhere to this biomaterial. cell-surface hydrophobicity and zeta-potential were examined as well. analysis of extracted hydrophobic proteins which adhered to oais revealed that the adherence of these micro-organisms was closely related to the hydrophobicity of their cell surfaces. the results of zeta-potential assays indicated that negative charge on the cell surface inhibited adherence to oais. gel electrophoresis revealed that oais could absorb cell-surface hydrophobic proteins from all bacterial species tested. preadsorption of hydrophobic components on the cell surface inhibited adherence of the strep. mutans strain to oais in a dose-dependent manner. the results indicate that oais adsorption of these oral bacteria was dependent on the degree of hydrophobicity of their surfaces. a major component of this adherence was hydrophobic cell-surface proteins.

TI  == thermophysiology of streptococcus mutans and related lactic-acid bacteria.
AB  == the temperature ranges for growth of streptococcus mutans gs-5 and s. sobrinus 6715 were found to be very narrow, from about 30 to 47 degrees c, with optimal growth around 37 degrees c. thus, the organisms showed little potential to grow in the environment outside of the animal host. in contrast wider ranges were found for enterococcus hirae, s. rattus and s. sanguis. detailed study of s. mutans gs-5 showed that energetic coupling, reflected in yields of biomass per mol of glucose utilized, were not greatly affected by changes in temperature within the growth range. however, since glycolysis occurred over a wider temperature range (about 10 to 52 degrees c) than growth, yield values dropped to zero at temperatures above or below the growth range. the temperature range for glycolysis could be related to temperature sensitivity of the phosphoenolypyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system for sugar uptake. f-atpases were active over a similar range of temperatures, but with a broad optimal range  from about 30 to 50 degrees c. proton permeability of s. mutans increased steadily with temperature in a manner similar to that of other mesophilic bacteria, such as escherichia coli. growth of the bacteria in media supplemented  with various fatty acids had major effects on proton permeabilities but the effects were not well reflected by changes in growth or glycolysis of the bacteria. the overall conclusions were that s. mutans is a typical mesophile in relation to membrane and catabolic functions but its narrow temperature range for growth is related to temperature sensitivities of anabolic systems.

TI  == cerebrospinal fluid broth culture isolates: their significance for antibiotic treatment.
AB  == enriched broth medium is routinely used as a supplement for agar plate culture of cerebrospinal fluid (csf). to assess the clinical utility of broth cultures, 151  consecutive csf bacterial and fungal isolates obtained from 91 patients were retrospectively reviewed for the effect of results on treatment. treatment decisions associated with individual csf specimens for which isolates were recovered from thioglycollate broth only were compared with the treatment decisions associated with csf specimens for which isolates were recovered by agar plate culture. treatment was defined as initiation of or change in antimicrobial  therapy based on the reporting of csf culture isolates. thirty-six (24%) of the 151 isolates were recovered in broth only. three (8%) of these 36 isolates (from  34 patients) resulted in treatment with antimicrobial agents; however, 2 of the 3 treated isolates (candida tropicalis, proteus mirabilis) were recovered from a second csf specimen in agar plate culture within 24 hours. thus, only a single isolate (3%; staphylococcus epidermidis) was treated based solely on a positive broth culture result. in contrast, 60 (52%) of the 115 isolates recovered in agar plate culture from 23 (40%) of 57 patients were treated (staphylococci, 28; gram-negative bacilli, 14; cryptococcus neoformans, 10; streptococcus pneumoniae, 3; streptococcus sanguis, 1; other, 4). we conclude that treatment with antimicrobial agents based on isolates recovered from csf specimens in broth culture alone is infrequent and infer from the data that the use of csf broth cultures contributes little to treatment decisions.

TI  == pathway for uptake and degradation of x-prolyl tripeptides in streptococcus mutans va-29r and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556.
AB  == the growth of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis in the oral environment requires that these micro-organisms be able to degrade salivary proteins and to assimilate the resulting peptides as an amino nitrogen source. our research is aimed at the definition of the proteolytic enzyme systems in these oral streptococci which allow them to utilize such substrates. in the present work, the nature of the hydrolytic activity expressed by s. mutans va-29r and s. sanguis atcc 10556 against x-pro4-nitroanilide and x-pro-y tripeptide substrates was investigated. this activity was predominantly associated with a cytoplasmic dipeptidyl peptidase which preferentially catalyzes the release of an n-terminal dipeptide from substrates in which proline is the penultimate residue. these streptococci also possess a second cytoplasmic peptidase, pepd, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of x-pro dipeptides. we found that gly-pro-ala or ala-pro-gly were transported into the bacterial cells only when an energy source  such as glucose was present. peptide uptake was time-dependent, and selective exodus of peptide-derived amino acids from the bacterial cells occurred during peptide uptake. results from these studies provide evidence that s. mutans va-29r and s. sanguis atcc 10556 possess a pathway for the complete degradation of x-pro tripeptides. transport of the peptides into cells prior to hydrolysis provides an efficient way by which all amino acids of a peptide may be obtained at an energy  expense equivalent to that associated with the transport of just one amino acid.  in light of the abundance of proline in salivary polypeptides, this degradative pathway could be an important component in the proteolytic pathway for salivary polypeptide utilization in these oral streptococci.

TI  == the role of an uncommon type of oral streptococcus sanguis in the etiology of behcet's disease.
AB  == the relationships of behcet's disease (bd) with oral diseases and the prevalence  of an uncommon type of oralstreptococcus sanguis (str. sanguis) in the oral cavity were investigated in a case-control study. bd patients were compared to patient controls (collagen disease) and healthy controls.an interview questionnaire survey of bd and oral diseases showed that during the pre-onset, onset, and post-onset periods, the incidences of tonsillitis and dental caries, or the history of dental treatment, were greater in bd cases. typological analysis showed a higher prevalence of an uncommon type ofstr. sanguis, differing from the common type, among bd cases compared to control groups. these results, showing a higher incidence of tonsillitis and dental caries during the presymptomatic period, a greater frequency of dental treatments during the symptomatic period, and the presence of an uncommon type ofstr. sanguis, indicate thatstr. sanguis of an uncommon type is related to increased risk of bd, and the  possibility of a causal role is suggested.

TI  == interaction between oral alpha-streptococci and group a streptococci in patients  with tonsillitis.
AB  == the incidence of oral alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against group a streptococci, as a defense mechanism against bacterial infection in the oral cavity, was investigated in 141 patients with streptococcal tonsillitis. the study population included both children (n = 79) and adults (n = 62). infection by group a streptococci appeared to be more common in children than in adults, as the detection rates of inhibitory alpha-streptococci in healthy children (29.7%), as well as pediatric patients with tonsillitis (14.9%), were lower than those in  adults (63.0%; p < .01). it is possible to consider oral alpha-streptococci with  inhibitory activity to be among the indications for tonsillectomy in patients with streptococcal tonsillitis, since the detection rate of inhibitory alpha-streptococci in surgical cases (10.9%) was significantly lower than that in nonsurgical cases (31.1%; p < .01). the high detection rate of these strains during the postoperative state supported the observation that the incidence of group a streptococcal infection was decreased postoperatively. accordingly, it is useful to investigate bacterial interference between oral alpha-streptococci and  group a streptococci in patients scheduled for tonsillectomy.

TI  == a microbiological study of pre- and postoperative apicoectomy sites.
AB  == there is little information on the microbiology of periapical lesions, and no data on the residual microbial flora in the periapex, if any, after apicoectomy procedures. hence, 64 patients treated by apicoectomy procedures were prospectively studied to assess the bacterial flora in the periapex and to evaluate the residual bacteria in postoperative apicoectomy sites. of the 64 lesions studied, 14 (22%) were sterile and 50 (78%) yielded bacteria preoperatively. bacteria could be recovered from 28 (56%) of the latter lesions after apicoectomy and curettage. a total of 105 bacterial strains was isolated from 50 lesions, yielding a range of 1-4 (mean 2.1) species per sample. the isolates comprised 84 (80%) facultative anaerobes and 21 (20%) strict anaerobes.  a polymicrobial growth was obtained from 39 lesions whilst 11 lesions yielded pure cultures. on detailed microbiological analyses of 29 lesions, 40% of the isolates were identified as alpha-haemolytic streptococci, half of which were streptococcus sanguis; anaerobic streptococci were the predominant anaerobes. none of the organisms or group(s) of organisms emerged as recalcitrant colonisers which were difficult to dislodge after surgical debridement. these data indicate  that the majority of periapical lesions harbour a variety of flora which cannot be eradicated despite thorough apicoectomy procedures.

TI  == extracts of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  == in order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as escherichia coli on bone formation, clone mc3t3-e1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. the addition of the sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration  range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. by contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis, and escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. the addition of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the  cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. polymyxin b did  not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. the inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kda eluted from sephadex g-200 column. the inhibitory substances of prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results indicate that prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.

TI  == the role of immunoglobulin g and fibrinogen in platelet aggregation by streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == previous work has shown that the type strain of streptococcus sanguis, nctc 7863, induces aggregation of normal platelets by a complement-dependent mechanism. we investigated the roles of igg and fibrinogen in the aggregation process. plasma depleted of igg by passage through protein a-sepharose failed to support platelet aggregation, as did plasma absorbed at 0 degrees c with whole bacteria. however,  absorption of plasma with a non-aggregating strain of s. sanguis, sk96, did not remove aggregating activity for nctc 7863. supplementing 0 degrees c-absorbed plasma with purified igg restored the aggregation supporting activity. a monoclonal antibody to the fc gammarii receptor inhibited platelet aggregation by the bacteria, indicating a requirement for bacteria-igg complexes interacting with the fc receptor in platelet aggregation. there was a lag time to the onset of platelet aggregation of 7-19 min depending upon the platelet donor, but the length of this lag did not correlate with either total igg concentration recognizing nctc 7863 in subjects' plasma, or the concentration any of the four igg subclasses or with igg avidity levels. fibrinogen was shown to bind rapidly to the bacterial cell surface. monoclonal antibody to gpiib/iiia, rgds peptide, and a specific antagonist for the platelet fibrinogen receptor, gpiib/iiia, fk633, inhibited platelet aggregation by nctc 7863, indicating that platelet aggregation is fibrinogen dependent. these data suggest that platelet aggregation by some strains of s. sanguis requires multiple stimuli/agonists, including igg-fc receptor interaction, complement and fibrinogen.

TI  == comya, a gene similar to comga of bacillus subtilis, is essential for competence-factor-dependent dna transformation in streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == tn4001 mutagenesis identified a new competence gene in streptococcus gordonii challis designated comya. a comya mutant was completely deficient in transformation and exhibited decreased levels of dna binding and hydrolysis. the  deduced 319-amino-acid comya protein exhibited 57% similarity and 33% identity to the comga transporter protein of bacillus subtilis and contained the walker a-box motif conserved in atp-binding proteins as well as aspartic acid boxes asp-1 and  asp-2 present in some components of the general secretory pathway of gram-negative bacteria. comya appeared to be part of a putative operon encompassing a comgb homolog, designated comyb, together with sequences that could encode comgc- and comgd-like peptides designated comyc and comyd, respectively, as well as other components. the putative comyc and comyd peptides  had leader sequences similar to the type iv n-methylphenylalanine pilins of gram-negative bacteria, but unlike other examples in this class, including b. subtilis, they contained an alanine at position -1 of the leader instead of the usual glycine residue. northern analysis identified a single 6.0-kb comya-containing transcript strictly dependent on exogenous competence factor for expression in coma1 cells. an identical pattern of expression was seen in wild-type challis cells grown under conditions of maximal competence but not in cells that were noncompetent.

TI  == inhibition of purified enolases from oral bacteria by fluoride.
AB  == enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microm or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mm inorganic phosphate ions. in this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. the molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kda. the vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 iu/mg and k(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mm. enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microm in the presence of 5 mm inorganic phosphate ions. ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mm. the enolase from streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from streptococcus salivarius atcc 10575 (ki = 19 +/- 2) or streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 (ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either actinomyces naeslundii wvu 627 (ki = 46 +/- 6) or lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469 (ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. the levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.

TI  == effects of acidification on growth and glycolysis of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == after carbohydrate intake, ph in dental plaque decreases rapidly and reaches about 4 within a few minutes. the acidification not only promotes demineralization of tooth surface but can also cause damage to bacteria in dental plaque. we, therefore, investigated the effect of acidification on the dental plaque bacteria streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. at ph 4.0 and 4.2, both growth and glycolytic activities in these streptococci were repressed.  prolonged acidification (for 60 min at ph 4.0) not only repressed both growth and glycolytic activities but also impaired them in s. sanguis cells with concomitant inactivation of the glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase and enolase. the impaired abilities of glycolysis and growth recovered following incubation at ph 7.0 for 80-90 min, and this was accompanied by reactivation of the glycolytic enzymes. on the other hand, these impairments were not observed in s. mutans cells exposed to prolonged acidification. these results indicate that the low ph frequently occurring in dental plaque may transiently impair streptococcal glycolysis and growth and that s. mutans is more durable to the acidification than s. sanguis.

TI  == myeloperoxidase isoform activities released by human neutrophils in response to dental and periodontal bacteria.
AB  == myeloperoxidase is an enzyme released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes which has been used, experimentally, as an indicator of periodontal disease activity when measured in gingival crevicular fluid. there are three myeloperoxidase isoforms:  mpo i, mpo ii and mpo iii. we examined the activities of myeloperoxidase isoforms released by neutrophils in response to serum-opsonized actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga sputigena and streptococcus sanguis. isoform activities were determined using intermediate-pressure liquid chromatography and microenzyme assay. a. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated higher levels of myeloperoxidase release than any other oral bacteria unless pre-opsonized with serum (or protein-a-purified immunoglobulin) from an individual with localized juvenile periodontitis. most oral bacteria stimulated the release of all myeloperoxidase isoforms with a profile enriched in mpo i and diminished in mpo iii. exceptionally, serum-opsonized a. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated myeloperoxidase isoform release in proportion to the neutrophil granule constituency with or without localized juvenile periodontitis serum pre-opsonization. because myeloperoxidase isoform profiles reflect how neutrophils were stimulated, isoform analysis may refine future diagnostic tests  based upon myeloperoxidase.

AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == the interaction of phospholipid liposomes with bacteria and their use in the delivery of bactericides.
AB  == liposomes have been prepared from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dppc) incorporating the cationic lipids stearylamine (sa), dimethyldioctadecylammonium  bromide (ddab) and dimethylaminoethane carbamoyl cholesterol (dcchol) and the anionic lipids dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (dppg) and phosphatidylinositol (pi). their adsorption to biofilms of skin-associated bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis and proteus vulgaris) and oral bacteria (streptococcus mutans and sanguis) has been investigated as a function of mole % cationic and anionic lipid. targeting (adsorption) was most effective for the systems dppc-chol-sa, dppc-dppg and dppc-pi liposomes to s. epidermidis. the effect of extracellular mucopolysaccharide on targeting was investigated for s. epidermidis biofilms. it  was found that targeting increased with the level of extracellular mucopolysaccharide for all liposome compositions studied. the delivery of the oil-soluble bactericide triclosan and the water soluble bactericide chlorhexidine was studied for a number of liposomal compositions. superior delivery of both bactericides relative to the free bactericide occurred for dppc-chol-sa liposomes and for triclosan delivery by dppc-dppg and dppc-pi liposomes targeted to s. epidermidis at low bactericide concentrations. dppc-chol-sa liposomes were also effective for delivery of triclosan to s. sanguis biofilms. double labelling experiments using [14c]-chlorhexidine and [3h]-dppc suggested that there was exchange between adsorbed liposomes which had delivered bactericide to the biofilm and those in the bulk solution implying a diffusion mechanism for bactericide delivery.

TI  == iga protease produced by streptococcus sanguis and antibody production against iga protease in patients with behcet's disease.
AB  == the production of iga protease in twelve strains of streptococcus sanguis isolated from patients with behcet's disease (bd) was examined. protease activity was detected in 10 out of 12 strains. the protease was purified from one representative strain, s. sanguis 113-20, by employing rotofor and deae-sephacel  chromatography. the molecular mass of the purified protease was approximately 100 kda, and it cleaved the proline-threonine site of the iga. both igg and iga titers against the cells (113-20) and the purified iga protease in the sera of bd patients and healthy controls, 36 each, were assayed. the igg titers against the  cells and protease were not significant in the bd patients or controls, but the iga titers against the cells and protease in the bd patients were significantly higher than those of the controls. these data indicate that the bd patients are infected with iga protease-producing s. sanguis strains, which cause an increase  of iga titer against these organisms and iga protease antigen. since the organisms can proliferate in bd patients for a long period of time (years), it seems that iga antibodies cannot effectively eliminate the organisms.

TI  == sinusitis of dental origin.
AB  == acute or chronic sinusitis may be odontogenic. bacteria involved in odontogenic sinusitis are specific organisms associated with the teeth (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, anaerobic germs). they are often secondary to an intrasinus foreign body following periodontitis. the treatment is both naso-sinusal and dental. cysts of the maxilla can also invade the sinus. in particular, radiculo-dental cysts (periapical) must be surgically excised, in some cases associated with a middle meatotomy. finally, one should look for oro-antral fistulae. the surgical technique for its closure should take  into account the reversibility of the sinus lesions.

TI  == the role of heat shock protein, microbial and autoimmune agents in the aetiology  of behcet's disease.
AB  == investigation of the aetiology of behcet's disease (bd) has focused predominantly on herpes simplex virus immunopathology, autoimmunity to oral mucosa or cross-reactive microbial antigens, and streptococcal infection. these aetiological factors might have a common denominator in microbial heat shock protein (hsp) which shows significant homology with the human mitochondrial hsp.  indeed, the uncommon serotypes of streptococcus sanguis found in bd cross-react with the 65 kd hsp which also shares antigenicity with an oral mucosal antigen. t cell epitope mapping has identified 4 peptides derived from the sequence of the 65 kd hsp which stimulate specifically tcr gamma delta + lymphocytes from patients with bd. these peptides (111-125, 154-172, 219-233 and 311-325) show significant homology with the corresponding peptides derived from the human 60 kd hsp. the specific proliferative response of tcr gamma delta + lymphocytes elicited by the 4 peptides can be used as a laboratory test for the diagnosis of  bd. the pathogenic significance of these peptides has been established by inducing uveitis in rats.

TI  == a numerical taxonomic study of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis and similar organisms using conventional tests and pyrolysis mass spectrometry.
AB  == numerical taxonomic methods were applied to the results of pyrolysis mass spectrometry (py-ms) and conventional test reaction patterns (ctrps) obtained with 46 strains of oral streptococci identified as representative of six species. of these: streptococcus gordonii strains formed a single homogeneous well-differentiated cluster both in the py-ms and ctrp analyses; s. oralis strains were more diverse, forming 2 ctrp and 3 py-ms clusters; s. crista, s. parasanguis and s. sanguis formed clear, but diverse and poorly differentiated clusters on the basis of ctrps, and were poorly differentiated in the py-ms analysis; and s. mitis strains were clearly diverse in both analyses. peritrichously fimbriate ('tufted') s. mitis strains formed a tight cluster, well differentiated from the type strain in both py-ms and ctrp analyses, and may represent a previously unrecognised centre of variation.

TI  == occurrence of lipoteichoic acid in oral streptococci.
AB  == the heterogeneous bacterial group known as oral streptococci was screened for the presence of cellular polyglycerolphosphate-containing lipoteichoic acid. this compound was detected in phenol extracts of lyophilized cells by an immunoassay in which polyglycerolphosphate-specific monoclonal antibody was used. polyglycerolphosphate-containing lipoteichoic acid occurred in all 86 strains of  oral streptococci examined except the streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis strains. this confirms the findings of rosan (b. rosan, science 201:918-920, 1978) and hamada et al. (s. hamada, j. mizuno, s. kotani, and m. torii, fems microbiol. lett. 8:93-96, 1980), is consistent with the results of the taxonomic study of oral streptococci performed by kilian et al. (m. kilian, l. mikkelsen, and j. henrichsen, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 39:471-484, 1989), who  emended the descriptions of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, and s. mitis, and reflects the phylogenetic relationship among s. mitis, s. oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae.

TI  == importance of genotypic and phenotypic tolerance in the treatment of experimental endocarditis due to streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == genotypic and phenotypic tolerance was studied in penicillin treatment of experimental endocarditis due to nontolerant and tolerant streptococcus gordonii  and to their backcross transformants. the organisms were matched for in vitro and in vivo growth rates. rats with aortic endocarditis were treated for 3 or 5 days, starting 12, 24, or 48 h after inoculation. when started at 12 h, during fast intravegetation growth, 3 days of treatment cured 80% of the nontolerant parent compared with <30% of the tolerant derivative (p < .005). when started at 24 or 48 h and if intravegetation growth had reached a plateau, 3 days of treatment failed against both bacteria. however, a significant difference between the 2 organisms was restored when treatment was extended to 5 days. thus, genotypic tolerance conferred a survival advantage in both fast- and slow-growing bacteria, demonstrating that the in vitro-defined tolerant phenotype also carried the risk  of treatment failure in vivo.

TI  == differential toxic effects of lactate and acetate on the metabolism of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == experiments were conducted with streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 to determine whether the acid end-products, lactate and acetate, were involved in the regulation of cellular growth and metabolism. the growth rate and culture biomass of both organisms was inhibited by the addition of lactate and acetate at concentrations as high as 200 mm to the cultures, although the final ph values of the lactate and acetate cultures were similar. in addition, the metabolic conversion of glucose to lactate was decreased by external lactate but stimulated by acetate. in spite of this, calculation of the  yield of cell biomass per mole of atp (yatp) showed that the yield of both organisms actually increased in the presence of added lactate, but decreased with acetate. this indicates that the two acids interacted with the cells of the organisms by different mechanisms. for both organisms, the final external undissociated lactic acid was relatively constant at concentrations between 0 and 200 mm added lactate, 24.9-32.5 mm for s. mutans and 8.0-11.5 mm for s. sanguis.  on the other hand, the final concentration of undissociated acetic acid in the s. mutans cultures increased from 2.9 to 83.7 mm as the medium acetate concentration increased, and from 1.0 to 36.0 mm with the s. sanguis cultures. counterflow experiments provided evidence for a lactate carrier in both s. mutans and s. sanguis, but an acetate carrier in these organisms could not be demonstrated. [14c]-lactate and [14c]-acetate were taken up into de-energized, chemostatgrown cells of s. mutans and s. sanguis in response to an artificially generated ph gradient but not by an imposed electrical gradient. thus, under these conditions  lactate uptake occurred via a symport process with only one proton. growth of both organisms in the presence of increasing concentrations of acetate resulted in a small reduction (27%) in the transmembrane ph gradient (delta ph) as measured by the permeant acid, [14c]-salicylate. however, the uptake of [14c]-acetate for the estimation of delta ph revealed significant inhibition of the acetate concentration gradient in the presence external acetate, indicating that the cells expelled the acetate anion. the results indicate that, unlike acetate uptake, lactate transport by s. mutans and s. sanguis was strictly regulated via the lactate carrier in order to prevent excessive dissipation of the ph gradient. clearly, the formation of acetate by oral streptococci is more problematic for cellular homeostasis than the formation of lactate.

TI  == saliva mediated adherence, aggregation and prevalence in dental plaque of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces spp, in young and elderly humans.

TI  == role of phagocytosis in activation of the coagulation system in streptococcus sanguis endocarditis.
AB  == the formation of vegetations consisting of fibrin, cellular elements, humoral factors, and bacteria is the central event in the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis. fibrin formation occurs on the vegetation, the coagulation system being activated locally via the expression of tissue factor (tf) on fibrin-adherent monocytes. this study was performed to assess the importance of phagocytosis of fibrin-adherent streptococcus sanguis in the stimulation of tf expression on fibrin-adherent monocytes, as well as a role for "frustrated" phagocytosis. with the latter process, these cells are unable to remove bacteria  from the fibrin surface but nonetheless might be activated to generate tf. we found that serum was not required for the stimulation of tf expression by fibrin-adherent monocytes in the presence of s. sanguis in an in vitro model for  bacterial endocarditis. the bacterial adhesin dextran did not influence the tf activity (tfa) of fibrin-adherent monocytes: tfa was the same after stimulation with a dextran-positive streptococcus as with its dextran-negative mutant. furthermore, dextran did not influence the tfa of endocardial vegetations, which  was the same for vegetations isolated from rabbits infected either with dextran-positive s. sanguis or its dextran-negative mutant. these results do not  support the hypothesis that in bacterial endocarditis (frustrated) phagocytosis significantly contributes to tf expression on vegetation-adherent monocytes. fibronectin, however, although not influencing the fibrin binding of the streptococci, did enhance the tfa of monocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. we conclude that although streptococci do enhance expression of tfa on monocytes, phagocytosis and bacterial adhesins do not play a major role in this process. stimulation of monocyte tfa may be more dependent on interactions between monocytes and the vegetational surface via fibronectin receptors, such as vla 4 and vla 5 (very late antigens 4 and 5).

(ab titers were > or = 1/512 and igm > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients  1 year later). heterologous ab: in spite of statistically significant difference  found in sie versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256)  is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. conclusions: the utility of homologous ab for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. on the contrary for heterologous ab, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.

AB  == genetic and biochemical analysis of exopolysaccharide (eps) production in lactic  acid bacteria has been a growing field of interest in the food industry. we previously identified and characterized a gene cluster composed of 13 genes (epsa to epsm) responsible for eps production in streptococcus thermophilus sfi6. here  we report one further gene, pbp2b, that is connected to eps production. mutants with a gene disruption in pbp2b were no longer able to produce eps, exhibited a reduced growth-rate, and their cell morphology was altered. the predicted gene product showed significant homology to the class b penicillin-binding proteins 2b of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. upstream of pbp2b, we further identified two genes which showed significant homology to the e. coli fold and urfl, which is an unidentified open reading frame presumed to be involved in dna repair. downstream of pbp2b, we identified a gene that showed homology to the bacillus subtilis and  the escherichia coli recm or recr which, respectively, are involved in the methyl-dependent dna mismatch repair. in s. thermophilus, pbp2b and recm were transcribed from their own promoters as monocistronic mrnas and are therefore organized as independent transcriptional units.

AB  == the pneumococcus expresses a protease that hydrolyzes human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1). a gene for iga1 protease was identified from a plasmid library of pneumococcal dna because of the effect of its overexpression on the colony morphology of streptococcus pneumoniae. the deduced 1,964-amino-acid sequence is  highly homologous to that of the iga1 protease from streptococcus sanguis. the similarity to the s. sanguis enzyme and the presence of a putative zinc-binding site suggest that the pneumococcal enzyme is a metalloprotease. the two streptococcal sequences differ in a hydrophilic region with 10 tandem repeats of  a 20-mer in s. sanguis, which is replaced by a similar but less repetitive sequence in s. pneumoniae. antiserum reactive with the pneumococcal iga1 protease was used to demonstrate that the majority of the protein is cell associated. the  expression and function of this gene were confirmed by insertional mutagenesis. interruption of the chromosomal gene resulted in loss of expression of an approximately 200-kda protein and complete elimination of detectable iga1 protease activity.

TI  == characterization of the streptococcus pneumoniae immunoglobulin a1 protease gene  (iga) and its translation product.
AB  == bacterial immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases constitute a very heterogenous group of extracellular endopeptidases which specifically cleave human iga1 in the hinge region. here we report that the iga1 protease gene, iga, of streptococcus pneumoniae is homologous to that of streptococcus sanguis. by using the s. sanguis iga gene as hybridization probe, the corresponding gene from a clinical isolate of s. pneumoniae was isolated in an escherichia coli lambda phage library. a lysate of e. coli infected with hybridization-positive recombinant phages possessed iga1-cleaving activity. the complete sequence of the s. pneumoniae iga gene was determined. an open reading frame with a strongly biased  codon usage and having the potential of encoding a protein of 1,927 amino acids with a molecular mass of 215,023 da was preceded by a potential -10 promoter sequence and a putative shine-dalgarno sequence. a putative signal peptide was found in the n-terminal end of the protein. the amino acid sequence similarity to the s. sanguis iga1 protease indicated that the pneumococcal iga1 protease is a zn-metalloproteinase. the primary structures of the two streptococcal iga1 proteases were quite different in the n-terminal parts, and both proteins contained repeat structures in this region. using a novel assay for iga1 protease activity upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we demonstrated that the secreted iga1 protease was present in several different molecular forms ranging in size from approximately 135 to 220 kda. in addition, interstrain differences in the sizes of the pneumococcal iga1 proteases were detected. southern blot analyses suggested that the s. pneumoniae iga gene is highly heterogenous within the species.

TI  == effects of oral flora on platelets: possible consequences in cardiovascular disease.
AB  == during episodes of dental bacteremia, viridans group streptococci encounter platelets. among these microorganisms, certain streptococcus sanguis induce human and rabbit platelets to aggregate in vitro. in experimental rabbits, circulating  streptococci induced platelets to aggregate, triggering the accumulation of platelets and fibrin into the heart valve vegetations of endocarditis. at necropsy, affected rabbit hearts showed ischemic areas. we therefore hypothesized that circulating s. sanguis might cause coronary thrombosis and signs of myocardial infarction (mi). signs of mi were monitored in rabbits after infusion  with platelet-aggregating doses of 4 to 40 x 10(9) cells of s. sanguis 133-79. infusion resulted in dose-dependent changes in electrocardiograms, blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility. these changes were consistent with the occurrence of mi. platelets isolated from hyperlipidemic rabbits showed  an accelerated in vitro aggregation response to strain 133-79. cultured from immunosuppressed children with septic shock and signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation, more than 60% of isolates of viridans streptococci induced platelet aggregation when tested in vitro. the data are consistent with a thrombogenic role for s. sanguis in human disease, contributing to the development of the vegetative lesion in infective endocarditis and a thrombotic mechanism to explain the additional contributed risk of periodontitis to mi.

TI  == effect of dentin treatment on in vitro root tubule bacterial invasion.
AB  == in light of the in vitro s. sanguis bacterial migration observed deep into root dentin, an in vitro system was developed to determine the viability of these bacteria at the end of migration. also of interest is whether the smear layer formed during root canal instrumentation modifies migration into root dentinal tubules. forty-eight bovine root dentin samples were randomly split into two groups. group 1 dentin blocks were not instrumented and were treated with 17% ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite for 4 minutes in an ultrasonic bath group 2 root canals were conventionally instrumented. the smear layer formed was not removed. dentin blocks were inoculated with a s. sanguis national collection of type culture 7863 suspension. each sample was immersed in  a receiver broth, incubated at 37 degrees c, and checked daily for 14 days. after a 14-day incubation period, group 1 s. sanguis cells remained viable and capable  of inoculating the receiver medium after migration through the tubules. group 2 cells, where the smear layer was intact, revealed an absence of s. sanguis migration in 88% of the cases. it is therefore plausible that smear layer on canal walls limits s. sanguis penetration of dentinal tubules in vitro.

TI  == natural transformation of streptococcus crista.
AB  == over the years streptococcus gordonii (sanguis) challis has become the workhorse  of genetic manipulations for the sanguis group of oral streptococci. this is because strain challis was shown in early studies to be highly naturally competent for transformation. however, challis is not usually the most appropriate strain to use in studies which focus on oral microbial adherence. we  report that other members of the newly reorganized sanguis group, particularly within the species s. crista, display reasonable transformation frequencies, with both plasmid and chromosomal dna, if transformed at the appropriate time during the growth curve. the ability to transform s. crista may be especially important  for genetic studies of biological properties that appear to be limited to these specific streptococcal strains.

TI  == treatment of endocarditis with teicoplanin: a retrospective analysis of 104 cases.
AB  == infective endocarditis is an uncommon disease but retains a high mortality. glycopeptides are used for patients with resistant pathogens, those allergic to penicillins or for those outside the hospital. the once daily administration of teicoplanin and its low toxicity suggest that it would be suitable for use in the long courses required for endocarditis. however, the dosage and combinations to be used require further study. a retrospective review has been made of 104 episodes of endocarditis treated with teicoplanin in 101 patients seen over 7 years. most patients had been referred to major london hospitals following failure of medical treatment. after three loading doses of 400 mg, teicoplanin was given at a dose of 400 mg/day in combination with other antibiotics such as gentamicin. follow up was for one year. the most common pathogens were streptococcus sanguis (15 cases), staphylococcus aureus (13 cases) and staphylococcus epidermidis (10 cases). of 80 patients febrile at the start of treatment with teicoplanin, 63 (79%) lost their fever within a median of 2 days (1-35 days). cure without surgery was effected in 50 (48%) and 75% of patients survived. other antibiotics, usually gentamicin or rifampicin, were used in 92 (90%) of patients. two strains of streptococcus spp. were said to be resistant but there was no relationship between mic of teicoplanin and outcome. pathogens with a high mbc tended to be more likely to resist treatment. adverse effects resulted in the withdrawal of teicoplanin in 20 cases (19%) but most events were  mild and renal deterioration occurred in only five patients. teicoplanin was effective in the treatment of endocarditis and appeared to be safe given the severity of disease in the patients treated.

TI  == evidence for the involvement of complement proteins in platelet aggregation by streptococcus sanguis nctc 7863.
AB  == we investigated the mechanisms of platelet aggregation by the type strain of streptococcus sanguis (nctc 7863). this species is one of the major aetiological  agents of infective endocarditis. s. sanguis nctc 7863 caused aggregation of normal human platelets in vitro following a lag period that varied between donors (7-19 min). platelet aggregation was dependent on one or more plasma constituents and all the necessary factors gradually became bound to the bacterial surface during the lag period. the length of the lag period was determined by the plasma  of the donor and not by a feature of their platelets. platelet aggregation by s.  sanguis nctc 7863 could be inhibited by heating plasma at 56 degrees c, by treating plasma with cobra venom factor, or by incubating with soluble complement receptor 1, all of which inhibit or deplete complement. complement activation required mg2+, but not ca2+ ions and the the cleavage fragment, ba, of factor b was produced, indicating that the alternative pathway was operative. zymosan- and s. sanguis-induced aggregation showed similarities, including the same variability in lag times among donors, and absorption of plasma with zymosan prevented the plasma from supporting platelet aggregation by s. sanguis, c3, c9 and vitronectin were found to bind to s. sanguis nctc 7863, but the latter two were present at very low levels on a non-aggregating strain of s. sanguis, sk96.  the rate of assembly of the c5b-9 complex on the nctc 7863 bacterial surface correlated with the lag time. these data suggest a role for the complement pathway in platelet aggregation by the type strain of s. sanguis.

AB  == the effect of streptococcus sanguis, s. salivarius, escherichia coli and porphyromonas gingivalis on the adhesion of candida albicans and c. krusei to human buccal epithelial cells (bec) was investigated with a modified membrane filter system. the filters (12 microns diameter pores) acted as a support for the bec which were pre-exposed to known concentrations of bacterial suspensions (for  45 min-1 h), and then re-incubated with standardised concentrations of yeast suspensions for various periods. the bec with adherent yeasts were then transferred on to a glass slide, gram-stained and counted by light microscopy. three of the four bacterial species significantly suppressed adhesion of c. albicans to bec; s. sanguis had no effect. both s. sanguis and s. salivarius suppressed adhesion of c. krusei to bec pre-exposed to three different bacterial  concentrations, although variable results were obtained with p. gingivalis and e. coli. significant differences in the relative adhesion of c. albicans and c. krusei to bec were also recorded. these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to bec is modulated both by the composition and the quantity of the pre-existing bacterial flora on the bec.

TI  == utilization of sialic acid by viridans streptococci.
AB  == the importance of viridans streptococci as agents of serious extra-oral diseases, including endocarditis, is now recognized. we have tested the hypothesis that the ability to utilize sialic acid as a nutrient source may play a role in the proliferation of these organisms. the type strains of the 15 presently recognized species of viridans streptococci and two clinical isolates-s. oralis (ar3), isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis, and s. intermedius (uns35),  a brain abscess isolate-were studied for their ability to utilize sialic acid. only s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. mitis ("oralis group") s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus ("milleri group"), and s. defectivus ("nutritionally variant group") were able to use sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic  acid) efficiently as a sole carbon source. formate, acetate, and ethanol were produced as the major metabolic end-products of sialic acid metabolism, while corresponding glucose-grown cultures produced lactate as the major metabolic end-product. utilization of sialic acid was independent of the production of sialidase. cell-free extracts of sialic acid-grown cultures expressed elevated levels of n-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase (npl; the first enzyme in the intracellular catabolism of sialic acid) and n-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (glcnac-6-p) deacetylase and glucosamine-6-phosphate (glcn-6-p) deaminase (enzymes involved in the intracellular catabolism of n-acetylglucosamine). these  activities were repressed by growth in the presence of glucose. the intracellular fate of sialic acid, after cleavage by npl into n-acetylmannosamine (mannac) and  pyruvate, is uncertain, but the elevated levels of glcnac-6-p deacetylase and glcn-6-p deaminase in sialic acid-grown cells suggest that phosphorylation and isomerization are possible steps in the metabolism of mannac to generate an intermediate common to the pathway of n-acetylglucosamine metabolism. the species of viridans streptococci that have the ability to utilize sialic acid are those most commonly associated with extra-oral diseases, and this ability is likely to  play a role in the persistence and survival of these infecting organisms in vivo.

TI  == influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (gpb). previous investigations showed that the macrophage  scavenger receptor (sr), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many gpb, possibly via lta. sr binding to other ligands is dependent  upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand.  we therefore investigated sr recognition of lta species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these ltas to compete  with the binding of metabolically labeled sr to beads coated with the known sr ligand polyguanylic acid. staphylococcus aureus lta, a classical lta type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane  diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for inhibition of sr binding of 0.84 microg/ml. when the s. aureus lta was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the ic50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. other polyglycerophosphate ltas from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, listeria monocytogenes, listeria welshimeri, and streptococcus sanguis showed ic50s of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to sr. accordingly, the zwitterionic lta of streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium innocuum lta substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. the data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated lta as a major ligand of gpb for binding to sr. whether binding of lta and whole gpb to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.

AB  == objective: to identify the incidence, causative organisms, and clinical outcomes  of eyes with bleb-associated endophthalmitis after glaucoma filtering procedures  with adjunctive mitomycin. methods: retrospective analysis of 773 consecutive eyes that underwent glaucoma filtering surgery at the bascom palmer eye institute, miami, fla. the course of 609 eyes from 485 patients with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up were reviewed. results: mean follow-up was 16.0 +/- 11.5 months (range, 3-48 months). of the 609 eyes, 13 (2.1%) developed bleb-associated endophthalmitis an average of 18.5 +/- 13.2 months after surgery (range, 1-45 months). the incidence of bleb-associated endophthalmitis was significantly greater after inferior trabeculectomy (7.8% per patient-year) than after superior trabeculectomy (1.3% per patient-year) by kaplan-meier estimates (p = .02, log rank test). the cumulative incidence was 13% for inferior limbal blebs and 1.6% for superior limbal blebs. nine (69.2%) of the 13 eyes were culture positive. streptococcus sanguis and haemophilus influenzae (6/13 [46.2%]) were the most frequent causative organisms. the mean increase in intraocular pressure after endophthalmitis treatment was 1.2 mm hg, with a mean decrease in visual acuity of 1.42 logmar units. eight (61.5%) of the 13 eyes had a final acuity of 20/400 or better. conclusions: the incidence of bleb-associated endophthalmitis after guarded filtering surgery performed with adjunctive mitomycin is higher than the  reported rate in eyes undergoing filtering surgery without the use of antifibrotic agents (0.2%-1.5%). inferior limbal trabeculectomy carries the highest risk of infection. eyes with mitomycin blebs maintained excellent filtration capacity. however, after treatment of the infection, the visual outcomes were generally poor.

TI  == induced candidosis in mice with artificially established oral flora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to gauge the effect of an artificially established flora, unnatural for mice, on the induction of oral candidosis in mice. four groups of balb/c mice were compared; conventional candida albicans-free mice, "germ-free" mice which had been inoculated with candida-free human saliva, germ-free mice which had been exposed to a cocktail of streptococcus mitis, s. sobrinus and s. sanguis, and uncontaminated germ-free mice. after exposure to c.  albicans via drinking water, the four groups of mice were killed and their oral cavities examined for candidal growth and oral lesions. conventional mice yielded significantly less candidal growth and exhibited significantly fewer oral lesions than the other three groups. candidal lesions in the two groups of contaminated germ-free mice were significantly fewer than in the uncontaminated germ-free mice. the latter exhibited extensive candidal lesions with little inflammatory infiltrate. it is concluded that mice with human oral micro-organisms have some resistance against candidal infection albeit at a reduced level, that mice with natural oral flora are highly resistant, and that germ-free mice are extremely susceptible to c. albicans infection.

TI  == the effect of smear layer on microbial coronal leakage of gutta-percha root fillings.
AB  == the aim of this in vitro study was to determine the effect of removal of the smear layer on canal obturation as measured by penetration of bacteria from a coronal direction. one hundred and twenty extracted human teeth with straight, single root canals were decoronated. the canals were prepared using the modified  double-flared technique with balanced force under copious irrigation. the apical  matrix was prepared to size 40 and apical patency subsequently confirmed with a size 15 file. the teeth were divided randomly into experimental groups (80 teeth) and control groups (40 teeth). the root canals of 40 experimental and 20 control  teeth were rinsed with 40% citric acid and 2% naocl to remove the smear layer before obturation. in experimental groups, 20 teeth with smear layer intact and 20 teeth with smear layer removed were obturated with lateral condensation of cold gutta-percha and apexit sealer. a further 20 teeth with smear layer intact and 20 teeth with smear layer removed were obturated with the trifecta technique  with the same sealer. in control groups, 10 teeth with smear layer intact and 10  teeth with smear layer removed were obturated with lateral condensation of cold gutta-percha and apexit sealer. these teeth were completely sealed both coronally and apically to serve as negative controls. the remaining 20 teeth with either smear layer intact or smear layer removed were not obturated and served as the positive controls. the root surface of each tooth was sealed with nail varnish. the cut end of a polypropylene tube was sealed around the coronal part of each root canal so that bacteria placed therein could move only through the obturated  canal space. each root was placed in a glass bottle containing sterile todd-hewitt broth (thb) and aliquots of 0.5 ml of thb were injected into the polypropylene tube. the model system was centrifuged at 168 g. an innoculum of streptococcus sanguis in thb was placed in each coronal chamber at 5-day intervals and daily observations were made for bacterial growth in the apical reservoir for 90 days. all positive control teeth showed bacterial penetration within 24 h, while the negative control teeth remained uncontaminated throughout  the test period. leakage through the experimental teeth was variable ranging from 7 to 86 days. there was no statistical significant difference (p > 0.05) in leakage between the obturated canal when the smear layer was either removed or intact.

TI  == experimental salivary pellicles formed on titanium surfaces mediate adhesion of streptococci.
AB  == the goal of this study was to characterize salivary components of titanium pellicles and to determine how experimental pellicles affect adhesion of several  strains of streptococci to titanium surfaces. titanium experimental pellicles were formed by incubation of fresh human parotid or human submandibular-sublingual saliva on pure titanium beads. pellicle was recovered from the beads using sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer and was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting to identify adsorbed salivary components. streptococcus anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius recovered from in vivo titanium plaque and five reference strains of streptococci were used in adhesion assays to titanium beads with and without experimental salivary pellicles. the experimental pellicle formed on titanium was found to be composed of selected proteins from human parotid and human submandibular-sublingual saliva. salivary alpha-amylase and proline-rich proteins were found in all experimental pellicles, while siga, high-molecular weight mucin, and proline-rich glycoproteins were detected in one of the experimental pellicles examined. adhesion of fresh isolates and reference stains of s. anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius to saliva-coated titanium was reduced compared to that of titanium without saliva coating. however, adhesion of laboratory strains of s. gordonii and s. sanguis was found to be significantly greater to experimental pellicles of human submandibular-sublingual saliva than was the adhesion of the fresh isolates, suggesting that streptococci-colonizing implant surfaces may be inherently less adhesive than other bacterial strains. this study found that salivary pellicles are selectively formed on titanium and mediate in vitro adhesion of streptococci.

AB  == biofilms of streptococcus sanguis and planktonic cells of the organism were exposed to chlorhexidine gluconate and cetylpyridinium chloride, at concentrations used clinically, and survivors enumerated. s. sanguis exhibited a  lower susceptibility to both antiseptics when it comprised a biofilm than when the organism was in the planktonic form. no viable bacteria were detectable after 5 min of exposure of planktonic cells to 0.2% (w/v) chlorhexidine gluconate or 0.05% (w/v) cetylpyridinium chloride, whereas viable bacterial survived in biofilms of s. sanguis even after exposure to these agents for 4 h. older biofilms (7 days old) had similar susceptibilities to the antiseptics as younger  biofilms (4 days old). chlorhexidine achieved kills corresponding to approximately a 2 log10 reduction in the viable count of biofilms, containing approximately 10(7) colony-forming units after 5 min of incubation, whereas the corresponding kills achieved by cetylpyridinium chloride amounted to approximately a 1 log10 reduction. however, on a molar basis, cetylpyridinium chloride was the more effective of the two antiseptics. minimum inhibitory concentration determinations showed chlorhexidine gluconate to be more effective  against s. sanguis than cetylpyridinium chloride. the results of this study have  revealed that the minimum inhibitory concentration is not a reliable predictor of the relative effectiveness of antimicrobial agents against s. sanguis biofilms.

AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate the effect of delmopinol hydrochloride on the development of dental plaque and on newly established plaque. in addition, the influence of this compound on the composition of the microbiota colonizing the gingival mucous membrane was studied. 14 healthy male volunteers took part. after a 3 week pre-experimental period of intense oral hygiene, the participants  refrained from all oral hygiene for 14 days. the buccal surfaces of cuspids and bicuspids on one side of the jaws were treated with a 1% aqueous solution of delmopinol hydrochloride (applied with a paint brush) 2 x a day for 7 days, while the contralateral side received placebo solution. on day 7, the application procedures were changed in that the test compound was applied on the teeth previously treated with placebo and vice versa. plaque development was assessed clinically and by photo-based planimetric determination. the clinical recordings  revealed that 89.3% of the placebo-treated surfaces displayed visible plaque on day 7, compared to 6.0% of the delmopinol hydrochloride treated surfaces. delmopinol hydrochloride treatment of the previously placebo-treated surfaces resulted in a decrease in the number of surfaces with visible plaque from 89.3% on day 7 to 6% on day 14. these results were confirmed by the planimetric data. no significant change in the composition of the mucosal flora was observed during the experimental period. the present results indicate that delmopinol hydrochloride markedly reduces the formation of dental plaque on a clean tooth surface exposed to conditions which favour bacterial colonization. furthermore, the substance appears to possess plaque-dissolving properties.

TI  == late bioprosthetic valve endocarditis caused by phialemonium aff. curvatum and streptococcus sanguis: a case report.
AB  == dual fungal and streptococcus sanguis endocarditis is reported in a 63-year-old woman 7 months after placement of a porcine aortic valve prosthesis. both micro-organisms were isolated by blood cultures, and the patient succumbed after  a full course of antibacterial chemotherapy without having received antifungal chemotherapy. the best possible designation of the fungus was phialemonium aff. curvatum w. gams & w. b. cooke, as represented by cbs 331.93. at autopsy hyphae were revealed in the porcine valve tissue by conventional staining. a hyperimmune rabbit antiserum raised towards strain cbs 331.93 and extensively absorbed with heterologous fungal antigens reacted strongly with hyphae in the valve tissue by  indirect immunofluorescence technique. we consider it most likely that the phialemonium infection evolved insidiously from the time of open heart surgery and led to a haematogenous streptococcal infection of a more fulminant course.

AB  == this study was conducted to observe the differences between the adsorption of streptococcus sanguis by saliva-coated and non-saliva-coated cells (plain cells)  to the surfaces of saliva-coated, bovine serum albumin-coated or buffer-washed hydroxyapatite beads. saliva treatment of bacterial cells altered the manner of saturation due to changes of affinity and/or the maximal number of adsorption sites on the hydroxyapatite beads. this result indicates that saliva treatment of bacterial cells might be a necessary step in testing bacterial adsorption to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads or saliva-coated teeth.

TI  == effects of sublethal exposure to an antiseptic mouthrinse on representative plaque bacteria.
AB  == although the mechanism responsible for the clinical antiplaque efficacy of oral antiseptics is generally considered to be primarily one of bactericidal activity, it has been suggested that oral antiseptics may have additional effects on bacteria exposed to sublethal levels. studies reported herein, investigated the effects of sublethal levels of an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse  (listerine antiseptic, warner-lambert co., morris plains, nj) on selected activities of representative plaque microorganisms using in vitro models. these studies demonstrated that sublethal exposure to the tested oral antiseptic can have significant effects in reducing intergeneric coaggregation, increasing bacterial generation time, and extracting endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria.  these in vitro activities can be correlated with features of plaque formation and pathogenicity seen in vivo; however, additional studies will be necessary to confirm that these mechanisms are, in fact, operative clinically.

AB  == the effect of four different species of oral bacteria (streptococci (x 2); escherichia; porphyromonas) on the adhesion of candida albicans and candida krusei to denture acrylic surfaces was studied using a previously described in vitro adhesion assay. clear acrylic strips immersed in known concentrations of bacterial suspensions and incubated for 45 min to 1 h, at 37 degrees c, were transferred to yeast suspensions of known concentrations and incubated for a similar period, and the adherent yeasts were quantified using an image analysis system. pre-exposure to different bacterial concentrations resulted in suppression of candidal adhesion to varying degrees. of three selected concentrations, exposure to the highest bacterial concentration (10(6) organisms/ml) resulted in a consistent reduction in candidal adhesion, except for e. coli-c. albicans and s. salivarius-c. albicans combinations. candidal adhesion was significantly reduced on pre-exposure to s. sanguis and p. gingivalis, but not e. coli. there were also significant differences in relative adhesion between c. albicans and c. krusei. taken together, these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to acrylic strips is modulated both by the quantity and the quality of pre-existing bacterial flora on acrylic surfaces.

AB  == thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate pd measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. microbial samples were taken from  11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. standard deviations of replicate pd measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with pd change. baseline and follow-up distributions of pd changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. sites from 2 subjects showed pd increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. species associated with putative active subjects included actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, selenomonas noxia and prevotella nigrescens. streptococcus sanguis, s. gordonii and peptostreptococcus micros were associated  with inactive subjects. s. gordonii and s. oralis were associated with health, whereas p. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. elevated serum antibodies were detected to a. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. the predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.

TI  == resistance of streptococcus sanguis biofilms to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria living in biofilms as dental plaque on tooth surfaces are generally more resistant to antimicrobial agents than bacteria in batch culture normally used for in vitro susceptibility testing. in order to compare the resistance of free-living and surface-grown oral bacteria, the mic of streptococcus sanguis 804 and atcc 10556 to amoxicillin, doxycycline and chlorhexidine was determined by a  broth dilution method. subsequently, s. sanguis biofilms established in an in vitro flow model were perfused with the antimicrobial agents for 48 h at concentrations equal to and up to 500 times the mic, and biofilm cell number was  determined during this period. the antibiotics at the mic did not affect the cell number of s. sanguis biofilms compared to the starting point, and only after 48 h at 500 times the mic were the biofilm bacteria eliminated. at intermediate concentrations biofilm cell number gradually decreased. chlorhexidine also gradually reduced biofilm cell number, but was inhibitory at concentrations closer to the mic than was the case for the antibiotics. thus s. sanguis in biofilms survived up to 500 times the mic found in batch culture for up to 48 h.

AB  == we have developed a host-vector system for heterologous expression in streptococcus gordonii (sg) challis (formerly streptococcus sanguis), a commensal bacterium of the human oral cavity. the system is based on (i) integration of plasmid insertion vectors into the chromosome of specially engineered recipient hosts, and (ii) the use of the m6-protein-encoding gene (emm6) as a partner for construction of translational gene fusions. m6 is a streptococcal surface protein already proven useful as a fusion partner for the delivery of foreign antigens to the surface of sg [pozzi et al., infect. immun. 60 (1992) 1902-1907]. insertion vectors carry a drug-resistance marker, different portions of emm6 and a multiple cloning site to allow construction of a variety of emm6-based fusions. upon transformation of a recipient host with an insertion vector, 100% of transformants acquire both the drug-resistance marker and the capacity of displaying the m6 molecule on the cell surface. chromosomal integration occurred  at high frequency in recipient host gp1221. transformation with 1 microgram of insertion vector dna yielded 8.1 x 10(5) transformants per ml of competent cells.

AB  == the stsi restriction endonuclease (r-stsi), a class-iis restriction endonuclease, found in streptococcus sanguis 54, is a heteroschizomer of r-foki, which recognizes 5'-ggatg-3'. to overproduce r-stsi in escherichia coli, the coding region of r-stsi was joined to the tac promoter of an expression vector, pkk223-3. by introduction of the plasmid into e. coli ut481 cells expressing the  fokim gene, r-stsi activity was overproduced, from which r-stsi was purified homogeneously. we compared the properties of r-stsi with those of r-foki. the optimum reaction conditions for r-stsi were quite different fron those for r-foki. r-stsi is an acidic protein (pi 6.3). anti-r-stsi serum did not cross-react with r-foki, indicating three-dimensional structural dissimilarity. the domain structure of r-stsi was elucidated by digestion with trypsin. in the presence of substrate dna, r-stsi was digested to yield 45-kda n-terminal and 23-kda c-terminal fragments. the amino-acid sequences around the trypsin cleavage sites of r-stsi and r-foki were quite homologous.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to examine the inhibitory effects of aqueous extracts derived from the bark-containing sticks (neem stick) of azadirachta indica upon bacterial aggregation, growth, adhesion to hydroxyapatite, and production of insoluble glucan, which may affect in vitro plaque formation. neem stick extracts were screened for minimal bacterial growth  inhibition (mic) against a panel of streptococci by means of a broth dilution assay. initial bacterial attachment was quantified by the measurement of the adhesion of 3h-labeled streptococcus sanguis to saliva-conditioned synthetic hydroxyapatite. the effect of the neem stick extract upon insoluble glucan synthesis was measured by the uptake of radiolabeled glucose from 14c-sucrose. aggregating activity of the neem stick extracts upon a panel of streptococci was  also examined. no inhibition of bacterial growth was observed among the streptococcal strains tested in the presence of < or = 320 micrograms/ml of the neem stick extract. the pre-treatment of s. sanguis with the neem stick extract or the gallotannin-enriched extract from melaphis chinensis at 250 micrograms/ml  resulted in a significant inhibition of the bacterial adhesion to saliva-conditioned hydroxyapatite. pre-treatment of saliva-conditioned hydroxyapatite with the neem stick or gallotannin-rich extract prior to exposure  to bacteria yielded significant reductions in bacterial adhesion. the neem stick  extract and the gallotannin-enriched extract from melaphis chinensis inhibited insoluble glucan synthesis. incubation of oral streptococci with the neem stick extract resulted in a microscopically observable bacteria aggregation. these data suggest that neem stick extract can reduce the ability of some streptococci to colonize tooth surfaces.

TI  == co-adhesion of oral microbial pairs under flow in the presence of saliva and lactose.
AB  == co-aggregation (interactions between two suspended micro-organisms) between oral  microbial pairs has been studied extensively and is believed to be an important factor in dental plaque formation. however, co-adhesion (interactions between suspended and already-adhering micro-organisms) may well be equally important. the aim of this paper was to determine the influence of saliva and lactose on the co-adhesion of streptococci (s. oralis 34 and s. sanguis pk1889) to actinomyces (a. naeslundii t14v-j1 or 5951) adhering on glass under flow from buffer and saliva in the absence and presence of lactose. the kinetics of co-adhesion as well as co-adhesion in a stationary end-point of co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating pairs was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber by analysis of the spatial arrangement of co-adhering micro-organisms as a function of time.  for co-aggregating pairs, initial deposition rates of streptococci in the immediate vicinity of adhering actinomyces (local initial deposition rates) were  up to 5 to 10 times higher than the non-local initial deposition rates in buffer  and in saliva, respectively. in a stationary end-point of co-adhesion, 5 to 6 times more streptococci co-adhered with the adhering actinomyces than averaged over the entire substratum surface. a non-co-aggregating pair showed only minor preferential (co-)adhesion near the adhering actinomyces. co-adhesion in buffer was fully lost when lactose was added. however, addition of lactose to saliva did not inhibit co-adhesion, but co-adhesion became more reversible. detachment of micro-organisms from the substratum due to the passage of an air-liquid interface, as occurs in the oral cavity during eating, drinking, and speaking, was minimal when deposition was carried out from buffer to bare glass. major detachment of streptococci adhering to the substratum occurred when adhesion was  mediated through a salivary conditioning film on the glass, while detachment of adhering actinomyces and streptococci co-adhering with them remained low. it is suggested that, in the development of dental plaque, adhering actinomyces may act as strongholds for other micro-organisms, like streptococci, to adhere.

TI  == influence of monocytes and antibiotic treatment on tissue factor activity of endocardial vegetations in rabbits infected with streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == a main feature in the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis is the activation of the coagulation system via the extrinsic pathway, resulting in the formation of infected endocardial vegetations. earlier studies gave indirect evidence that monocytes play an important role in the procoagulant response during the course of the disease. in this study, we assessed the role of monocytes more directly. we compared weights and tissue factor activities (tfa) of endocardial vegetations of normal rabbits infected with streptococcus sanguis with those of rabbits which were treated with the cytostatic drug etoposide (vepesid; bristol-myers squibb b.v.) to induce a selective monocytopenia. furthermore, the importance of the presence of bacteria was determined through the influence of antibiotic treatment on tfa, vegetational weight, and infection of the vegetations. the tfa of the vegetations was measured chromogenically by monitoring the factor vii-dependent activation of factor x with an amidolytic assay for factor xa. we found that the  degree of infection and the weight of vegetations of rabbits treated with the cytostatic drug etoposide did not differ from that of untreated rabbits. their tfa, however, was significantly lower than the tfa of vegetations of rabbits not  treated with etoposide. we also found that, as with the monocytopenic rabbits, the weight of the vegetations was not reduced in penicillin g-treated rabbits. the degree of infection and tfa, however, were significantly lower. we conclude that monocytes indeed are involved in the activation of the coagulation system during the course of bacterial endocarditis and that the degree of infection is positively correlated to the tfa of the vegetations.

TI  == platelet-streptococcal interactions in endocarditis.
AB  == infective endocarditis is characterized by the formation of septic masses of platelets on the surfaces of heart valves and is most commonly caused by viridans streptococci. streptococcal virulence in endocarditis involves factors that promote infectivity and pathogenicity. adhesins and exopolysaccharide (glycocalyx) contribute to infectivity. although many factors may contribute to pathogenicity, the platelet aggregation-associated protein (paap) of streptococcus sanguis contributes directly to the development of experimental endocarditis. paap is synthesized as a rhamnose-rich glycoprotein of 115 kda and  contains a collagen-like platelet-interactive domain, pro-gly-glu-gln-gly-pro-lys. expressed on the cell wall of platelet aggregation-inducing strains (agg+) of s. sanguis, paap apparently interacts with a signal-transducing receptor complex on platelets, which includes a novel 175-kda alpha 2-integrin-associated protein and a 65-kda collagen-binding component. from available data, the role of paap in the pathogenesis of experimental endocarditis may be explained by a proposed mechanistic model. on injured heart valves, paap first enhances platelet accumulation into a fibrin-enmeshed thrombus (vegetation), within which s. sanguis colonizes. colonizing bacteria must resist platelet microbicidal protein (pmpr). the aggregation of platelets on the heart valve may be potentiated by an ectoatpase expressed on the surface of the s. sanguis and platelet alpha-adrenoreceptors that respond to endogenous catecholamines. the expression of paap may be modified during infection. collagen is exposed on damaged heart valves; fever (heat shock) occurs during endocarditis. in response to heat shock or collagen in vitro, paap  expression is altered. after colonization, streptococcal exotoxin(s) may cause fever. proteases and other enzymes from streptococci and host sources may directly destroy the heart valves. when paap is unexpressed or neutralized with specific antibodies, experimental endocarditis runs a milder course and vegetations are smaller. the data suggest strongly, therefore, that the role of paap may overlap the colonization function of putative adhesins such as fima or ssab. finally, paap also contributes to the development of the characteristic septic mural thrombus (vegetation) of infective endocarditis and the signs of valvular pathology.

AB  == this study describes the effects of varnish containing 40% chlorhexidine diacetate on actinomyces naeslundii populations in plaque from human molar fissures. in each of 15 subjects two dental fissures with high levels of mutants  streptococci were selected. the experimental treatment consisted of the single application of a small amount of chlorhexidine varnish onto the selected fissures. the varnish was removed 15 min after application. one month after varnish application a significant increase was observed in a. naeslundii counts while the number of mutans streptococci had decreased significantly compared with preexperimental levels. from 85 randomly selected actinomyces isolates taken from blood agar plates before varnish application, 44% belonged to a. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 56% to a. naeslundii genospecies 2. from 106 isolates taken 1 month after chlorhexidine varnish application, 42% belonged to a. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 58% to a. naeslundii genospecies 2. at baseline 28% of a. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were catalase-positive, but 1 month after varnish application 4% of the strains were catalase-positive (p < 0.05). it is concluded that chlorhexidine varnish application caused an increase of a. naeslundii in dental plaque, but induced no significant changes in the distribution of the two a. naeslundii genospecies.

TI  == inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of mutans streptococci.
AB  == funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed gloiopeltis furcata strongly inhibited the absorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha), but enhanced that of streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 and  streptococcus oralis atcc 10557. furthermore, funoran had a strong desorption activity against mutans streptococci preadsorbed to s-ha. in the presence of sucrose, the absorption of cells of streptococcus sobrinus b13, streptococcus mutans ingbritt, and s. mutans mt8148r to s-ha was strongly inhibited by 0.01% funoran. the colonization of s. sobrinus 6715 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats that were administered funoran was less frequent than that in a funoran-free group. the mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores  of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group.

TI  == photodynamic effects of toluidine blue on human oral keratinocytes and fibroblasts and streptococcus sanguis evaluated in vitro.
AB  == background and objective: some oral bacteria are susceptible to killing by red light after their sensitization with toluidine blue o (tbo). the photochemotherapy of periodontal disease in vivo would require a therapeutic window where bacteria could be killed without adjacent normal tissue damage. study design/materials and methods: the laser-induced effects of tbo on normal human gingival keratinocytes and fibroblasts have been studied in vitro. for the  assessment of viability, the celltiter 96tm aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay was used. results: tbo was cytotoxic at low concentrations (5.0 micrograms/ml). sensitization of keratinocytes and fibroblasts with 2 and 5.0 micrograms/ml tbo, respectively, for 5 min and exposure to light from a 7.3 mw helium/neon (hene) laser for up to 2 min (0.876j) did not reduce cell viability. however, killing of streptococcus sanguis was achieved following exposure to hene light for 75 sec (0.547j) in the presence of tbo at a concentration of 2.5 micrograms/ml. conclusion: the development of a system for the lethal photosensitization of bacteria responsible for periodontal disease may be possible.

TI  == identification and characterization of the genes of enterococcus faecalis plasmid pcf10 involved in replication and in negative control of pheromone-inducible conjugation.
AB  == the prgb gene of the enterococcus faecalis pheromone-inducible conjugative plasmid pcf10 encodes the surface protein asc10. this protein mediates cell aggregation and its expression results in high-frequency transfer of the plasmid  from donor to recipient. to identify the minimum region necessary for negative regulation of prgb expression, target plasmids were constructed containing a recently identified positive control region and a prgb::lacz transcriptional fusion; expression of prgb in cells carrying these plasmids was thus verified by  beta-galactosidase assay. the target plasmids were used in genetic studies with compatible plasmids containing cloned pcf10 genes supplying putative negative control functions to define the minimum region of pcf10 required for shutdown of  prgb expression in the absence of exogenous pheromone. the minimum segment required for negative control, as indentified by deletion analysis, was a 6.9-kb  region extending from the 5' end of a gene called prgn, through a previously identified gene, prgx. the dna in this region, which had not been previously characterized (2.85 kb), was sequenced, and several potential regulatory genes and plasmid replication genes were identified. genetic analysis indicated that the prgn, -y, and -x genes are involved in negative control; prgw may also play a role in negative control, since it appeared to be required for expression of prgy. prgx, or a closely adjacent dna sequence, acted in cis. the region of pcf10 containing negative control genes was also shown to function as an autonomous replicon in e. faecalis.

TI  == prb1, prb2, and prb4 coded polymorphisms among human salivary concanavalin-a binding, ii-1, and po proline-rich proteins.
AB  == six closely linked prp (proline-rich protein) genes code for many salivary prps that show frequent length and null variants. from determined protein sequences and dna sequence analysis of variant alleles, we here report the coding and molecular basis for con (concanavalin a-binding) and po (parotid "o") protein polymorphisms. the con1 glycoprotein is encoded in exon 3 of a prb2 allele (prb2l con1+) with a potential n-linked glycosylation site. because of a probable gene conversion encompassing > or = 684 bp of dna, the "prb2-like" con2 glycoprotein is encoded in exon 3 of a prb1 allele (prb1m con2+) with a potential glycosylation site. the pmf protein is also encoded in the prb1m con2+ allele, thus explaining the previously reported association between con2 and pmf proteins. a prb2l con1 allele contains a single nt missense change [tct(ser)-->cct (pro)] that abolishes the potential n-linked glycosylation site (nks-->nkp) in the con1 protein, and this explains the con- type. the po protein  and a glycoprotein (ii-1) are encoded in the prb4 gene, and both proteins are absent in the presence of a mutation in the prb4m po- allele that contains a single nt change (g--c) at the +1 invariant position of the intron 3 5'donor splice site. the genetically determined absence of the ii-1 glycoprotein leads to altered in vitro binding of streptococcus sanguis 10556 to salivary proteins, which suggests a biological consequence for null mutations of the prb4 gene.

TI  == effect of titanium on selected oral bacterial species in vitro.
AB  == titanium granules were tested for their antibacterial effect on strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, haemophilus parainfluenzae, fusobacterium spp. and prevotella intermedia in comparison with amalgam and two of its components, copper and tin. glass beads were used as controls. the number of viable bacteria was estimated in samples exposed to the various materials for 1, 3, 6 and 24 h, respectively, and the viable counts were  related to the baseline value. titanium showed low antibacterial effect on the species tested. copper and amalgam showed an expressed toxicity to all species and differed significantly from titanium and glass particles. gram positive streptococcus spp. and a. naeslundii showed a lower susceptibility to the metals  than the gram negative species. the antibacterial effect of copper and amalgam test particles on s. sanguis and p. intermedia was significantly decreased in the presence of serum. this study showed that some metals have a toxic effect in vitro on oral bacteria, a fact that may play a role in plaque formation when these materials are used for dental restorations. titanium did not have a similar antibacterial effect.

TI  == enhanced bactericidal activity of arm and hammer dental care.
AB  == purpose: to compare and contrast antibacterial activities of a baking soda-containing dentifrice, arm and hammer dental care (ahdc) with two fluoride dentifrices without baking soda (crest and colgate). materials and methods: a biphasic approach was taken, utilizing newly-developed laboratory model systems to: (1) assess the activity of brief exposure to dentifrices on single and mixed  cultures; and (2) determine the effect of multiple, short-term exposure of sucrose-colonized streptococcus mutans to simulate cumulative activity against cariogenic plaque. results: the short-term exposure assays revealed that s. mutans was significantly more susceptible to ahdc than either crest of colgate (p<0.05). moreover, exposure of mixed suspensions of bacteria by ahdc resulted in complete killing of actinomyces viscosus and significantly greater decreases in s. mutans (p<0.05). this enhanced bactericidal effect was not due to an alkaline  ph as ph-adjusted ahdc solutions exhibited similar activity. the comprehensive in vitro plaque studies showed that exposure of colonized s. mutans to ahdc resulted in significantly greater decreases in numbers of viable cells than crest (p<0.05). under the conditions employed, the baking soda-containing ahdc exhibited greater antibacterial efficacy overall than the standard crest or colgate pastes. these studies suggest that the use of ahdc may provide additional clinical benefit as a result of the enhanced bactericidal activity.

TI  == simultaneous monitoring of intracellular ph and proton excretion during glycolysis by streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis: effect of low ph and fluoride.
AB  == a system was developed by which 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-4 or 5-carboxyfluorescein could be used to monitor intracellular ph at the same time that proton excretion  was being measured. streptococcal cells were loaded with the dye, and after the addition of glucose protons were excreted and the intracellular ph increased quickly and remained higher than the extracellular ph of 7.0. the excretion of protons stopped and the intracellular ph returned to the original level when glucose was depleted. the intracellular level of atp remained high during glucose metabolism and decreased with the depletion of glucose. at extracellular ph of 5.5, and 5.0, the intracellular ph of fasting cells was higher than the extracellular ph value. after addition of glucose there were initial lags of proton excretion and of increases in intracellular ph at the acidic extracellular ph values. in the presence of fluoride, a lag in proton excretion and a simultaneous decrease in intracellular ph were observed, indicating a partial and transient inhibition of proton-atpase activity.

TI  == modulation of glycosidase and protease activities by chemostat growth conditions  in an endocarditis strain of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the effects of growth conditions on the properties of the endocarditis-producing  oral bacterium streptococcus sanguis fss2 were studied. this strain produces a variety of proteases and glycosidases, including a thrombin-like activity that is a potential virulence factor for endocarditis. cultures were grown with limiting  glucose or galactose in chemostats over a range of dilution rates and ph levels,  and the following activities were measured at ph 7.5: thrombin-like, hageman factor-like, n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase, beta-d-glucosidase, and beta-d-galactosidase. at growth ph 6.5, specific activities generally decreased as the dilution rate increased from 0.05 to 0.40 h(-1). at a dilution rate of 0.1 h(-1), specific activities generally were highest at growth ph 6.5 and lower and  approximately equal at growth ph 5.5 and 7.5. the major exception was the thrombin-like activity, for which the specific activity at growth ph 7.5 was approximately 5-fold higher than at growth ph 5.5. hageman factor-like activity was apparently glucose catabolite repressible, as its activity was 3-fold higher  in galactose cultures. the measured activities changed as functions of growth conditions and thus were modulated by environment. environmental regulation of thrombin-like activity by ph is consistent with an activity that is less important on tooth surfaces than in tissues.

AB  == platelets aggregate in response to an adhesin and the platelet aggregation-associated protein (paap) expressed on the cell surfaces of certain strains of streptococcus sanguis. we sought to identify the corresponding paap receptor and accessory adhesin binding sites on platelets. since the adhesion(s)  of s. sanguis for platelets has not been characterized, an anti-idiotype (anti-id) murine monoclonal antibody (mab2) strategy was developed. first, mab1s  that distinguished the adhesin and paap antigens on the surface of s. sanguis i 133-79 were selected. fab fragments of mab1.2 (immunoglobulin g2b [igg2b]; 70 pmol) reacted with 5 x 10(7) cells of s. sanguis to completely inhibit the aggregation of human platelets in plasma. under similar conditions, mab1.1 (igg1) inhibited the adhesion of s. sanguis cells to platelets by a maximum of 34%, with a comparatively small effect on platelet aggregation. together, these two mab1s inhibited s. sanguis-platelet adhesion by 63%. in western immunoblots, both mab1s reacted with s. sanguis 133-79 87- and 150-kda surface proteins and mab1.2 also reacted with purified type i collagen. the hybridomas producing mab1.1 and mab1.2 were then injected into balb/c mice. enlarged spleens were harvested, and a panel of mab2 hybridomas was prepared. to identify anti-ids against the specific mab1s, the mab2 panel was screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for reaction with rabbit polyclonal igg antibodies against the 87- and 150-kda antigens. the reactions between the specific rabbit antibodies and anti-ids were inhibited by the 87- and 150-kda antigens. when preincubated with platelets, mab2.1 (counterpart of mab1.1) inhibited adhesion to platelets maximally by 46% and mab2.2 (anti-mab1.2) inhibited adhesion to platelets maximally by 35%. together,  both mab2s inhibited the adhesion of s. sanguis to platelets by 81%. mab2.2 also  inhibited induction of platelet aggregation. mab2.2 immunoprecipitated a biotinylated platelet membrane antigen of 170 kda (unreduced); mab2.1 precipitated membrane antigens of 175- and 230-kda (unreduced). therefore, platelet binding sites and the receptor for the s. sanguis adhesin and paap, respectively, are distinguished by the anti-id mab2s.

AB  == by using an in vitro bone-forming culture system, the chick periosteal osteogenesis (cpo) model, the direct effects on osteogenesis of sonicated extracts derived from oral bacteria were examined. both extracts from bacterial species having strong associations with periodontal diseases (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia, hereinafter referred to as suspected periodontopathogens) and extracts from species not correlated with periodontal disease (streptococcus sanguis, veillonella atypica, and prevotella denticola, hereinafter referred to as nonpathogenic bacteria) were tested. all bacterial cultures were grown under standard anaerobic culture conditions. sonicated bacterial extracts were prepared from the bacterial pellet. these were added in various proportions to the cpo cultures. parameters of osteogenesis, including alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium and p(i) accumulation, and collagen synthesis, were measured in 6-day-old cultures. compared with controls grown in the absence of bacterial products, osteogenesis was inhibited significantly in cultures treated with extracts derived from the suspected periodontopathogens. no osteogenic inhibition was observed in cultures treated with extracts from the nonpathogenic bacteria. these results suggest that the ability to inhibit osteogenesis in vitro may be a pathogenic property shared by a limited group of species. further characterization of the p. gingivalis extracts revealed that both proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous products, including lipopolysaccharide, were able to inhibit osteogenesis. p. gingivalis extract-mediated inhibition of osteogenesis in cpo cultures was blocked by indomethacin, implicating prostaglandins in the regulation of the bacterial effects. the bacterial extracts had either reversible or irreversible inhibitory effects on osteogenesis when added after differentiation or before/during differentiation of bone cells, respectively.

TI  == adsorption of saliva-coated and just-harvested streptococcus sanguis to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads.
AB  == it is possible that salivary proteins on bacterial cells have some influence on the adsorption of oral bacteria to the surface of oral tissues. the aim of this study was to clarify the influence of salivary proteins attached to the surface of streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 (s. sanguis) on bacterial adsorption to hydroxyapatite beads treated with salivary proteins (s-ha beads). just-harvested  cells (n-system) and saliva-coated cells (c-system) were used. the results showed that adsorption to s-ha beads was gradually reduced by a covering of salivary proteins. no influence was observed on the adsorption of cells due to the presence of divalent cations, phosphate or edta when the n-system and c-system were compared. though it was evident that hydrophobic bonding was involved in adsorption in the n-system, few such effects were observed in the c-system. adsorption was inhibited to varying degrees by sugars in both systems. pretreatment of cells with heat affected adsorption differently in the n-system and c-system. these findings suggest that salivary proteins attached to the bacterial cell surface may influence its adsorption to oral tissues.

TI  == insertional inactivation of binding determinants of streptococcus crista cc5a using tn916.
AB  == intermicrobial binding plays an important role in the ecology of the oral cavity  because it represents one mechanism by which specific bacteria colonize dental plaque. the formation of "corncobs", a morphologically distinct microbial unit composed of streptococcus crista and fusobacterium nucleatum, is a highly specific binding interaction that depends on the presence of polar tufts of fimbriae on the streptococci. we have used a genetic approach to examine the role of streptococcal cell surface components involved in the binding of s. crista to  f. nucleatum. such binding may be an important component of corncob formation. a  method for the genetic transformation of s. crista was used to transfer the broad host range transposon, tn916, into the bacteria. cells were grown to early log phase in brain heart infusion broth containing 10% fetal calf serum. the competent cells were mixed with purified dna from pdl916, a plasmid construct consisting of tn916 and the streptococcal/escherichia coli shuttle vector pdl278. over 300 transformants were screened for a reduction in binding to f. nucleatum.  five of the transformants showed a change in binding ranging from 59% to 29% of the positive control values. southern blots revealed that the binding-deficient transformants contained the tn916 element integrated into one of 4 different sites in the chromosome. the transposon, integrated into 4 different sites, appeared to be stable in the absence of selective pressure. based on these findings, it appears that some strains of s. crista are naturally competent and that insertional inactivation methods can be used to facilitate the study of binding receptors in this group of oral streptococci.

AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == streptococcus oralis previously identified as uncommon 'streptococcus sanguis' in behcet's disease.
AB  == the relation between the biochemical and serological properties of 'streptococcus sanguis' was studied to characterize the strains isolated from dental plaque of patients with behcet's disease and controls. seven reference and 100 clinical strains preserved by the behcet's disease research committee of japan were identified using established criteria and differentiated with antisera against strep. oralis atcc 10557, strep. sanguis atcc 10556 and 'strep. sanguis' st7, compatible with the criteria. uncommon serovars (serotypes) kth-1 (= atcc 49298), kth-2 (= atcc 49296), kth-3 (= atcc kth-4 (= atcc 49297) and b220 (serovar kth-1) with both iga1 protease and neuraminidase (sialidase) were identified as strep. oralis, whereas common serovars st3 with iga1 protease alone and st7 without both enzymes were identified as strep. sanguis and strep. gordonii, respectively. isolates previously ranked as uncommon serovars were identified as strep. oralis, whereas the rest ranked as common serovars were identified as the same species as those of the grouping strains. a soft-agar technique was available for species identification except for strep. oralis serovar kth-1 reacting with the antiserum against strep. gordonii st7. the frequency of isolation of strep. oralis was higher in behcet's disease (52%) than in controls (38%), but no difference was observed between the properties of the two groups of isolates. strep. oralis virulence factors may be involved in breach the mucosal barrier in patients with  specific reactivity to these antigens and inducing behcet's disease.

TI  == viridans streptococci isolated from the bloodstream. relevance of species identification.
AB  == over a 4-year-period, 104 isolates belonging to the viridans streptococci were recovered from the blood and identified to the species according to beighton and  co-workers. streptococcus oralis was the species most frequently recovered from patients in the hematology unit [29 of 39 (74%)]. streptococcus mitis ranked second [seven of 39 (18%)]. both species were associated with oromucositis. isolates presently identified as s. oralis are mainly those previously identified as s. mitis or streptococcus sanguis ii. streptococcus milleri was most frequently isolated in the patients from the general hospital population [28 of 65 (43%) isolates]: streptococcus anginosus (n = 20), streptococcus constellatus  (n = 4), and streptococcus intermedius (n = 4). in 14 episodes from the general hospital population, clinical significance was judged questionable. from this part of the laboratory, clinical significance could not be predicted from the number of blood cultures grown, nor from the delay of growth detection. the rapid id 32 strep system agreed well with the identifications according to the scheme of beighton et al., whereas the api 20 strep system did not.

TI  == salivary amylase promotes adhesion of oral streptococci to hydroxyapatite.
AB  == recent studies have demonstrated that several species of oral streptococci, such  as streptococcus gordonii, bind soluble salivary alpha-amylase. the goal of the present study was to determine if amylase immobilized onto a surface such as hydroxyapatite can serve as an adhesion receptor for s. gordonii. initially, human parotid saliva was fractionated on bio-gel p60, and fractions were screened for their ability to promote adhesion of s. gordonii to hydroxyapatite. fractions containing alpha-amylase and proline-rich proteins promoted the adhesion of [3h]-labeled s. gordonii to hydroxyapatite. similar findings were obtained with purified amylase and acidic proline-rich protein 1 (prp1). incubation of s. gordonii g9b in the presence of starch and maltotriose increased the binding of this strain to amylase-coated hydroxyapatite, while the adhesion of s. sanguis 10556 to amylase-coated hydroxyapatite was not affected by these saccharides. these results suggest that amylase may serve as a hydroxyapatite pellicle receptor for amylase-binding streptococci. furthermore, starch and starch metabolites may enhance the adhesion of amylase-binding streptococci to amylase in dental pellicles to augment the formation of dental plaque.

TI  == bacterial adhesion to dental amalgam and three resin composites.
AB  == objectives: the ability of three oral bacteria to adhere to hydrophobic amalgam (water contact angle 60 degrees) and hydrophobic resin composites (prisma-ap.h 56 degrees. herculite xrv 82 degrees and z100 89 degrees) was compared using an in vitro assay. methods and results: following preincubation of the materials with human saliva, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed the surfaces to adsorb carbon and nitrogen-containing compounds in a conditioning film that appeared to  block the detection of na and others in 2100 resin. hg and ag in amalgam, si and  zn in prisma ap.h resin and ag and na in herculite resin. the precoating of the substrata by a proteinaceous conditioning film led to decreased binding of viable cells of streptococcus sanguis ch3, streptococcus salivarius hb and actinomyces viscosus wg as compared with the adhesion to bare composites. with and without salivary coating, there was a correlation between increased bacterial hydrophobicity and increased retention on the substrata. however, there was no statistical difference in binding to the amalgam compared with the resin composites. in vitro studies showed that the bacteria autoaggregated in the presence of saliva. conclusion: the results indicate the potential ability of normal oral flora to colonize resin composite.

TI  == bacteremia in conjunction with endodontic therapy.
AB  == this study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. microbiological samples were taken under  aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients.  in the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. in the  other 13 patients (group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. in 7 patients of group 1, propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. in 4 patients of group 2, p. intermedia, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.

TI  == corrosion of intra-oral magnets in the presence and absence of biofilms of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == intra-oral magnets are used in dentistry for a variety of purposes, and their susceptibility to corrosion is of great clinical importance. although a number of in vitro models have been developed to study corrosion of intra-oral magnets, none have attempted to determine the possible contribution to corrosion made by oral bacteria, which are known to form a biofilm on intra-oral appliances. we have exposed demagnetized neodymium/iron/boron (nd2fe14b) magnets to an artificial saliva in the presence and absence of a biofilm of streptococcus sanguils, one of the predominant organisms in the oral cavity. over a 21-d period, a 3.2% decrease in the mass of the magnets was observed when s. sanguis was present, while in the absence of the organism the decrease in mass was 1.4%.  we also examined the ability of poly(para-xylylene), a commonly-used coating, to  protect the magnets against corrosion. no decrease in the mass of magnets coated  with poly(para-xylylene) was detected over a 21-d period in the presence of s. sanguis. this study has shown that biofilms of s. sanguis cause appreciable corrosion of nd2fe14b magnets which is greater than that occurring in the absence of the organism, and that a coating of poly(para-xylylene) provides protection against such corrosion.

TI  == sucrose-dependent accumulation of oral streptococci and their adhesion-defective  mutants on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  == the adhesion and accumulation of oral streptococci on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite was examined in strains representing species that appear in initial plaque (streptococcus sanguise fc1 and streptococcus oralis c5) and in more mature plaque (streptococcus gordonii g9b). washed cells of strains fc1 and  c5 did not attach better to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite than did strain g9b, suggesting that the degree of initial adhesiveness does not alone account for the temporal appearance of these bacteria in dental plaque. growing cells of each strain were also examined for their ability to accumulate on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. the addition of sucrose to the medium promoted the accumulation of strain g9b more than it promoted the accumulation of strains fc1 and c5. sucrose also enhanced the accumulation of adhesion-defective mutants of each strain to levels similar to those of the respective parent strains. these results suggest that sucrose-dependent accumulation may facilitate the colonization of the tooth surface by these species of oral streptococci when adhesion is limited  by reduced bacterial adhesiveness or limited pellicle-binding sites.

TI  == saliva protein binding to layers of oral streptococci in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == this paper reports a system for measuring saliva protein binding to oral streptococci. enamel chips with layers of streptococcus gordonii blackburn or streptococcus oralis 10557 were incubated in vitro with whole saliva from eight persons. blackburn bound significantly more amylase than 10557; no strain differences were seen for lysozyme or lactoferrin. there were significant correlations between saliva and bound amylase and lactoferrin. blackburn and 10557 chips were then placed in ten subjects. sites included the buccal left and  right upper premolars and molars (ul, ur), labial upper central incisors (uc), and lingual lower central incisors (ll). that study was repeated three months later; chips with streptococcus sanguis 13379 were also placed then. blackburn bound significantly more amylase than the other strains. blackburn and 10557 both bound the most amylase at ul and ur, and the least amylase at uc. however, strain 13379 bound less amylase at ul. that strain also bound significantly less siga at ul. all three strains bound the least siga at uc. lysozyme and lactoferrin binding showed few differences among sites or strains. bound protein concentrations were significantly correlated across sites and strains within subjects, but not correlated with whole saliva. strain differences may reflect species differences in amylase binding, or differences in species-specific siga titers. site differences may indicate local variation in protein availability. differences between chip correlations with whole saliva in vitro and in vivo suggest that the salivary film may be modified as it flows over tooth surfaces.

TI  == quantifying the strength of bacterial adhesive interactions with salivary glycoproteins.
AB  == we adapted an assay that has been used to estimate the strength of eukaryotic cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesive interactions (mcclay et al., 1981) to quantify the strength of bacterial (streptococci, fusobacteria, actinomyces) interactions with salivary receptors. bacteria are centrifuged onto  human submandibular/sublingual or parotid-saliva-coated microtiter wells. plates  are sealed with pressure-sensitive, double-sided tape which allows them to be inverted and centrifuged again. the force required to remove the bacteria from the coated wells is a direct measure of the adhesive strength of the interaction(s) being disrupted. the bacteria-saliva adhesive forces we detected ranged from 1.6 x 10(-8) dynes (streptococcus sanguis 72-40) to > 1.1 x 10(-7) dynes (actinomyces viscosus t14 v). these forces were in the range to withstand the shear stress produced by salivary flow, which we calculated as approximately  6.1 x 10(-7) dynes.

TI  == post-antibiotic effect of azithromycin and erythromycin on streptococcal susceptibility to phagocytosis.
AB  == the effect of azithromycin and erythromycin on growth, cell surface hydrophobicity and the susceptibility to the bactericidal activity of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmnl) was examined in four streptococcus species. exposure to either 10 x mic azithromycin or erythromycin induced a post-antibiotic effect (pae) of between 2.4 and 4.3 h. erythromycin caused a longer pae for s. sanguis than azithromycin under the same conditions. the cell surface charge (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) of the streptococci was altered significantly during pae; loss of hydrophobicity was induced by both macrolides,  and this effect was variable amongst the species. the decrease in hydrophobicity  was not related to inhibition of growth. the effect of each drug during pae on the interaction of opsonised suspensions of the streptococci with human pmnl revealed that erythromycin, and to a lesser extent azithromycin, increased susceptibility to the bactericidal activity of human pmnl; this effect was abolished following pae. the present study clearly showed that pae should not only be considered as delayed bacterial growth, but also as modulation of bacterial susceptibility to phagocytosis which may influence the outcome of the host-parasite relationship.

AB  == candida albicans atcc 10261 and ca2 bound to cells of the oral bacteria streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguis when these bacteria were immobilized onto microtiter plate wells, but they did not bind to cells of streptococcus mutans or streptococcus salivarius. cell wall polysaccharide was extracted with alkali from s. gordonii nctc 7869, the streptococcal species to which c. albicans bound with highest affinity, and was effective in blocking the coaggregation of c. albicans and s. gordonii cells in the fluid phase. when fixed to microtiter plate wells, the s. gordonii polysaccharide was bound by all strains of c. albicans tested. the polysaccharide contained rha, glc, galnac, glcnac, and gal and was related compositionally to previously characterized cell wall polysaccharides from strains of s. oralis and  s. sanguis. the adherence of yeast cells to the immobilized polysaccharide was not inhibitable by a number of saccharides. antiserum raised to the s. gordonii nctc 7869 polysaccharide blocked adherence of c. albicans atcc 10261 to the polysaccharide. the results identify a complex cell wall polysaccharide of s. gordonii as the coaggregation receptor for c. albicans. adherent interactions of  yeast cells with streptococci and other bacteria may be important for colonization of both hard and soft oral surfaces by c. albicans.

TI  == development of a flow method for susceptibility testing of oral biofilms in vitro.
AB  == bacteria in biofilms are known to be more resistant than bacteria in batch cultures to antimicrobial agents. the purpose of the present study was to develop a flow method for formation of oral biofilms permitting susceptibility testing of plaque bacteria. a brain heart infusion (bhi) streptococcus sanguis 804 culture was pumped through a modified robbins device (mrd) with 25 exchangeable silicone  disks at 40 ml/h. after 24-48 h disks were removed and biofilm cells dispersed by vortex mixing and low-output ultrasonication. colony forming units (cfu)/cm2 were determined after aerobic incubation on blood agar plates. optimal biofilm formation was found after growth for 48 h at 37 degrees c in bhi + 1% sucrose, using saliva-coated silicone disks in inverted mrds, yielding on average 4.4 x 10(5) cfu/cm2. similar results were obtained for s. sanguis atcc 10556 and five clinical isolates. testing the susceptibility of s. sanguis to chlorhexidine gluconate showed increased resistance of biofilms compared to batch culture. thus an appropriate biofilm model for susceptibility testing of oral microorganisms has been established.

TI  == calcium and water diffusion in single-species model bacterial plaques.
AB  == the diffusion of tritiated water and 45ca through single-species model plaques was measured in a diaphragm cell. using plaques of streptococcus downei, the apparent diffusion coefficient for tritiated water showed a small but significant decrease between ph 7.0 and 5.0 with a smaller, non-significant decrease for calcium. these effects are attributed to possible plaque shrinkage at reduced ph, which overcomes effects due to charge-dependent changes in permeability. effective diffusion coefficients for 45ca obtained from lag-time measurements were much reduced at low carrier concentrations, demonstrating a binding which correlated with previous results from equilibrium dialysis. strep. sanguis and corynebacterium matruchotii showed few differences from strep. downei, although the corynebacterium previously demonstrated stronger calcium binding. permeability to water and calcium were slightly affected by ph, while effective diffusion of calcium depended on concentration. this may have important implications for the process of mineral loss in dental caries.

AB  == prevalence of mutans streptococci (ms) and the effect of selected variables, including the early childhood use of antibiotics on the oral colonization of ms,  were studied among 353, 5- to 12-year-old african-american children using a cross-sectional study. ms prevalence was estimated using pooled plaque and stimulated saliva samples (spatula). data on antibiotic use and other potential determinants of oral colonization of ms were obtained using a self-administered questionnaire. antibiotic data were validated using health records of subjects. ms prevalence (92%, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 89-95%) was associated with dental caries (odds ratio [or] = 2.5, 95% ci = 1.3-6.2), age (chi for trend = 4.3, p = 0.04), increased frequency of sweet consumption (chi for trend = 5.1, p  = 0.02), and increased number of teeth in the mouth (unit or = 1.3, 95% ci = 1.1-1.6). higher ms levels were associated with higher number of decayed teeth (p < 0.0001), and also, with having the mother as the primary caregiver during the second year of life (p = 0.02). furthermore, children who took antibiotics during early childhood and those who lived in the same household with many others during the second year of life had a higher ms prevalence than those who did not (or = 8.3, 95% ci = 2.0-35.0; unit or = 1.5, 95% ci = 1.03-2.2, respectively). it is unclear why those exposed to antibiotics during the "window of infectivity" of ms exhibit a higher ms prevalence. antibiotic-related oral ecological changes (i.e,  lower levels of s. sanguis) and environmental changes (i.e., frequent exposure to sugar through most pediatric antibiotic preparations) may make the oral cavity more favorable for initial ms colonization.

TI  == treatment with various antibiotics of experimental endocarditis caused by penicillin-resistant streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == background: streptococcus sanguis currently accounts for one-half of viridans streptococci. treatment has become complicated due to the increase in resistance  to penicillin and cephalosporins. the aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of various antibiotics as monotherapy and in association with gentamicin, in a experimental model of infective endocarditis in rabbits. the effects were compared with a control group and a group given classical penicillin-gentamicin treatment. material and methods: infective endocarditis was induced in 180 rabbits with a clinical isolate of streptococcus sanguis. treatment was started 48 h after infection, and lasted 5 days. the animals were divided into nine groups of 20 rabbits: g1, untreated controls; g2, penicillin-gentamicin; g3, clindamycin-gentamicin; g4, imipenem; g5, imipenem-gentamicin; g6, teicoplanin; g7, teicoplanin-gentamicin; g8, vancomycin and g9, vancomycin-gentamicin. response to therapy was evaluated by mortality curves, as negative blood cultures, concentration of s. sanguis in aortic vegetations and rate of sterilization of vegetations. results: vegetation weight was significantly lower  in treated groups than in controls; lower weights were found in g5, 6, and 9. g9  sterilized 75% of the vegetations. death occurred in 25% of the control group and in 4.76% of g6 and 7. blood cultures became negative most rapidly in g9. conclusions: combined treatment with vancomycin-gentamicin may be highly efficacious in patients with endocarditis caused by penicillin-resistant streptococcus sanguis. other combinations, such as imipenem-gentamicin and teicoplanin-gentamicin, may be also advantageous.

AB  == members of the streptococcus sanguis group (ssg) and streptococcus milleri group  (smg) were screened for their ability to produce glycosidase, arylamidase (peptidase), protease, dextranase and glycosyltransferase activities. species within each group produced unique patterns of activity. the most commonly produced glycosidases were beta-d-glucosidase, beta-d-galactosidase, n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and n-acetyl-beta-d-galactosaminidase and the least commonly produced glycosidase activity was beta-fucosidase with streptococcus intermedius (smg) being the only species capable of producing the activity. for arylamidase activity, the most commonly produced type was lysine-arylamidase. glycosidase and arylamidase activities were localized to particular sub-cellular fractions. alpha-galactosidase was found only in culture  supernatant fluids whereas n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase was found in all fractions; the culture supernatant, cell wall, cell membrane and cytoplasm. no arylamidase activity was seen in culture supernatants. phe-arg-arylamidase was found only in cytoplasmic fractions whereas val-pro-argarylamidase was found in cell walls, cell membranes and cytoplasmic fraction. protease activity was measured as the degradation of bovine serum albumin (bsa) and casein. casein was  degraded by a number of strains whereas no species/strains were able to degrade bsa. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus (smg), streptococcus mitior and streptococcus defectivus (ssg) were the only species that produced hyaluronidase and no species produced chondroitin sulphatase. the groups were also examined for their abilities to produce glycosyltransferase and dextranase.  strep. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis produced glucosyltransferase and, with the exception of the latter species, fructosyltransferase. no species within the smg was capable of producing either glycosyltransferase.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. a second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mm (0.1%) or 6.4 mm (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. for electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. treatment with 6.4 mm delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. the result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. more material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. it appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.

AB  == certain strains of streptococcus sanguis adhere selectively to human platelets (adh+) and, in plasma, induce them to aggregate into in vitro thrombi (agg+). the induction of aggregation is mediated by the platelet aggregation-associated protein (paap) expressed on the cell surface of the streptococcus. in endocarditis, expression of paap may be regulated by association with host proteins on damaged heart valves. to begin to test this hypothesis, three strains of s. sanguis were each cultured in the presence or absence of collagens (types i to x), laminin, or paap-derived peptide preparations. after harvesting and washing, the platelet-interactive phenotype of strains 133-79 (adh+ agg+), l74 (adh+ agg-), and 10556 (adh- agg-) was unchanged. the cells from each culture were then digested mildly with trypsin to isolate paap. paap isolated from strain 133-79 (adh+ agg+) grown in the absence of added collagen, other proteins, or peptides inhibited platelet aggregation in response to untreated cells of s. sanguis. platelet aggregation was induced immediately, however, by paap from strain 133-79 isolated after growth in the presence of 300 nm type i collagen, while lower concentrations yielded protein fragments that potentiated the response to intact cells. aggregation-inducing paap could be removed by anti-paap (pgeqgpk) immunoaffinity chromatography, but only inhibitory activity could be recovered. the agonist effect of paap was not associated with collagen itself, since the paap preparations did not contain detectable amounts of hydroxyproline. paap antigens isolated from cells grown in the presence and absence of collagen had similar apparent molecular weights, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western immunoblotting. when electrophoresis was performed under nondenaturing conditions, however, paap isolated from cells grown in type i collagen migrated more slowly. strain l74 grown with type i collagen yielded tryptic fragments of proteins that inhibited aggregation significantly better than control peptides (no collagen in the medium). strain 10556 was apparently unaffected by growth in type i collagen. the effect of type i collagen was somewhat unique. growth in the presence of collagen types ii to vi (300 nm) yielded protein fragments that potentiated without inducing platelet aggregation, while other collagens, laminin, and paap-derived peptides did not affect platelet aggregation. these results suggest that growth in the presence of type i collagen and, perhaps, collagens ii to vi alters the expression and conformation of paap in certain strains of s. sanguis.

TI  == the fima locus of streptococcus parasanguis encodes an atp-binding membrane transport system.
AB  == the gene encoding fima, a 36 kda fimbrial adhesion of streptococcus parasanguis fw213, is highly conserved in all four genetic groups of sanguis streptococci. fima-like peptides were produced by all strains tested. the nucleotide sequence directly upstream of fima contains two open reading frames, orf5 and orf1, whose  deduced protein products are homologous to members of a superfamily of atp-binding cassette membrane transport proteins, including both prokaryotic and  eukaryotic uptake and export systems. the amino acid sequence of fima contains the consensus prolipoprotein cleavage site (lxxc) common to the 'periplasmic' binding proteins of gram-positive transport systems. the deduced product of orf5  is a 28.6 kda membrane-associated protein that has the consensus binding site for atp (gxxgxgks). it shares significant homology with amie of streptococcus pneumoniae as well as with escherichia coli proteins involved in iron(iii) uptake. allelic-replacement mutagenesis of orf5 resulted in greatly increased resistance to aminopterin. these data demonstrate functionality with the amie locus as well. the deduced product of orf1 is an extremely hydrophobic integral membrane protein of 30.8 kda with a pattern of six potential membrane-spanning regions, typical of a component of these types of transport system. the nucleotide sequence downstream of fima, orf3, encodes a 20 kda protein having 78% identity with the 20 kda protein encoded downstream of ssab, a fima homologue in  s. sanguis 12. it also exhibits significant homology with bacterioferritin co-migratory protein (bcp) of e. coli k-12. allelic-replacement mutagenesis in the fima locus of fw213 showed that (i) expression of fima was initiated at a site far upstream of the fima start codon, and (ii) expression of fima was not linked to expression of orf3. northern blots probed with internal fragments of orf5, orf1, fima or orf3 hybridized to the same transcript of 3.3 kb, which suggested that these loci were transcribed as a polycistronic message. the orf3 probe also hybridized to a 540 bp transcript consistent with the size of orf3 alone and supportive of the mutagenesis data of non-linkage. strains mutated in fima continued to produce fimbriae, indicating that fima was not the fimbrial structural subunit. immunoelectron microscopy revealed fima was localized at the  tips of the fimbriae of fw213. this is the first study that demonstrates that an  adhesin which binds a bacterial cell to a substrate is associated with an atp-binding cassette.

TI  == identification of intracellular amylase activity in streptococcus bovis and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis has been demonstrated to produce an extracellular amylase activity. we previously reported on the cloning of a gene from s. bovis encoding for what was initially believed to be the extracellular amylase. dna sequence analyses indicated that the amylase produced by the cloned  gene did not match the n-terminus amino acid sequence of the purified extracellular amylase and contained no apparent leader sequence for secretion. analyses of crude extracts demonstrated the presence of an intracellular amylase  in s. bovis jb1 that differed in molecular weight (56,000) from that of the extracellular amylase (70,000). the 56,000 molecular weight amylase was identical to the amylase produced by escherichia coli containing the cloned amylase gene. low levels of intracellular amylase activity were also detected in other strains  of s. bovis and also streptococcus salivarius. introduction of the plasmid pva838 containing the cloned amylase gene into s. bovis and s. sanguis resulted in enhanced intracellular amylase production by both organisms. the amylase gene has been sequenced, and analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence for the amylase indicates a high degree of similarity with secreted amylases from bacillus species.

TI  == eliminating effects of an air purifier on infectants during dental procedure.

TI  == involvement of bactericidal factors from thrombin-stimulated platelets in clearance of adherent viridans streptococci in experimental infective endocarditis.
AB  == platelets activated with thrombin release bactericidal factors. we studied the role of the susceptibility of viridans streptococci to these bactericidal factors in the development of infective endocarditis (ie). by using the experimental endocarditis rabbit model, the initial adherence and the development of ie were assessed for 10 viridans streptococcal strains differing in their susceptibilities to releasate (material released) from thrombin-activated platelets. six strains were susceptible and four strains were resistant to these  releasates. the numbers of vegetations (vgs) colonized at 5 min and 48 h after intravenous challenge with 10(4) cfu were determined. at 5 min after challenge, significantly more vgs were colonized with bacteria of the six platelet releasate-susceptible strains than with bacteria of the four releasate-resistant  strains (p < 0.005). in the releasate-susceptible group of strains, the number of colonized vgs decreased significantly between 5 min and 48 h after intravenous inoculation (p < 0.001). such a decrease was not observed with the releasate-resistant strains. as a result, the final developments of ie due to releasate-susceptible and -resistant strains were not significantly different. the releasate-susceptible strain 1 and the releasate-resistant strain 2 were selected for more detailed experiments. rabbits were killed at 5 and 30 min and 2, 4, and 48 h after inoculation. the number of culture-positive vgs as well as the number of adherent bacteria on the individual vgs were determined. the 90% infective dose for each strain was 10(5) cfu. at low inoculum concentrations (10(3) and 10(4) cfu) a larger proportion of the inoculated bacteria of both strains was found to be adherent on vgs than at higher challenge doses. the number of culture-positive vgs as well as the number of adherent bacteria per vg  decreased rapidly in the first 30 min after challenge with strain 1 but not after challenge with strain 2. additional experiments with the platelet releasate-susceptible strain s224 and the platelet releasate-resistant stain s182 confirmed the data obtained with strains 1 and 2 and indicated that releasate-susceptible strains disappeared from the vgs with time, whereas releasate-susceptible strains persisted. in vitro studies with vgs excised 5 min  after challenge with stain 1 or 2 showed that clearance of the releasate-susceptible strain 1 was not caused by complement bactericidal activity or surface phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear cells. bacterial cells of strain 1 adherent on excised vtgs were rapidly cleared by exposure to fresh clotting blood or to releasates from thrombin-stimulated platelet suspension.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == a 23 kda membrane glycoprotein bearing neunac alpha 2-3gal beta 1-3galnac o-linked carbohydrate chains acts as a receptor for streptococcus sanguis omz 9 on human buccal epithelial cells.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis colonizes several human oral surfaces, including both hard  and soft tissues. large salivary mucin-like glycoproteins bearing sialic acid residues are known to bind various s.sanguis strains. however, the molecular basis for the adhesion of s.sanguis to human buccal epithelial cells (hbec) has not been established. the present study shows that s.sanguis omz 9 binds to exfoliated hbec in a sialic acid-sensitive manner. the desialylation of such cells invariably abolishes adhesion of s.sanguis omz 9 to the cell surface. a soluble glycopeptide bearing short sialylated o-linked carbohydrate chains behaves as a potent inhibitor of the attachment of s.sanguis omz 9 to exfoliated  hbec. the resialylation of desialylated hbec with cmp-sialic acid and gal beta 1,3galnac alpha 2,3-sialyltransferase specific for o-glycans restores the receptor function for s.sanguis omz 9, whereas a similar cell resialylation with  the gal beta 1,4glcnac alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase specific for n-glycans is without effect. finally, the same resialylation reaction carried out with cmp-9-fluoresceinyl-sialic acid as a substrate yields exfoliated hbec bearing fluorescence on a single 23 kda protein, when using the alpha 2,3-sialyltransferase as the catalyst. the latter finding demonstrates that this  23 kda cell surface glycoprotein bears neunac alpha 2-3gal beta 1-3galnac o-linked sugar chains, a carbohydrate sequence which is recognized by s.sanguis omz 9 on exfoliated hbec. in similar experiments carried out with a buccal carcinoma cell line termed sqcc/y1, s.sanguis omz 9 did not attach in great numbers to such cultured cells, and these cells were shown to not express membrane glycoprotein bearing alpha 2,3-sialylated o-linked carbohydrate chains.

TI  == bacterial-stimulated cytokine production of peripheral mononuclear cells from patients of various periodontitis categories.
AB  == periodontitis is a general term for disease categories, including juvenile periodontitis (jp), rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp), and adult periodontitis (ap), which may or may not share a common etiology and pathogenesis. these disease categories are characterized by differences in progression of tissue destruction and differences in age group susceptibility, but not, to our knowledge, by differences in cytokine responses of inflammatory cells. the present study examined blood cell counts and interindividual variation in the ability of pbmc of patients in three different categories of periodontitis to produce cytokines after stimulation with different oral bacterial species in vitro. the ap group had a significantly lower production of il-1ra when stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) (p < 0.05). streptococcus sanguis (s.s.), which is associated with normal periodontal conditions, induced extremely high levels of il-1 alpha and tnf alpha production in all groups. the rpp group had a significantly higher number of monocytes (mc) than the ap group (p < 0.05). additionally, jp patients had a significantly higher concentration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes compared to juvenile controls (p < 0.05). in conclusion, il-1 alpha, tnf alpha, or il-6 production by peripheral blood mc after in vitro stimulation with oral bacterial type stains may not distinguish different categories of periodontitis. the results support the hypothesis that the cytokine il-1ra is produced in different concentrations in the two groups: rpp and ap. furthermore, elevated mc concentration in the rpp group compared to the ap group may be an important pathogenic feature in rpp.

TI  == oral bacterial attachment to titanium surfaces: a scanning electron microscopy study.
AB  == despite the wide use of dental implants, the understanding of the mechanism(s) of bacterial attachment to implant surfaces and of the factors that affect such attachment is limited. in this study, the attachment of oral bacteria--including  streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis--to titanium (ti) discs with different surface morphology (smooth, grooved, or rough) was examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem). the most bacterial attachment was observed on the rough bsa-coated ti surfaces. the smooth surfaces promoted poor attachment for s. sanguis and a. viscosus. however, p. gingivalis attached equally well to both the smooth and grooved coated ti surfaces, based on direct cell quantitation and examination with sem. cell-surface fimbriae (which may play a role in adhesion) of both a. viscosus and p. gingivalis observed were associated with the ti surfaces. ti implant surface characteristics appeared to influence oral bacterial attachment in vitro. the in vitro attachment system has  proven its usefulness for future bacterial attachment studies with model implant  surfaces.

TI  == transformation of naturally competent streptococcus mutans with replicative and non-replicative tn916-containing plasmids: implications for a mechanism of transposition.
AB  == based on the observations reported here and what is known concerning transformation of naturally competent strains of s. mutans and other streptococcal species such as s. gordonii, we propose the model shown in figure 2. the tn916-intermediate transforms s. mutans as originally proposed for b. subtilis by scott and coworkers [8]. it is not clear in either system (b. subtilis or s. mutans) whether the tn916 intermediate enters the cell as ds-dna or ss-dna. because it is likely that transformation of b. subtilis via formation  of protoplasts involves a mechanism quite different from natural transformation in s. mutans, it would be unwise to extrapolate findings from their studies. if tn916 enters s. mutans in a manner similar to plasmid or chromosomal dna, we would assume that tn916 binds to a cell receptor and as one strand enters, the other is degraded [9]. this leaves open the question of whether tn916 recircularizes as ds-dna before it inserts into the chromosome or whether it remains as ss-dna, if, indeed, it enters as ss-dna. the transformation efficiency for the tn916 intermediate (approximately 10(-7) precluded kinetics studies such  as those performed with pam118. poyart-salmeron and coworkers [11] however, described a model in which tn1545 inserts into the target site as a ds-dna circular molecule, similar to that seen with lambda phage. perhaps the most interesting finding presented here is that the predominant mechanism of insertion of tn916 into the chromosome of the recipient occurs after tn916 enters the cell. the replicative plasmid pam118 evidently forms by two-hit kinetics followed by intracellular excision and transposition of tn916. the helper-rescue experiment shows that in this system, the formation of tcr transformants, and hence the integration of tn916, was a function of the transformation efficacy of plasmid pam118. since intracellular excision of tn916 probably follows the re-formation of the plasmid pam118, the rate-limiting step in this system would be the formation of the transient, intracellular plasmid pam118. (the transient white colony phenotype probably denotes the slower growth rate of transformants that acquire the large replicative plasmid pam118). our findings demonstrate that a practical way of promoting tn916 insertions into chromosomal dna for the purpose  of obtaining mutations is to use a helper-rescue system. our model supports the concept that the majority of tn916 inserts arise from a mechanism similar to 'zygotic induction' as proposed for s. sanguis (gordonii) [1]. however, the frequencies for the co-establishment of the replicative plasmid (emr) and tn916 inserts (tcr) in their paper (10(-6)) differ from our observations for s. mutans. we found nearly 100% of tcr white colonies to be emr whereas in s. gordonii, only a fraction (approximately 1%) exhibited the tcremr phenotype. if both phenotypes  arose independently, the frequency of the tcremr phenotype would be 10(-8) rather than 10(-6) survivors/recipients as observed. it was surmised that both tcr and emr transformants arise dependently [1] where both the tn916 intermediate and pam118 contribute to the formation of tn916 inserts. we conclude from their data, however, that most tcr arose from the tn916-intermediate formed in the donor, in  agreement with the explanation of these data by scott [12]. support for the contention that the tcr arose in s. gordonii from transformation by the tn916-intermediate as in s. mutans (yellows), and not from intracellular excision from pam118, comes from the observation that so few tcr are ems and because pam150 (rep-) yields tcr at the same frequency as the rep+ pam118 in their experiments. in summary, the tn916 intermediate is capable of transforming s. mutans. in contrast to the hypothesis of scott [12], however, the tn916 intermediate is not the only form involved in the transformat++t

AB  == numerous studies, using models to mimic the formation of the acquired pellicle, have concentrated on human saliva-coated hydroxyapatite; in contrast, although the rat is frequently used as an animal model, the information concerning the formation of pellicles from rat saliva is sparse. we compared the ability of streptococcus and actinomyces species to adhere to hydroxyapatite coated by rat saliva (rsha) and human saliva (sha). we also explored the influence of glucan synthesized in situ on the adherence of organisms. we show that each strain of organism has a distinct binding pattern, which was essentially the same with surfaces coated with either rat or human saliva. dissolved rsha beads revealed a  major protein band (35-49 kd), identified as glutamine/glutamic-acid-rich protein; acidic proline-rich protein (31-45 kd and alpha-amylase (66 kd) were also identified. overall, these in vitro data strongly suggest that the principles of bacterial adhesion to rsha are similar to those observed with sha.

AB  == clinical studies suggest that the long-term suppression of mutans streptococci on tooth surfaces after intensive chlorhexidine therapy is mainly due to bacterial interference. other streptococci and also actinomyces naeslundii are proposed to  inhibit regrowth of mutans streptococci after suppression by the agent. we have tested this hypothesis in gnotobiotic rats associated with streptococcus mutans alone, or associated with s. mutans and strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis biovar i, and  a. naeslundii. left lower jaws in these rats were treated with concentrated chlorhexidine varnish, and the return of s. mutans on the treated jaws monitored. in mono-associated rats, s. mutans regained the level of the untreated right lower jaw in approximately 1 week. in contrast, s. mutans remained suppressed for several weeks in rats multi-associated with other streptococci and actinomyces strains. the suppression was more pronounced in the rats fed on basal diet with little free sugars than in rats fed on a sucrose-containing diet. counts of other streptococci recovered quickly from the intensive chlorhexidine treatment, but a. naeslundii remained suppressed for at least 1 week. the findings demonstrate the  crucial importance of the oral microflora in controlling regrowth of mutans streptococci after chemotherapy.

AB  == the procedure for the purification of the adhesin polysaccharide receptor and its hexasaccharide repeating unit from whole s. oralis atcc 55229 by chemical, enzymatic, and chromatographic techniques has been described. chemical, chromatographic, and mass spectrometric procedures allow preliminary structural characterization of the hexasaccharide repeating unit and polysaccharide. the structural characterizations of the hexasaccharide and polysaccharide are completed using several 1d and 2d nmr techniques. identification of the anomeric  1h and 13c signals of the glycosyl residues permits, by virtue of their chemical  shifts and coupling constants (3jhh and 1jch), the determination of the configurations of the glycosidic linkages. the hmbc connectivities permit the establishment of the hexasaccharide sequence as rhap alpha(1-->2)rhap alpha(1-->3)galp alpha(1-->3)galp beta(1-->4)glcp beta(1-->3)gal. the 1h nmr chemical shifts of the polysaccharide, as determined by the combination of cosy and tocsy experiments, and the observed interglycosidic noesy cross-peaks reveal  the structure of the polysaccharide to be [formula: see text] where the position  of the glycerol (gro) phosphate moiety has been determined by [1h, 31p] nmr spectroscopy.

TI  == stimulation of monocyte tissue factor expression in an in vitro model of bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == the coagulation system plays a major role in the formation of the infected endocardial vegetation in bacterial endocarditis. since monocytes can express tissue factor (tf) on their surfaces, they are thought to be responsible for the  extrinsic activation of the coagulation cascade during this disease. the present  study used an in vitro model in which fibrin plates, isolated adherent monocytes, and streptococcus sanguis were used as an analog for endocardial vegetations. adherence to fibrin by itself was found to stimulate tf expression on the monocytes, but stimulation by s. sanguis significantly increased tf expression, which was found to be maximal at a bacterium-to-monocyte ratio of 9 or more.

TI  == kinetics of lactose-reversible coadhesion of actinomyces naeslundii wvu 398a and  streptococcus oralis 34 on the surface of hexadecane droplets.
AB  == most investigations of mechanisms accounting for intergeneric coaggregation have  emphasized stereospecific rather than nonspecific interactions. the purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative importance of lectin-carbohydrate and nonspecific hydrophobic and ionic interactions, using a model based on strains with one of the most well understood specific coaggregation mechanisms, the lactose-reversible coaggregation of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis. the kinetics of coadhesion and desorption of coadherent bacteria were studied using s. oralis 34 bound to hexadecane droplets  as an affinity support for the adhesion of a. naeslundii wvu 398a. light, confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that a. naeslundii cells adhered only to the s. oralis cells, not to exposed hexadecane between the streptococci. coadhesion was inhibited by lactose concentrations as low as 2.0 mm. the rate of coadhesion was halved at 60 mm lactose. the hydrophobicity inhibitors bovine serum albumin and defatted bovine serum albumin  and the salts licl and kcl failed to inhibit coadhesion in the hexadecane assay,  and bovine serum albumin also failed to inhibit coaggregation in a bacterial aggregation assay on glass slides. high concentrations of the salts achieved a 50% rate decrease in a. naeslundii adhesion to the s. oralis-coated droplets only when they were combined with > 20 mm lactose. sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) and tween 20 inhibition was tested by the slide coaggregation assay because they tended to emulsify the droplets; sds was inhibitory. lactose selectively desorbed a. naeslundii from s. oralis-coated droplets at low concentrations equivalent to  those that inhibited coadhesion. neither licl nor kcl desorbed a. naeslundii from the droplets, even at 500 mm. at low concentrations, sds but not tween 20 eluted  both a. naeslundii and s. oralis from the droplets. although the sds results might suggest a degree of cooperative charge interactions, the results support the hypothesis that stereospecific, beta-galactoside-sensitive interactions have  a much greater impact than nonspecific interactions on the coadhesion of a. naeslundii and s. oralis.

TI  == effect of binding of fibrinogen to each bacterium on coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis.
AB  == fibrinogen inhibits the coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus oralis. in this study, we determined which bacterium interacts with fibrinogen in this inhibitory process. although preincubation of each bacterium with fibrinogen did not inhibit coaggregation, its activity was completely eliminated by the addition of protease inhibitors such as n-ethylmaleimide (nem), p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate and n alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone  to the preincubation mixture with fibrinogen and p. gingivalis. however, the inhibition of coaggregation was not found after preincubation of s. oralis with fibrinogen in the presence or absence of the protease inhibitors. labelled materials were recovered from the extract of p. gingivalis cells incubated with radioiodinated fibrinogen in the presence of nem but not in the absence of nem. in the binding experiment, p. gingivalis showed a much higher binding activity to fibrinogen than s. oralis. these findings suggest that fibrinogen and its fragment(s) may mask directly or indirectly the aggregation site with s. oralis on the p. gingivalis cells in its inhibitory process of coaggregation.

TI  == adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of oral streptococcal cells.
AB  == oral tissues, especially tooth surfaces, are covered with a layer of salivary proteins. oral bacterial cells that adsorb to salivary components accumulated on  the tooth surface are, as a rule, covered with the same components, especially proteins. thus, it is possible that the salivary proteins covering the bacterial  cells are related to the adhesion of bacteria to oral tissues. the aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms of adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis and s. salivarius using an adsorption  assay with salivary proteins labeled with tritiated formaldehyde. the results showed that salivary proteins adsorbed more to s. salivarius than to s. mitis, and least to s. sanguis. it was evident that hydrophobic bonding was involved in  the adsorption of salivary proteins to the bacterial cells tested. the amount of  salivary proteins adsorbed to s. mitis and s. salivarius was decreased by the presence of phosphate, that to s. sanguis was increased by the presence of a divalent cation such as ca2+, and that to all bacteria tested was inhibited in different ways by the presence of sugars. the amount of salivary proteins adsorbed to s. sanguis and s. salivarius was reduced effectively by pretreatment  of the cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin and papain. in the case of s. mitis, the  amount of adsorbed salivary proteins was decreased by pretreatment of the cells with chymotrypsin only, and was increased by pretreatment with lipase. these results indicate that there are different mechanisms of adsorption of salivary protein to the cell surfaces of oral streptococci.

TI  == the targeting of phospholipid liposomes to bacteria.
AB  == phospholipid liposomes have been prepared from phospholipid mixtures including dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol (dppc/pi) and dppc/dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (dppc/dppg) mixtures and targeted to adsorbed biofilms of the skin-associated bacteria staphylococcus epidermidis and  proteus vulgaris and the oral bacterium streptococcus sanguis. the effects of time, liposome concentration and density of bacteria in the biofilm have been studied in detail for staphylococcus epidermidis. the targeting (as assessed by the apparent monolayer coverage of the biofilms by liposomes) to the biofilms was found to be sensitive to the mol% of pi and dppg in the liposomes and optimum levels of pi were found for targeting to each bacterium. the use of pi and dppg-containing liposomes for the delivery of the bactericide, triclosan, to biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis was studied as a function of the amount of triclosan carried by the liposomes. all the liposome systems tested inhibited the growth of bacteria from the biofilms after brief (2 min) exposure to triclosan-carrying liposomes. at low triclosan levels bacterial growth inhibition by triclosan-carrying liposomes exceeded that by an equivalent level of free triclosan. after short periods (min) of exposure of biofilms to triclosan-carrying liposomes the bactericide was shown to preferentially concentrate in the biofilms relative to its liposomal lipid carrier. the results  suggest that phospholipid liposomes with appropriately chosen lipid composition have potential for the targeting and delivery of bactericide to bacteria.

TI  == [infective endocarditis in icelandic children.]
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the predisposing conditions and etiology of infective endocarditis (ie) in icelandic children during the last ten years from 1984 to 1993. records from all cases of ie in iceland during this period were sampled. vegetations were confirmed in all patients by echocardiography and  in cases of culture negative ie the diagnosis was made on clinical grounds and on the response to antibiotic treatment. during this period eight children were diagnosed with ie. five of these cases occurred in a cluster during a two months  period last year (1993). four patients had a known heart defect, three had a central venous catheter (cvc) and one patient had no factors known to predispose  ie. the most common site of infection was the tricuspid valve seen in six cases,  one in the aortic valve and one in the aortic arch. all patients survived without neurological sequel. a positive blood culture was obtained in six cases. the infective organisms were staphylococcus aureus (three patients), staphylococcus epidermitis (one patient), streptococcus sanguis (one patient) and candida albicans (one patient). the results show that the spectrum of ie in icelandic children is similar to the changing spectrum elsewhere where infected cvc's are now responsible for relatively high proportion of the cases. this is most likely  due to greater use of cvc's especially in neonatal intensive care units. a relatively few cases of typical ie, i.e. in children with an underlying heart lesion or following cardiac surgery, suggests effective prophylactic therapy and  follow up.

TI  == a quantitative study of calcium binding by isolated streptococcal cell walls and  lipoteichoic acid: comparison with whole cells.
AB  == calcium-binding by surface components of oral bacteria may have important effects on remineralization/demineralization phenomena and plaque cohesion. additionally, some species export large quantities of lipoteichoic acid, possibly as a protective measure. measurement of calcium-binding can facilitate prediction of how this will effectively buffer plaque fluid calcium concentration and affect these processes. using equilibrium dialysis, we measured calcium-binding capacities and affinities at ph 7.0 in isolated cell walls of streptococcus downei, s. sanguis, and purified lipoteichoic acid (lta) of s. sanguis. mean binding capacities were: 56.5 mumol ca/g wet weight for s. downei cell walls and  47.2 mumol ca/g wet weight for s. sanguis cell walls, and 1.11 mol ca/mol lta phosphate were found. mean dissociation constants (mmol/l) for cell wall calcium  binding were 2.16 mmol/l (s. downei) and 2.69 mmol/l (s. sanguis). these constants were not significantly different from those for whole cells of the same species (rose et al., 1993), but the dissociation constant for lta (7.82 mmol/l)  was significantly higher and suggested a different mode of binding. at neutral ph, at the known calcium concentration of plaque fluid, whole cells and cell walls are likely to be completely saturated with calcium, whereas free lta is only 30% saturated. the large amounts of lta exported by some sucrose-grown streptococci may therefore act as a calcium buffer and so protect the organisms against high local concentrations of calcium produced during demineralization.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

AB  == background: the viridans group streptococcus (svg) include species which may have different pathogenic capacity. this study was aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of bacteremia by different species of svg. patients and methods: one hundred ninety-four clinical records of patients with blood culture(s) isolation  (hemoline/biomerieux) of svg (api 20 strep/biomerieux) over 9 years were reviewed with criteria of clinical significance being established and the results analyzed by the chi square test. results: the most frequent species of svg isolated were:  s. sanguis ii (29.4%), s. mitis (27.3%) and s. anginosus (12.9%). with regard to  the criteria established, 36% of the isolates were clinically significant, associating s. anginosus with significant bacteremia (p = 0.001) and s. mitis with non significant bacteremia (p = 0.04). more than half of the isolations of s. anginosus, s. bovis, s. mutans and s. adjacens were clinically significant with this rate being lower in the remaining species (s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, s. salivarius and s. acidominimus). the significant isolations correspond with endocarditis (s. sanguis ii being responsible for 44%; p = 0.05). in 54.3% of the cases followed by abscesses or other localized infections and severe sepsis in patients with a solid or hematologic tumor with a mortality of 20%. the endocarditis/other disease relation was: greater for the existence of endocarditis for s. sanguis ii, s. sanguis i, s. mutans, s. bovis and s. adjacens; similar in both diseases for s. mitis, and greater for the existence of a non endocardic disease for s. anginosus. conclusions: in this series the isolation of svg group was clinically significant in 36% of cases with a probability of clinical significance and disease association related to the species isolated of svg.

AB  == the toxin-coregulated pilus (tcp)-encoding gene cluster (tcp) specifies a type-iv pilus that is a major colonization determinant of vibrio cholerae. we have identified a gene 200 bp upstream from the tcp cluster that requires toxr for expression. we have designated this gene tagd (toxr-activated gene) and have shown that tagd is encoded on a 600-nt transcript. the deduced tagd product is a  164-amino-acid polypeptide (20 kda). interestingly, tagd shares a high degree of  similarity to a protein of streptococcus sanguis 12 that is thought to play a role in fimbriae synthesis or assembly. the high degree of similarity between tagd and the ss 12 protein provides preliminary evidence that tagd represents an  additional member of the tcp cluster.

AB  == human oral viridans group streptococci that coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii pk606 express surface proteins related to scaa, the coaggregation-mediating adhesin of streptococcus gordonii pk488 (r. n. andersen,  n. ganeshkumar, and p. e. kolenbrander, infect. immun. 61:981-987, 1993). the nucleotide sequence of the 6,125-bp ecori insert of pra1, containing scaa, the gene encoding scaa, was determined. six open reading frames (orfs) were identified. the orientation of four orfs, two upstream (orf 1 and orf 2) and one  downstream (orf 4) of scaa (orf 3), indicated transcription in one direction, whereas orf 5 and orf 6 were transcribed divergently. computer analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences identified a consensus binding site for atp (gxxgxgks) in the putative 28,054-da protein encoded by orf 1. orf 2 potentially  encoded a hydrophobic protein of 29,705 da with six potential membrane-spanning regions. scaa was 310 amino acids, 34,787 da, and contained the lipoprotein consensus sequence lxxc, also reported for the scaa-related proteins ssab, fima,  and psaa from streptococcus sanguis 12, streptococcus parasanguis fw213, and streptococcus pneumoniae r36a, respectively. orf 4 potentially encoded a 163-amino-acid protein of 17,912 da, which was nearly identical to the downstream adjacent gene products of ssab, fima, and psaa. no significant homology with other proteins was found with the putative orf 5 gene product, a 229-amino-acid protein of 25,107 da. orf 6 was incomplete and encoded a protein larger than 564  amino acids. this putative protein had a consensus zn2+ binding motif, hexxh, found among bacterial thermolysins and mammalian neutral endopeptidases and was 40% identical to a homologous 210-amino-acid region of human enkephalinase. the genetic organization of orfs 1, 2, and 3 was similar to those of the bacterial periplasmic-binding protein-dependent transport systems of gram-negative bacteria and binding-lipoprotein-dependent transport systems of gram-positive bacteria, and these genes appeared to encode abc (atp-binding cassette) proteins. this report describes a cell-to-cell adherence function associated with an atp-binding cassette.

TI  == bacteremia due to viridans streptococci in neutropenic patients: a review.
AB  == viridans streptococci have long been considered, with the exception of the ability to cause endocarditis, as minor pathogenic agents. more recently, however, these bacteria have become a major concern in neutropenic patients undergoing a chemotherapeutic treatment. in this high-risk population, they can be responsible for up to 39% of bacteremia cases and are the most frequent cause  of this type of infection. the most frequently isolated species in blood cultures are streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis ii. viridans streptococcus bacteremia can be accompanied by serious complications, like adult respiratory distress syndrome (ards) (3% to 33%), shock (7% to 18%) or endocarditis (7% to 8%). mortality rates range from 6% to 30%. case-control studies have identified the following risk factors: severe neutropenia (< 100 neutrophils/mm3), prophylactic antibiotic treatments with quinolone or co-trimoxazole, absence of intravenous antibiotics at the time of bacteremia, high doses of cytosine arabinoside, oropharyngeal mucositis, and heavy colonization by viridans streptococci. the introduction of penicillin in prophylactic antibiotic treatments has reduced the incidence of these infections, but the long-term use of penicillin could be compromised by the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == cell surface protein receptors in oral streptococci.
AB  == streptococci have a vast repertoire of adherence properties which include binding to human tissue components, epithelial cells and to other bacterial cells. these  interactions are determined by the expression of cell-surface receptors some of which are species-specific. in the oral streptococci, two families of surface protein receptors with highly conserved amino acid sequences have been identified. the antigen i/ii family of polypeptides are wall-associated high molecular mass proteins (158-166 kda) with several binding functions that may be  attributed to different domains of the receptor molecules. the lrai family of polypeptides are surface-associated lipoproteins (32-33 kda) involved in adherence of streptococci to salivary glycoprotein pellicle and to oral actinomyces. a region of amino acid sequence similarity is evident amongst members of the two protein families in streptococcus gordonii. ligand-binding specificities of these receptor polypeptides may account for species-specific adherence and site-directed colonization of streptococci within the human oral cavity.

AB  == to investigate the antigenic variation and relationships of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) proteases among different species and genera, we examined a comprehensive  collection of serine type and metallo-type iga1 proteases and corresponding antisera in enzyme neutralization assays. sharing of neutralizing epitopes of metallo-type iga1 proteases from streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis and of serine type iga1 proteases from haemophilus and pathogenic neisseria species was extremely limited. a number of limited to strong cross-reactions in such epitopes were found among serine type iga1 proteases released by members of the genera haemophilus and neisseria,  reflecting the common origin of their iga gene. however, the relatively limited prevalence of shared "neutralizing" epitopes of iga1 proteases from the two genera indicates that they rarely induce immunity to each other. in contrast, extensive sharing of neutralizing epitopes was found between n. meningitidis and  n. gonorrhoeae iga1 proteases, making them potentially attractive vaccine components. among metallo-type iga1 proteases, several pneumococcal proteases were found to induce neutralizing antibodies to iga1 proteases of oral streptococci whereas the opposite was not the case.

AB  == the intent of this study was to assess the effects of continued laboratory subculturing on selected biochemical properties of oral streptococci freshly isolated from dental plaque. six fresh isolates (3 streptococcus mutans and 3 non-mutans) and 2 laboratory strains were subcultured daily for a total of 225 transfers, and cells were harvested every 75 transfers from duplicate batch cultures grown with glucose at a constant ph. eleven biochemical properties were  assayed with cells, membranes and cell-free extracts and the results subjected to statistical analysis for differences between the duplicate cultures and the various subcultures. in addition, the activity of 19 hydrolytic enzymes was assayed with the semiquantitative apizym system (analytab products). the activity of zero-time samples varied by as much as 241-fold for a single property with particularly low activity for eiiglc of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system and cell-associated extracellular polysaccharide synthesis. the 3 s. mutans fresh isolates had higher activity in 8 of the 11 assays compared with the 3 non-mutans strains, with extracellular polysaccharide  synthesis the most significant trait. statistical analysis of the 2816 assays of  the 11 traits for the 8 test strains at the 4 selected time intervals revealed considerable change in the activity of the test parameters. the most notable changes in the s. mutans strains over the 225 subcultures were significant increases in glycolytic activity and decreases in hydrophobicity and extracellular polysaccharide synthesis activity. of the measured properties, lactate dehydrogenase and cell-associated extracellular polysaccharide synthesis  activity were the most stable and h+/atpase activity was the most variable.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro modulation of oral bacterial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads by milk casein derivatives.
AB  == bovine caseinate, derivatives of its glycosylated moiety [caseinoglycomacropeptide (cgp)], and caseinophosphopeptides were evaluated as inhibitors of adhesion of oral bacteria to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads (s-ha). all milk casein-derived components behaved as potent inhibitors of streptococcus sanguis omz 9 and streptococcus sobrinus omz 176 adhesion to s-ha,  whereas neither bovine serum albumin nor polyethyleneglycol were able to interfere with the adhesion of these strains. by contrast, none of the molecular  species tested was able to inhibit the attachment of actinomyces viscosus ny 1 to s-ha. on the other hand, casein derivatives were shown to displace human serum albumin from s-ha beads. they were also able to bind to the bacterial cell surface of all strains examined. collectively, these findings suggest that interactions between acidic casein-derived milk components and the biological surfaces involved in bacterial adhesion to s-ha result in an inhibitory effect that is selective for the oral streptococci examined.

TI  == the antibacterial and anti-staining properties of the novel anti-adherent agent m239, 144 alone and in combination with chlorhexidine.
AB  == the anti-adherent agent m239,144 has been shown to reduce the adhesion of s. sanguis strains to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite by 27-94%. the purpose of this study was to determine any antibacterial properties of m239,144 which might inhibit replication of the organisms which do adhere and to determine whether m239,144 interferes with the antibacterial properties of the antiseptic agent chlorhexidine. maximum inhibitory dilutions (mids) were calculated using both broth and agar methods. 0.1% m239,144 displayed no antibacterial activity against s. oralis nctc 7864 or s. sanguis nctc 7863 using the broth dilution method and had no antibacterial activity against a range of plaque-forming organisms using the agar dilution method. the anti-bacterial activity of chlorhexidine against four of five oral plaque-forming species was reduced by 0.1% m239,144. the effect of a novel anti-adherent agent, mk239,144, on chlorhexidine staining was assessed in an in vitro model. 1% m239,144 completely prevented chlorhexidine staining at  concentrations from 0.0002% to 0.2%. m239,144/chlorhexidine formulations show potential for a non-staining anti-plaque mouthwash.

TI  == a comparative study of the aggregation of human, rat and rabbit platelets by members of the streptococcus sanguis group.
AB  == aggregation of platelets by bacteria is a potential factor in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. twenty-five strains from the streptococcus sanguis group, including 15 recent isolates from cases of endocarditis, were compared for their  ability to aggregate human and rat platelets over periods of 15 and 25 min, respectively. in each case, 76% of strains caused aggregation; the median time to onset of aggregation was longer for human platelets (12 min) than for rat platelets (1 min). strains unable to aggregate human platelets included three from cases of endocarditis. there was no correlation between the ability to aggregate human and rat platelets, although the majority of strains (60%) aggregated both. tests on representative strains for their ability to aggregate rabbit platelets gave results similar to those for rat platelets, including a median time of 1 min to onset of aggregation. the differences in the ability of individual bacterial strains to aggregate human and animal platelets indicate that caution is needed in extrapolating in-vitro observations to the in-vivo situation.

TI  == an in vitro investigation of the cariogenic potential of oral streptococci.
AB  == whilst the importance of the mutans streptococci in the aetiology of dental caries is clear, a number of studies have described caries development in their absence. this investigation aimed to assess the cariogenic potential of streptococcus gordonii, strep. sanguis, strep. vestibularis and enterococcus faecalis in comparison with strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus, using a recently described in vitro model. in the presence of a 146 mm sucrose solution and powdered hydroxyapatite, each species was incubated for 5 h, after which acid anion production, calcium release and change in ph were measured. it was possible to assign each species to one of three groups, with e. faecalis, strep. gordonii, strep. sanguis exhibiting low, strep. vestibularis intermediate, and strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus high in vitro cariogenic potential. this assay could be used as a screening test to assess the potential cariogenicity of a range of bacterial species.

TI  == detection of streptococcus pneumoniae dna in blood cultures by pcr.
AB  == we have developed a pcr assay, with primers derived from the autolysin (lyt) gene, for the detection of streptococcus pneumoniae dna in blood cultures. the predicted fragment of 247 bp was detected in all strains of pneumococci, embracing 12 different serotypes that were tested. although dna extracted from four viridans streptococci spp. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus parasanguis) gave amplification products, these were quite different from the predicted fragment for s. pneumoniae. application of the assay for diagnosis of septicemia caused by s. pneumoniae showed concordance between pcr and culture results. however, on four occasions pcr was positive in supernatants from both paired culture bottles while pneumococci were cultured from only one. performing pcr on negative cultures in controlled studies such as vaccine trials may provide a sensitive tool for increasing case detection.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of chlorhexidine and arginine sustained-release varnishes in the mentally retarded.
AB  == local applications of sustained-released varnishes of chlorhexidine and arginine  were used in a controlled pilot study of 34 mentally retarded patients, ages 18-45, assigned to one of these groups: chlorhexidine (c), arginine (a), or placebo (p). a professional scaling followed by four weeks of professional brushing to reach a plaque index (pii) and gingival index (gi) of 1.0 at baseline preceded eight weeks of daily varnish application to the buccal and labial surfaces of all teeth. clinical parameters (pii and gi) and bacterial samples from selected teeth were collected at predetermined intervals. four and eight weeks following the baseline, the pii was significantly different among the groups, with the lowest score in the chlorhexidine group. no significant differences among the three groups were noted for the gi. the chlorhexidine and arginine groups showed significant reductions (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively) in the number of s. mutans. the arginine group showed a nonsignificant increase in the number of s. sanguis. these results suggest that the topical antimicrobial agents may have some relevance to plaque control among  patients with mental retardation.

TI  == fine antigen specificity of human gamma delta t cell lines (v gamma 9+) established by repetitive stimulation with a serotype (kth-1) of a gram-positive  bacterium, streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == we have established human gamma delta t cell lines specific for streptococcus sanguis (s. sanguis) kth-1 present in normal oral cavity flora. the cd4-cd8-cd3+v gamma 9+v delta 1-cd45ro+ cd25+ t cell lines showed a proliferative response to the streptococcal antigen (ag) in the presence of autologous antigen-presenting cells without apparent evidence of hla restriction. the proliferative response of the gamma delta t cell lines was completely blocked by anti-tcr gamma delta monoclonal antibody (mab) and anti-hla class i mab (w6/32), whereas anti-hla classical class ia mab (b-h9; anti-hla-a,b,c), anti-hla class ii mab (anti-dr, anti-dq, and anti-dp) and anti-cd4 mab did not have any inhibitory effects. surprisingly, the gamma delta t cell lines showed the proliferative response against the original bacterial ag kth-1 exclusively, and exhibited no cross-reactivity with nominal ag such as purified protein derivative of tuberculin, tetanus toxoid and mycobacterium tuberculosis, or the same species but different strain of s. sanguis, american type culture collection (atcc) standard strain (10556), or even with the same strain but different serotype of s. sanguis, kth-3. moreover, cytokine production of the gamma delta t cell lines  was similar to the th1 pattern [interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and tnf-beta]. they also produced interleukin-8 that functions as one of chemoattractants for polymorphonuclear cells. using direct sequencing technique of the polymerase chain reaction products, we found that junctional diversity of the t cell receptor (tcr) used by the parental kth-1 specific gamma  delta t cell line and its subclones is rather limited. it is suggested that gamma delta t cells with canonical tcr could preferentially respond to kth-1 ag. thus,  in addition to a broad or cross-reactivity of gamma delta t cells against phylogenetically conserved stress/heat-shock protein, which is well characterized by others, some peripheral blood gamma delta t cells could recognize and kill exogenous agents with fine antigenic specificity to protect the body against them.

TI  == hospital practices influence the pattern of infective endocarditis.
AB  == objective: to identify factors contributing to infective endocarditis at a major  teaching hospital. methods: retrospective review of clinical records of patients  diagnosed with endocarditis by standard case definitions with respect to causative organisms, clinical features and outcome. results: one hundred and ninety-three episodes of endocarditis seen between 1979 and 1992 at westmead hospital, sydney, were reviewed. in the 174 cases where the causative organism was isolated, 75 (43%) were staphylococcus aureus and 50 (29%) were viridans streptococci. nosocomial acquisition and/or inter-hospital transfer accounted for 83 episodes; 48 (58%) s. aureus (p < 0.001) and nine (11%) viridans streptococci  (p < 0.001). in cases from the local community, viridans streptococci were more common than s. aureus (37% versus 25%); these included 18 episodes (14 s. aureus) in intravenous drug users. conclusion: we conclude that, compared with community-acquired infections, the aetiology of endocarditis in a large teaching  hospital is influenced strongly by the prevalence of nosocomial endocarditis and  the need for interhospital transfer of complicated cases.

TI  == role of amoxicillin serum levels for successful prophylaxis of experimental endocarditis due to tolerant streptococci.
AB  == the importance of amoxicillin serum profiles for successful prophylaxis of experimental endocarditis in rats was assessed. animals with catheter-induced vegetations were challenged intravenously with large inocula of streptococcus sanguis and received one of the following amoxicillin dosages: single or multiple bolus injection of 40 mg/kg; 40 mg/kg administered as a continuous infusion over  12 h; or either 9 or 18 mg/kg administered over 12 or 24 h, respectively. the regimen producing a single transient high peak serum level failed to prevent experimental endocarditis; in contrast, a second injection 6 h after the first resulted in successful prophylaxis. likewise, the three regimens of continuous, relatively low-dose regimens prevented infections. thus, the most important parameter for successful prophylaxis was the duration of inhibitory concentration of the drug in the serum. the total dose of antibiotic, the peak serum levels, or the area-under-the-curve values were not predictive of successful prophylaxis.

TI  == pioneer oral streptococci produce immunoglobulin a1 protease.
AB  == as part of a longitudinal study of the relationship between bacterial colonization and the secretory immune response, 367 isolates of pioneer viridans  streptococci collected from 40 breast- and bottle-fed neonates within the first month postpartum were tested for the production of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease and glycosidases. fifty percent of the streptococci isolated produced iga1 protease, including all isolates of streptococcus oralis and s. sanguis, 60.7% of s. mitis biovar 1 isolates, and some isolates that could not be identified. three cleavage patterns of alpha 1 heavy chains were observed. six isolates of s. mitis biovar 1 that did not produce iga1 protease attacked the alpha 1 chain. incubation of iga1 protease-negative s. mitis biovar 1 isolates with iga1, either prior to or together with s. sanguis, rendered the iga1 paraprotein resistant to cleavage by the iga1 protease of s. sanguis. the ability of some pioneer streptococci in the human oral cavity to produce iga1 protease and of others to modify the susceptibility of iga1 to cleavage by iga1 protease perhaps enhances their ability to survive in this habitat.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == evidence for an ecto-atpase on the cell wall of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == certain strains of viridans streptococci bind platelets, which release atp from dense granules and then aggregate. by hydrolyzing the released atp to the platelet agonist, adp, cell wall-associated atpase activity of streptococcus sanguis may amplify the aggregation of platelets. to identify and characterize this ecto-atpase activity, whole cells were incubated with [14c]-atp. the cell-free nucleotides were separated by thin-layer chromatography and quantified  by liquid scintillation counting. whole-cell activity showed temperature and ph optima in the physiological range. to isolate a soluble fraction with atpase activity from the cell wall, whole cells were digested under osmotically stable conditions to produce protoplasts. protoplasts and cells were separated from soluble cell wall materials by centrifugation. atpase activity in cell fractions  was identified by zymograms of native 8% polyacrylamide gels after electrophoresis. the ecto-atpase preparation, membrane and cytoplasmic atpase in  lysed protoplasts showed different zymograms and sensitivity to inhibition by dccd, ouabain vanadate, azide and nem. in electron micrographs of ultrathin sections of cells of s. sanguis, atpase activity was localized to the cell wall.  since the pattern of localization to the wall changed with the phase of growth, the ecto-atpase of s. sanguis may be associated with the development and maintenance of the cell wall.

AB  == the efficacy of imipenem alone or in combination with gentamicin for the treatment of experimental endocarditis in rabbits caused by a penicillin resistant strain of streptococcus sanguis was compared to that of gentamicin and  penicillin g. in vitro, both beta-lactams were bactericidal in action and the combination of gentamicin and imipenem was synergistic after 4 h whereas penicillin g and gentamicin showed synergy after 8 h. antibiotic treatment was started two days after initiating infection and groups of 20 animals were treated for 5 days with imipenem alone or in combination with gentamicin or with gentamicin and penicillin g. two of 20 rabbits which received no therapy died whereas all other rabbits survived the treatment period. blood cultures became negative in 19 rabbits on the second day of treatment with imipenem and gentamicin and sterilization of the vegetations was achieved in 12 animals. in contrast, eight animals given the alternative treatments remained bacteraemic and viable organisms were recovered from the vegetations in every case. however, bacterial counts and vegetation weights only differed significantly between treated animals and controls but not between the different treatment groups. never the less, these data suggest that combined treatment with imipenem and gentamicin might provide an effective regimen for patients with endocarditis caused by penicillin resistant s. sanguis.

AB  == the clinical and immunological 8-year follow-up of a 45-year old female with hypereosinophilic syndrome and cardiac involvement of loffler's fibroplastic endocarditis which was complicated by infective endocarditis during immunosuppressive treatment is presented. all 3 stages of the disease were documented by clinical and histologic data: stage 1 by biopsy proven eosinophilic myocarditis and arteritis, stage 2 with berlin blue positive parietal thrombosis, and the fibrotic features of stage 3 both by fibrosis in the latest biopsies and  by echocardiography. it was remarkable, however, that this classic clinical case  of loffler's endocarditis lacked a few serological markers postulated to be found regularly, e.g., a positive staining for the cationic protein and major ribonucleases. instead, the patient demonstrated all the immunological features of autoreactive myocarditis with cytolytic, complement fixing antimyolemmal antibodies. after an initial loading dose of 120 mg prednisolone per day for 6 weeks (11/1986), the steroid dosage was reduced to 40 mg (12/1986) and diminished to 15 mg/day in 1988 to 1989. finally, the patient was on 4 mg prednisolone per day for almost 4 years. in 1987, azathioprine was added in the dose of 150 mg/day for 6 weeks. in 3/1994 the patient developed infective endocarditis with streptococcus sanguis and presented with dyspnoea. by echocardiography a large floating structure was diagnosed on the anterior mitral leaflet and the left atrium was enlarged by severe mitral regurgitation. infective endocarditis was successfully treated with antibiotics, but mitral regurgitation made valve replacement obligatory.

"milleri" (1), s. pneumoniae (1), s. acidominimus (1), and gemella haemolysans (1). these species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). a count of the gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.

TI  == dextranase enhances antibiotic efficacy in experimental viridans streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == in endocarditis, exopolysaccharide production by viridans streptococci has been associated with delayed antimicrobial efficacy in cardiac vegetations. we compared the efficacies of temafloxacin alone and in combination with dextranase, an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing 20 to 90% of the bacterial glycocalyx, in a rabbit model of endocarditis. in in vivo experiments, rabbits were infected intravenously with 10(8) streptococcus sanguis organisms and were treated 6 days  later with temafloxacin (50 mg/kg of body weight intramuscularly twice a day) alone or combined with dextranase (1,000 u per rabbit per day intravenously). after 4 days of treatment (day 11), the animals were sacrificed and vegetations were quantitatively cultured. for ex vivo experiments, rabbits were infected as stated above and, on day 11, vegetations were excised aseptically and incubated in vitro in rabbit serum alone (control) or with temafloxacin or temafloxacin plus dextranase at concentrations similar to peak levels in plasma. in vitro, dextranase alone had no antimicrobial effect. in vivo and ex vivo, temafloxacin combined with dextranase was more effective than temafloxacin alone (p < 0.05). our results suggest that dextranase is able to increase the effects of temafloxacin by reducing the amount of bacterial glycocalyx in infected vegetations, as confirmed in vitro by electron microscopy showing a markedly reduced amount of glycocalyx and a more clearly visible fibrin matrix.

TI  == treatment of experimental endocarditis caused by penicillin-resistant streptococcus sanguis with different doses of teicoplanin.
AB  == streptococcus viridans continues to be the most frequent causal agent of infective endocarditis. treatment has become more complicated due to the increase in resistance to penicillin and cephalosporins. in order to study the possible efficacy of teicoplanin at low and high doses, this antibiotic was investigated in rabbits as a monotherapy and in association with gentamicin. the effects were  compared with a control group and a group given classical penicillin-gentamicin treatment. infective endocarditis was induced in 120 rabbits with a clinical isolate of streptococcus sanguis. treatment was started 48 h after infection, and lasted 5 days. animals were divided into 6 groups of 20 rabbits each: g1, untreated controls; g2, penicillin+gentamicin; g3 low-dose teicoplanin; g4, low-dose teicoplanin+gentamicin; g5, high-dose teicoplanin; and g6, high-dose teicoplanin+gentamicin. response to therapy was evaluated with mortality curves,  negativization of blood cultures, concentration of s. sanguis in aortic vegetations and rate of sterilization of vegetations. vegetation weight was significantly lower in treated groups than in controls; lower weights were found  in g4, the only treatment that sterilized 65% of vegetations. death occurred only in the control group (10% mortality). negativization of blood cultures was greatest and most rapid in g4, followed by g6. concentrations of s. sanguis in aortic vegetations were significantly lower in all treated groups compared with controls, with the lowest being in groups g4 and g6. combined treatment with teicoplanin+gentamicin may be highly efficacious in patients with endocarditis caused by penicillin-resistant streptococcus sanguis. high-dose teicoplanin+gentamicin does not seem to be more efficacious than low-dose teicoplanin+gentamicin.

AB  == tachyplesin i, a polycationic antimicrobial peptide isolated from hemocytes of horseshoe crabs, kills bacteria by disrupting the membrane potential of the cytoplasmic membrane. the present study shows that, among 36 oral streptococcal strains, 12 of 21 streptococcus sanguis, 3 streptococcus mutans, 9 streptococcus  salivarius and 3 streptococcus milleri strains were susceptible to tachyplesin i, whereas 9 s. sanguis strains were resistant. interestingly, these resistant strains include the clinical isolates from both kawasaki disease and behcet patients. according to the time-kill study, tachyplesin i inhibited irreversibly  the growth of s. sanguis, s. mutans and s. salivarius strains within 20 min and an s. milleri strain within 80 min. although it has been suggested that escherichia coli cultured in rich media were more susceptible to tachyplesin i, the present results show that only 3 s. milleri strains were more sensitized to tachyplesin i in a glucose-supplemented medium, and other tested strains were not. similarly, only 4 strains were more resistant to tachyplesin i in saline than these were in a rich medium.

TI  == in vivo activities and penetration of the two components of the streptogramin rp  59500 in cardiac vegetations of experimental endocarditis.
AB  == we evaluated the in vivo activity and the diffusion of radiolabelled rp 57669 (rpi) and rp 54476 (rpii), the two components of the injectable streptogramin rp  59500, alone or in combination, in aortic vegetations from experimental endocarditis in rabbits. rpi and rpii demonstrated in vitro bacteriostatic and bactericidal synergy against a clinical strain of staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin and susceptible to erythromycin. in experimental staphylococcal endocarditis, rp 59500 was as effective as vancomycin and significantly more effective than rpi (p < 0.01) and rpii (p < 0.05). autoradiography studies showed different patterns of distribution into cardiac vegetations infected with streptococcus sanguis for [14c]rpi and [14c]rpii. [14c]rpi was homogeneously distributed throughout the vegetations whereas [14c]rpii showed a decreasing gradient of concentration between the periphery and the core of the vegetation, with an approximately 2:1 ratio. [14c]rpi diffused approximately 2 to 4 times more than [14c]rpii into the core of the vegetations. since the injected ratio of rpi and rpii is 30:70 in rp 59500, the actual rpi:rpii ratio in the core of the vegetation may range from 0.8 to 1.7, a ratio which remains compatible with the in vivo synergism demonstrated between the two components.

TI  == association of salivary bacterial aggregating activity with sulfomucin.
AB  == the requirements of human salivary mucins for aggregating potential towards the common cariogenic oral bacteria, s. mutans and s. sanguis, were investigated. agglutination inhibition assays demonstrated that the aggregating capacity towards bacteria resides in the acidic mucin fraction. the inhibitory activity of the acidic mucin decreased only 2-4-fold following removal of sialic acid, whereas the desulfation caused a complete loss of the inhibitory potential against both bacteria. furthermore, the aggregating capacity of mucin-derived sulfated oligosaccharide was found to be 16-fold higher than that of the sialic acid containing oligosaccharide. the results point towards the importance of salivary sulfomucins as a predominant factor in the defense of oral cavity against cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == endocarditis due to high level gentamicin resistant enterococcus faecium.
AB  == we describe the first reported case in the literature of bacterial endocarditis caused by enterococcus faecium that was highly resistant to gentamicin. the case  is unusual in that it followed a successfully treated streptococcus sanguis endocarditis. the micro-organism was susceptible only to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin and to agents such as pristinamycin and daptomycin which are not routinely available for treatment. it illustrates the therapeutic dilemma posed by serious infections with such micro-organisms and supports previous observations that early heart valve replacement surgery may be  necessary to achieve cure of endocarditis due to enterococci which are highly resistant to gentamicin. it further emphasises the importance of screening for high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci in all life threatening enterococcal infections, including endocarditis, septicaemia and meningitis when  aminoglycoside-penicillin synergy is required for successful treatment.

TI  == an appraisal of the virulence factors associated with streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == platelet aggregation is believed to be a virulence factor in infective endocarditis. other factors may be adhesion to components of thrombotic vegetations, particularly platelets, fibronectin and fibrinogen. two strains from the streptococcus sanguis group (ssg) were chosen for comparative study on the basis that one aggregated both human and rat platelets and the other lacked this  capacity. both strains caused endocarditis in the rat model but the aggregating strain was found in higher numbers in the excised vegetations. the nonaggregating strain was unable to bind to human or rat platelets but could bind insoluble fibronectin, insoluble fibrinogen and platelet-fibrin clots from both sources, albeit to a lesser extent than the aggregating strain. these results suggest that whereas adhesion to, and aggregation of, platelets are not essential events in the initiation of the pathogenesis of experimental endocarditis, they may be factors contributing to virulence.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effect of pyrophosphate on oral bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether pyrophosphate, the anticalculus component of tartar-control dentifrices, exerts antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria commonly found in supragingival plaque. minimal inhibitory concentrations of pyrophosphate were determined for streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans (serotype c), actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces  naeslundii. all of the bacteria tested were susceptible to pyrophosphate with identical minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.67% wt/vol (25 mm). bactericidal kinetics assays revealed that both s. mutans and a. viscosus were killed by pyrophosphate, with the latter being considerably more susceptible. the mechanism of killing was not due to high ionic strength, as comparable controls showed no loss in numbers of viable cells. brief exposure (two 5-min incubations) of s. mutans to pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate caused pronounced inhibition of growth over the 24-h test period. under the constraints of the conditions used, these studies indicate that pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate can substantially inhibit the growth of oral bacteria. these compounds may affect the oral microflora of patients who routinely use tartar-control dentifrices and mouthrinses.

AB  == strains of streptococcus, actinomyces and lactobacillus were grown on glass surfaces in semi-defined medium (ph 7.0) with mucin, at a dilution rate of d = 0.1 h-1, in a modified chemostat. the accumulation of cells followed four phases. in phase 1 (0-1 h), cells did not divide on the surfaces and adhesion accounted for rapid accumulation. phase 2 (1-4 h) comprised adhesion and cell division, and accumulation slowed, cell number doubling times (cdt) streptococcus, 2.7 h to 8.6 h, actinomyces, 2.3 h to 7.5 h and lactobacillus, 3.6 h to 3.8 h. cell division on surfaces accounted for accumulation in phase 3 (4 h to 12 h): cdt streptococcus, 1.7 h to 5.2 h, actinomyces, 2.4 h to 7.5 h and lactobacillus, 2.2 h to 7.2 h. the biofilm stabilized in phase 4, cdt 18.5 h to 90.2 h. the numbers  (10(6) colony-forming units per cm2) of cells in stable biofilms were streptococcus, 4.02 to 5.12, actinomyces, 12.5 and 34.0 and lactobacillus, 2.77.  accumulation increased (cdt 0.9 h-2.7 h) when cells were exposed to glucose excess or high dilution rates and phase 2 of accumulation did not occur.

TI  == conservation of salivary glycoprotein-interacting and human immunoglobulin g-cross-reactive domains of antigen i/ii in oral streptococci.
AB  == in this study we localized more precisely the salivary glycoprotein-interacting and the human immunoglobulin g (higg)-cross-reacting domains on the sr molecule,  an antigen i/ii-related protein from s. mutans serotype f. mapping of the sr molecule with polypeptides expressed by subclones covering the entire molecule and with synthetic peptides demonstrates that the salivary glycoprotein-binding domain is located in the n-terminal alanine-rich repeats of the sr molecule. in order to investigate the degree of conservation of both regions in various oral streptococci, we tested the reactivity of 8 representative strains of the mutans  group and 11 nonmutans oral streptococcus strains (s. anginosus, s. milleri, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. salivarius, and s. mitis strains) with antipeptide antibodies in a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay together with colony hybridization analysis using dna probes  designed to map these two regions. all the mutans group strains except s. rattus  and the 11 nonmutans streptococcal strains showed a high conservation of the c-terminal part of the sr molecule, especially the higg-cross-reacting domain, and less homology for the n-terminal salivary glycoprotein-binding region. almost all of the sera from patients with rheumatic disease reacted strongly with sr from s. mutans serotype f, p1 from s. mutans serotype c, and four peptides located in the higg-cross-reacting region and not with peptides located at the c  and n termini and in the proline-rich repeats. these results confirm that epitopes located within this region are immunogenic in humans and could lead to the synthesis of natural anti-igg antibodies.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine varnish on streptococci in dental plaque from occlusal fissures.
AB  == the treatment of tooth surfaces with chlorhexidine varnish may lead to long-lasting suppression of mutants streptococci in dental plaque. microbiological observations following varnish treatment suggest that this prolonged suppression might be caused by bacterial interference. to investigate whether physiologically related organisms, such as other streptococcus species, compete with mutans streptococci in the ecosystem, we have analyzed streptococcal populations on the tooth surface before and after chlorhexidine varnish treatment. occlusal surfaces with high numbers of mutans streptococci were selected in human volunteers and treated with chlorhexidine varnish. analyses of  sequentially collected plaque samples confirmed that s. oralis-group streptococci returned to baseline levels shortly after the chlorhexidine application, while actinomyces naeslundii populations reached prestudy or even higher levels only several days after treatment. mutans streptococci, however, were below the detection level in the 14-day samples, except in 1 individual. the pattern of recolonization by individual streptococcus species after chlorhexidine application closely resembled that of cleaned enamel surfaces: s. oralis and s. sanguis were primary colonizers while s. gordonii became dominant at a later stage. it is concluded that after intensive chlorhexidine treatment, a normal oral microflora reestablished, characterized by low proportions of mutans streptococci.

AB  == the aim of this investigation was to determine whether sublethal concentrations of chlorhexidine (cx), hexetidine (hx), cetylpyridinium chloride (cc), sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds), sanguinarine (sg), sodium fluoride (naf), and ammonium fluoride (nh4f) could affect hydrophobicity and adhesion of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha). determination of the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) showed that both species were susceptible to all agents tested. growth in the presence of sub-mic concentrations of cx, sds, cc, naf, or nh4f did not change significantly the hydrophobicity of s. sanguis cells when compared to the control which lacked any  agent. however, growth in the presence of hx or sg resulted in a significant reduction in their hydrophobicity. sub-mic levels of sds or sg in the growth medium resulted in s. mutans cells with increased affinity for hexadecane compared with the control. the adherence of s. sanguis was changed significantly  only by hx or sg, resulting in less cells adhering to s-ha. however, s. mutans cells previously incubated with naf, nh4f, or sg showed a higher adherence to s-ha than the control. the mechanisms of interference with adherence are at present not completely understood. thus, antimicrobial agents at sub-mic concentrations can interfere selectively with hydrophobicity and/or adhesion of oral streptococci.

AB  == the potential antimicrobial activity of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and adriamycin against gram positive and negative bacteria and candida albicans was examined. the time taken for different microbial inocula to turn a simulated blood culture positive in the presence of different concentrations of these drugs was measured. doxorubicin retarded the growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus sanguis in a concentration dependent manner. cyclophosphamide and vincristine showed minimal antimicrobial activity. escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by any of the drugs. an inoculum dependent effect was seen with some combinations of microbial inocula and cytotoxic drug concentrations.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == evaluation of the capacity of oral streptococci to produce hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the capacity of 11 strains of oral streptococcal species (streptococcus sanguis,  s. oralis, s. mitis and s. sobrinus) to produce hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) was studied in vitro. detection of this property in solid media, particularly with trypticase soy agar-benzidine-peroxidase, was more sensitive than in liquid media. the addition of carbohydrates (arabinose, xylose, mannose, sorbose and lactose), sorbitol and saccharine to buffered trypticase soy broth increased h2o2 production in s. oralis nctc 11427, although the concentrations obtained with some substrates (glucose, galactose, mannitol and xylitol) were lower than those  obtained in controls. in s. sanguis nctc 7863, h2o2 production was detected only  with galactose, sorbitol, lactose and saccharin.

TI  == dental infections as a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction.
AB  == the so-called classic risk factors of coronary heart disease (chd) do not explain all its clinical and epidemiological features. recent evidence suggests that certain infections, among them dental infections, are involved in the pathogenesis of chd. case-control studies have revealed an association between dental infections and acute myocardial infarction and chronic coronary heart disease. a large epidemiological survey revealed an association between missing teeth and chd and a recent 14-year follow-up of 9760 individuals showed that periodontitis is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. preliminary results suggest that the severity of dental infections correlates with the extent of coronary atheromatosis. individuals with severe dental infections also have higher level of von willebrand factor antigen, leukocytes and fibrinogen. streptococcus sanguis has been shown to aggregate human platelets in vitro. the mechanism behind the association between dental infections and chd  could be the effect of bacteria on the cells taking part in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis.

TI  == antiseptic mouthrinse-induced microbial cell surface alterations.
AB  == this study determined the effect of an essential oil-containing mouthrinse, listerine antiseptic, on microbial cell surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy. twenty-four hour cultures of c. albicans, a. viscosus, s. sanguis, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were harvested and washed in  buffer. triplicate samples were overlaid on poly-l-lysine coated coverslips, immersed in either listerine or buffer for 30 seconds, fixed in glutaraldehyde followed by post-fixing in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in peldri ii. exposure of the microorganisms to listerine antiseptic for 30 seconds  resulted in distinct morphological alterations of cell surfaces suggestive of loss of cell surface integrity. the extent of alteration varied among the structurally different species; cell surface roughening was mild in s. sanguis but extensive in the other microorganisms which developed distinct surface blebs  and other abnormalities after the 30-second exposure. these results suggest that  a brief exposure to listerine produces significant morphological changes which may be associated with cell death and may help explain the alteration of surface-associated activities demonstrated in previous studies.

TI  == purification and characterization of chimeric human iga1 and iga2 expressed in cos and chinese hamster ovary cells.
AB  == ag-specific chimeric human iga molecules, of the two human subclasses, iga1 and iga2, have been expressed in two mammalian cell systems. analysis of the secreted iga molecules, purified in milligram quantities from stable chinese hamster ovary transfectants by ag affinity chromatography, has allowed a direct comparison of the biologic properties of the two subclasses. hplc gel filtration analysis revealed that in both subclasses, the iga molecules associate predominantly into  dimers. the monomer units are presumed to interact noncovalently, inasmuch as no  dimers are evident when the antibodies are subjected to sds-page. the recombinant antibodies are glycosylated, inasmuch as a lectin blotting procedure revealed that the h chains of both subclasses are recognized by con a. when subjected to digestion by preparations of iga1-specific proteases secreted by two pathogenic streptococcal strains, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis, the recombinant iga molecules behave just as their natural equivalents. thus, only the chimeric iga1 molecule is cleaved, with the iga2 remaining intact. in terms of interaction with natural effector molecules, both recombinant iga isotypes were shown to interact with fc alpha receptors on calcitriol-stimulated hl-60 cells with similar affinity, but neither antibody was found to interact with human c1q. the expression system described readily permits manipulation of the human iga genes, which should lead to a fuller molecular understanding of how this important antibody mediates its function.

TI  == grouping of oral streptococcal species using fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy in comparison with classical microbiological identification.
AB  == the grouping and identification made by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir) of 40 oral streptococcal strains was compared with their known taxonomic  positions. grouping was obtained by cluster analysis on the spectral distances between the first derivative spectra of the strains. spectra were divided into five spectral 'windows' and cluster analysis was either on either a combination of all five windows or on a selected window. the oral streptococci were divided into two main clusters, mutans streptococci and other streptococci. this division was based mainly on the spectral information contained in the window between 1300-900 cm-1, indicative of polysaccharide and phosphate-carrying compounds. in  the grouping based on the entire spectrum, species clusters could be observed for streptococcus crista, strep. salivarius and strep. rattus. a few strains were placed in wrong clusters because of intra-strain variance. it is concluded that the grouping of these oral streptococcal species was good and similar to the classical taxonomy and that ft-ir might develop into a new identification method  for oral streptococci.

AB  == a bacteriological study of isolates from the oral cavity of patients with kawasaki disease (kd), age-matched non-kd patients and healthy children, showed that over half the kd and control isolates had gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci. about 50% of these organisms were identified as viridans streptococci by means of an api strep 20 kit. further identification by fluorometric dna-dna hybridisation demonstrated that the predominant species were s. oralis and s. mitis, each of which accounted for 25% of the isolates of viridans streptococci;  40% of viridans strains were unidentifiable; and s. sanguis and s. parasanguis were minor components. studies in vivo showed that insertion of culture supernates of most of the viridans streptococci increased capillary permeability  and induced redness with swelling and occasional bleeding in rabbit skin. one-third of s. mitis strains and one-fifth of the unidentified strains caused aggregation of human blood platelets, whereas s. oralis and other strains had no  such effect. the distribution of extracellular lipoteichoic acids and glucan produced in the presence of sucrose was also examined. there were no significant  differences in the recovery rate of viridans streptococci forming these biologically active extracellular products between kd and control groups.

TI  == effect of thrombocytopenia on the early course of streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == although platelets are a major factor in the pathogenesis of endocarditis, it is  unclear if these cells promote or limit disease progression. to address this issue, the effects of thrombocytopenia on the early course of endovascular infection were examined. aortic valve endocarditis was produced in rabbits by using streptococcus sanguis m99. thrombocytopenia was induced by intravenous administration of antiplatelet serum. compared with controls (infected rabbits given nonimmune serum), thrombocytopenic rabbits had higher densities of streptococci within vegetations (mean log10 cfu/g, 9.78 vs. 8.11, p < .002) and a higher total number of bacteria per valve (mean log10 total cfu/valve, 8.96 vs. 7.43, p < .004). when tested for its interactions with platelets in vitro, strain m99 bound, activated, and aggregated rabbit platelets extensively and was rapidly killed by platelet microbicidal protein. these results indicate that platelets can limit disease progression in endocarditis. the host defense properties of platelets may in part be mediated by platelet microbicidal protein.

AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == glucose stimulates camp accumulation in the oral bacterium actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == actinomyces viscosus t14v, a gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 u) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl camp. glucose, on the other hand, stimulated camp accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. fructose  and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on camp accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were  without effect. glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate camp accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. glucose did not stimulate camp levels  in other gram-positive bacteria including streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis and s. salivarius but did cause camp accumulation in other strains of a. viscosus. the results suggest that glucose effects on camp metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the a. viscosus bacteria. the results  also suggest that glucose stimulates camp accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.

TI  == simulated human serum profiles of one daily dose of ceftriaxone plus netilmicin in treatment of experimental streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == we performed experiments in rats aimed at determining whether a combination of ceftriaxone (cro) and netilmicin (net), by using once-daily administration in rats, which simulated profiles of drug in human serum, was more effective than either agent alone in the treatment of endocarditis caused by viridans group streptococci. a programmable infusion pump system enabled the production of profiles of cro in serum that simulate those found in humans after the intravenous administration of 2 g. the subcutaneous administration of 18 mg of net per kg of body weight produced levels in the sera of rats comparable to those after the intravenous administration of a dose of 5 mg of net per kg in humans. rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations were infected intravenously with two test strains, a cro-susceptible streptococcus sanguis strain (mics of cro and net, 0.064 and 8 mg/liter, respectively) and a relatively cro-resistant streptococcus mitis strain (mics of cro and net, 2 and 8 mg/liter, respectively). against both strains, the combination of cro and net was synergistic in vitro as  determined by time-kill curves. treatment of rats was started 48 h postinfection  and lasted for 3 days. cro alone was effective against the susceptible strain (p  < 0.001 compared with control animals) but was not effective against the resistant organism. a significantly enhanced antibacterial activity of the cro-net combination in reducing the valvular bacterial counts was observed with both test strains (p < 0.001). the synergistic effect was obtained with a single  daily injection of net which provided detectable levels in serum for only 8 h, suggesting that in vivo synergism in the treatment of infections caused by viridans group streptococci can be obtained without 24 h of aminoglycoside coverage. these experimental data might provide a rationale for clinical trials of a once-a-day dosing regimen in the treatment of streptococcal but nonenterococcal endocarditis.

TI  == characterization of allelic replacement in streptococcus parasanguis: transformation and homologous recombination in a 'nontransformable' streptococcus.
AB  == we have obtained transformants of streptococcus parasanguis fw213 containing allelic replacements in several chromosomal loci. transformation occurred following electroporation with nonreplicating plasmids carrying two antibiotic-resistance-encoding genes, one of which is inserted into dna homologous to the chromosomal target. in contrast with other streptococci, s. parasanguis fw213 is not transformed by linear dna. mutations in nonreplicating plasmid dna preferentially replaced their homologues in the s. parasanguis fw213  chromosome by a double-crossover homologous recombination event, as shown by the  fact that over 90% of transformants were sensitive to the vector-coded antibiotic marker. southern blot analysis of these transformants showed that three of the five target loci had been mutated, and that the wild-type sequence had been replaced by the mutated sequence carried on the transforming plasmid. this bias toward homologous replacement rather than integration of the entire transforming  plasmid dna simplifies site-specific mutagenesis and genetic analysis of the streptococcal chromosome.

TI  == isomalto-oligosaccharide-containing lipoteichoic acid of streptococcus sanguis. microheterogeneity and distribution of chain substituents.
AB  == the lipoteichoic acid of streptococcus sanguis dsm 20567 contains a poly(glycerophosphate) chain, with 49% of the glycerophosphate residues being substituted with d-alanine ester, 35% with alpha-d-glucopyranosyl and alpha-isomalto-oligosaccharide residues. analysis of molecular species by affinity chromatography on concanavalin a showed all chains to be substituted and alanine ester and glycosyl residues to be present on the same rather than on separate chains. molecular species varied in the length of the poly(glycerophosphate) chain, the extent of glycosylation, and had a constant alanine-ester content. an alkali-hydrolysis procedure revealed a distribution pattern between random and regular for the glycosyl substituents and suggested a  similar distribution for the alanyl residues which occupy the free positions between the glycosyl substituents.

TI  == isomalto-oligosaccharide-containing lipoteichoic acid of streptococcus sanguis. basic structure.
AB  == the lipoteichoic acid of streptococcus sanguis dsm 20567 and of dsm 20068 was isolated by phenol/water extraction and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. the preparations from both strains have an identical structure: a 1,3-linked poly(glycerophosphate) chain phosphodiester-linked to glc-(alpha 1-2)glc(alpha 1-3)acyl2gro as the lipid anchor. the chain is substituted with d-alanine ester and glycosyl residues which comprise mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl residues with (1-6) interglycosidic linkages. the glycosylglycerols were released with 48% (by mass) hydrofluoric acid, separated and characterized by a combination of chemical procedures and modern techniques of 1h-nmr and 13c-nmr spectroscopy. the alpha-isomalto-oligosaccharides add a novel motif to lipoteichoic-acid chain substituents. 1h-nmr and 13c-nmr spectroscopy also provided a detailed picture of the basic glycosylated poly(1,3-glycerophosphate) diglucosylglycerol. it proved a single unbranched chain structure, provided evidence for the chain length, the extent of glycosylation, the structure of the lipid anchor and the site of attachment of the poly(glycerophosphate) chain on the lipid anchor. owing to its unique glycosyl substituents the lipoteichoic acid may serve as a taxonomic marker for the redefined species s. sanguis (formerly s. sanguis type i).

TI  == the comparative activity of azithromycin, macrolides and amoxycillin against streptococci in experimental infections.
AB  == since serious sequelae may follow streptococcal infections, eradication is viewed as necessary for successful therapy. studies were therefore conducted to compare  the effectiveness of azithromycin with other macrolide antibiotics and amoxycillin to eliminate these organisms in experimental localized infections. in a streptococcus pneumoniae lung infection induced by transtracheal challenge, the pathogen was not recovered after therapy with azithromycin (ed50 7.9 mg/kg), while clarithromycin was not effective (ed50 > 100 mg/kg). however, in a s. pneumoniae middle ear infection, azithromycin and clarithromycin were effective (ed50 2.9 and 6.3 mg/kg, respectively) in eradicating the pathogen from this closed space infection. against a localized streptococcus pyogenes infection (implanted inoculated disc), azithromycin effectively eradicated the pathogen, while clarithromycin, roxithromycin and erythromycin did not. eradication of a viridans streptococcus or streptococcus gordonii (formerly streptococcus sanguis) from heart tissue in experimental bacterial endocarditis was also evaluated. azithromycin given prophylactically or therapeutically was efficacious in eliminating the viridans streptococcus and s. gordonii in the bacterial endocarditis model of infection; erythromycin was only marginally effective in the same studies. all studies provided evidence of the bactericidal action of azithromycin in vivo and demonstrated the ability of the compound to eradicate streptococcal pathogens in localized infections.

TI  == transmission of mutans streptococci to infants following short term application of an iodine-naf solution to mothers' dentition.
AB  == in a randomized clinical trial, six applications of an i2-naf or a placebo solution were administered to the mothers' dentition at the time of tooth emergence of her infant, to evaluate its effect on transmission of mutans streptococci (ms) to the infant. ms and other bacterial levels were periodically  monitored in 48 mother-infant pairs until the child's third birthday. there were  significant reductions in maternal salivary ms (p = 0.04), lactobacilli (p = 0.04), total streptococci (p = 0.002), and total cultivable organisms (p = 0.004) immediately following treatment. in children, 3-yr incidence of ms colonization and the time of acquisition of ms or the caries experience did not differ significantly between the two groups. we conclude that short-term application of  i2-naf to the maternal dentition of predentate infants significantly lowers ms, lactobacilli, total streptococci, and total cultivable bacteria in mothers' saliva, but does not influence the incidence and the time of acquisition of ms or the caries experience in children.

TI  == differential expression of salivary mucin bacterial aggregating activity with caries status.
AB  == 1. the low and high mol. wt mucin forms were isolated from saliva of caries-resistant (cr) and caries-susceptible (cs) individuals, and assessed for their bacterial aggregating potential towards s. mutans and s. sanguis, the common cariogenic microorganisms encountered in the oral cavity. 2. the high mol. wt mucin from both groups of subjects exhibited similar protein and carbohydrate  content, but the level of covalently bound fatty acids was significantly lower in the cr group. the mucin from cr group showed only a weak inhibitory potential, and no inhibitory activity was observed with the mucin of cs group. 3. the low mol. wt mucins from both groups, while displaying compositional similarities, showed a marked variation in the bacterial aggregating activity. with both bacteria, the activity of the mucin from cr group was at least 128-fold greater than that of cs group. 4. the conversion of the high mol. wt mucin to a low mol.  wt form through the action of salivary protease produced in both groups enhancement in mucin's bacterial aggregating capacity. this enhancement was, however, considerably less pronounced in the case of mucin from cs group. 5. the  results for the first time demonstrate that the bacterial aggregating epitope of  salivary mucins is expressed to a greater extent in cr individuals, and that this epitope is apparently more accessible to bacteria in the low mol. wt mucin form.

TI  == serum immunoglobulin g antibodies to porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus sanguis during experimental gingivitis in young adults.
AB  == twenty-eight young, healthy adults completed an experimental gingivitis study in  which blood and clinical recordings were obtained at baseline; after a 4-week period of thorough oral hygiene; after a subsequent 3-week period of plaque accumulation; and after another 2 weeks of thorough oral hygiene. serum immunoglobulin g antibodies against whole cells of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus sanguis were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. mean serum immunoglobulin g antibody levels to p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and s. sanguis remained essentially constant during the experiment, whereas the immunoglobulin g antibodies to p. gingivalis declined during the initial period of oral hygiene and the subsequent period of plaque accumulation to an average of 84.5% of the baseline value. this reduction could be attributed to the people who developed marked gingival inflammation during the period of plaque accumulation, indicating that the systemic host response may be associated with local tissue responses to  variations in oral hygiene. these people were, however, also characterized by higher initial serum immunoglobulin g responses to p. gingivalis than people who  developed less pronounced gingival inflammation during the experiment. the variability and individuality noted in the host response to potential pathogens have important implications for attempts to use such measures for establishing a  diagnosis or prognosis for the individual patient.

TI  == migration of a streptococcus sanguis strain through the root dentinal tubules.

TI  == demonstration of antigen-specific immune response against streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the genetic control of streptococcus sanguis antigen response was studied. mice sensitized with inactivated s. sanguis organisms antigen-injected at the base of  the tail developed footpad swelling. those with an i-ak,q,r region of h-2 showed  a strong footpad response, whereas those with an i-ab,d,s region showed a weak response to s. sanguis cell wall antigen. footpad response was mediated by cd4+,8- t cells by using in vitro monoclonal antibody treatment. similar evidence of genetic control was obtained with an in vitro t cell proliferation assay. however, quantitation of antibodies against s. sanguis showed that antibody production was not controlled by h-2. these results indicated that both in vivo footpad swelling and in vitro t cell proliferation responses were functions of helper (cd3+,4+,8-) t cells and controlled by the i-a region of h-2.

TI  == role of superantigens in human disease.
AB  == superantigens include bacterial products (mainly of streptococci and staphylococci) that stimulate t cells to proliferate nonspecifically through interaction with class ii major histocompatibility complex products on antigen-presenting cells and then with variable regions on the beta chain of the  t cell receptor complex. they include pyrogenic toxins (streptococcal scarlet fever toxins of serotypes a, b, and c, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1, and staphylococcal enterotoxin serotypes a, b, cn, d, e, and g), streptococcal m protein, staphylococcal exfoliative toxin, and recently identified pyrogenic toxins made by groups b, c, f, and g streptococci and streptococcus sanguis. pyrogenic toxin superantigens cause acute toxic shock syndrome and are associated with toxic shock-like syndromes. superantigens cause symptoms via release of immune cytokines. these proteins should be considered potential causes of illnesses such as rheumatic fever, arthritis, kawasaki syndrome, atopic dermatitis, and guttate psoriasis because of their potent immune system-altering  capacity.

TI  == longitudinal study of relations between human salivary antimicrobial proteins and measures of dental plaque accumulation and composition.
AB  == many studies have attempted to relate levels of antimicrobial proteins in saliva  to oral health; results have been inconsistent, and one reason might be inconsistency of measures of plaque and saliva within subjects. this study investigated associations between plaque and salivary variables in longitudinal data. whole saliva, and 8-h plaque pooled from buccal first permanent molars, was obtained from 32 dental students on tuesdays from 3:00-6:00 p.m. over 4 weeks. salivary flow rate was determined, and samples were assayed for lysozyme, lactoferrin, total peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, oscn-, siga and total protein. colonies on mitis-salivarius agar were assigned to streptococcus sanguis, strep.  mutans or strep. salivarius on the basis of morphology, supplemented by the api rapid strep identification system. consistency of values within subjects across weeks was evaluated by repeat-measures analysis of variance and intraclass correlation; data were transformed to reduce skewness. pearson's r was used to determine associations between plaque and salivary variables. significant intraclass correlations (alpha = 0.05) were found for all salivary variables except myeloperoxidase, and for total flora, total streptococci, strep. sanguis and strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci. significant pearson correlations with strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci were found for total protein (r = -0.24), siga (r = -0.22), lactoferrin (r = -0.19) and oscn- (r = 0.20) when data from all weeks were pooled (n = 128). strep. sanguis proportions tended to be low in subjects with high values for salivary proteins;  the range of proportions was wider in subjects with low salivary values. these findings suggest some consistency of weekly values for many plaque and salivary variables. they also support previous cross-sectional data which suggested that salivary antimicrobial proteins may have some effect on plaque composition. this  study was made before recent revisions in streptococcal taxonomy, and further research is needed to clarify interactions of salivary proteins with currently defined species.

TI  == nucleotide sequence analysis of the termini and chromosomal locus involved in site-specific integration of the streptococcal conjugative transposon tn5252.

TI  == mechanisms of platelet aggregation by streptococcus sanguis, a causative organism in infective endocarditis.
AB  == the ability of certain strains of streptococcus sanguis to aggregate human platelets in vitro may be related to their virulence in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. we have studied the mechanisms of aggregation of human platelets by s. sanguis strain nctc 7863. platelet aggregation follows incubation of s. sanguis cells with platelet-rich plasma from normal, healthy adults, after  a lag of 7-19 min. platelet aggregation was accompanied by 5-hydroxytryptamine release and thromboxane b2 production. aggregation was prevented by aspirin and by edta. platelets from two patients with glanzmann's thrombasthenia did not respond to bacteria. fixed, washed platelets resuspended in normal plasma were not agglutinated by s. sanguis. blocking the glycoprotein ib receptor with a monoclonal antibody inhibited aggregation of prp. however, s. sanguis did not induce von willebrand factor (vwf) binding to platelets; nor did the bacteria prevent ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination or vwf binding. the aggregation response was not related to plasma vwf activity levels in normal subjects or in patients with von willebrand's disease. the platelet response to s. sanguis therefore resembles true aggregation, requiring the cyclo-oxygenase pathway and the presence of glycoprotein iib/iiia. the mechanism also involves glycoprotein ib, but not apparently through irreversible binding of vwf.

TI  == a critical appraisal of positive cooperativity in oral streptococcal adhesion: scatchard analyses of adhesion data versus analyses of the spatial arrangement of adhering bacteria.
AB  == positive cooperativity is a mechanism proposed to account for the adhesion of bacteria to surfaces. in this paper, two methods that both claim to assess experimentally cooperative phenomena, viz. scatchard analysis of adhesion data (using adhesion to vials) and analysis of the spatial arrangement of adhering cells (using a flow chamber), were compared and critically evaluated. three oral  strains were used and the substrata involved were glass (hydrophilic) and silicone-coated glass (hydrophobic) employed with or without a salivary coating.  scatchard analysis and near-neighbour analysis of adhering cells yield similar conclusions with regard to the mechanism of adhesion of the cells, provided that  adhering cells are sufficiently immobilized under the experimental conditions. in the case of incomplete immobilization, near-neighbour collection results from sliding of adhering cells rather than from cooperative phenomena. also, the agreement between the conclusions from both methods seems to be better, the more  reversibly the cells adhere. positive cooperativity can be absent or present on saliva-coated substrata with a distinct effect of the substratum hydrophobicity,  despite the presence of an adsorbed film. this suggests that a different pellicle develops on a hydrophobic substratum than on a hydrophilic substratum. this is confirmed by our observation that the amino acid composition of salivary films is different on both types of substratum.

TI  == [treatment with vancomycin of experimental endocarditis caused by streptococcus sanguis ii resistant to penicillin].
AB  == background: streptococcus viridans continues to be the most frequent causal agent of infective endocarditis. treatment has become more complicated due to the increase in resistance to penicillin and cephalosporins. in order to study the possible efficacy of vancomycin, this antibiotic was investigated in rabbits as a monotherapy and in association with gentamicin. the effects were compared with a  control group and a group given classical penicillin-gentamicin treatment. material and methods: minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, lethality curves and synergism were determined against streptococcus sanguis ii. infective endocarditis was induced in 80 rabbits, which were infected via catheter. treatment was started 48 hours after infection, and lasted 5 days. the animals were divided into 4 groups of 20 rabbits each: 1, untreated controls; 2, penicillin-gentamicin; 3, vancomycin; 4, vancomycin-gentamicin. response to therapy was evaluated with mortality curves, negativization of blood cultures, concentration of streptococcus sanguis ii in aortic vegetations, rate of sterilization of vegetations, body weight and serum bactericidal capacity. results: vegetations weight was significantly lower in treated groups than in controls; lower weights were found in groups 2 and 4. the  lowest vegetation weight was recorded in group 4, the only treatment that sterilized 75% of vegetations. death occurred only in the control group (10%). negativization of blood cultures was greatest and most rapid in group 4. serum bactericidal capacity was greater after the two combined treatments, and highest  in group 4. conclusions: combined treatment with vancomycin-gentamicin may be highly efficacious in patients with endocarditis caused by penicillin-resistant streptococcus viridans.

AB  == proteoliposomes having surface-bound succinylated concanavalin a (s-cona) have been prepared from a range of phospholipid mixtures by sonication (suv) and reverse phase evaporation (rev) covering a range of size (weight-average diameter (dw)) from approx. 35 to 310 nm and weight-average number of protein molecules per liposomes (pw) from approx. 50 to 3000. the targeting of the proteoliposomes  to adsorbed biofilms of the bacteria streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans has been assessed from the extent of inhibition of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) for bacterial cell surface antigens. the surface-bound lectin enhances targeting relative to 'naked' liposomes of comparable concentration by factors of 2-50 depending on the liposomal lipid composition and pw. the effect of the bactericide triclosan on the thermal properties and permeability characteristics of liposomes has been studied. at and above a molar ratio of triclosan to lipid of 0.6, triclosan eliminates the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dppc) containing liposomes and increases the bilayer permeability of both liposomes and proteoliposomes to d-glucose. the proteoliposomes have been used to deliver triclosan to s. sanguis biofilms and the inhibition of growth of the bacteria after treatment with liposomally delivered triclosan has been determined using a  microtitre plate re-growth assay and compared with growth inhibition by 'free' triclosan. it is shown that for short exposure times (1 to 2 min) proteoliposomally delivered triclosan is a more effective growth inhibitor than free triclosan. the results are discussed in terms of the targeting, retention and subsequent release of triclosan into the bacterial biofilms.

TI  == formation of alpha-(1-->6), alpha-(1-->3), and alpha-(1-->2) glycosidic linkages  by dextransucrase from streptococcus sanguis in acceptor-dependent reactions.
AB  == dextransucrase from streptococcus sanguis 10558 was found to synthesize alpha-(1-->6), alpha-(1-->3), and alpha-(1-->2) linkages during an acceptor-dependent glucosyl transfer reaction. normally, new glucosyl residues are added at c-6 of monosaccharide acceptors. however, sugars blocked at c-6 also can serve as good acceptors. the disaccharide and trisaccharide products formed when methyl 6-bromo-6-deoxy-alpha-d-glucopyranoside was used as acceptor were isolated and characterized. both were found to contain only alpha-(1-->3) glycosidic bonds. this supports the hypothesis that when c-6 is blocked the acceptor binds to the enzyme in a flipped orientation, resulting in an approximate exchange in space of the c-3 and c-6, thereby putting c-3 adjacent to the active site. the second alpha-(1-->3) links in the trisaccharide are formed by a single-chain mechanism without release of the intermediate disaccharide. with maltose as acceptor, new glucosyl residues are added at c-6'. however, if that position is blocked with a bromine atom, the resulting compound, 6'-bromo-6'-deoxy-maltose, can still serve as an acceptor. the product in this case was isolated and characterized. the new glycosidic link was found to be alpha-(1-->2).

AB  == objectives: infectious crystalline keratopathy is a unique pauci-inflammatory infection of the cornea most commonly due to viridans type streptococci. we investigated the hypothesis that production of exopolysaccharide by streptococci, a property that can be induced by growth conditions, may contribute to the pathogenesis of infectious crystalline keratopathy by suppressing the ocular immune response. methods: streptococcus sanguis type ii was grown under two conditions, conventionally in brain-heart infusion broth and in 5% sucrose-supplemented brain-heart infusion broth, to promote exopolysaccharide formation. rabbit corneas were inoculated by passage of 9-0 silk sutures soaked in bacterial suspensions. results: arborizing, sharply demarcated pauci-inflammatory lesions were noted in 71% of rabbit corneas inoculated with s  sanguis type ii grown in sucrose-supplemented media and in 25% of control corneas (p = .05). suppurative lesions developed in the remaining corneas. histologic evaluation of infectious crystalline keratopathy lesions revealed characteristic  features. conclusion: increased exopolysaccharide formation by s sanguis type ii  is associated with production of infectious corneal lesions that resemble those of infectious crystalline keratopathy.

TI  == coaggregation: specific adherence among human oral plaque bacteria.
AB  == nearly all human oral bacteria exhibit coaggregation, cell-to-cell recognition of genetically distinct cell types. clumps or coaggregates composed of the two kinds of cells are formed immediately upon mixing two partner cell types. members of all 18 genera tested exhibit lactose-reversible coaggregation. many of these interactions appear to be mediated by a lectin on one cell type that interacts with a complementary carbohydrate receptor on the other cell type. a lactose-sensitive adhesin has been isolated from prevotella loescheii pk1295, and it exhibits the adherence properties observed with whole cells. other adhesins have been identified and the genes for some of them have been cloned and sequenced. one streptococcus sanguis adhesin is a lipoprotein that appears to have a dual function of recognizing both a bacterial carbohydrate receptor and a  receptor in human saliva. carbohydrate receptors for some adhesins have been purified from five oral streptococci, and they specifically block the coaggregations with the streptococcal partners that express the complementary adhesins. coaggregation offers an explanation for the temporally related accretion of dental plaque and bacterial recognition of mucosal surfaces. early colonizers of the tooth surface coaggregate with each other and late colonizers of the tooth surface coaggregate with each other, but with few exceptions, early  colonizers do not recognize late colonizers. furthermore, bacteria that colonize  mucosal surfaces coaggregate with each other, indicating the high degree of specificity of coaggregation in the oral bacterial population.

AB  == coaggregation between streptococcus gordonii pk488 and actinomyces naeslundii pk606 is mediated by a 38-kda streptococcal protein, designated scaa. the gene, scaa, which encodes this protein has been cloned into escherichia coli. a genomic s. gordonii pk488 library (in lambda zap ii) was screened with anti-s. gordonii immunoglobulin g absorbed with s. gordonii pk1804, an isogenic coaggregation-defective mutant of strain pk488. a positive recombinant phage was  isolated, and a phagemid designated pra1 was obtained which contained a 6.6-kb insert. expression of scaa from pra1 and from a subcloned internal 2.1-kb fragment was observed. the absorbed antiserum cross-reacted with a 34.7-kda protein, ssab, from s. sanguis 12, also a coaggregation partner of a. naeslundii  pk606. absorbed antiserum to s. gordonii pk488 and antiserum to ssab both reacted with 38-kda proteins in supernatants from mildly sonicated preparations from 11 other coaggregation partners of a. naeslundii pk606. putative adhesin genes were  identified in each of these coaggregation partners by southern analysis of their  genomic dna with the cloned 2.1-kb fragment as a probe. a 30-base oligonucleotide probe based on the sequence of ssab of s. sanguis 12 hybridized in an identical manner. these data extend the notion that most of the viridans streptococci that  coaggregate with actinomyces are capable of expressing scaa-related proteins.

AB  == a streptococcus parasanguis adhesin that blocks the attachment of s. parasanguis  fw213 to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (scha) has been purified. previous work demonstrated that the attachment of fw213 to scha is mediated by fimbriae and that one component associated with fimbriae is a 36-kda protein (fima) that reacts with antifimbria serum in western blots (immunoblots) and is not present in afimbriated mutants. to obtain amounts of fima sufficient for adhesion blocking assays, we cloned the gene coding for fima into an escherichia coli t7 overexpression system. the resulting strain produced large amounts of fima, as much as 50% of the total cell protein. fima was purified by elution from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, and its native conformation was reestablished by sodium dodecyl sulfate removal, resolubilization in guanidine hydrochloride, and 50-fold dilution. some refolded fima aggregated into dimers and trimers. preincubation of scha with 100 micrograms of purified, renatured fima per ml blocked 85% of the binding of fw213. the fima-scha complex was quite  stable and could be washed continuously for at least 2 h with only a slight loss  of fima blocking activity. when fima was added to preformed bacterium-scha complexes, it displaced 40% of the bacteria already bound to scha. the results suggest that fima is an adhesin with a high substrate affinity and may prove useful in the development of a therapeutic agent for the prevention of plaque formation and endocarditis initiated by the sanguis streptococci.

TI  == biosynthesis and characterization of phosphatidylglycerophosphoglycerol, a possible intermediate in lipoteichoic acid biosynthesis in streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == a membrane enzyme preparation from streptococcus sanguis was shown to convert sn-[14c]glycerol 3-phosphate and cdp-diacylglycerol (or deoxycdp-diacylglycerol)  into a series of progressively higher-molecular-weight [14c]oligophosphoglycerophospholipids in vitro. the first oligophosphoglycerophospholipid to accumulate (termed lipid-1) was purified to homogeneity; chemical analysis, gas-liquid chromatography and chemical degradation studies indicated the most likely structure to be phosphatidylglycerophosphoglycerol (pgpg). pgpg is formed directly from two molecules of phosphatidylglycerol (pg), one molecule of pg serving as a sn-glycerol 1-phosphate (pg) donor and the second serving as the pg acceptor, with co-production of diacylglycerol. these oligophosphoglycerophospholipids may  be intermediates in the biosynthesis of lipoteichoic acids.

TI  == an analysis of the subgingival microflora in randomly selected subjects.
AB  == the aim of this study was to describe the presence of some microbial species in the subgingival microflora of a randomly selected subject sample. a further objective was to analyze the association between some microbiological characteristics and the periodontal conditions of the subjects. a total of 171 individuals aged 30-65 years were included. a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the mesial aspect of the 6 ramfjord teeth by the use of the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analyzed according to standardized procedures. the periodontal condition of the subjects was examined clinically and included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and probing attachment level. the results showed that 81% of the subjects were positive for campylobacter rectus, 80% for fusobacterium nucleatum, 77% for streptococcus sanguis, 72% for streptococcus mitis, 66% for eikenella corrodens,  58% for prevotella intermedia, 32% for capnocytophaga, 27% for selenomonas, 25% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 14% for porphyromonas gingivalis and 13% for streptococcus mutans. small differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between subjects harboring p. gingivalis, a. actinomytecomitans or  > 5% p. intermedia and the rest of the sample. similarly small differences in the clinical parameters were revealed when the subjects were grouped according to proportions of disease-associated and health-associated species in their subgingival samples.

TI  == dental plaque development on defined streptococcal surfaces.
AB  == coaggregations between bacterial species have been widely studied in vitro but not in the mouth. a new in vivo assay was used to measure the rate and composition of indigenous plaque formation onto bovine enamel chips covered with  a continuous layer of bacteria. chips were covered with streptococcus oralis atcc 10557, which coaggregated with many oral species, or streptococcus gordonii s7, which did not coaggregate with these oral species, and placed in the mouth for 4  and 24 h. there were no differences in the number of most indigenous bacterial species isolated from the two streptococcal surfaces. however, the number of actinomyces viscosus as a proportion of total actinomyces spp. was significantly  different on the two surfaces at 24 h. with the exception of actinomyces naeslundii and a. viscosus removed from the s7 surface, all indigenous species increased significantly in number from 4 to 24 h, irrespective of the streptococcal surface. this study demonstrated that interbacterial coaggregation  had only a limited effect on in vivo plaque development. thus suggesting that environmental factors, growth or other adherence phenomena are dominant in in vivo plaque formation.

TI  == oral streptococcal colonization of infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and proportions of different streptococcal species among the streptococcal flora during infancy. a total of 60 oral samples were collected by oral swabbing of the buccal mucosa and alveolar ridges of 18 infants before tooth eruption and from buccal and lingual surfaces of teeth after tooth eruption. a total of 549 isolates on mitis salivarius agar were speciated, principally by recently revised biochemical criteria of kilian et al. streptococcus mitis biovar 1 predominated, both in prevalence (89%) and proportion of oral streptococci recovered in each sample (median = 87% of streptococcal flora). streptococcus salivarius was also prevalent (94%) but generally represented a small percentage of the total streptococcal flora (median = 3%). streptococcus oralis and streptococcus anginosus strains were detected in approximately one third of predentate and dentate infants in the first year of life. streptococcus sanguis strains were not detected before tooth eruption, but could be detected in 7/14 of the infants with teeth. thus, s. mitis constitutes the major component of the initially colonizing streptococcal microbiota of the young infant.

TI  == synergistic activity of ceftriaxone combined with netilmicin administered once daily for treatment of experimental streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == we have conducted experiments to determine if one daily injection of netilmicin (net) would be synergistic with the broad-spectrum cephalosporin ceftriaxone (cro) in the treatment of experimentally induced endocarditis. rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations were infected intravenously with 3 x 10(7) cfu of a beta-lactam-sensitive strain of streptococcus sanguis or a beta-lactam-resistant strain of streptococcus mitis. treatment with the antibiotics alone (cro, 10 mg/kg of body weight every 8 h; net, 18 mg/kg every 24 h) or in combinations which had proved synergistic in in vitro time-kill curves was commenced 48 h postinfection and continued for 72 h. the results show that the combination was markedly effective against s. sanguis and moderately effective against s. mitis, while, with the protocol used here, the agents alone  were not. the results suggest that cro-net should be an effective combination for treating streptococcal endocarditis in humans and may permit a shorter duration of treatment and once-a-day dosing to be used.

TI  == the streptococcus sanguis platelet aggregation-associated protein. identification and characterization of the minimal platelet-interactive domain.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis expresses a cell wall-bound protein that induces the activation and aggregation of platelets. this platelet aggregation-associated protein (paap) contains a collagen-like, platelet-interactive domain within a 23-kda protein fragment. to isolate the minimal platelet-interactive domain, p23  paap was digested with collagenase, and the digest chromatographed to isolate fractions with activity inhibitory to s. sanguis-induced platelet aggregation. the active fraction was then digested with cyanogen bromide, the product chromatographed, and a smaller inhibitory peptide isolated. finally, this fraction was digested with endoproteinase lys-c, and the digest fractionated. after each step, inhibitory activity resolved into single chromatographic peaks of 13 kda (p13 paap), 2.7 kda (p2.7 paap), and a minimal 7-mer peptide, respectively. these paap fragments showed similar id50 (19-28 nm), suggesting that each contained a single copy of the platelet-interactive domain. the minimal 7-mer peptide was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. the primary structure was determined to be pro-gly-glu-gln-gly-pro-lys. this sequence conforms to the predicted structural motif of the platelet-interactive domains of types i and iii collagen. this 7-mer peptide is therefore the platelet-interactive domain of the paap from s. sanguis. its structure explains the molecular basis for immunological cross-reactivity and functional similarity to the platelet-interactive domains of collagens.

TI  == the dental status and attitudes of patients at risk from infective endocarditis.
AB  == infective endocarditis represents one of the few potentially fatal infections that may be caused in the patient by a dentist. efforts to reduce the incidence of this disease usually take the form of appropriate antibiotic cover prior to dental treatment, together with the establishment and maintenance of good oral health. this paper is a report of a survey on the dental health and awareness of  81 'at-risk' patients attending a cardiology outpatient clinic. it was found that whilst the patients were apparently well motivated and well informed, a high prevalence of periodontal disease existed in the group. it is concluded that when patients are diagnosed with a cardiac disorder which predisposes to infective endocarditis they should have a dental examination as soon as possible, preferably by a dentist experienced in the treatment of patients with special needs.

TI  == ph changes in human dental plaque from lactose and milk before and after adaptation.
AB  == ph changes in human dental plaque in vivo from lactose and milk have been studied in four separate mouthrinse experiments. (1) ph was measured in plaque samples of 12 subjects before and after 6 weeks of frequent daily mouthrinsing with 10% lactose. the ph decreases were significantly more pronounced after the adaptation period than before (p < 0.001), 4 of the 12 subjects showing about the same low plaque ph from lactose as from glucose. (2) similar to the previous experiment, frequent daily mouthrinsing with low-fat bovine milk in 10 subjects resulted in more pronounced ph decreases in plaque after an adaptation period of 4 weeks (p < 0.001). (3) single mouthrinses, without any prior adaptation, with bovine standard milk, human breast milk, lactose-hydrolysed bovine standard milk, 5% lactose and 5% sucrose were compared regarding the effect on plaque ph in 7 subjects. all solutions resulted in ph falls. the most pronounced were found with sucrose, followed by the lactose-hydrolysed milk. (4) bovine standard milk, 5% lactose and 10% sucrose were compared after a single mouthrinse in 5 subjects using interdental plaque ph wire telemetry. lactose and milk were fermented more  slowly than sucrose. in a separate study, acid production from lactose was also measured in two oral strains each of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguis. the results from these experiments indicated that at least part of the lactose transport and catabolism in all studied streptococcus strains seems to be regulated by inducible enzymes.

TI  == mixed continuous cultures of streptococcus mutans with streptococcus sanguis or with streptococcus oralis as a model to study the ecological effects of the lactoperoxidase system.
AB  == mixed continuous cultures of streptococcus species were obtained, using complex carbohydrate (mucin) as a source of nutrients, to study the ecological effects of oxygen and the lactoperoxidase system. s. mutans nctc 10449 was unable to grow as a pure culture on mucin, but attained a significant population size in the presence of s. oralis and s. sanguis strains. the cell densities of the anaerobic mixed cultures decreased when oxygen was supplied, and s. mutans was more suppressed by oxygen than were s. sanguis and s. oralis. however, the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (30 mumol/l in the mixed culture of s. mutans with s. sanguis and 640 mumol/l in the culture with s. oralis) indicated a certain resistance of the organisms to hydrogen peroxide. addition of lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate to the oxygen-supplied cultures had a differential effect on the streptococcal populations. while s. mutans was inhibited, and even disappeared in the culture with s. oralis, the growth of s. sanguis and s. oralis was unaffected. this latter observation was in accordance with the oscn- reductase activities of these organisms. when hydrogen peroxide was also added together with lactoperoxidase and thiocyanate, a further inhibition of s. mutans in the culture with s. sanguis was observed. under these  conditions, s. oralis was also inhibited, perhaps by the strong accumulation of oscn-, exceeding the capacity of the oscn- reductase. the effects of lactoperoxidase on mixed cultures may reflect the situation in the mouth.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == interfering alpha-streptococci as a protection against recurrent streptococcal tonsillitis in children.
AB  == recurrent streptococcal tonsillitis/pharyngitis is a great problem, especially in certain epidemiological situations. patients treated with antibiotics often have  a disturbed normal throat flora and may lack, e.g., alpha-streptococci known in vitro to have an interfering activity against group a streptococci. thirty-one patients with recurrent streptococcal tonsillitis were given antibiotics for 10 days. at the end of this treatment they were sprayed in their mouths with four selected alpha-streptococcal strains known to have strong growth inhibiting activity in vitro against most beta-streptococci group a. the follow-up period after this colonization was 3 months. after alpha-streptococcal treatment, none of the patients attracted a new tonsillitis during the follow-up period while 8%  of the controls had a second tonsillitis. treatment of streptococcal tonsillitis/pharyngitis with antibiotics followed by recolonization with alpha-streptococci seems to hinder further recurrences.

TI  == a quantitative study of calcium binding and aggregation in selected oral bacteria.

AB  == the isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. the effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups:  (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. mutans, and s. gordonii. the mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (cfu) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. streptococci  were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal cfu and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. there was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. in contrast to studies using older classifications, s. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). s. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. s. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. s. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == involvement of alpha 2-adrenoreceptors and g proteins in the modulation of platelet secretion in response to streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == in the presence of plasma, human platelets secrete the contents of their dense granules and then aggregate in response to certain strains of streptococcus sanguis. after 2 to 5 min of incubation with streptococci, platelets from fast-responding donors will begin to aggregate. slow responders aggregate after a longer delay. platelets may secrete after a short (fast responder) or long (slow  responder) delay because of differences in the basal levels or responses to potentiating catecholamines. to test this hypothesis in vitro, endogenous basal catecholamine levels in platelets and plasma from fast and slow responders were analyzed by hplc with electrochemical detection. the total basal concentration of epinephrine in platelets plus plasma was fourfold higher in fast responders, with the platelet compartment showing the greatest difference. the basal affinity of alpha 2-adrenoreceptors in platelets from both groups was similar when estimated  using a specific antagonist, [3h]-yohimbine. platelets from all donors showed decreased alpha 2-adrenoreceptor affinity in the presence of low (2 nm), but not  higher (10 nm), concentrations of added epinephrine. platelets in the two groups  were then compared for secretion of atp. more atp was secreted after a shorter delay from fast responding platelets, which was mimicked in slow responders by adding physiologically attainable levels (40 nm) of epinephrine. addition of the  alpha 2-antagonist, phentolamine (10 microm), to the platelets of slow and fast responders completely inhibited or reduced secretion by one third, respectively.  therefore, alpha 2-adrenoreceptors modulate the secretory response of platelets to cells of s. sanguis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

AB  == we report a rare case of isolated tricuspid valve endocarditis. a 46-year-old man who was non-addicted, non-alcoholic and had no underlying cardiac disease was admitted to our hospital for persistent pyrexia. appropriate intravenous antibiotics therapy was unable to control the repeated infection and destruction  of his tricuspid valve progressed. the patient was referred to our surgical division where on intraoperative inspection, tricuspid valve endocarditis was found to involve the entire anterior leaflet and part of the posterior leaflet. following complete debridement of the infectious lesion, tricuspid valvuloplasty  was not considered to be possible. so we performed tricuspid valve replacement using a mechanical valve (carbomedics 27 mm). his postoperative course was uneventful and he had no ventricular arrhythmia. after prophylactic antibiotic administration for 3 weeks, he was afebrile for 2 weeks without any medication. thereafter he was discharged and has been free from any complications for over 1  year.

TI  == physico-chemical and structural properties of the surfaces of peptostreptococcus  micros and streptococcus mitis as compared to those of mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the surface properties of nine streptococcus mitis and four peptostreptococcus micros strains from the oral cavity were examined and compared with a large group of oral streptococci. zeta potential and contact angle measurements were employed to determine physico-chemical cell surface properties. in addition, elemental surface concentration ratios were obtained via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,  and surface structures were examined with transmission electron microscopy. the s. mitis and p. micros strains were found to have higher isoelectric points, higher hydrophobicities and higher n/c surface concentration ratios than some other oral streptococci. the combined data suggest that both species possess large amounts of surface protein. all the s. mitis strains displayed abundant surface fibrils in negative staining, but the p. micros strains were devoid of surface appendages indicating that surface protein is present in different forms  in the two species. the surfaces of s. mitis and p. micros type strains differed  significantly from the other strains examined.

TI  == effects of food preservatives on growth and metabolism of plaque bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to assess the consumption of food preservatives during the last decades, and to study the effect of the preservatives, sorbic and benzoic acid, on growth and glycolysis of oral bacteria in vitro, and on acid formation by dental plaque in vivo. five consumption reports from the central bureau of statistics of norway were used to estimate alterations in consumption of staple food containing the two preservatives. a modified broth dilution method was used to determine the mic values of the preservatives against streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus sanguis. extracellular 14c-glycolytic metabolites were studied by hplc analyses. plaque-ph measurements were used to assess possible effects on acid production. the consumption reports indicated increased consumption of preservatives. the in vitro testing suggested that legal concentrations of preservatives may inhibit the growth of oral streptococci. however, the preservatives did not inhibit in vitro glycolysis at tested concentrations. in vivo testing with similar concentrations (0.4% w/v) showed a significant effect. a higher concentration (2% w/v potassium sorbate) had a tendency to inhibit acid-formation by dental plaque  even more.

TI  == profiling of propionibacterium acnes recovered from root canal and blood during and after endodontic treatment.
AB  == this report describes the first results of an ongoing study of bacteremia after endodontic treatment of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. after access cavity preparation, microbiological samples were taken from the root canal under aseptic conditions in 4 single-rooted teeth in 4 patients. in treatment of  2 of the patients, the first 3 reamers (sizes 15-25) were deliberately used to a  level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. in 2 patients the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. blood samples were taken  from the patients during the endodontic instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. using lysis-filtration under anaerobic conditions, the blood was passed through a cellulose membrane filter. the filters as well as the  root canal samples were incubated using an anaerobic technique. anaerobic bacteria were isolated from all root canals. in the 2 patients where overinstrumentation had occurred, propionibacterium acnes was recovered both from the root canals and from the blood samples taken during and after the treatment had been completed. biochemical profiles, antibiotic susceptibility tests and electrophoresis of soluble proteins revealed that propionibacterium acnes isolated from the root canal and blood samples were identical within patients, but varied between patients. facultative anaerobic bacteria including streptococcus sanguis were recovered from only one root canal sample and not from the blood samples.

TI  == serum antibody responses to streptococcus mutans antigens in humans systemically  infected with oral streptococci.
AB  == sera from patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis (sbe) due to streptococcus mutans or other oral streptococci and from normal subjects were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to defined s. mutans  antigens. antibodies of igg and iga isotypes to ag i/ii and ag iii were greatly elevated in s. mutans-sbe sera, and the iga antibodies in 3 sera included both polymeric and monomeric forms. elevated igm and igg anti-lipoteichoic acid and igg and iga anti-serotype c polysaccharide antibodies were also found. the sera of 4 of 6 patients infected with other oral streptococci also displayed antibodies to s. mutans ag i/ii. sera of 3 patients infected with streptococcus mitis or streptococcus oralis, but none of the s. mutans-infected cases, showed elevated antibodies to human heart sarcolemma, and all sbe sera had elevated rheumatoid factor. these results suggest that the known surface protein antigens  of s. mutans are immunodominant in humans, and are not likely to be heart cross-reactive.

TI  == expression of salivary mucin bacterial aggregating activity: difference with caries.
AB  == the low and high molecular weight mucin forms were isolated from saliva of individuals with different caries status and assessed for their bacterial aggregating potential towards s. mutans and s. sanguis. the high molecular weight mucin from both groups exhibited similar protein and carbohydrate content, but the level of covalently bound fatty acids was lower in the caries-resistant group. the mucin from caries-resistant group showed only a weak inhibitory potential, while no inhibitory activity was observed with the mucin of caries-susceptible group. the low molecular weight mucins from both groups, while displaying compositional similarities, showed a marked variation in the bacterial aggregating activity, and the titer of the mucin from caries-resistant group was  at least 128-fold greater than that of caries-susceptible group. the results demonstrate that the bacterial aggregating epitope of salivary mucins is expressed to a greater extent in caries-resistant individuals, and that this epitope is apparently more accessible to bacteria in the low molecular weight mucin form.

TI  == development and characterization of porphyromonas gingivalis-specific rat t-cell  clones.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as a major pathogen in periodontitis. to determine the role of t cells in the regulation of this disease, a method was developed for the generation and characterization of rat t-cell clones with antigen specificity to p. gingivalis whole cells. the clones studied so far demonstrated a t-helper (th) phenotype w3/13+, w3/25+, ox8- and ox22-. these t-cell clones proliferated in vitro in response to p. gingivalis, but not to other bacteria (prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, wolinella recta, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sanguis). limiting dilution analysis showed w3/25+, ox8- t cells preferentially respond to p. gingivalis, rather than w3/25-, ox8+ t cells. p. gingivalis-reactive w3/25+ t cells belonged to the ox22- population, suggesting that the ox22- t cells may represent memory cells. all clones tested produced interferon gamma, but not interleukin 2. the cloned t-cell f1 significantly enhanced p. gingivalis-specific antibody production (p < 0.03). the availability  of these cloned t cells should bring new insight into the mechanism by which t cells regulate oral health and periodontal disease.

TI  == complete structure of the adhesin receptor polysaccharide of streptococcus oralis atcc 55229 (streptococcus sanguis h1).
AB  == this report describes the determination of the complete primary structure of the  adhesin receptor polysaccharide of streptococcus oralis atcc 55229 (previously characterized as streptococcus sanguis h1), a gram-positive bacteria implicated in dental plaque formation. the polysaccharide was isolated from s. oralis atcc 55229 cells after deproteination, enzymatic hydrolysis, and ion exchange chromatography. it was shown to consist of rhamnose, galactose, glucose, glycerol, and phosphate, in molar ratios of 2:3:1:1:1. sequence and linkage assignments of the glycosyl residues were obtained by methylation analysis followed by gas-liquid chromatography and electron-impact mass spectrometry. 31p  nmr spectroscopy revealed that phosphate was present in a diester, connecting glycerol to one of the galactosyl residues. high-performance liquid chromatography of a partial acid hydrolysate of the polysaccharide confirmed this finding by showing galactose 6-phosphate and glycerol 1-phosphate. the structural determination was completed by the combination of two-dimensional homonuclear hartmann-hahn and noe experiments and heteronuclear [1h,13c] and [1h,31p] multiple-quantum coherence experiments. thus, the adhesin receptor polysaccharide of s. oralis atcc 55229 was found to be a polymer composed of hexasaccharide repeating units that contain glycerol linked through a phosphodiester to c6 of the alpha-galactopyranosyl residue and are joined end-to-end through galactofuranosyl-beta(1-->3)-rhamnopyranosyl linkages: [formula: see text] this structure is novel among bacterial cell surface polysaccharides in general and specifically among those implicated in dental plaque formation.

AB  == in this in vitro study, a model system was developed and tested to evaluate the sealing ability of temporary restorative materials used in endodontic access preparations. the materials studied, cavit, irm, and term, were tested on 40 premolars against a known bacterial species, streptococcus sanguis. the leakage of bacterial cells was checked 4 and 8 days after initial immersion in the culture. thermocycling was introduced on the fourth day. after 8 days the cement  thicknesses were measured after the teeth had been longitudinally sectioned. before and after thermocycling, irm was less leakproof than cavit (p < 0.05) and  term (p < 0.05). thermocycling aggravated percolation in the case of irm, and decreased the tightness of cavit, whereas term remained leakproof. the thicknesses were as follows: cavit, 3.73 mm; irm, 3.45 mm; and term, 5.49 mm. there was no statistically significant relationship between thickness and tightness.

TI  == the platelet interactivity phenotype of streptococcus sanguis influences the course of experimental endocarditis.
AB  == a strain of streptococcus sanguis that induced rabbit platelets to aggregate in vitro (agg+ phenotype) was hypothesized to be a more virulent pathogen than an agg- strain in experimental endocarditis in rabbits. a left ventricular catheter  was implanted, and then an agg+ or agg- strain was inoculated intravenously. vegetations formed on the aortic semilunar valves but were unaffected by the duration of implantation of the catheter. vegetations enlarged by accumulating platelets and their mass increased directly with the duration of endocarditis. inoculation of the agg+ strain consistently caused endocarditis with significantly larger vegetations, a more severe clinical course (including febrile episodes, hematological changes, and signs of myocardial ischemia), more  gross lesions in major organs, and greater mortality than inoculation with the agg- strain, saline, or the agg+ strain pretreated with monospecific rabbit immunoglobulin g or fab fragments against its platelet aggregation-associated protein (paap; class ii). in experimental endocarditis, paap expressed by agg+ s. sanguis appeared to be an important virulence factor.

TI  == characterization of the streptococcus mutans gs-5 frua gene encoding exo-beta-d-fructosidase.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence (5,010 bp) of the fructanase gene (frua) and flanking regions of the chromosome of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was determined. the frua gene appears to be the sole transcript arising from a proximal promoter. the presumed precursor of the secreted frua protein consists of 1,423 amino acids, and it has an m(r) of 158,656 and a pi of 4.82. the n terminus of frua has characteristics in common with signal peptides of gram-positive organisms. the c  terminus consists of a serine- and threonine-rich region, followed by the peptide lpdtgd, 4 charged amino acids, 21 amino acids with a strongly hydrophobic character, and a charged pentapeptide tail, which are proposed to correspond to the wall-spanning region, the lpxtgx consensus sequence, and the membrane-spanning domains of surface-associated proteins of gram-positive cocci.  the frua protein has significant homology with the bacillus subtilis levanase (sacc), the bacteroides fragilis levanase (scrl), yeast invertases, and a number  of other beta-fructosidases but not with fructosyltransferase, glucosyltransferases, or glucan-binding proteins of oral streptococci. genes with homology to frua were detected in s. mutans serotype c, e, and f strains, streptococcus rattus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguis. a deletion derivative of frua lacking the c-terminal 437 amino acids was still functional and could hydrolyze beta-(2,6)- and beta-(2,1)-linked sugars, but with altered preference for substrates. the data begin to define functional domains of the frua protein and potential regulatory sites for induction, repression, growth rate control, and posttranslational localization of this multifunctional enzyme.

AB  == an aminopeptidase isolated from the cytoplasmic fraction of a cell extract of streptococcus mitis atcc 903 was purified 330-fold by ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. the partially  purified enzyme had a broad substrate specificity. twelve aminoacyl-beta-naphthylamide substrates were hydrolyzed and also several di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentapeptides and bradykinin. the enzyme hydrolyzed arginine-beta-naphthylamide at the highest rate. optimal conditions for activity  were at ph 7.0-7.2 and at 37-40 degrees c. the molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 93,000. the enzyme was activated by co2+ ions. hg2+ inhibited the activity completely. sds, edta, urea, and pcmb also inhibited activity. inhibition by edta could be completely reversed by dialysis and addition of co2+  ions. reducing agents, sodium fluoride, and pmsf had no effect on the activity of the enzyme. the isoelectric point of the enzyme was at ph 4.3. high substrate concentrations inhibited activity. substrate inhibition increased in the presence of high concentrations of co2+ ions.

TI  == periodontal bone loss in porphyromonas gingivalis-infected specific pathogen-free rats after preinoculation with endogenous streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == anaerobic gram-negative bacteria dominate in periodontitis locations, while gram-positive bacteria characterize healthy sites. a well-established gram-positive flora might therefore inhibit the colonization of gram-negative pathogens. the purpose of the present investigation was to examine whether endogenous s. sanguis could prevent, or reduce, periodontal bone loss in rats infected with a virulent p. gingivalis strain. sixty specific pathogen-free wistar rats were divided into 6 groups. doxycycline was administered in the drinking water for 2 weeks to the groups a, b, c, and d to suppress the preexisting microflora in the mouth. rats in groups a and c were subsequently inoculated with an s. sanguis strain, isolated from one of the rats, once a day for 5 d. infection with p. gingivalis 381 was then carried out for 5 d in groups  a, b, and e. group f was not treated with doxycycline nor infected with bacteria  and served as untreated control. six weeks after the p. gingivalis inoculation, the rats were killed. periodontal bone levels were assessed radiographically and  morphometrically, and serum antibody against p. gingivalis 381 was determined by  a fluorescence immunoassay. periodontal bone support, determined radiographically, was reduced in group b (doxycycline-treated, p. gingivalis-inoculated) compared with the other groups. in contrast, the morphometric determination showed no differences between the groups. in group b antibody levels against two different p. gingivalis 381 cell surface antigens were significantly elevated.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of (1) twelve 0.4 per cent stannous fluoride (snf2) commercial products and (2) different concentrations of snf2 (range = 0.02 to 3.28 per cent). the antibacterial inhibitory effect of various snf2 gels was evaluated as to their effectiveness against oral plaque bacteria including strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, a. viscosus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. intermedius.  when twelve different commercial preparations of 0.4 per cent snf2 were compared  for inhibitory effect on plaque bacteria, several of the snf2 preparations were significantly more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria (p < 0.05). with increasing concentration of snf2, there was a comparable increase in the inhibitory effect on the oral bacteria tested (r2 ranged from 0.867 to 0.996). snf2 at a concentration of 0.4 per cent had a similar antibacterial effect to 0.12 per cent chlorhexidine. this in vitro study demonstrated that certain snf2 products are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in plaque, and this inhibitory effect is directly related to the concentration of the snf2.

TI  == efficacy of preprocedural rinsing with an antiseptic in reducing viable bacteria  in dental aerosols.
AB  == this double-blind, controlled, cross-over, clinical study evaluated the effect of preprocedural rinsing with an antiseptic mouthrinse on the level of recoverable viable bacteria in an aerosol generated during a typical dental procedure. eighteen subjects participated. following 24 hours of abstention from all oral hygiene procedures, subjects received a 10-minute ultrasonic scaling of a randomly selected one-half of their mouth which served as the unrinsed control. they were then randomly assigned either antiseptic mouthwash or a control rinse and rinsed with 20 ml for 30 seconds, after which the remaining half mouth (experimental side) was scaled ultrasonically for 10 minutes. during each 10-minute scaling period aerosolized bacteria were collected on a sterile filter  using a modified vacuum air-sampling device. microbes captured on the sterile filter were quantitated by overlaying the filters onto trypticase soy agar, incubating the filters aerobically at 37 degrees c for 24 to 72 hours, and counting the resulting colony forming units (cfu). preliminary experiments had confirmed that neither the collection method nor residual antiseptic mouthwash in the aerosol adversely affected the number of viable bacteria recovered from the filter. rinsing with the antiseptic mouthwash produced a 94.1% reduction in recoverable cfus compared to the non-rinsed control, while the control rinse produced a 33.9% reduction. the difference between the mouthwash and control was  statistically significant (p < .001). this study indicates that preprocedural rinsing with an antiseptic mouthwash can significantly reduce the microbial content of aerosols generated during ultrasonic scaling and may have potential in-office use as part of an infection control regimen.

TI  == macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

TI  == the influence of morphological variation on candida albicans adhesion to denture  acrylic in vitro.
AB  == using denture acrylic pieces coated with either whole human stimulated saliva or  oral streptococci, the binding ability of three different candida albicans strains was investigated. the c. albicans strains include a clinical isolate with the commonly observed, smooth, round colonial morphology (strain 613p), a morphological variant spontaneously derived from the clinical isolate strain 613p (strain 613m1bk) and a clinical isolate from an oral lesion that was also a morphological variant upon primary isolation (strain 228). levels of adhesion to  the acrylic pieces were determined radiometrically using c. albicans cells metabolically labelled with [35s]-methionine. whole stimulated saliva significantly increased the binding of all strains compared to uncoated acrylic.  however, the level of binding of strain 613p to saliva-coated acrylic was significantly greater than the levels observed for the morphological variant strain 613m1bk. coating acrylic pieces with either streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904, strep. mutans gs-5 or strep. sobrinus atcc 27352 instead of saliva resulted in significantly greater binding by strain 613p compared to uncoated acrylic. pre-coating the acrylic with the oral streptococci did not significantly increase the binding of morphological variant strains 613m1bk and 228 compared to uncoated acrylic. in general, preincubation of adherent streptococci with sucrose to induce the synthesis of extracellular carbohydrate polymers did not significantly increase the binding levels of the c. albicans strains above those  observed using streptococci in buffer alone. compared to its parental strain 613p, morphological variant strain 613m1bk adhered poorly to denture acrylic coated with either salivary constituents or oral streptococci, while strain 228 adhered to the same substrates at an intermediate level. furthermore, physical disaggregation of clusters of the morphological variant strain 613m1bk did not appear to increase its binding capacity to saliva-coated denture acrylic. the effect of whole stimulated saliva on the adherence of c. albicans 613p to a variety of plastic substrates in addition to denture acrylic was examined. overall, saliva pre-coating of the various plastics promoted c. albicans 613p adhesion. the adhesion of strain 613p to denture acrylic coated with whole stimulated saliva from each of five different donors or with parotid and submandibular/sublingual saliva from each of two donors was also examined. regardless of donor, a coating of whole stimulated saliva significantly increased the binding of strain 613p to denture acrylic compared to uncoated acrylic. in addition, a coating of parotid saliva significantly increased the binding of strain 613p to denture acrylic compared to submandibular/sublingual saliva.

AB  == twenty-seven compounds were screened for their ability to sensitize streptococcus sanguis to killing by light from a 7.3-mw helium/neon (hene) laser. bacteria were mixed with various concentrations of the test compounds, spread over the surfaces of agar plates, and then exposed to light from the hene laser for various time periods. the plates were then incubated and examined for zones of inhibition. those compounds found to be effective photosensitizers were then tested against porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. toluidine blue o, azure b chloride, and methylene blue at concentrations of 0.005% (wt/vol) were effective photosensitizers of all four species, enabling killing of bacteria following exposure to laser light for only  30 s.

TI  == characterization of the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to oral streptococci.
AB  == adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis deposited on nitrocellulose paper was investigated. a variety of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of p. gingivalis bound to both s. sanguis and s. mitis. binding of p. gingivalis to all but one of the streptococci was not inhibited by salivary molecules. pretreatment of p. gingivalis with periodate and pretreatment of s. sanguis and s. mitis with pronase decreased binding, suggesting that adherence may be mediated by a protein on the streptococci interacting with a carbohydrate on p. gingivalis. binding was not inhibited by a selection of simple sugars. the ability to adhere to early plaque  bacteria such as s. sanguis and s. mitis may be important in the colonization of  the mouth by p. gingivalis.

TI  == streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in patients with cancer.
AB  == eighty-two episodes of bacteremia due to streptococci (including the genus enterococcus) in 78 patients hospitalized at institut jules bordet between 1986 and 1988 were reviewed. the incidence ranged from 5.5 to 7.6 per 1,000 admissions (16% of all bacteremias). enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis were the most prevalent isolates, followed by streptococcus angionosus, streptococcus salivarius, and large colony-forming beta-hemolytic species (a, b, c, and g). twenty-one episodes were polymicrobial. one-half of the patients had solid tumors, and one-half had hematologic malignancies. forty-two patients were neutropenic (less than 1,000 polymorphonuclear neutrophils/microl). only 15 episodes were acquired outside the hospital, and 11 episodes were breakthrough bacteremias. twenty patients died within 1 month of the onset of streptococcal bacteremia. five patients, two of whom were neutropenic, had fatal  adult respiratory distress syndrome. the source of bacteremia remained undetermined in 35.4% of the episodes; the oral mucous membrane and the gastrointestinal tract were the most frequently recognized associated sites of infection. no unexpected antimicrobial resistance was observed except in two penicillin-resistant strains, one s. mitis and one e. faecium. no relation between peak or trough serum bactericidal titers and outcome could be demonstrated.

TI  == comparative acid tolerances and inhibitor sensitivities of isolated f-atpases of  oral lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == ph activity profiles and inhibitor sensitivities were compared for membrane atpases isolated from three oral lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, streptococcus mutans gs-5, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904, with, respectively, high, moderate, and low levels of acid tolerance. membranes containing f1f0 atpases were isolated by means of salt lysis of cells treated with muralytic enzymes. membrane-free f1f0 complexes were then isolated from membranes by detergent extraction with triton x-100 or octylglucoside. finally, f1 complexes free of the proton-conducting f0 sector were obtained by washing membranes with buffers of low ionic strength. the ph activity profiles of the membrane-associated enzymes reflected the general acid tolerances of the organisms from which they were isolated; for example, ph optima were approximately 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0, respectively, for enzymes from l. casei, s. mutans, and s. sanguis. roughly similar profiles were found for membrane-free f1f0 complexes, which were stabilized by phospholipids against loss of activity during storage. however, profiles for f1 enzymes were distinctly narrower, indicating that association with f0 and possibly other membrane components enhanced tolerance to both acid and alkaline media. all of the enzymes were found to have similar sensitivities to al-f complexes, but only f1f0 enzymes were highly sensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. the procedures described for isolation of membrane-free f1f0 forms of the enzymes from oral lactic acid bacteria will be of use in future studies of the characteristics of the enzymes,  especially in studies with liposomes.

AB  == aims: to compare the performance of the sentinel blood culture system with two other systems for the recovery of streptococci and anaerobes. methods: blood cultures were taken from 55 patients one to two minutes after dental extraction.  the samples were tested by the radiometric bactec 460; the isolator 10, which works by lysis centrifugation; and sentinel, a fully automated system, which detects bacterial growth by changes in the voltage between two electrodes in the  media. positive samples were subcultured and streptococci and anaerobes were further identified. terminal subcultures were performed on all negative samples.  results: sentinel was comparable with bactec, with sentinel recovering 20 streptococci and 14 anaerobes; bactec isolated 26 streptococci and 15 anaerobes.  the recovery of streptococcus sanguis was significantly better from bactec than sentinel. the isolator 10 recovered significantly fewer streptococci and anaerobes than either bactec or sentinel. sentinel was noticeably quicker in detecting anaerobes than bactec 460. however, there was no comparable difference  with streptococci. contaminants were recovered from 10% of isolator 10, 2.7% of bactec, and 7.2% of sentinel bottles. conclusions: sentinel and bactec 460 were broadly comparable in the detection of viridans streptococci and oral anaerobes,  and both systems were significantly better than the isolator 10. however, the prototype sentinel, was significantly poorer than bactec for the recovery of s sanguis.

TI  == identification of a gene, rgg, which regulates expression of glucosyltransferase  and influences the spp phenotype of streptococcus gordonii challis.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii challis was previously shown to give rise to phase variants expressing high (spp+) or low (spp-) levels of extracellular glucosyltransferase (gtf) activity. here, shotgun cloning of an s. gordonii spp+  chromosomal digest resulted in a chimeric plasmid (pam5010) able to complement the spp- phenotype. in addition, introduction of pam5010 into an spp+ strain resulted in a 10-fold increase in gtf expression. deletion analysis of pam5010 identified a 1.2-kb dna segment which exhibited the same functional properties as pam5010. nucleotide sequence analysis of this region revealed a gene approximately 1 kb in size. the gene was designated rgg. disruption of the chromosomal rgg gene open reading frame in an spp+ strain resulted in strain ds512, which displayed an spp(-)-like phenotype and had 3% of wild-type gtf activity. a plasmid containing the rgg gene was able to complement the ds512 phenotype and significantly increase gtf expression above wild-type levels. sequence analysis and other data showed that the s. gordonii gtf determinant, designated gtfg, is located 66 bp downstream of the rgg gene. the sequence also revealed interesting inverted repeats which may play a role in the regulation of  gtfg. we conclude that rgg positively regulates the expression of gtf and influences expression of the spp phenotype.

TI  == expression of m6 protein gene of streptococcus pyogenes in streptococcus gordonii after chromosomal integration and transcriptional fusion.
AB  == the m6 protein of streptococcus pyogenes was expressed on the cell surface and secreted in streptococcus gordonii challis (formerly streptococcus sanguis) after chromosomal integration of a promoterless m6 protein gene (emm-6.1). the ermc gene, conferring resistance to erythromycin, was cloned downstream of emm-6.1, within the same clai fragment. the initiation codon of emm-6.1 was 19 bp downstream of a clai site, so that clai cleavage would leave the gene promoterless. the clai fragment containing the promoterless emm-6.1 and ermc was  ligated in vitro with a clai digest of s. gordonii chromosomal dna. random chromosomal integration of the heterologous dna was obtained by using the ligation mixture to transform the naturally competent s. gordonii challis. twenty-eight percent of transformants selected for erythromycin resistance also expressed m6. among the best m6 producers, 10 clones were selected for the stability of their phenotype. nine of the 10 clones were shown to harbour one intact copy of the emm-6.1/ermc clai fragment integrated into the chromosome. these strains both expressed m6 protein on the surface and secreted different amounts of the molecule, since in each case the protein was produced after a transcriptional fusion of emm-6.1 with a different chromosomal promoter. a s. gordonii strain expressing large amounts of surface m6 protein, as judged by immunofluorescence and western blot, was compared to the m- parental strain in a  standard opsonophagocytosis assay. of the isogenic pair, m6+ s. gordonii survived better in human blood and was phagocytosed at a slower rate.

TI  == purification and properties of sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from oral streptococci.
AB  == the activity of sorbitol-6-phosphate (s6p) dehydrogenase (s6pdh) and the sorbitol transport system were studied in strains of the oral streptococci streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. genetically transformed (to ferment sorbitol) strains and their dna donors were included. s6pdh was purified by anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. the purity of the enzyme was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the purified enzyme from all the strains exhibited michaelis-menton saturation kinetics. the km values for nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (nad) and s6p ranged between 0.03 and 0.21 mm and 0.07 and 0.20 mm respectively. the relative molecular weights of the native enzyme were 229,000 for one donor-transformant pair (s. sanguis and s. gordonii), 107,000 for the other pair (s. mitis and s. gordonii) and 129,000 for s. mutans. the molecular weights of the s6pdh subunits  ranged from 26,000 to 28,000. the ph optima (greater than 8.5) and the amino acid composition (15 amino acids examined) were similar for the s6pdh from the different strains. however, the chromatographic and electrophoretic patterns as well as the km values for nad and s6p were the same only between the s6pdhs from  the strains within each donor-transformant pair. purified s6pdh from s. mutans also exhibited low mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. sorbitol-grown decryptified cells of all the strains phosphorylated sorbitol in the presence of  phosphoenolpyruvate but not in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (atp). atp-mediated phosphorylation of glucose was observed with the same strains when grown on glucose. no evidence for a non-phosphotransferase transport system was found for sorbitol in any of the strains.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == cross-reactive immunodeterminants on streptococcus sanguis and collagen. predicting a structural motif of platelet-interactive domains.
AB  == cross-reactive immunodeterminants on a fibril-associated surface antigen of streptococcus sanguis and types i and iii collagen participate in the induction of aggregation of human platelets. to further understand the basis for this apparent molecular mimicry, antitype-specific collagen antibodies, anti-kpgepgpk  (an analogue of platelet-interactive domains on collagen) and a panel of kpgepgpk-like synthetic peptides were used as probes. when collagen or s. sanguis cells were pretreated with the anti-collagen antisera, the induction of aggregation of platelet-rich plasma was greatly delayed or abrogated. these anti-collagen antibodies also neutralized kpgepgpk and purified s. sanguis platelet-interactive antigens as inhibitors of s. sanguis or collagen-induced aggregation of platelets in plasma. in immunoblot analyses, these anti-collagen antibodies reacted with s. sanguis platelet-interactive antigens. additionally, antisera against the platelet-interactive antigen of s. sanguis selectively reacted with undigested type i collagen and with fragments cb3 and cb6 of cyanogen bromide-treated type i collagen. finally, when platelets were pretreated with synthetic peptides containing specific amino acid substitutions within the kpgepgpk sequence, the time to onset of platelet-rich plasma aggregation by both  agonists was altered. the hierarchical pattern of responses of platelets to these peptides and predictions of the structural changes produced by simulated insertions of each peptide into the cb4 sequence of type iii collagen suggested conformational requirements for interactions with platelets. thus, these data show that cross-reactive immunodeterminants of s. sanguis and collagen induce platelet aggregation. the platelet-interactive domains are predicted to be characterized by a structural motif with the consensus sequence x-p-g-e-p/q-g-p-x.

TI  == ph regulation by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the intracellular ph (phi) optimum for glycolysis in streptococcus mutans ingbritt was determined to be 7.0 by use of the ionophore gramicidin for manipulation of phi. glycolytic activity decreased to zero as the phi was lowered from 7.0 to 5.0. in contrast, glycolysis had an extracellular ph (pho) optimum of 6.0 with a much broader profile. the relative insensitivity of glycolysis to the  lowering of pho was attributed to the ability of s. mutans to maintain a transmembrane ph gradient (delta ph, inside more alkaline) at low pho. at a pho of 5.0, glycolyzing cells of s. mutans maintained a delta ph of 1.37 +/- 0.09 units. the maintenance of this delta ph was dependent on the concentration of potassium ions in the extracellular medium. potassium was rapidly taken up by glycolyzing cells of s. mutans at a rate of 70 nmol/mg dry weight/min. this uptake was dependent on the presence of both atp and a proton motive-force (delta p). the addition of n-n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (dccd) to glycolyzing cells of  s. mutans caused a partial collapse of the delta ph. growth of s. mutants at pho  5.5 in continuous culture resulted in the maintenance of a delta ph larger than that produced by cells grown at ph 7.0. these results suggest the presence of a proton-translocating f1fo-atpase in s. mutans whose activity is regulated by the  intracellular ph and transmembrane electrical potential (delta psi). the production of an artificial delta p of 124 mv across the cell membrane of s. mutans did not result in proton movement through the f1fo-atpase coupled to atp synthesis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the mobilization of a nonconjugative plasmid (pcat) that mediates chloramphenicol resistance in lactobacillus plantarum catc2r was achieved by comobilization with  the conjugative plasmid pam beta 1. the conjugation studies confirmed that the 8.5-kb pcat in l. plantarum catc2r contains the gene responsible for chloramphenicol resistance and that the plasmid has several unique restriction sites which make it useful for genetic studies in carnobacterium spp. cloning studies showed that the gene responsible for chloramphenicol resistance is located in the 2.6-kb ecorv-sali region of pcat. this was confirmed by probing the 3.0-kb bglii fragment of pcat with a biotin-labeled 1.6-kb bsteii-hpaii fragment from the streptococcal-derived plasmid pva797(cmr). expression of chloramphenicol resistance in carnobacterium as well as in other lactobacillus species was achieved by electrotransformation using donor dna from pcat.

AB  == the purposes of this study were to give the characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque, and the relationships with dental caries. we stained 69 patients' teeth on supragingival plaques (plaque index = 1) with the pfiffer's reagent or fd&c red#28 dye, then isolated 80 strains of oral streptococci from 69 patients. cultures were grown in tsb, ms, and msb media. a total of 80 fresh-isolated plaque streptococci, including strains of s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. mutans were identified on the basis of morphologic, dark field, sem, and biochemical characteristics. all of the oral plaque streptococci were to be found in significant percentages in dental plaque. patients who had caries harboured s. mutans more often (37/40) than patients without caries (7/29). s. mutans comprised the greatest percentage (37/69) of microorganisms encountered in caries' plaque, and there was an association between high counts of s. mutans and the presence of dental caries. cultural and  biochemical methods were used for the isolation and identification of the different species of s. mutans. the result indicated that biotype i were the most predominant species (50%) in dental plaque. thus, it is possible to isolate, screen and identify unknown strains through the morphologic, darkfield, sem, and  biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from human dental plaque. by means of the present methods for identification, we hold considerable  promises for contributing to the prevention and diagnosis of dental diseases.

TI  == restriction endonuclease-fragment polymorphisms of oral viridans streptococci, compared by conventional and field-inversion gel electrophoresis.
AB  == oral streptococci formerly classified as streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus mitis have recently been divided into four species. two additional species have also been proposed for this group. each species is genetically distinct, but they have many traits in common, which makes it difficult for clinical isolates to be  identified by phenotypic tests. genotypic comparison may provide an alternative approach. this study used dna fingerprint analysis for comparison of genotypes of 21 reference strains--classified as streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, "streptococcus parasanguis", or "streptococcus crista" in previous dna hybridization studies--and 17 clinical and laboratory strains placed in those groups on the basis of phenotypic tests. hindiii and pvuii digests were run in conventional horizontal agarose gels. sfii digests of reference strains and two laboratory strains were run in field-inversion gels. fingerprint patterns were compared by visual examination, cluster analysis of densitometric traces, and lane-matching software. only two "s. crista" strains and two parent mutant lineages showed fingerprint patterns that were identical by visual examination. fingerprint patterns of all other strains were unique. cluster analysis results could not be considered valid, since replicate lanes in  different gels were not grouped together. hindiii and pvuii digests contained too many bands for correct matching by lane-matching software. sfii digests were correctly matched by computer, with the same results as visual examination. results indicate that the diversity of strains within these streptococcal species was too great to permit species identification by dna fingerprint patterns. this  genotypic diversity suggests that isolates from unrelated hosts may have been separate for long periods of time.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. adherence of pmns to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. in this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on pmn activation using an in vitro method of measuring pmn adherence to  dacron fibres. most of the bacteria investigated increased pmn adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of pmn lysosomal enzymes and other products. in contrast, bacteroides species suppressed pmns, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. the modulatory effects of oral bacteria on pmn activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.

AB  == greater attention has been recently paid to the role of certain strains of streptococcus as an etiologic agent of behcet's disease, in which t cell abnormalities are considered to be involved. we therefore examined whether t cells from patients with behcet's disease might to be stimulated by streptococcus sanguis-related antigen (rre kth-1 antigens). t cells from 17 patients with behcet's disease, but not those from 13 healthy individuals or from 13 patients with other rheumatic diseases, were stimulated to produce greater amounts of interleukin 6 (il6) by addition of rre kth-1 antigens [stimulation index: 3.96 +/- 0.56 and 1.35 +/- 0.28 or 1.83 +/- 0.43 (mean +/- sem), respectively]. the il6 production by t cells required the presence of either fresh or paraformaldehyde-fixed monocytes. the enhancement of t cell il6 production was not related to the presence of hla-b51, which has been shown to be frequently associated with behcet's disease. these results indicate that t cells from patients with behcet's disease are stimulated by streptococcal antigens to produce il6 through t cell-monocyte interactions in which binding of the antigens to monocytes, but not necessarily processing of the antigens by monocytes, is involved. moreover, rre kth-1 antigens as well as escherichia coli-derived antigens also enhanced the production of interferon-gamma by t cells from patients with behcet's disease. the data thus suggest that t cell hypersensitivity to several bacterial antigens may play a central role in the pathogenesis of behcet's disease.

TI  == glucosyltransferase phase variation in streptococcus gordonii modifies adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite surfaces in a sucrose-independent manner.
AB  == phase variation of streptococcus gordonii between high (spp+) and low (spp-) levels of glucosyltransferase (gtf) activity resulted in the greater adhesion of  spp- strains to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) in a washed-cell adhesion test. specific gtf mutants did not show this response. although washed spp+ cells produced 5-fold or more glucan from sucrose than spp- cells did under the conditions of the adhesion test, sucrose elevated the adhesion of both phenotypes to hydroxyapatite (ha) equally, but had no effect on adhesion to s-ha. this effect was not sucrose-specific, however, because equimolar amounts of other carbohydrates and nacl elevated adhesion of both spp types to levels similar to those seen with sucrose. adhesion did not correlate with relative changes in cell hydrophobicity. these results suggest that, in addition to changes in gtf activity, other changes relevant to adhesion may occur during spp phase variation.

TI  == isolation and characterization of actinomyces viscosus mutants defective in binding salivary proline-rich proteins.
AB  == recent studies have provided evidence for human salivary proline-rich proteins (prps) serving as potential receptors in the acquired pellicle for actinomyces viscosus type 1 fimbriae. we report here the isolation of mutants derived from a. viscosus t14v-j1 which are defective in binding to prps partially purified from parotid gland saliva. mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate preceded enrichment for cells nonreactive with prps by successive adsorptions with prp-treated latex  beads. screening was accomplished by random selection of 250 isolated colonies from each of four enrichment cycles and reaction with prp-treated latex beads in  microtiter plates. two mutants of independent origin were examined for adherence  to hydroxyapatite treated with either prps, proline-rich glycoproteins, deglycosylated proline-rich glycoproteins, or whole saliva. additional surface properties that were examined included agglutination with polyclonal antisera to  type 1 and type 2 fimbriae, agglutination by a monoclonal antibody to type 1 fimbriae that inhibits adherence of the parent strain to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite, the ability to bind monoclonal antibody to the type 1 fimbrial subunit, and lactose-reversible coaggregation with streptococcus sanguis 34. both mutants exhibited reduced binding to hydroxyapatite treated with whole saliva or  salivary protein preparations but were still capable of reaction with antiserum to type 1 and type 2 fimbriae. in addition, these mutants possessed the ability to bind monoclonal antibody to the type 1 fimbrial subunit in amounts comparable  to the amount bound by the parent strain but were not agglutinated by the adherence-inhibiting monoclonal antibody. when considered with previously published data, these results suggest that an adhesive molecule is probably associated with type 1 fimbriae and allows for the interaction of a. viscosus with constituents in the salivary pellicle.

AB  == a 58.7-kb nonconjugative plasmid (pkq1) previously reported in a clinical isolate of enterococcus faecium was found to contain both a tetm and an erythromycin resistance (erm) determinant. the plasmid contained a region homologous to the a, f, h, and g hincii fragments of tn916. however, the 4.8-kb b fragment of tn916 which contained the tetm determinant was replaced by a 7.3-kb fragment, and the 3.6-kb hincii c fragment of tn916 was missing. an element homologous to tn917 was juxtaposed to the truncated tn916-like element. the tn917-like element was similar in size to the erm transposon tn917 as determined by a clai restriction digest which spanned approximately 99% of the transposon. when bacillus subtilis  or streptococcus sanguis were transformed with pkq1, no zygotically induced transposition of the tetm element was detected. similarly no transposition of the tn917-like element was detected.

TI  == [a clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  == panipenem/betamipron (cs-976, papm/bp), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical  efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. the duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. when clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. it was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. it was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. papm/bp was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses  daily to 10 cases. for the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. the efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. the overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. as pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. they were gram-positive cocci including 2  strains each of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus viridans  and a strain of streptococcus spp., and gram-negative rods including 9 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas spp.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == induction of a putative laminin-binding protein of streptococcus gordonii in human infective endocarditis.
AB  == there is evidence to suggest that the virulence of streptococcus strains in infective endocarditis might be due to the expression of binding sites for the extracellular matrix proteins of damaged valves. in this communication, we draw attention to one laminin-binding protein from a strain of streptococcus gordonii  isolated from a patient with human endocarditis. this 145-kda protein was found on the cell wall of the bacterium. the level of expression of this binding protein might be regulated by the presence of extracellular matrix proteins: the  protein was lacking after in vitro selection of laminin, collagen i, and fibronectin nonbinding variants, and it was recovered after growth of the variants when laminin or collagen i was added to the growth medium. it was also missing after 10 subcultures in minimal medium, indicating some positive control. furthermore, the 145-kda protein was recognized as a major antigen by sera from patients treated for streptococcal infective endocarditis, while sera from patients with valvulopathies gave only slight recognition, suggesting an increase of the expression of this protein during infective endocarditis. it was also shown that the 145-kda protein carried a collagen i-like determinant detected with anti-human collagen i antibodies.

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.

AB  == the present investigation examined the distribution of 14 subgingival species at  a total of 2299 sites in 90 subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxygenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. the mean total viable count for all sites in all subjects was 8.3 x 10(6). the probes accounted for an average of 27.8% of the total viable count. the % of subjects in which each species was detected was as follows; v. parvula, 98; b. intermedius i, 98; s. sanguis ii, 96; b. intermedius ii, 95; c. ochracea, 94; b. gingivalis, 91; s. sanguis i, 85; w. recta, 83; f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, 82; s. intermedius, 80; b. forsythus, 76; p. micros, 74; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, 62 and  a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, 52. the % of sites colonized by each of the  14 test species varied considerably within different subjects. the median number  of sites colonized by different species ranged from 3.6% for a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b to 43.5% for v. parvula. in half the subjects, the mean % of the total viable counts for each of the test species was less than  4%. when subjects were divided on the basis of % of sites at baseline with greater than 3 mm attachment loss, the 14 probes accounted for 29.9% of the microbiota in the localized disease group and 25% in the widespread disease group.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == this study evaluated the effect of an alternate delivery system for chlorhexidine on salivary levels of mutans streptococci (ms) and other selected oral bacteria.  on the basis of salivary ms levels > or = 10(4) cfu/ml, 22 subjects were enrolled. all caries lesions were restored prior to treatment. two pretreatment paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were obtained for culturing at least 1 week apart. complete-arch vacuum-adapted mouthguards were individually fabricated and  coated internally with a 3% w/v chlorhexidine varnish. mouthguards were worn for  an average of 7 h/night for 7 nights. saliva samples were obtained immediately after treatment and 1 and 3 months later. there was no significant change in levels of any of the monitored bacteria between the two pretreatment samples. a significant and specific reduction in salivary ms levels was observed in the three after-treatment samples as compared with baseline values (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.05, respectively). the levels of actinomyces viscosus were also measured, and there was a significant reduction immediately after treatment (p <  0.05), a return to baseline values at 1 month, and a significant increase above baseline values at 3 months, (p < 0.001). there was no significant change in saliva volume, in total numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria, or in levels of lactobacilli or streptococcus sanguis. this treatment system is capable of significant and specific suppression of ms levels for up to 3 months without retreatment.

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci to salivary glycoproteins.
AB  == we used an overlay method to study the ability of human salivary glycoproteins to serve as receptors for several strains of streptococci that colonize the oral cavity. parotid and submandibular-sublingual salivas were collected as ductal secretions, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. the resulting blots were overlaid with [35s]methionine-labeled bacteria, and salivary components to which the bacteria bound were detected by autoradiography. potential glycoprotein receptors were identified for 8 of the 16 strains tested. in three cases (streptococcus sanguis 72-40 and 804 and streptococcus sobrinus omz176), highly specific interactions with a single salivary component were detected. removal of  sialic acid residues from the low-molecular-weight salivary mucin prevented adherence of one of these strains (s. sanguis 72-40), suggesting that this saccharide either mediates binding or is a critical component of the receptor site. in the remaining five strains (streptococcus gordonii g9b and 10558, s. sanguis 10556, and streptococcus oralis 10557 and 72-41), interactions with multiple salivary components, including the low-molecular-weight salivary mucin,  highly glycosylated proline-rich glycoproteins, and alpha-amylase, were detected. these results suggest that some oral streptococci can bind specifically to certain of the salivary glycoproteins. the interactions identified may play an important role in governing bacterial adherence and clearance within the oral cavity.

TI  == multibacterial artificial plaque. a model for studying carious process.
AB  == a multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans (serotype c), streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus. typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. the caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. the lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. the acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. it is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful  in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in  the media. moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.

AB  == this study measured the in vitro inhibition of growth and adherence of five oral  bacteria by glass-ionomer materials. disks were prepared from two cavity liners and four restorative class materials, by use of teflon plates with circular wells, five mm wide and two mm deep. the bacterial species tested included: a. viscosus, s. mitis, s. mutans, l. casei, and s. sanguis. growth inhibition studies were performed by the spreading of 0.1 ml of standardized inocula over agar plates produced with selective media, followed by the direct application of  glass-ionomer disks onto the agar. on other plates, disks were placed onto uninoculated agars for 48 h, followed by bacterial inoculation. all agar plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each bacterial species. the four restorative materials were also placed aseptically into sterilized bovine incisors and placed into sucrose containing broth media, inoculated with s. mutans for three days. adhering materials were disclosed and scored. an ion-exchange electrode was used to measure fluoride release over a seven-day period for all six glass ionomers. the two cavity liners and two of the restorative materials produced the largest growth inhibition zones by direct contact. no growth inhibition occurred when the specimens were allowed to come into contact with the agars prior to inoculation. all four restorative materials  reduced bacterial accumulations on enamel surfaces by over 80%. elevations in short-term fluoride release levels were positively correlated with growth inhibition.

TI  == noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  == erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by aureobasidium sp. from glucose. it is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. the aim of this study was  to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. it was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from streptococcus mutans ps-14 (c) and streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- sem) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with s. mutans ps-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared  to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). the main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.

TI  == a mechanism of passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies to a 185,000 m(r)  streptococcal antigen.
AB  == the cell surface streptococcal antigen (sa) i/ii of 185,000 m(r) is an immunodominant molecule that expresses one or more adhesion determinants. a series of 14 monoclonal antibodies (mab) to defined parts of sa i/ii were generated and some of these were used in passive immunization of macaques. topical administration of selected mab to the teeth of macaques prevented colonization of endogenous or implanted exogenous streptococcus mutans for a period of 1 year. significant reduction of both smooth surface and fissure caries was found in macaques who had mab (guy's 1) applied to their teeth, as compared with saline-treated animals. a series of in vivo passive immunization experiments was then carried out in 57 human subjects. topical application of mab to sa i/ii  prevented colonization of both artificially implanted exogenous strains of s. mutans, as well as natural recolonization by indigenous s. mutans. the properties of the protective mab were then investigated and the epitope specificity within the sa i/ii molecule was found to be essential but not the isotype specificity of the immunoglobulin (ig). the requirement for complement activating and the phagocyte binding sites of the fc fragment of mab was not essential, as the f(ab')2 fragment of the mab was as protective as the intact igg, but the fab fragment failed to prevent recolonization of s. mutans. prevention of recolonization was specifically restricted to s. mutans, as the proportion of other organisms, such as s. sanguis, failed to show a significant change. the surprising feature of these experiments was that protection of re-colonization of s. mutans lasted up to 2 years, although mab was applied for only 3 weeks and functional mab was detected on the teeth only 3 days following application of the mab. the long-term protection could therefore not be accounted for by a persistence of mab on the teeth, but may be due to a shift in the microbial balance in which other bacteria occupy the ecological niche vacated by s. mutans, resulting in colonization resistance to s. mutans. gene cloning and sequencing the sa from s. mutans, s. sobrinus and s. sanguis identified a conserved region (residues 955-1213) which on southern hybridization and partial dna sequence analysis was also found in 19 alpha-haemolytic oral streptococci. the results suggest that the sa molecule may constitute a family of adhesins in oral alpha haemolytic streptococci.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the occurrence of highly variable penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) in penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae suggested that transfer of homologous genes from related species may be involved in resistance development.  antiserum and monoclonal antibodies raised against pbps 1a and 2b from the susceptible s. pneumoniae r6 strain were used to identify related pbps in 41 s. mitis, s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii strains mostly isolated in south africa with mic values ranging from less than 0.15 to 16 mg/ml. furthermore, the possibility of genetic exchange was examined with 30 penicillin-resistant strains of this collection (mic greater than 0.06 mg/ml) as donors using s. pneumoniae r6 as recipient in transformation experiments. the majority of s. mitis and s. sanguis ii strains but none of the s. sanguis i strains could transform penicillin resistance genes into s. pneumoniae r6. all positive donor strains and all susceptible isolates of s. mitis and s. sanguis ii strains contained pbps which cross-reacted with the anti-pbp 1a and/or anti-pbp 2b antibodies. on the other hand, only five of the 14 s. sanguis i strains contained a pbp that reacted with one of the antibodies. this strongly suggested the presence of genes homologous to the pneumococcal pbp 1a and 2b genes in viridans streptococci, and  documents that penicillin resistance determinants can be transformed from viridans streptococci into the pneumococcus.

TI  == studies on the subcellular localization of protease and arylaminopeptidase activities in streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556.
AB  == intact cells of streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 possessed arylaminopeptidases exhibiting activity toward the nitroanilide (na) derivatives of leucine, alanine, methionine, arginine, or lysine. weak hydrolytic activity was observed in assays  with the na derivatives of valine, proline, glycine, or glutamic acid. subcellular localization studies revealed that arylaminopeptidase activities were located in both the cell membrane and cytoplasm. arylaminopeptidases exhibiting activity toward the leucine, alanine, or methionine na substrates appeared to be  more predominantly associated with the membrane, whereas enzymes exhibiting activity toward arginyl-na or lysyl-na were more prevalently located in the cytoplasm. several results from this study suggest that the membrane-assocaited arginyl and lysyl arylaminopeptidases were located in such a way that their expression was restricted in the intact cell. the addition of 0.5 mol/l nacl to protoplast preparations derived from mutanolysin-treated cells resulted in an almost complete solubilization of membrane-associated arylaminopeptidase activities. these observations support the conclusion that the association of arylaminopeptidases with the cell membrane may involve hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions, or both. s. sanguis atcc 10556 also possessed at least one caseinolytic endopeptidase activity. this activity is most likely located near the membrane surface, as no association with the cell wall was evident. the location of membrane-associated endopeptidase and arylaminopeptidase activities, together with intracellular peptidases, is suggested to provide an efficient mechanism for the hydrolysis and subsequent utilization of polypeptide  and oligopeptide substrates as sources of amino acids for growth by this microorganism.

AB  == an abbreviated treatment with a chlorhexidine-containing varnish was compared with a similar treatment with a placebo varnish and with a prophylaxis alone for  its effects on the numbers of detectable salivary mutants streptococci in 51 adults. the varnishes, applied once weekly for four weeks, were held in place with a covering layer of either of two polyurethane sealants (fluorprotector or adhesit). on the first appointment, the varnish-sealant combination was applied to all tooth surfaces, but on succeeding appointments only the occlusal and approximal surfaces were covered. the chlorhexidine varnish, covered with either  sealant, reduced the salivary mutans streptococci by an average of 3 logs (99.9%) in all of the 20 subjects treated, and below detectable levels for at least four  weeks in nine of them. in the groups receiving placebo varnish-sealant combinations, the mean log number of mutans streptococci of the subjects was reduced only by approximately 0.5 log (32%), and none of the subjects experienced loss of their detectable mutans streptococci for four weeks, although one subject did so for three weeks. no significant difference between the effects of the two  polyurethane sealants was observed. treatment with a single prophylaxis had no effect on mutans streptococcus levels. subjects treated with chlorhexidine varnish also experienced an increase in s. sanguis and a small decrease in yeasts. loss of detectable mutans streptococci did not cause changes in the numbers of other micro-organisms examined, beyond those observed with chlorhexidine varnish treatment alone.

TI  == overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis twenty-two years after operation risks management and prevention.
AB  == a new case of fatal postsplenectomy sepsis occurring 22 years after operation for splenic rupture is described. there are now 30 published cases in which this complication occurred 10 or more years after operation. the microorganism responsible for the vast majority of cases is streptococcus pneumoniae. the causative pathogen identified in the present case was a viridans streptococcas, strep. sanguis, an opportunistic, low virulence pathogen. the clinical presentation of this patient is characteristic of the syndrome of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection and exemplifies the dramatic suddenness with which it develops.

TI  == relation of counts of microbial species to clinical status at the sampled site.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to relate clinical characteristics at a site to the frequency of detection, absolute counts and proportions of 14 subgingival species. subgingival plaque samples were removed by curette from the  mesial surface of 2299 teeth in 3 healthy and 87 subjects with periodontal attachment loss. samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the dna fixed to the filters.  digoxygenin-labeled dna probes were used to identify colonies of each test species. measurements of pocket depth, attachment level, recession, redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration were made at each sampled site. total viable  counts at sites ranged from 10(3) to greater than 10(8) and were strongly related to pocket depth. mean total counts at sites less than 3 mm averaged 4.6 x 10(6),  while mean counts at sites greater than 7 mm averaged 2.0 x 10(7). species enumerated and % of sites colonized were as follows; v. parvula 44; s. sanguis ii 36; b. intermedius i 33; c. ochracea 31; b. intermedius ii 30; s. sanguis i 29; b. gingivalis 27; s. intermedius 25; p. micros 24; w. recta 23; f. nucleatum ss vincentii 18; b. forsythus 15; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 10; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 8. counts of b. intermedius ii were higher at sites which exhibited gingival redness while b. intermedius i was higher at sites which bled on probing. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b was more frequent and  at higher mean % at sites without recession. the opposite was true for s. sanguis ii. b. gingivalis was somewhat more prevalent and at higher levels at suppurating sites. b. gingivalis, b. intermedius i and ii and b. forsythus were found more frequently and at higher levels at sites with deeper pockets, while v. parvula was less prevalent at sites with pocket depths less than 4 mm. b. gingivalis, b.  intermedius i and a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b increased with increasing pocket depth in both localized and widespread disease subjects, but mean counts were higher in the localized disease subjects at any pocket depth. only w. recta  was found at higher levels at deep sites in widespread disease subjects when compared with similar sites in localized disease subjects. no suspected pathogens were detected in 38% of shallow sites, 31% of intermediate sites and 22% of deep  sites, 2/3 of deep pockets, but less than 1/2 of shallow pockets harbored at least 2 of the suspected pathogens.

TI  == relation of baseline microbial parameters to future periodontal attachment loss.
AB  == the relationship between the level of subgingival species at baseline and subsequent attachment loss in a subject was examined. 38 subjects (14-71 years) with prior evidence of periodontal destruction were monitored 2x for pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth at baseline and 2 months. a subject was considered to exhibit new attachment loss if 1 or more sites increased 3 mm or more in attachment level in 2 months. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the baseline visit from the mesial aspect of each tooth (28 sites) using gracey curettes. samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the dna fixed to the filters.  digoxygenin-labeled dna probes were used to enumerate 14 subgingival species. 17  of 38 subjects (44.7%) exhibited new attachment loss in 2 months. the % of the total viable count of each species was averaged for each subject. the species enumerated and the mean % of the total cultivable microbiota averaged across the  active and inactive subjects were as follows; b gingivalis 2.3, 1.2; w. recta 1.3, 0.6; b. intermedius i 2.5, 2.0; b. forsythus 1.5, 1.2; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 1.1, 0.8; f. nucleatum ss vincentii 1.1, 1.0; s. intermedius 2.0, 1.9; p. micros 1.5, 1.5; b. intermedius ii 1.6, 1.7; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 0.4, 0.6; s. sanguis i 1.8, 2.1; s. sanguis ii 2.7, 3.0; v. parvula 3.9, 4.2; c. ochracea 0.9, 1.8.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == enumeration of oral streptococci on media containing different concentrations of  sodium and potassium ions.
AB  == laboratory "type" strains of oral streptococci were screened for their ability to grow on mitis-salivarius agar (msa) in the presence of increasing concentrations  of either na+ or k+ up to 500 mmol/l. strains were generally better able to withstand increasing concentrations of na+ than k+, although low numbers of colony-forming units (cfus) were seen with the highest concentration of either cation. two strains of streptococcus mutans, ingbritt 162 and ingbritt 175, behaved differently when the concentration of cation was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/l; the latter showed a marked increase in the number of cfus when the na+ concentration was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/l, whereas there was a decrease with strain ingbritt 162. strains of oral streptococci from the saliva of adults  and children were isolated on modified msa containing known concentrations of na+ and k+ and further examined if they showed "mutans-like" colony morphology. the number of cfus generally dropped as the concentration of na+ or k+ was increased  from 200 to 350 or 500 mmol/l. greater numbers of streptococci were tolerant to na+ than to k+. half of the isolates were members of the streptococcus sanguis group (ssg), either streptococcus mitis or s. sanguis ii, and these were more tolerant to high concentrations of na+ or k+ than other isolates that were identified as streptococcus morbillorum, streptococcus acidominimus, and streptococcus milleri.

TI  == subclass distribution of salivary secretory immunoglobulin a antibodies to oral streptococci.
AB  == the ability of specific secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) antibodies to inhibit  bacterial colonization of mucosal surfaces may be neutralized by the activity of  bacterial iga1 proteases. because of the resistance of the iga2 subclass to these enzymes, the biological effect of iga1 proteases in vivo may depend on the subclass distribution of the bacterium-specific antibodies. we have estimated the subclass distribution of s-iga antibodies in saliva samples from 13 individuals against iga1 protease-producing (streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis)  and nonproducing (streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis bv. 2) oral streptococci. iga1 was found to be the predominant subclass of antibodies against these four bacteria in most of the saliva samples, corroborating previous data suggesting a role of iga1 proteases in plaque formation. however, variation in the subclass distribution of s-iga antibodies against the same strain was observed. in one individual, iga2 was the predominant subclass of antibodies against all four streptococci and of total salivary s-iga, pointing to the possible significance of genetic variations. the study also addresses methodological problems related to the quantitation of salivary antibodies by solid-phase immunoassays.

TI  == salivary-agglutinin-mediated adherence of streptococcus mutans to early plaque bacteria.
AB  == interspecies binding is important in the colonization of the oral cavity by bacteria. streptococcus mutans can adhere to other plaque bacteria, such as streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus, and this adherence is enhanced by saliva. the salivary and bacterial molecules that mediate this interaction were investigated. salivary agglutinin, a mucinlike glycoprotein known to mediate the  aggregation of many oral streptococci in vitro, was found to mediate the adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis or a. viscosus. adherence of s. mutans to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus was inhibited by antibodies to the bacterial agglutinin receptor. expression of the s. sanguis receptor (ssp-5) gene in enterococcus faecalis increased adhesion of this organism to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus. this interaction could be inhibited by antibodies to the agglutinin receptor. the results suggest that salivary agglutinin can promote adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis and a. viscosus through interactions with the agglutinin receptor on s. mutans.

TI  == influence of delmopinol on bacterial zeta-potentials and on the colloidal stability of bacterial suspensions.
AB  == delmopinol is a low molecular weight surface-active compound that has been shown  to be effective against dental plaque both in vitro and in vivo and against gingivitis in vivo. to study the mode of action of delmopinol, the influence of the compound on the stability of bacterial suspensions, both with and without saliva, and on the zeta-potentials of oral streptococci was studied. the results  showed that delmopinol reduced the magnitude of the zeta-potentials, but, in contrast, the colloidal stability of the bacterial suspensions without saliva was increased. the explanation of these observations could be that non-dlvo interaction components, such as repulsive hydration/steric forces, have come into effect at very close distances between two approaching bacterial cells. to judge  from the present results, it is possible that delmopinol forms films on bacterial cells in a plaque, thereby facilitating mechanical removal.

TI  == streptococcus crista sp. nov., a viridans streptococcus with tufted fibrils, isolated from the human oral cavity and throat.
AB  == we studied strains of an unusual streptococcus that superficially resembles streptococcus sanguis but has fibrils that are arranged in lateral tufts. these strains were originally isolated from human throats and oral cavities and have been referred to previously as "streptococcus sanguis i," the "cr group," and the "tufted-fibril group." until now, insufficient phenotypic data have been available to allow reliable differentiation of these strains from other viridans  streptococcal species, particularly the species in the s. sanguis group. recently, workers have proposed a scheme of phenetic tests that is based on 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrates and conventional biochemical tests and allows the tufted-fibril group to be differentiated; these organisms differ from  other viridans species in being able to hydrolyze arginine but not esculin and in producing alpha-l-fucosidase but not beta-glucosidase or alkaline phosphatase. these data, together with the results of our dna-dna hybridization experiments and the unusual ultrastructure of the tufted-fibril strains as determined by electron microscopy, demonstrate that these organisms represent a new species, for which the name streptococcus crista is proposed. the dna base composition is  42.6 to 43.2 mol% g + c. the type strain is strain cr311 (= nctc 12479).

TI  == delineation of a segment of adsorbed salivary acidic proline-rich proteins which  promotes adhesion of streptococcus gordonii to apatitic surfaces.
AB  == cells of several strains of streptococcus gordonii attached in much higher numbers to experimental pellicles formed from samples of submandibular or parotid saliva on hydroxyapatite (ha) beads than to buffer controls. the nature of the salivary components responsible were investigated by preparing experimental pellicles from chromatographic fractions of submandibular saliva obtained from trisacryl gf 2000m columns. adhesion of s. gordonii blackburn was promoted by two groups of fractions. the adhesion-promoting activity in the first group of fractions was associated with the family of acidic proline-rich proteins (prps),  while that of the second group is as yet unidentified. experimental pellicles prepared by treating ha with 2 micrograms of pure 150-amino-acid-residue prps (prp-1, prp-2, and pif-s) promoted adhesion of s. gordonii blackburn cells to an  extent comparable to that obtained with unfractionated saliva. however, pellicles prepared from a 106-residue prp (prp-3) were significantly less effective, and those prepared from the amino-terminal tryptic peptide (residues 1 to 30) of the  prp and the salivary phosphoprotein statherin were completely ineffective in promoting adhesion. although adhesion of several strains of s. gordonii was promoted by adsorbed prp-1, the adhesion of several strains of streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus oralis was either not affected or only weakly enhanced by this protein. s. gordonii cells bound avidly to prps adsorbed onto ha beads, but the streptococci did not appear to bind prps in solution, since concentrations of prp as high as 200 micrograms/ml did not inhibit binding of bacterial cells to pellicles prepared from pure prp. s. gordonii cells also attached well to prp or a synthetic decapeptide representing residues 142 to 150  of the prp when the peptide was linked to agarose beads. studies with a series of synthetic decapeptides indicated that the minimal segment of prp which promoted high levels of s. gordonii adhesion was the carboxy-terminal dipeptide pro-gln (residues 149 and 150).

TI  == conservation of the gene encoding streptococcal antigen i/ii in oral streptococci.
AB  == the spap gene of streptococcus mutans serotype c encodes a major cell surface protein, streptococcal antigen (sa) i/ii, with an mr of 185,000, that is thought  to be involved in bacterial adhesion to teeth. proteins with significant amino acid sequence homology to sa i/ii have also been found in s. sobrinus and s. sanguis. the objectives of this study were to investigate the conservation of the spap gene in the mutans groups of streptococci and to determine whether homologous genes were present in other species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci. dna extracted from representative strains of 19 streptococcal species was examined by southern hybridization and partial dna sequence analysis. a series of five overlapping dna probes from the spap gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and used in the southern hybridizations. the entire gene was found to be well conserved in all strains of s. mutans serotypes c, e, and f investigated. a probe from the 3' region of the gene, which encodes residues 857  to 1207 of the sa i/ii protein, hybridized with dna from a number of mutans streptococci, as well as with dna from nonmutans alpha-hemolytic streptococci. conservation within this region was further demonstrated by sequencing gene fragments of two strains of s. intermedius and s. oralis. the results show that some regions of the spap gene are highly conserved not only in the mutans group of streptococci but also in other nonmutans alpha-hemolytic streptococci. this suggests that a family of cell surface proteins which, by analogy with the 185,000-mr sa i/ii of s. mutans, could be involved in bacterial adhesion might exist.

TI  == sequence and structural analysis of surface protein antigen i/ii (spaa) of streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  == streptococcal antigen i/ii or the surface protein antigen a (spaa) of streptococcus sobrinus is an adhesin which mediates binding of the organism to tooth surfaces. the complete sequence of the gene which encodes spaa has been determined. the gene consists of 4,584 bp and encodes a protein of 1,528 amino acid residues. the deduced amino acid sequence shows extensive homology with those of the cell surface adhesins from streptococcus mutans serotypes c and f and from streptococcus sanguis. structural analysis of the n-terminal region (residues 50 to 550), which is rich in alanine and includes four tandem repeats of an 82-residue sequence, suggests that it adopts an alpha-helical coiled-coil conformation. cell surface hydrophobicity may be associated with this region. the c-terminal region is more conserved and includes two tandem repeats of a 39-residue proline-rich sequence. a further proline-rich sequence in this region  is predicted to span the cell wall. although a hydrophobic sequence is present in the c-terminal region, it appears to be too short to span the cell membrane. anchoring of spaa in the cell membrane may therefore require some form of posttranslational modification or association with another membrane protein.

TI  == the role of oral bacteria in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.
AB  == various micro-organisms have been implicated as causative agents for bacterial endocarditis, including lactobacilli and in particular the viridans streptococci  which are more commonly associated with dental caries. of these, the most frequently isolated one has the descriptive name streptococcus sanguis. the disease is characterized by growth of micro-organisms within a platelet-fibrin thrombus protruding from a valve leaflet. an understanding of the pathogenesis involves knowledge of the mechanisms of conversion of the normal vascular surface to a thrombogenic one and the adhesion of micro-organisms to such surfaces. model systems to study this interaction include experimental animals, mammalian epithelial cells and platelets, and proteins such as fibronectin and fibrinogen.  microbial protein surface components (adhesins) and lipoteichoic acid have also been implicated. capsular polysaccharides may be involved, but the role of dextrans formed from sucrose has been over-emphasized as the polymers are not formed in situ. antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at risk is based on bacteriostatic or bactericidal action. however, bacterial cell surface components involved in adhesion may also be affected, and knowledge of such reactions could  provide a more rational basis for antibiotic prophylaxis.

AB  == sucralfate, an aluminum salt of sucrose octasulfate, has been shown to be effective in reducing the discomfort of radiation therapy-induced oral mucositis. this study was done to determine whether sucralfate could be used as a nutritional source for dental caries-producing organisms. three streptococcus strains were cultured in a defined medium. sucralfate powder was evaluated for its ability to be used as a carbohydrate food source by these organisms. the addition of sucralfate alone did not stimulate the organism's growth. the addition of sucralfate and glucose resulted in less growth than the addition of glucose alone. increasing the sucralfate concentration from 1% to 10% in the glucose-containing cultures resulted in statistically significant growth inhibition (p less than 0.02). sucralfate appears to have no cariogenic potential and may have some cariostatic potential.

TI  == synergistic degradation of mucin by streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis in mixed chemostat cultures.
AB  == oral streptococci can grow in mucin by utilizing the oligosaccharide chains as a  source of carbohydrate. the degradation of the oligosaccharides by these species  is accomplished by exoglycosidase activities. in this experiment, it was investigated whether strains from different species could cooperate in the release of sugars from the mucin oligosaccharide. to this end, streptococcus sanguis ny 584 and streptococcus oralis strain ny 586 were grown continuously in  a chemically-defined medium, with pig gastric mucin as the growth-limiting source of carbohydrate. in pure cultures, strain ny 586 attained approximately three-fold-higher cell densities than did strain ny 584 in the mucin medium. this was in accordance with the observation that s. oralis ny 586 exhibited fucosidase activity, as indicated by the presence of fucose in the culture fluid. in contrast, strain ny 584 has no fucosidase activity against mucin, and therefore cannot attack fucose-ending oligosaccharide chains. stable mixed cultures of the  strains were obtained. it appeared that s. sanguis ny 584 reached significantly higher cell densities in mixed cultures with s. oralis ny 586 than in pure culture. stimulation of the growth of strain ny 584 was probably due to the generation of non-fucose-ending oligosaccharide chains by fucosidase from strain  ny 586. it is concluded that the synergistic degradation of oligosaccharides in glycoproteins is a potential factor influencing the streptococcal populations in  the mouth.

TI  == clinical and microbiological findings on newly inserted hydroxyapatite-coated and pure titanium human dental implants.
AB  == the clinical and microbiologic features of 30 hydroxyapatite-coated root-form endosseous dental implants (tri-stage) were compared to 10 similar pure titanium  implants without hydroxyapatite coatings. in 7 of 9 partially edentulous patients studied, pure titanium fixtures were placed adjacent to hydroxyapatite-coated implants. implants in the maxilla were submerged beneath mucosal tissues after implant placement for a minimum of 6 months, and in the mandible for at least 4 months. all patients were prescribed short-term beta-lactam antibiotic therapy after fixture placement, and 8 of 9 used chlorhexidine mouthrinses after fixture  exposure. clinical and microbiological examination was carried out 7-10 months after fixed prosthetic loading of the implants. clinical measurements included the gingival index, plaque index, bleeding on probing and peri-implant probing depths determined with the florida probe system. subgingival microbial samples were collected with paper points and transported in vmga iii. specimens were examined by direct phase-contrast microscopy and were plated onto nonselective and selective culture media for anaerobic and aerobic incubation. no significant  mean clinical or microbiological differences were found between the implant types, although one hydroxyapatite-coated implant exhibited deep probing depths,  bleeding on probing and marked radiographic crestal bone loss. streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were the most predominant organisms recovered from clinically stable implants, whereas high proportions of fusobacterium species and peptostreptococcus prevotii were isolated from the ailing hydroxyapatite-coated implant. one or more implants in 8 of the study subjects yielded enteric rods, pseudomonads, enterococci or staphylococci. the prognosis of implants with varying early microbiotas needs to be established in longitudinal studies.

AB  == the effect of methotrexate (mtx) and doxorubicin on the growth, metabolism and ultrastructure of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis was studied in vitro. both anticancer drugs exerted an inhibitory effect on the oral streptococci. mtx was more inhibitory than doxorubicin. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of mtx to s. mutans were 0.25-2.5 micrograms/ml and that of doxorubicin 0.2 mg/ml. the mics of mtx and doxorubicin to s. sanguis were 0.025 micrograms/ml and 2.0-0.02 mg/ml, respectively. when saliva samples of patients with malignant tumors receiving various doses of mtx were analyzed, mtx was found to be secreted into the oral cavity at concentrations ranging from 0.014 to 4.486 micrograms/ml. the saliva of these patients was also found to inhibit the growth  of s. mutans, and the inhibition zones were in accordance with the mic values observed. the results suggest that anticancer therapy must be taken into account  when the salivary microbiological findings of cancer patients are interpreted.

AB  == sorbitol metabolism was examined with a sorbitol-fermenting strain (160) of streptococcus sanguis isolated from the dental plaque of a subject using sorbitol-containing chewing-gum for 4 years. s. sanguis 160 was grown in continuous culture (ph, 7.0; dilution rate, 0.1 h-1) with glucose, sorbitol and nitrogen (sorbitol-excess) limitations. cells grown with a glucose limitation exhibited low, but detectable, uptake of [14c]-sorbitol and transition to medium  limiting in sorbitol resulted in a 5-fold increase in sorbitol uptake. kinetic data revealed that both glucose and sorbitol-limited cells possessed 2 transport  systems for sorbitol (ks = 3.3-6.7 and 36-64 microm), but continued growth of the organism on limiting sorbitol resulted in the loss of the high-affinity system. decryptified, sorbitol-limited cells phosphorylated sorbitol in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate (pep), but not with atp, indicating sorbitol transport solely via the pep phosphotransferase (pts) system. pep-dependent activity in glucose-limited and sorbitol-excess cells was 6- and 4-fold lower than that of the sorbitol-limited cells. uptake of [14c]-sorbitol and activity for ell for sorbitol [ellsor] of the pts in cells in transition from a glucose to sorbitol limitation confirmed the induction of the sorbitol-pts and the repression of the  glucose-pts in the presence of sorbitol. cells grown with an excess of sorbitol exhibited very low ellsor activity. a crossover experiment with membranes and soluble fractions from glucose-, sorbitol- and nitrogen-limited cells of s. sanguis 160 demonstrated the induction of a soluble pts component in sorbitol-limited cells essential for sorbitol transport via the pts.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == sorbitol inhibition of glucose metabolism by streptococcus sanguis 160.
AB  == clinical studies in sweden have shown that the proportion of sorbitol-utilizing strains of streptococcus sanguis increases in dental plaque from individuals using sorbitol-containing products for prolonged periods. we have undertaken to study the metabolism of glucose and sorbitol by s. sanguis 160, isolated from a subject consuming sorbitol-containing chewing-gum 4 times a day for 4 years. growth on glucose was inhibited by the presence of sorbitol in the growth medium  and sorbitol was utilized in the presence of glucose, albeit, at a slower rate than glucose. in addition, pulses of glucose added to cultures growing on sorbitol resulted in the expulsion of sorbitol from the cell. in order to examine further the relationship of sorbitol and glucose, uptake assays were carried out  with s. sanguis 160 grown in continuous culture (ph 7.0, dilution rate = 0.1 h-1) with glucose, sorbitol or nitrogen (sorbitol excess) limitations. the uptake of [14c]-glucose by sorbitol-limited cells, but not by glucose-limited cells, was inhibited by sorbitol, as was glycolysis. kinetic experiments with glucose-limited cells showed 2 transport systems for glucose with ks values of 5.2 and 40 microm, and glucose phosphorylation activity by decryptified cells indicated transport by the p-enolpyruvate (pep) phosphotransferase system (pts) with lesser activity for an atp-dependent transport process. transition from glucose-limited growth to sorbitol-limited growth revealed repression of total [14c]-glucose uptake by intact cells and activity for enzyme ii for glucose (ellglc) of the pts measured in membrane preparations in the presence of an excess of the soluble pts proteins in crude cell-free supernatant fractions.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == ecology of viridans streptococci in the oral cavity and pharynx.
AB  == recently published taxonomic studies of viridans streptococci have resulted in several changes in the nomenclature and definition of oral streptococcal species. with this background, the ecology of streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavities was reinvestigated. the results based on the examination of 1426 streptococcal isolates confirmed and extended earlier findings. apart from mature supragingival plaque, which contained a mixture of all orally encountered streptococci, each site showed a characteristic streptococcal flora. initial dental plaque formation is primarily associated with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1  and streptococcus oralis. our investigation showed that s. sanguis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most prominent streptococci, also on buccal mucosa. in contrast, s. oralis was almost exclusively found in initial dental plaque. streptococcus gordonii, formerly part of s. sanguis, was found in small numbers on the oropharyngeal mucosa and in mature supragingival plaque. the dorsum of the tongue was dominated by s. mitis biovar 2 and streptococcus salivarius, the latter of which was predominant also on the pharyngeal mucosa. streptococcus anginosus was by far the most predominant streptococcus in subgingival plaque. immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease-producing streptococci were primarily isolated  from initial dental plaque and from the buccal mucosa. this lends further support to the concept of iga1 proteases being important for the ability of streptococci  to evade the local immune defence during their initial colonization of certain oral surfaces.

TI  == inhibitory effect of stannous fluoride and other commonly used antimicrobial agents on oral bacteria.
AB  == the purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of stannous fluoride (snf2) gel and other commonly used oral antimicrobial agents/products. the antibacterial inhibitory effect of the various agents was evaluated by their effect against oral plaque bacteria including strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius. a lawn of the specific bacteria to be tested was placed onto blood agar plates. wells were then punched into the agar and each well was filled with  75 microliters of one of the antimicrobial products or control solutions. a positive control was a 0.12% chlorhexidine solution and a negative control was physiological saline. agar plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees c for 5-7 days. zones of inhibition in the lawn of bacteria were measured by a boley gauge. each experiment was performed in duplicate and mean zones of bacterial inhibition were determined. only 0.4% snf2 and 0.12% chlorhexidine were consistently more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria when compared with other  commercial mouth rinses/agents which had any one of a variety of antimicrobial agents as ingredients (alpha = 0.05). this in vitro study demonstrates that stannous fluoride gel is as effective as chlorhexidine in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in dental plaque.

TI  == evaluation of a hygiene monitor for detection of contamination in dental surgeries.
AB  == routines for disinfecting working surfaces in dental surgeries are difficult to monitor without time-consuming and labour-intensive microbiological techniques, yet effective monitoring is a vital part of cross-infection control. easy to use, on-site methods would be valuable in this context. this study evaluates a portable monitor, the biotrace hygiene monitor, which uses bioluminescence to measure adenosine triphosphate (atp) on surfaces. under laboratory conditions, the ability of the monitor to detect whole saliva and streptococcus sanguis was determined and, in the general practice environment, the level of atp on surfaces in five dental surgeries was assessed. the minimum amount of saliva detectable was 0.5 microliters and in surgeries, the monitor readily identified numerous surfaces with fairly high levels of atp. routine cleaning methods sometimes left  atp on surfaces at levels which represented a cross-infection risk, if it is assumed that the atp derived from patients' saliva. modification of cleaning methods resulted in a reduction of atp levels to within that which could be considered reasonably practicably safe. it is concluded that the biotrace hygiene monitor offers a simple and valuable means of monitoring dental practice cleaning routines.

AB  == the aggregation of group a streptococci by whole, stimulated human saliva (whs) and the effect of saliva on streptococcal adherence to host cells was investigated. whs samples from 11 individuals were found to aggregate both m+ and m- group a streptococci to various degrees. the aggregating activity was sensitive to heat, edta, egta [ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid], sodium dodecyl sulfate, and lipoteichoic acid. none of the simple sugars tested, mercaptoethanol, albumin, or nonionic detergents had any effect on aggregation. the aggregating activity of edta-treated saliva was restored by 0.1 mm ca2+ and 1.0 mm mn2+ but not by up to  5 mm mg2+. only streptococci from the stationary phase were aggregated. hyaluronidase treatment of streptococci from the exponential phase of growth restored their ability to be aggregated, suggesting that the hyaluronic acid capsule interferes with agglutination. adsorption of whs by one strain of streptococcus pyogenes removed aggregating activity for other strains of s. pyogenes and streptococcus sanguis but not agglutinins for escherichia coli, suggesting that the agglutinin is specific for certain gram-positive bacteria. molecular sieve chromatography of whs and identification of streptococcus-binding components of saliva suggest that either a glycoprotein of approximately 360 kda  or a mucin of saliva of greater than 1,000 kda mediates aggregation of streptococci. whs also inhibited adherence of s. pyogenes to buccal epithelial cells.

AB  == the protein, hpr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts) in bacteria, was purified from streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. the purified preparation gave only one band  when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pi = 4.85). however, electrophoresis in tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by pep in the presence of enzyme i of the pts or by atp with the hpr kinase. homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained  by preparative electrophoresis. each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the  doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. the electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees c for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees c for several months. both hpr proteins catalyzed in vitro the pep-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with  a preparation of hpr containing both forms of the protein. both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from pep to the other specific pts proteins  known in s salivarius. rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. the presence of the 2 forms of hpr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of s salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. a doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (s mutans, s sobrinus, s sanguis, s thermophilus, s  bovis, s rattus) and also in l lactis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the etiology of behcet's syndrome (bs) is unknown, but a number of streptococcal  species have been implicated. a hypothesis was postulated that a shared antigen,  such as a stress protein, might account for some of these findings. indeed, a rabbit antiserum against a 65-kda heat shock protein of mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed a corresponding 65-kda band with all six streptococcus sanguis strains examined and s. pyogenes but not with s. salivarius. by applying  a panel of nine monoclonal antibodies to the mycobacterial 65-kda heat shock protein, an approximately 65-kda antigen was identified in the uncommon serotypes of s. sanguis st3 and h.83 and one with a different mr was identified in kth-1 and s. pyogenes. monoclonal antibodies y1.2, c1.1, ii h9, and ml30, which reacted with these streptococci, recognize residues 11 to 27, 88 to 123, 107 to 122, and  276 to 297 of the 65-kda heat shock protein, respectively, suggesting that these  residues are conserved among some uncommon serotypes of s. sanguis and s. pyogenes. immunoblot analyses of sera from patients with bs for immunoglobulin a  (iga) and igg antibodies revealed bands of 65 to 70 kda with the mycobacterial heat shock protein, s. sanguis strains, and s. pyogenes, although these reactivities were also found to a lesser extent in controls. a 65- to 70-kda band was found more frequently with s. sanguis kth-2 or kth-3 and iga in serum from patients with bs than with serum from controls (p less than 0.02). antibodies in  serum were then studied by a radioimmunoassay, and in patients with bs this revealed significantly raised iga antibodies to the recombinant 65-kda mycobacterial heat shock protein and to soluble protein extracts of s. sanguis st3, kth-1, kth-2, and kth-3. whereas significant anti-65-kda heat shock protein  and anti-s. sanguis st3 antibodies were also found in sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and recurrent oral ulcers, the anti-s. sanguis kth-1, kth-2, and kth-3 antibodies were confined to bs. the results are consistent with the hypothesis that some of the streptococcal antigens are associated with heat shock or stress proteins, which will need to be formally established by isolating heat  shock proteins from streptococci.

TI  == factors affecting peptide catabolism by oral streptococci.
AB  == the binding of a number of unsubstituted peptides to streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans and their subsequent degradation by such cells were examined. peptides were added to cell suspensions prepared from glucose-limited growth in a chemostat and, at appropriate time intervals, cell-free filtrates were analyzed for peptides and their constituent amino acid residues by high-pressure liquid chromatography techniques. the results indicated that peptide hydrophobicity plays a limited role in peptide binding, but that charge and chain-length are probably important. in s. sanguis, carboxypeptidase activity rapidly released c-terminal arginine (arg); this amino acid was less rapidly released from the n-terminus but a number of other residues were also released by aminopeptidase activity. when arg is buried in the peptide, the rate of its release depends upon the number and type of residues between it and the n-terminus. in contrast, s. mutans possessed only weak peptidase activities. the  nature of its peptidase activities indicates that s. sanguis can obtain the metabolically important arg from a variety of peptides.

AB  == pathogenesis of nutritionally variant streptococcal (nvs) endocarditis initiates  with bacterial attachment to and colonization of the damaged heart valve surface. underlying extracellular matrix (ecm) exposed to the environment during damage to cardiac endothelium provides additional receptors that could be involved in bacterial adherence. the ability of nvs and endocarditis-associated streptococci  to bind ecm was investigated by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system that incorporated ecm secreted by baby hamster kidney and human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture. streptococcus defectivus, the major species isolated from nvs endocarditis cases, bound ecm of fibroblasts and endothelial cells, indicating that the ecm molecule involved in the binding was a common constituent of diverse matrices. the specific binding of s. defectivus to ecm was demonstrated by saturation binding and specific antibody inhibition studies. of the 15 s. defectivus strains analyzed, 13 bound ecm, whereas streptococcus adjacens and nvs serotype iii strains were unable to bind the matrix. this selective binding suggested that s. defectivus binds to heart valves through a mechanism different from those of other nvs in subacute bacterial endocarditis. a survey of non-nvs streptococcal endocarditis isolates demonstrated that s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. faecalis also bound ecm, whereas other viridans species were unable to bind the matrix.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of a gene coding for a saliva-binding protein (ssab) from streptococcus sanguis 12 and possible role of the protein in coaggregation with actinomyces.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 2.9-kb streptococcal dna fragment which codes for two proteins with mrs of 36,000 (streptococcus sanguis adhesin b [ssab]) and 20,000 has been determined. the ssab gene is 927 bp and codes for a 34,684-da protein. the open reading frame coding for the 20-kda protein is 489 bp and codes for a protein of 17,885 da. the ssab protein has a putative hydrophobic 19-amino-acid signal sequence resulting in a 32,620-mr secreted protein, whereas  the 20-kda protein has no signal sequence. both proteins are hydrophilic, and neither appears to have a hydrophobic membrane anchor sequence in the carboxy-terminal region. a dna sequence homology of 73% exists between the cloned fragment containing the ssab gene from s. sanguis 12 and the cloned fragment containing the type 1 fimbrial gene of s. sanguis fw213 (j.c. fenno, d.j. leblanc, and p. fives-taylor, infect. immun. 57:3527-3533, 1989). amino acid comparisons of the ssab and type 1 fimbrial proteins show 87% homology, indicating a close similarity of the two proteins. antiserum raised against the cloned ssab protein cross-reacts with a 38-kda protein identified from streptococcus gordonii (s. sanguis) pk488 which was proposed to mediate coaggregation with actinomyces naeslundii pk606 (p.e. kolenbrander and r.n. andersen, infect. immun. 58:3064-3072, 1990). the ssab adhesion may play a role in oral colonization by binding either to a receptor on saliva or to a receptor on actinomyces.

TI  == [personal identification from antibodies to oral streptococci using elisa].
AB  == serum antibodies to oral streptococci were titrated by elisa for the purpose of personal identification. the bacteria concerned comprised 9 strains of streptococcus mutans, which are known to cause dental caries, and one strain of streptococcus sanguis commonly found in the oral cavity and harmless to the teeth. the quantities of igm antibodies to these streptococci were more or less dependent on the total levels of serum igm. however, no relation was found between the igg antibodies and the total serum levels of igg. iga antibodies showed a degree of correlation that was intermediate between those of the igm and igg antibodies. two antibodies, anti-streptococcus mutans ps14 (anti-sm) and anti-streptococcus sanguis 10556 (anti-ss), were selected, because the cross-reactivities of the igg antibodies with these streptococci were slight. the quantity ratios of igg anti-sm antibodies and igg anti-ss antibodies differed from person to person, ranging from about 1:1 to 1:6 in 129 healthy japanese adults. elisa was considered to be appropriate for assaying these antibodies because of its good intra-assay reproducibility. the igg anti-sm/anti-ss quantity ratio was not related to sex, age or abo blood group, and appeared to be unrelated to the "decayed, missing and filled teeth index" (dmf index). the anti-sm/anti-ss ratios were investigated for 12 months after the preparation of bloodstains. they remained almost unchanged for 8 months, although the reactivities of individual igg antibodies began to decrease 3 to 5 months after preparation. these results indicate that the ratio of igg anti-streptococcal antibodies in bloodstains is a very useful parameter in personal identification.

TI  == surface hydrophobicity of small oral spirochetes.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to determine the surface hydrophobicity of small oral spirochetes and to receive an impression of the molecular organization of the cell surfaces. nine spirochete strains with one endoflagellum from each cell-end (1:2:1 spirochetes) and eight with two endoflagella from each cell-end (2:4:2 spirochetes) from subgingival plaque were examined. two hydrophobicity assay systems were used: 1) two-phase partitioning and 2) salting-out aggregation by ammonium sulfate. the influence of heat, enzymes, saliva, and serum were examined. the 2:4:2 spirochetes were significantly more hydrophobic than the 1:2:1 spirochetes. for all strains heat treatment increased surface hydrophobicity, whereas incubation with proteases decreased surface hydrophobicity for the 1:2:1 spirochetes. the 2:4:2 spirochetes were unaffected by the proteases. lipase and hyaluronidase affected the two morphotypes in opposite directions. saliva did not affect the surface hydrophobicity of any of the strains, whereas rabbit serum decreased this property for the 2:4:2 strains.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == detection of immunoglobulin a1 protease-induced fab alpha fragments on dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == the mechanisms by which immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease activity may enable bacteria to evade the effect of specific secretory iga (s-iga) antibodies are not clear. a possibility which has received indirect experimental support is that bacteria, as a consequence of the protease activity, become coated with incompetent fab alpha fragments instead of with intact antibody molecules. using  a combination of nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, we detected fab alpha fragments not only on oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii) incubated in saliva but also on the bacteria in incipient dental plaque. these results are of  relevance to our previous observation that iga1 protease activity may neutralize  the ability of s-iga antibodies to inhibit the adherence of oral streptococci to  saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.

TI  == incidence of penicillin tolerance among blood culture isolates of streptococcus sanguis, 1987-88.
AB  == laboratories that reported isolations of streptococcus sanguis from blood cultures to the communicable disease surveillance centre (cdsc) colindale were requested to submit strains to bath public health laboratory to allow the prevalence of penicillin tolerance within different biotypes of this species to be studied. one hundred and fifty one streptococcus spp were received from 78 united kingdom laboratories in one year. strains were identified using the api 20 strep, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of penicillin were determined using the spiral gradient plate method. penicillin tolerance was detected by spraying beta-lactamase over inoculated gradient plates, reincubating for 48 hours and counting the number of surviving organisms represented by colonies. there were 57 different api identification profiles encountered in the survey. most s sanguis i/1 strains were penicillin tolerant, most s sanguis ii strains were non-tolerant. the overall geometric mean mic of penicillin was considerably  lower for s sanguis i/1 than for all other biotypes. the distribution of biotypes and the geometric mean mic of penicillin for each biotype were not significantly  different for infective endocarditis strains than for all strains tested, suggesting little or no association between penicillin tolerance and the seeding  of endocardium. when the reactions obtained using api 20 strep were compared with a recent taxonomic study of viridans streptococci, 22 of 38 s sanguis i/1 strains could be reclassified as s gordonii; all these strains were penicillin tolerant.  such reclassification would allow likely penicillin tolerant strains to be predicted.

TI  == inhibition of adsorption of oral streptococci to saliva treated hydroxyapatite by chitin derivatives.
AB  == this study estimated the effects of five chitin derivatives low molecular chitosan (lmcs), ethyleneglycol chitin (pegt), carboxymethyl chitin (pcmt), sulphated chitosan (psss), and phosphorylated chitin (pppt) on the adsorption of  three oral streptococci to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite (s-ha). the adsorption was evaluated by measuring the optical density of the bacterial cell suspensions  released from saliva-treated hydroxyapatite by 0.5 n hcl. the adsorption of test  strains to s-ha progressively decreased in proportion to each additional volume of pegt, pppt, or psss. pppt and psss quite effectively inhibited the adsorption  of s. mutans onto s-ha, but were less effective against s. sanguis and s. mitis.  pppt, psss, and pcmt all markedly promoted the desorption of s. mutans cells pre-adsorbed onto s-ha. pretreatment of s-ha with pppt, psss, or pcmt significantly decreased the subsequent adsorption of s. mutans and s. mitis. pretreatment of these cells with pegt also decreased their adsorption to s-ha. these findings suggest that these chitin derivatives may change the ionic natures of the s-ha and the bacterial cell surface, resulting in a less favorable interaction.

TI  == analysis of the immunoglobulin a protease gene of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the amino acid sequence t-p-p-t-p-s-p-s is tandemly duplicated in the heavy chain of human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1), the major antibody in secretions. the bacterial pathogen streptococcus sanguis, a precursor to dental caries and a cause of bacterial endocarditis, yields iga protease that cleaves only the pro-thr peptide bond in the left duplication, while the type 2 iga proteases of the genital pathogen neisseria gonorrhoeae and the respiratory pathogen haemophilus influenzae cleave only the p-t bond in the right half. we have sequenced the entire s. sanguis iga gene cloned into escherichia coli. a segment  consisting of 20 amino acids tandemly repeated 10 times, of unknown function, occurs near the amino-terminal end of the enzyme encoded in e. coli. identification of a predicted zinc-binding region in the s. sanguis enzyme and the demonstration that mutations in this region result in production of a catalytically inactive protein support the idea that the enzyme is a metalloprotease. the n. gonorrhoeae and h. influenzae enzymes were earlier shown  to be serine-type proteases, while the bacteroides melaninogenicus iga protease was shown to be a cysteine-type enzyme. the streptococcal iga protease amino acid sequence has no significant homology with either of the two previously determined iga protease sequences, that of type 2 n. gonorrhoeae and type 1 h. influenzae. the differences in both structure and mechanism among these functionally analogous enzymes underscore their role in the infectious process and offer some  prospect of therapeutic intervention.

TI  == adherence of porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis to streptococcus sanguis in vitro.
AB  == intergeneric bacterial adherence is responsible for the complexity of the microbiota in human dental plaque and is believed to enable some extraneous bacteria to initially colonize the human oral cavity. some current evidence indicates that streptococcus sanguis, an early colonizer of teeth, enhances subsequent colonization by porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, a bacterium associated with advanced adult periodontitis. in this study, selected strains of  p. gingivalis and s. sanguis were tested for their adherence activities in vitro. a differential filtration assay was devised in which one member of the test pair  was radiolabeled. heterogeneous aggregates that formed in mixed suspensions were  collected on polycarbonate filters (8-microns pore size) and were washed free of  individual bacteria and small homologous clumps. p. gingivalis 381, w50, jkg7, and 33277 adhered to s. sanguis g9b, m5, challis 6, and 38. p. gingivalis a7a1-28 did not adhere well to s. sanguis under these conditions. more precise measurements of intergeneric adherence were obtained with an alternative assay with radiolabeled p. gingivalis and an artificial dental plaque composed of s. sanguis coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated agarose beads. cnbr-agarose was selected as the supporting matrix for the plaque because it was uniformly and permanently coated with s. sanguis and because p. gingivalis had negligible adherence activity for streptococcus-free beads. p. gingivalis w50 grown to the early stationary phase adhered to s. sanguis-coated beads in higher numbers than  either midlogarithmic- or late-stationary-phase cells. intergeneric adherence was not inhibited or reversed by the presence of lactose or other monosaccharides or  disaccharides. pretreatment of either bacterium with trypsin or proteinase k reduced subsequent adherence by 86 to 100%. neuraminidase treatment of p. gingivalis caused 98% reduction of adherence, whereas similar treatment of s. sanguis caused only a 2% loss. preincubation of p. gingivalis at 60 degrees c for 30 min decreased subsequent adherence to s. sanguis-coated beads by 94%. adherence was reduced by 96% when bacteria were assayed while suspended in human  whole saliva or when pretreated with saliva and subsequently assayed in buffer. the concentration of whole human saliva required to inhibit 50% adherence in this assay was 23 micrograms per ml (1:200 dilution). suspension of the bacteria in normal rabbit serum resulted in 94% inhibition of adherence. these data indicate  that saliva and serum may be important host defense factors for controlling porphyromonas-streptococcus adherence.

AB  == pip501 is a member of a group of conjugative plasmids that are self-transmissible to a wide variety of streptococci as well as to other gram-positive bacteria. several pip501 restriction fragment deletion derivatives have been isolated and characterized. in this paper we describe one such derivative (pva1702) which was  conjugally proficient but had a limited host range. the loss of host range ability was seen as decreased conjugal transfer from enterococcus faecalis to streptococcus sanguis and was coincident with the deletion of a 4.5-kb dna fragment. transformation of pva1702 into s. sanguis also was dramatically reduced as compared to its progenitor, suggesting the 4.5-kb fragment encoded a factor(s) necessary for stable maintenance in this host but not in e. faecalis. these observations suggest that pip501 employs specific mechanisms enabling its maintenance in certain gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == sorbitol transport and metabolism by oral streptococci.
AB  == sorbitol transport by oral streptococci was mediated by a phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts). the transition of s. sanguis 160 from continuous growth on limiting glucose to limiting sorbitol resulted in induction of eiisor of the sorbitol-pts, as well as sorbitol-6-p dehydrogenase which converts sorbitol-6-p to fructose-6-p. sorbitol transport activity required the presence of a soluble sorbitol-specific component of the pts, tentatively identified as an enzyme iii for sorbitol (iiisor). in addition, the results indicated that sorbitol transport can be mediated by the ellglc, particularly in the presence of the sorbitol-specific component. s. sanguis 160 utilized sorbitol in a manner different from that reported for s mutans. growth on glucose by s. sanguis 160 was inhibited by the presence of sorbitol in the growth medium and sorbitol was utilized in the presence of glucose. in addition, pulses of glucose added to cultures growing on sorbitol resulted in expulsion of sorbitol from the cell. sorbitol was shown to interfere with glucose metabolism by s. sanguis 160 by inhibiting glucose transport by sorbitol-limited cells, but not by glucose-limited cells, and by inhibiting glycolytic activity with glucose as the  substrate. furthermore, sorbitol was an effective repressor of the glucose-pts, exhibiting negative regulation over synthesis of both eiiglc and a soluble component of the glucose-pts, presumably iiiglc. oral streptococci metabolize sorbitol to large amounts of formate and ethanol in addition to smaller amounts of lactate and acetate. the metabolism of sorbitol by s. sanguis and s. gordonii  was less sensitive to oxygen than that by s. mutans and s. mitis.

TI  == on salivary film formation and bacterial retention to solids. a methodological and experimental in vitro study.
AB  == a parallel-plate flow cell system was developed to assess individual and combined parameters relevant to oral microbial retention. in this system, internal reflection germanium prisms represented oral solid surfaces including tooth surfaces. the system used, allowed adsorbed protein films to be analyzed in situ  by multiple non-destructive surface analytical techniques, without provoking surface associated biofilms. using a range of biochemical and biophysical techniques, germanium prisms of medium critical surface tension were noted to accurately model film formation at tooth-saliva interfaces. a range of clinically relevant temperatures (22 and 37 degrees c), rinse shear rates (1 and 32 ml/min)  and critical surface tensions (high, medium and low) were systematically tested in the flow-cell system for their influence, if any, on salivary microbial retention from whole human saliva. comparisons of the interfacial organization of adsorbed material were made between human parotid (hps) and submandibular-sublingual (hsmsl) salivas. the influence of these salivary secretions was also tested on the retention capacities of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus salivarius. microbial retention was found to be significantly dependent on initial critical surface tensions and rinse flow rates, but not to be affected by tested temperatures. when compared to prisms of low and high critical surface tension, medium critical surface tension prisms retained the highest numbers of microorganisms. no statistically verified morphological selectivity was observed in the retained microbial populations. when the interfacial organizations of hps and hsmsl were evaluated at low- and medium energy surfaces in the absence and presence the streptococci, comparatively thinner and denser films with pronounced bacterial retention was noted for hps on prisms of low critical surface tension. in the presence of saliva or salivary fractions, no difference in retention capacities was observed between the tested  bacterial strains. the data suggest that in the presence of saliva, physico-chemical and mechanical factors have a major influence on the short term  microbial retention to solid surfaces. the amount of salivary proteins being initially retained to a material also seems to be more directly related to the critical surface tension quality of the solid than to the type of bacterial strain present in suspension. the empirical critical surface tension of a material is thus a useful predictor of both microbial retention capacities and primary interactions between saliva and solid surfaces.

TI  == analogies in the two-dimensional spatial arrangement of adsorbed proteins and adhering bacteria: bovine serum albumin and streptococcus sanguis 12.
AB  == neither proteins nor bacteria adsorb or adhere homogeneously to a substratum surface. the final two-dimensional spatial arrangement depends on a complicated interplay between protein-protein (bacterium-bacterium) and protein (bacterium)-substratum interactions and the prevailing hydrodynamic conditions. in this paper, results are presented of two separate experiments in which bovine  serum albumin (bsa) was adsorbed to, or streptococcus sanguis 12 was deposited on substrata with different wettabilities in a search for analogies in the two-dimensional spatial arrangement of the absorbed proteins and adhering bacteria. the spatial arrangement of adsorbed bsa, visualized by transmission electron microscopy on replicas of the surface, was island-like on substrata with a low wettability and well distributed on substrata with a high wettability. the  spatial arrangement of adhering s. sanguis 12 was observed directly by light microscopy during the experiment and showed a relatively large collection of near-neighbour sites on the low wettability substrata compared with the high wettability substrata. thus, it seems that the occurrence of island-like structures in protein adsorption is concurrent with a large collection of near-neighbour sites in bacterial adhesion. as a possible explanation for the above analogy, it is suggested that proteins or bacteria are insufficiently immobilized on low wettability substrata owing to weak interaction forces, and they can move over the substratum surface to yield the two-dimensional spatial arrangements observed.

TI  == antimicrobial proteins in human unstimulated whole saliva in relation to each other, and to measures of health status, dental plaque accumulation and composition.
AB  == saliva antimicrobial proteins may interact in a common system to influence the oral ecology. clinical studies of antimicrobial protein action thus may require a multiple-protein approach. multivariate statistical methods have been used to describe possible patterns of interaction for lysozyme, lactoferrin, salivary peroxidase and secretory iga in stimulated parotid saliva. however, oral microbes are most likely to encounter antimicrobial proteins in mixed resting saliva. relationships among levels of lysozyme, lactoferrin, salivary peroxidase, and secretory iga therefore were investigated in whole saliva from 216 subjects, and  an attempt made to relate interperson variation in those proteins to differences  in health and status, and dental plaque accumulation and composition. all proteins were significantly (alpha = 0.05) correlated with each other (r = 0.38-0.52, p less than 0.001). there was only one axis of common variation among  proteins, and that axis was significantly correlated (p less than 0.001) with total protein (r = 0.84) and flow rate (r = -0.56). that pattern deviated from the previous finding that proteins of acinar origin tended to vary independently  from proteins of ductal origin in stimulated parotid saliva. the difference between parotid and whole saliva may reflect constitutive secretion of all proteins at low levels of stimulation. common variation of unstimulated saliva proteins suggests that antimicrobial actions can be compared in subjects at population extremes. there were no significant associations between antimicrobial proteins in whole saliva and measures of health status or plaque accumulation. however, the proportions of streptococcus sanguis were significantly correlated with lysozyme (r = -0.26), lactoferrin (r = -0.34), peroxidase (r = -0.30), total protein (r = -0.37), flow rate (r = 0.24) and principal-components scores (r = -0.33) in a subset of subjects (n = 85) where commercial biochemical tests were used to supplement species identification by colony morphology. those findings may indicate that saliva antimicrobial proteins can affect the composition of dental plaque.

TI  == oxygen and the sugar metabolism in oral streptococci.
AB  == streptococci have several ways of adapting themselves to the constantly changing  environment of the human oral cavity. this paper discusses the adaptation of sugar metabolism to variations in oxygen levels. in all streptococci the embden-meyerhof pathway of glycolysis works under aerobic as well as anaerobic conditions, but pyruvate is converted into different metabolic end products depending on the oxygen levels. under anaerobic conditions all streptococci form  formate, acetate, and ethanol by a pyruvate formate-lyase pathway. if sugar is in excess, they also form lactate using a lactate dehydrogenase. under aerobic conditions pyruvate formate-lyase is inactivated. this enzyme is then replaced by a pyruvate oxidase in some streptococci and by a pyruvate dehydrogenase in others. the characteristics of these enzymes help streptococci like s. sanguis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, and s. mitis to compete successfully with other bacteria  in those sites of the oral cavity that are freely exposed to saliva, while mutans streptococci have to colonize anaerobic sites such as those in-between the teeth  and in the occlusal fissures of the teeth.

AB  == in this paper, secretory iga adsorption from a single component siga solution and from human whole saliva onto human enamel and artificial solid substrata with various surface free energies was studied as a function of time. elisa indicated  that screening or displacement of adsorbed siga by other salivary proteins occurred only on low surface free energy substrata, not on high surface free energy substrata such as enamel. in addition, the adhesion of three oral streptococcal strains (streptococcus mitis bms, s. sanguis 12, and s. mutans ns), also having widely different surface free energies, to siga-coated surfaces was studied. the adhesion of all three streptococcal strains was significantly reduced in the presence of a siga coating. however, ranking the adhesion data with respect to the various substrata revealed a similar order to that in the case of uncoated substrata, indicating that substratum properties were at least partly transferred by the adsorbed protein film to the interface with adhering micro-organisms. for s. sanguis 12 and s. mitis bms, adhesion decreased proportionally with the amounts of siga detected by elisa, but for s. mutans ns such relations with the amounts of siga detected on the protein-coated substrata  were not found. thus, for s. mutans ns a specific antibody effect seems to exist  in addition to a non-specific protein effect like that observed for s. sanguis 12 and s. mitis bms.

TI  == platelet-interactive products of streptococcus sanguis protoplasts.
AB  == to isolate a more native, platelet-interactive macromolecule (class ii antigen) of streptococcus sanguis, cultured protoplasts were used as a source. protoplasts were optimally prepared from fresh washed cells by digestion with 80 u of mutanolysin per ml for 75 min at 37 degrees c while osmotically stabilized in 26% (wt/vol) raffinose. osmotically stabilized forms were surrounded by a 9-nm bilaminar membrane, as shown by transmission electron microscopy. protoplasts were cultured in chemically defined synthetic medium and osmotically stabilized by ammonium chloride. spent culture media were harvested daily for 7 days. each day, soluble proteins were isolated from media, preincubated with platelet-rich plasma, and tested for inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by s. sanguis cells. products released from s. sanguis protoplasts and reactive with an anti-class ii antigen immunoaffinity matrix were able to inhibit s. sanguis-induced platelet aggregation. as resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, anti-class ii-reactive protoplast products included silver-stained bands of 67, 79, 115, 216, and 248 kda. the 115-kda protein fraction was isolated by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. this form of the class ii antigen contained n-formylmethionine at its amino terminus. rhamnose constituted 18.2% of the total residual dry weight and nearly half of its carbohydrate content. diester phosphorus constituted 1% of this fraction. after trypsinization of the protoplast products from either preparation, a 65-kda protein fragment was recovered. this protoplast protein fragment and the s. sanguis cell-derived 65-kda class ii antigen, previously implicated in the induction of platelet aggregation, were shown to be functionally and immunologically identical.

TI  == purification and characterization of an outer membrane protein adhesin from haemophilus parainfluenzae hp-28.
AB  == outer membranes were isolated from haemophilus parainfluenzae hp-28 by a mild extraction method followed by sephadex g-150 gel filtration chromatography. the first peak (pool 1) recovered contained an activity which inhibited adherence of  hp-28 cells to saliva-coated spheroidal hydroxyapatite. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of pool 1 revealed a dominant protein band of 34 kda. the sds-page-purified 34-kda protein was excised from the gel and used for antibody preparation in rabbits. the antiserum produced was analyzed by immunoblot and was shown to be monospecific for the 34-kda protein. anti-34-kda protein antibody was purified from the rabbit antiserum by protein a-sepharose 6mb affinity chromatography. this antibody was then cross-linked to protein a-sepharose 6mb to construct a second affinity column. the 34-kda proteins were purified from outer membranes by this affinity chromatography. the 34-kda protein was homogeneous, as confirmed by sds-page, isoelectric focusing, and reverse-phase chromatography analyses. fab and fc fragments of the purified anti-34-kda protein antibodies were prepared by papain  digestion, followed by carboxymethyl cellulose chromatography. fab fragments from the anti-34-kda protein antibody and the affinity-purified 34-kda protein both showed significant inhibition of parent h. parainfluenzae hp-28 cell adherence to experimental salivary pellicle and to streptococcus sanguis sa-1.

TI  == prevention of gram-positive and candida albicans infections using teicoplanin and fluconazole: a randomized study in neutropenic children.
AB  == we have shown that the combination of teicoplanin (t) and ceftriaxone (c) given once daily as first-line empirical antimicrobial therapy is very effective (85%)  and safe in febrile neutropenic children (icaac, 1988). like others (icaac, 1989) we have stressed the new life-threatening problems with streptococcus mitis and strep. sanguis. considering the regular sensitivity of gram-positive organisms to t, it is possible that the introduction of the glycopeptide at the onset of aplasia may be helpful. the high incidence of fungal infection or superinfection  supports the routine use of an effective antifungal agent when fever is still present or relapse occurs. our study was designed to assess the prevention of (1) staphylococcal and streptococcal infections using t when the central catheter is  being placed, and (2) candida infection by the simultaneous use of a new anti-mycotic agent fluconazole (f) administered once-daily. patients were randomized into two arms of the study. arm a received t 6 mg/kg/d and f 3 mg/kg/d starting when the catheter was put in place. if fever occurred, c 50 mg/kg/d and  amikacin (a) 15 mg/kg/d were added and t increased to 10 mg/kg/d. if a febrile relapse occurred, amphotericin b was added. in arm b the combination of the three agents t 10 mg/kg/d, c 50 mg/kg/d and a 15 mg/kg/d was started only if there was  fever. amphotericin b was used in febrile relapses. forty-six patients were eligible (23 in each arm; no statistically significant differences between the two groups). the mean age of the patients was 8 years and mean duration of aplasia 23 and 24 d. results were as follows: arm a the duration of t + f alone was 10 d, 22 patients had a febrile episode with 1 gram-positive, 11 gram-negative and one candida strain isolated in eight patients. c + a were effective in 72% of these patients. there were no deaths. in arm b, fever occurred in all patients during the first 6 d, with eight gram-positive and six gram-negative organisms isolated in nine patients. c + t + a were successful in 83% of patients. a bacterial superinfection was documented in four patients, candida superinfection in seven patients and one patient died from candida parakrusei septicaemia. when the total amount of c and a used in both arms was compared, there was a reduction in 20% of the two agents in arm a, but t was equivalent in both arms. treatment was well tolerated in both arms.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == influence of hydrophobicity on oligopeptide utilization by oral streptococci.
AB  == the growth responses of streptococcus mutans va-29r, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556, and streptococcus mitior nih to hydrophilic and hydrophobic peptides obtained following isopropanol fractionation of trypticase were compared. although the two fractions contained peptides of similar molecular size, differences were observed with respect to amino acid compositions. s. mutans va-29r showed a pronounced difference in growth response to hydrophilic vs. hydrophobic peptides. while growth of this micro-organism on hydrophilic peptides was indistinguishable from that on unfractionated trypticase, only very slow growth occurred on the hydrophobic peptides. s. sanguis atcc 10556 and s. mitior  nih also displayed some selectivity, as evidenced by their faster relative growth rates on hydrophilic, as compared with hydrophobic, peptides. the results of this study support the conclusion that the properties of the substrate, as defined by  its amino acid composition, may be more important than molecular size as a factor influencing recognition and subsequent utilization of oligopeptides as sources of amino acids for growth by these three oral streptococci.

TI  == in vitro survival of bacteroides intermedius in five transport media, alone or in the presence of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the survival rate of bacteroides intermedius was first tested in monoculture, and streptococcus sanguis was then added in 5 different transport media; 2 nonnutritious media, the viability-preserving medium of the university of goteborg no. iv (vmg iv), reduced transport fluid (rtf), and 3 nutritious media,  thioglycolate medium (tg), peptone yeast extract medium (py) and py medium with 1% glucose (pyg). all manipulations were carried out in an anaerobic chamber. after a given transport time (6 or 24 h) aliquots were spread on plates containing solid py medium by means of an automated spiral system device, thus permitting counts after incubation. the slight variations in the counts of b. intermedius in monoculture, not exceeding 0.5 log10 in the 5 media tested, indicated its good survival capability, i.e. at least 24 h. by contrast, when s.  sanguis was added, it was only possible to use nutritious media such as py or tg  for 6 h. in the glocose-containing media (pyg, tg), the multiplication of rapidly glucose-fermenting microorganisms such as streptococci influenced the b. intermedius survival rate. therefore, the transport time for oral microbiological samples needs to be reduced as much as possible. the use of excessively rich media (particularly media containing a high level of glucose) should be avoided.

TI  == association of selected bacteria with the lesions of root surface caries.
AB  == plaque from the root surfaces of 165 subjects (mean age 65.5 years, 22-26 teeth/subject) was analysed for specific bacteria. five subject groups were defined: a (dmfs 16.4), b (dmfs 55.9), c1 (dmfs 55.6), c2 (dmfs 57.0) and c3 (dmfs 48.1). groups c1 and c2 had unrestored root surface lesions; group a, b and c3 were free of unrestored root caries and differed in their coronal caries experience. streptococcus mutans was isolated more frequently from the root lesions in groups c1 and c2 than from intact root surfaces in group a. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis 1 and streptococcus sanguis were isolated more frequently from group a. the percentage contribution that s. mutans made to plaque from lesions in groups c1 and c2 was higher than that from plaque  in group a and actinomyces viscosus serovar 2 contributed more to plaque in group c1 than in samples from group a. the percentage counts of lactobacillus in plaque from lesions in groups c1 and c2 were higher than those from intact roots in groups a, b, and c3. subjects were also grouped on the presence of lactobacillus  and s. mutans in plaque samples. samples with both organisms (n = 17) showed significantly higher isolation frequencies of specific strains of s. mitis 1 and  also a. viscosus serovar 2 compared with samples of plaque containing s. mutans or lactobacillus. actinomyces naeslundii serovar 1 was not isolated from samples  containing both s. mutans and lactobacillus. the results confirm an association of s. mutans and lactobacillus with root surface lesions and suggest a relationship between lesions and a. viscosus serovar 2.

TI  == the utilization of casein and amino acids by streptococcus sanguis p4a7 in continuous culture.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis p4a7 was grown in glucose limited conditions in continuous  culture at ph 7.0 in a chemically defined medium containing either free amino acids or casein as the organic nitrogen source. apart from aspartate and threonine, which were poorly utilized at the higher dilution rates, all amino acids in the free-amino-acid medium were utilized to various extents. at the higher dilution rates, aspartate actually increased in concentration, probably due to deamidation of asparagine. the amino acid most utilized at all dilution rates was arginine, with up to 99% of the amino acid being consumed. both casein  and its alpha s1-casein fraction supported growth at a level only slightly lower  than that obtained with the free-amino-acid medium, provided that either cysteine or thioglycollate was present. with the exception of tyrosine, nearly all of the  amino acyl residues of alpha s1-casein were utilized to some degree. in general,  the higher the concentration of each amino acid in the medium (whether free or as part of alpha s1-casein) the higher the extent of utilization by s. sanguis p4a7. only 50% of the arginyl residues (0.16 mm) of alpha s1-casein were utilized compared with 99% of free arginine (1.5 mm) under similar conditions, suggesting  that only 50% of the alpha s1-casein arginine was accessible to the organism.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == this study describes the predominant cultivable microflora of three-week-old plaque samples obtained from human enamel sites, on the basis of microbial identification of over 9000 fresh isolates. lower removable appliances, on which  were mounted enamel sections and slabs, were worn by five young adult subjects under three experimental protocols. these were (1) 'normal' plaque conditions, (2) extra-oral sucrose applications nine times daily, and (3) inoculation of each subject's own mutans streptococci onto the enamel test sites and sucrose applications, as described above. with the exception of slightly higher proportions of gram-negative bacilli associated with slab plaque following sucrose application, no significant differences in percentage or absolute counts  of organisms were found between normal and sucrose plaques. the inoculation of mutans streptococci, combined with extra-oral sucrose applications, was associated with significantly higher percentages and absolute mean counts of both mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, and lower proportions of s. sanguis and s.  oralis. although the isolation frequency of mutans streptococci increased in all  subjects and the overall mean proportion rose following inoculation, considerable inter-subject variation was seen in mean percentage counts of these organisms isolated from the three-week plaque samples.

AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == aggregation of oral bacteria by human salivary mucins in comparison to salivary and gastric mucins of animal origin.
AB  == seventeen strains of oral bacteria of the genera actinomyces (5), bacteroides (3), and streptococcus (9) were tested for aggregation by the human whole salivary mucin fraction (hwsm) in comparison to three types of animal mucin preparations from submandibular glands of cow (bsm) and sheep (osm), and from the stomach of pig (pgm). considerable variation was seen with respect to the rate and titer of aggregation induced by these mucins. the aggregating activity of hwsm varied widely among the different bacterial strains. the bacteroides group showed hardly any induced aggregation, whereas the final aggregation titers varied for s. sanguis (3 strains) between 12 and 48, for s. oralis (3 strains) between 6 and 48, for the s. mutans group (3 strains) between 6 and 96, and for the five actinomyces strains even between 6 and 192. for a particular strain, similar differences in titer were seen between the four mucins. for a human salivary mucin (mg-2) it has been described that sialic acid in the sequence neuac (alpha 2,3)gal(beta 1,3)galnac- was specifically involved in the interaction with s. sanguis strains, in contrast to s. rattus bht. our results, however, indicate that this sugar sequence is not a prerequisite for the aggregation of s. sanguis, as animal mucins, devoid of this structure, were equally well or even better capable of inducing aggregation. on the other hand, desialization of bsm and osm largely abolished their aggregating capability towards s. rattus bht. moreover, it was found that bsm and osm, which are comparable with respect to their major oligosaccharide structure, show considerable differences in aggregating activity towards the same bacterial strain.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == an investigation into the mechanism of protection by local passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies against streptococcus mutans.
AB  == local oral passive immunization with streptococcus mutans-specific monoclonal antibody (mab) (guy's 13) prevented recolonization by indigenous s. mutans in human volunteers who had first been treated with a conventional antibacterial agent (chlorhexidine). the f(ab')2 fragment of the mab was as protective as the intact immunoglobulin g, but the fab fragment of the molecule failed to prevent recolonization of s. mutans. in subjects receiving the mab fab fragment, s. mutans levels in dental plaque and saliva reappeared at a similar rate to that found in sham-immunized subjects who received either saline or a nonprotective mab. in vitro, mab had no bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal effect on s. mutans. however, s. mutans grown in the presence of either intact immunoglobulin g mab or the f(ab')2 fragment formed very long chains, which resulted in clumping of the cells. s. mutans grown with either saline or the mab fab fragment formed significantly shorter chains, more characteristic of streptococcal growth in liquid media. the results suggest that the two binding sites of the mab molecule  may be an essential feature for preventing streptococcal colonization but that the ability to bind to phagocytes and activate complement which resides in the fc fragment is not essential. protection against colonization by s. mutans lasting up to 2 years was observed in immunized subjects, although mab was applied over a period of only 3 weeks. furthermore, functional mab was detected up to 3 days following application of mab to the teeth. the long-term protection could not be  accounted for by a persistence of mab on the tooth surface, and we have suggested that it may be due to a shift in the balance of the oral flora which discouraged  recolonization by s. mutans. however, examination of the proportions of streptococcus sanguis and veillonella species in the recolonization experiments failed to reveal a significant change in the proportions of either organism, which returned to approximately the preexperimental levels in both the immunized  and control groups. these findings confirm the in vivo functional specificity of  the mab to s. mutans but are not consistent with the suggestion that s. sanguis or veillonella take over the niche vacated by s. mutans, unless the shift in the  proportion of these organisms cannot be detected by the method used.

TI  == further in vivo studies on the plaque-inhibiting effect of chlorhexidine and its  binding mechanisms.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the relative importance of chemical groups in the oral cavity which bind chlorhexidine of clinical significance. this was performed by clinical experiments where a test panel of 11 individuals rinsed with chlorhexidine at ph 7, ph 5.5, and ph 3. rinsing with 0.02 m edta was performed prior to the chlorhexidine rinse, because this procedure has been shown to enhance the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine in  vitro. however, pre-rinses with edta did not increase the clinical effect of chlorhexidine. bacteriologic tests showed comparable antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine at ph 7 and ph 3. mouthrinses of ph 7 and ph 5.5 had comparable plaque-inhibiting effects, whereas the effect of a rinse of ph 3 was not different from that of the placebo. this finding is interpreted to suggest that primary phosphate (pk about 2) is an important receptor site for chlorhexidine, whereas secondary phosphate (pk = 7.0) is of negligible importance. previous studies have clearly shown that phosphate binds chlorhexidine. the lack of clinical effect at ph 3 is probably due to precipitation of salivary proteins by  hydrogen ions, making primary phosphate groups unavailable for interaction with chlorhexidine.

TI  == utilization of nitrogenous compounds by oral bacteria.
AB  == in terms of the crucial acid-base balance in dental plaque, the bacterial catabolism of nitrogenous compounds, such as peptides and amino acids, is of importance because the end-products can raise plaque ph. of particular significance is the fermentation of arginine by bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis, a numerically important plaque organism. aspects of the uptake of this amino acid were studied and it was also shown the organism can obtain arginine from small peptides, since it possesses cell-associated exo-peptidases. furthermore, it could grow in media containing whole protein (casein), or one of  its fractions, as the sole source of organic nitrogen. the studies thus showed that s. sanguis is well equipped, in terms of endo- and exo-peptidase activities, to obtain the metabolically important arginine from whole protein. it is suggested that knowledge of this type should lead to a better understanding of overall plaque metabolism--of relevance to both cariogenic and periodontopathic plaques.

AB  == the adhesion of streptococcus sanguis to hydroxylapatite is a process involving several adhesins and receptors. binding isotherms and scatchard plots of the adhesion suggest that cooperative interactions occur at low cell densities. it was found that sulfolane, a hydrophobic-bond diluent, was capable of inhibiting the cooperative adhesion of s. sanguis to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite beads. sodium thiocyanate, a chaotropic agent, inhibited not only cooperative adhesion,  but also the adhesion thought to result from noncooperative interactions. it is suggested that strong chaotropic agents may not only inhibit adhesin-receptor complexes, but also may influence the secondary/tertiary structures of interacting species.

AB  == intergeneric coaggregation of streptococcus gordonii (s. sanguis) pk488 and actinomyces naeslundii pk606 was studied by using coaggregation-defective (cog-)  mutants of both strains. a streptococcal protein of 38 kilodaltons was identified with anti-s. gordonii serum absorbed with cog- cells of the streptococcus. absorbed immunoglobulin g specifically blocked coaggregation of the streptococcus-actinomyces pair but did not affect the coaggregation of the streptococcus with other coaggregation partners. the 38-kilodalton protein was found in the supernatant of mild sonicated cell suspensions and was extracted from whole cells with sodium barbital or with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (chaps). an immunoreactive protein of the same size was found in sonicated cell supernatants  of several other oral streptococci that also coaggregated with a. naeslundii pk606. inhibition of s. gordonii pk488-a. naeslundii pk606 coaggregation was not  observed with any of 16 different sugars tested. we propose that a functionally similar adhesin that mediates coaggregations with a. naeslundii pk606 is expressed by several species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == the effects of dyadic combinations of endodontic medicaments on microbial growth  inhibition.
AB  == in recent years dyadic combinations of endodontic medicaments have been used increasingly in clinical pediatric dentistry with little regard to the possibility of pharmacological antagonism of the components. in this investigation, a microbial growth inhibition assay was used to determine changes  in antimicrobial activity in dyadic mixtures of endodontic medicaments. the combinations assayed were ledermix (corticosteroid-antibiotic) and calyxl (calcium hydroxide), ledermix and kri (iodoform), kri and calyxl, and formocresol and eugenol. all these compounds have antibacterial activity when used individually. in the dyadic combinations assayed, results showed that adding calcium hydroxide to another antibiotic preparation has deleterious effects on growth inhibition, and combining any two antimicrobial medicaments produces no additive or synergistic effects. it is concluded that it may be clinically advantageous to use endodontic medicaments in the dyadic combinations shown in this investigation.

AB  == eighty-one human subjects completed a double-blind study which examined the effects of a 0.3% triclosan/2% gantrez copolymer/0.243% sodium fluoride dentifrice on the microflora of supragingival dental plaque. subjects were divided into an experimental group which performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice and a control group which also performed  normal oral hygiene with the same dentifrice minus the triclosan/copolymer. at baseline, 10 weeks, and 28 weeks, supragingival dental plaque was collected from  buccal and lingual surfaces of the four first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase contrast microscopy, 2) actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces species, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and wolinella recta by immunofluorescence microscopy, and 3) lactobacillus, yeast, enterics, staphylococcus, aerobes and anaerobes by bacterial culture. after 28 weeks' use of their respective dentifrices, changes in the supragingival plaque microflora of the subjects were similar between the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group and the control dentifrice group, except for statistically significant reductions in fusiforms, spirochetes and staphylococci and significant increases in s. sanguis in the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group, as compared to the control dentifrice group. the subject population was unusual in the presence of enteric species and anaerobes found in supragingival plaque sites. this study indicates that the use of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan and 2% gantrez copolymer over an extended period of time (28 weeks) does not result in shifts in the microflora of supragingival plaque favoring the growth of either opportunistic or pathogenic bacterial species.

TI  == comparison of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis receptors for human  salivary agglutinin.
AB  == oral streptococci vary in their susceptibility to salivary agglutinin-mediated aggregation. to understand the molecular basis of this specificity, the structure and function of receptors for agglutinin from streptococcus mutans kpsk2 (msl-1)  and streptococcus sanguis m5 (ssp-5) were compared. immunological screening of an s. mutans kpsk2 genomic dna library yielded two identical clones expressing a streptococcal protein that co-migrated with a 220 kda peptide in sds extracts from this organism. this protein inhibited agglutinin-mediated aggregation of s.  mutans kpsk2 in a dose-dependent manner. the msl-1 gene is homologous to the s. mutans spap and pac genes although single base substitutions alter several amino  acids. msl-1 is also similar to the agglutinin receptor (ssp-5) cloned from s. sanguis m5. all three proteins, msl-1, p1, and ssp-5 share at least one epitope since monoclonal and polyclonal anti-ssp-5 antibodies react with both msl-1 and p1. however, other monoclonal antibodies are specific for ssp-5 and appear to react with a peptide domain exhibiting little homology to msl-1 or p1. sugar inhibition studies showed that agglutinin-mediated aggregation of s. mutans kpsk2 was most potently inhibited by fucose and lactose. sialic acid, a potent inhibitor of s. sanguis aggregation, had no effect on the interaction of agglutinin with s. mutans kpsk2. these results suggest that while the msl-1 and ssp-5 proteins are genetically and immunologically related, their specificity for binding sites on agglutinin differs.

TI  == structure of a streptococcal adhesin carbohydrate receptor.
AB  == interactions between complementary protein and carbohydrate structures on different genera of human oral bacteria have been implicated in the formation of  dental plaque. the carbohydrate receptor on streptococcus sanguis h1 (one of the  primary colonizing species) that is specific for the adhesin on capnocytophaga ochracea atcc 33596 (a secondary colonizer) has been isolated from the streptococcal cell wall, purified, and structurally characterized. the hexasaccharide repeating unit of the polysaccharide was purified by reverse-phase, amino-bonded silica, and gel permeation high performance liquid chromatography. earlier studies established that the repeating unit was a hexasaccharide composed of rhamnose, galactose, and glucose in the ration of 2:3:1, respectively. in the present study, determination of absolute configuration by gas chromatography of the trimethylsilyl (+)-2-butyl glycosides  revealed that the rhamnose residues were of the l configuration while the hexoses were all d. 252californium plasma desorption mass spectrometry of the native, the acetylated and the reduced and acetylated hexasaccharide determined that the molecular mass of the native hexasaccharide was 959, and that the 2 rhamnose residues were linked to each other at the nonreducing terminus of the linear molecule. methylation analysis revealed the positions of the glycosidic linkages  in the hexasaccharide and showed that a galactose residue was present at the reducing end. the structural characterization of the hexasaccharide was completed by one and two dimensional 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy. complete 1h and 13c assignments for each glycosyl residue were established by two-dimensional (1h,1h) correlation spectroscopy, homonuclear hartmann-hahn, and (13c,1h) correlation experiments. the configurations of the glycosidic linkages were inferred from the chemical shifts and coupling constants of the anomeric 1h and 13c resonances. the sequence of the glycosyl residues was determined by a heteronuclear multiple bond correlation experiment. these data show that the structure of the hexasaccharide  repeating unit derived from the cell wall polysaccharide of s. sanguis h1 is: alpha-l-rhap-(1----2)-alpha-l-rhap-(1----3)-alpha-d-galp- (1----3)-beta-d-galp-(1----4)-beta-d-glcp-(1----3)-alpha/beta-d-gal.

TI  == purification and partial characterization of a 65-kda platelet aggregation-associated protein antigen from the surface of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == cells of streptococcus sanguis express a collagen-like immunodeterminant (class ii antigen) on their cell walls that induces aggregation of platelets in plasma.  these platelet aggregation-associated proteins (paaps) are recovered in cell-free preparations obtained from cells of s. sanguis after 5 min of sonic or limited trypsin treatment. pretreatment of platelet-rich plasma with these soluble preparations selectively inhibits platelet aggregation in response to s. sanguis  cells. a paap antigen was isolated and purified from minimal tryptic digests of s. sanguis cells using (i) immunoaffinity chromatography or (ii) gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. a monospecific rabbit antiserum was prepared against paap (from procedure ii) and used to verify identity with paap fragments  in different preparations. criteria of purity included single precipitins in immunoelectrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, western immunoblot, and cooh (lys)- and nh2 (pro)-terminal analyses. the 65-kda (p65) antigen isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography had 50-fold greater specific inhibitory activity in s. sanguis-induced prp aggregation than the original tryptic digest and about 1.4 times that recovered by sequential column chromatography. amino acids of the p65  paap fragment constituted 89.5% of the total dry weight, with glycine, lysine, and glutamic acid predominant. lesser amounts of proline were also noted. monosaccharides, including glucose and galactose, comprised 4.0% of the total. a  platelet interactive determinant of p65 was localized to a 23-kda tryptic fragment after further trypsin treatment. amino acids of this 23-kda fragment constituted 99.8% of the total dry weight. in their native state on the cell wall of platelet-interactive strains of s. sanguis, platelet aggregation-associated proteins are probably assembled on fibrils as polyvalent agonists.

TI  == penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci have obtained altered penicillin-binding protein genes from penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == penicillin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae possess altered forms of penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) with decreased affinity for penicillin. the pbp2b genes of these strains have a mosaic structure, consisting of regions that  are very similar to those in penicillin-sensitive strains, alternating with regions that are highly diverged. penicillin-resistant strains of viridans groups streptococci (e.g., s. sanguis and s. oralis) that produce altered pbps have also been reported. the pbp2b genes of two penicillin-resistant clinical isolates of s. sanguis were identical in sequence to the mosaic class b pbp2b genes found in  penicillin-resistant serotype 23 strains of s. pneumoniae. emergence of penicillin resistance appears to have occurred by the horizontal transfer of an altered pbp2b gene from penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae into s. sanguis. the pbp2b genes of three penicillin-resistant s. oralis strains were similar to the mosaic class b pbp2b gene of penicillin-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae but possessed an additional block of diverged sequence. penicillin resistance in s. oralis has also probably arisen by horizontal transfer of this variant form of the class b mosaic pbp2b gene from a penicillin-resistant strain of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == the influence of sucralose on bacterial metabolism.
AB  == sucralose (1',4',6' trideoxy-trichloro-galactosucrose) is a nontoxic, intensely sweet sucrose derivative that has been shown to be non-cariogenic in experimental animals. the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral bacteria could utilize sucralose. sucralose, as a sole carbon source, was unable to support growth of ten strains of oral bacteria and dental plaque. when sucrolose  was incorporated into a liquid medium containing glucose or sucrose, all organisms tested displayed similar ph falls, compared with controls. the incorporation of 126 mmol/l sucralose into glucose agar medium caused total inhibition of growth of streptococcus sobrinus 6715-17, streptococcus sanguis 10904, streptococcus sanguis challis, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus wvu627. sucralose had no effect on ips production. sucralose was not bound to, nor taken up by, cells. sucralose inhibited the formation of glucan and fructan polymers in proportion to the sucralose-to-enzyme ratio, but independent  of the sucrose concentration in the assay mixture. no radioactive polymer was formed from 14c-u-sucralose added to mixtures containing glucosyltransferase (gtf) or fructosyl-transferase (ftf). inhibition of gtf and ftf by sucralose was  removed following dialysis of the enzyme/sucralose mixture. these results show that sucralose was not utilized by the oral bacteria tested and that the inhibitory effect of sucralose on gtf and ftf was non-competitive and reversible. the results further support the concept that sucralose is non-cariogenic.

AB  == this is the first report of high-level gentamicin resistance in a group b streptococcus. strain b128 of serotype ii was isolated from an infected leg wound in 1987. b128 was resistant to high levels of gentamicin as well as of all other  available aminoglycosides and was also resistant to tetracyclines. no bactericidal synergism was found between ampicillin or vancomycin and any of these aminoglycosides. gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline resistance determinants transferred by conjugation into a plasmid-free group b streptococcus recipient at a frequency of 10(-8) to 10(-9) transconjugants per donor cell. no transconjugants were detected when streptococci of groups a, c, and g, streptococcus sanguis, or enterococcus faecalis was used as a recipient. no plasmids were detected in b128 or in any of the four transconjugants tested. by dna-dna hybridization, homology was detected between gene aac6/aph2, of e. faecalis origin, and a 2.4-kilobase hindiii chromosomal fragment of b128; homology to the genes aph3 and aade, of e. faecalis origin, was found with hindiii chromosomal fragments of the same size (3.0 kilobases). strains like b128, which potentially can be responsible for severe neonatal infections, are of great clinical concern, since there are to date no antibiotic combinations exhibiting bactericidal synergism against them.

TI  == sialidase activity of the "streptococcus milleri group" and other viridans group  streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. sialidase was produced by all strains of streptococcus oralis and s. intermedius and by a majority of s. mitis strains. s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s.  gordonii, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, "s. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.

TI  == [initial-plaque forming ability of glucosyltransferases from streptococcus mutans serotype c strain].
AB  == in order to clarify functional roles of extracellular glucosyltransferases (gtases) from s. mutans serotype c in initial stage of plaque formation, gtase-i  and gtase-s were purified from culture fluids of strain ps 14. and an ability of  these gtases to enhance cellular attachment of oral streptococci was investigated using 3h labeled resting cells of s. sanguis challis and s. milleri is 57. the results were as follows: 1) from culture fluids of strain ps 14 grown in a m 4 medium supplemented with 1% ammonium sulfate, gtase-i was purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, cm-cellurose column chromatography and toyopearl hw-55 gelfiltration. also, gtase-s was purified by the method of baba et al from the culture fluids of strain ps 14 grown in a dialyzed bhi medium. purified gtase-i and gtase-s were almost homogeneous, and had a molecular size of 160 kda and 145  kda respectively (by sds-page). 2) sucrose-dependent attachment of s. sanguis cells to experimental pellicles was markedly enhanced by the addition of crude gtase in saliva. this fact was conformed by a scanning electron microscopic observation of the attachment cells. such enhanced attachment necessitated a long-term incubation (greater than 10 h) of the cells in the presence of sucrose, suggesting that it is correlated to de novo glucan synthesis. 3) purified gtase-i also had an ability to enhance the cellular attachment of s. sanguis cells as well as crude gtase, while purified gtase-s didn't have. neither crude enzyme, gtase-i nor gtase-s have an ability to enhance significantly the cellular attachment of s. milleri cells. however, s. milleri pretreated with the preparations containing gtase-s gained the ability to attach to experimental pellicles prepared from saliva supplemented with gtase-i. these results suggest that the cellular attachment system mediated by enzymatic action (s) of gtase (s) from serotype c s. mutans be present and function in the first stage of plaque formation.

AB  == the gene coding for a dextranase activity of arthrobacter cb-8, named dex gene, was isolated and cloned into escherichia coli and into streptococcus sanguis. the gene library was screened by transparent halo formation around the colonies grown on agar medium containing blue dextran. dna fragment consisting of about 3,200 base pairs was prepared for further cloning procedures. dextranase activity was detected in the periplasmic space of e. coli clones, using puc19, pva 838 and their derivatives. dex gene was also introduced into s. sanguis challis using pva 838, a plasmid that is able to replicate in both e. coli and s. sanguis. but the  clones did not express the dex gene. for the expression of dex gene in s. sanguis, a new shuttle vector was constructed, which contained the promoter region of a glucosyltransferase gene from s. mutans as well as the terminator region of ribosomal rna from e. coli. the plasmid was designated pmnk. using pmnk as vector, dex gene was expressed in s. sanguis. dextranase activity was detected in the cellular fraction of the clones.

TI  == in vitro adherence of microorganisms to denture base resin with different surface texture.
AB  == we examined the effects of various denture base resin surface textures on the adherence of microorganisms. s. sanguis and b. gingivalis adhered in greater amounts to the denture base resin than the other microorganisms tested. as to bacterial adherence according to polishing state, s. oralis, b. gingivalis c-101, and b. intermedius c-001 more adhered to the no. 400 paper-polished surface than  to the buff-polished and smoothening-treated surfaces. s. sanguis less adhered to the smoothening-treated surface. s. mitis and c. albicans, on the other hand, more adhered to the smoothening-treated surface. for the other microorganisms tested, no relationship was observed between surface texture and bacterial adherence. the fall-off test revealed no remarkable differences in the fall-off of s. sanguis and b. gingivalis c-101 by the types of surface treatment. however, the fall-off of c. albicans was poorest from the no. 400 paper-polished surface.  these results indicate that smoothening the denture base surface is important for denture plaque control.

TI  == streptococcal-host interactions. structural and functional analysis of a streptococcus sanguis receptor for a human salivary glycoprotein.
AB  == colonization of oral tissues by streptococcus sanguis may be influenced by a mucin-like salivary glycoprotein (sag) through a calcium-dependent interaction with a specific bacterial receptor. we report the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the s. sanguis receptor (ssp-5) and show that this protein may bind sialic acid residues of sag. the ssp-5 protein contains three unique structural domains, two of which consist of repetitive amino acid sequences. the  n-terminal domain is comprised of four tandem copies of an 82-residue repeat which exhibits homology to m protein of streptococcus pyogenes. this region is highly charged and predicted to be alpha-helical. a second hydrophilic repetitive domain consists of three copies of a 39-amino acid sequence containing 30% proline flanked by nonrepetitive proline-rich sequence. the third domain consists of 48% proline and resides near the c terminus of the protein. secondary structure analysis of the ssp-5 sequence also identified four potential helix-turn-helix motifs that resembled e-f hand calcium binding domains. the ssp-5 protein is highly homologous to a surface antigen expressed by the mutans streptococci and the domain structure of ssp-5 is conserved within this family of proteins. the interactions of ssp-5 and of intact s. sanguis with sag were inhibited by neuraminidase digestion of the salivary glycoprotein and by simple sugars containing sialic acid, suggesting that sialic acid is the primary ligand  involved in the binding reaction.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between bacterial flora in tonsillar lacunae and antistreptococcal antibody in sera of the patients with  pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). since the pustules develops or worsens after tonsillitis in many patients with ppp, a pathogenic role of tonsillar bacteria is suggested, but no significant association has been proven so far. in  this study, the aerobes in the tonsillar lacunae were identified and quantitated  in 15 adult patients with ppp and 9 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis (ct). in addition, serum streptococcal antigen-specific antibody levels in 40 adult patients with ppp, 18 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. a total of 53 strains (17 species) of aerobes were isolated and identified from the tonsillar lacunae in patients with ppp, while 35 strains (12 species) of aerobes were found in the patients with ct. 2. s. salivarius and s. pneumoniae were the dominant aerobes isolated from patients  with ppp or ct. 3. although the rates of isolation for staphylococcus and s. pneumoniae were lower in ppp patients than in ct patients, the rate for s. sanguis i was higher in ppp patients than in ct patients. 4. the percentage of alpha, gamma-streptococci to total aerobes in ppp patients was higher than in ct  patients. 5. the igg antibody titers against s. sanguis and s. mitis, and the igm antibody titers against all streptococci investigated in ppp patients were higher than those in both ct patients and controls. 6. moreover, both the igg antibody titers against s. pyogenes t4 and s. sanguis i and the igm antibody titers against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii of the patients in which ppp markedly improved after tonsillectomy were higher than those in which ppp showed less improvement postoperatively.

AB  == the contribution of human parotid (par) and submandibular/sublingual (sm/sl) saliva and of the human whole salivary mucin fraction (hwsm) to saliva-induced bacterial aggregation was studied for s. sanguis c476, s. oralis i581, and s. rattus hg 59. the mucous sm/sl saliva showed a much higher aggregation potency towards the s. sanguis and s. oralis strain than did the serous par saliva. the sm/sl saliva-induced aggregation was observed after 30 min, at 60 min followed by the par saliva-induced aggregation, and showed a 4-fold higher aggregation titer  of 128 for s. sanguis, and an 8-fold higher titer of 516 for s. oralis. in contrast, the par saliva showed a slightly higher aggregation activity than the sm/sl saliva towards s. rattus as judged by a twofold higher titer of 64. morphologically, however, the sm/sl saliva-induced aggregation of s. rattus was far more pronounced as was also found for s. sanguis. finally, the hwsm-induced aggregation showed a 4 to 8-fold higher titer than the originating salivary source, measuring 2048 for s. oralis and 128 for s. rattus. moreover, no difference was observed in aggregation activity between the hwsm from whole saliva of a blood group o donor and the hwsm from sm/sl saliva of a blood group a donor. all the data point to an important, though not exclusive role of the human salivary mucin fraction in the saliva-induced aggregation of these strains.

TI  == microbiology of root surface caries in humans.
AB  == studies on the microbiology of root surface caries between 1970 and 1975 placed emphasis on gram-positive pleomorphic filamentous rods, particularly actinomyces  viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. both of these species had been shown to produce root surface caries in experimental animals. since this time, studies have placed more emphasis on streptococcus mutans, and s. mutans and lactobacillus are significant in prediction of root surface caries risk in patients. subsequent studies confirmed an association between s. mutans and 'soft' or 'initial' root lesions. thus, it is important when determining the microflora of root surface lesions to make careful characterization of the state  of the lesion. a second important aspect of the analysis of bacterial communities associated with root surface caries is better definition of the organisms. most studies have concentrated on 'target organisms' s. mutans, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, lactobacillus, and veillonella. however, it has been known for 17 years that the actinomyces associated with the lesions may be variants of a. viscosus and a. naeslundii. such strains (intermediate strains) have been described in taxonomic studies of actinomyces, yet little is known of the differences in physiology of these strains or their relationship to root surface caries. a similar situation exists with oral streptococcus where new taxonomic divisions are being proposed. recognition of the potential diversity within the 'target' genera of root surface caries could yield valuable data. recent studies suggest that this is so, since samples from root surface lesions which contain s. mutans and lactobacillus show a high isolation of s. mitis 1 and no isolations of a. naeslundii. careful definition of the lesions of root surface caries and the flora will allow analysis to relate a specific bacterial community to the state fo the lesion and assist in monitoring the control of the lesion through fluoride and antibacterials.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == molecular aspects of immunoglobulin a1 degradation by oral streptococci.
AB  == using a panel of 143 strains classified according to a novel taxonomic system for oral viridans-type streptococci, we reexamined the ability of oral streptococci to attack human immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) molecules with iga1 protease or glycosidases. iga1 protease production was an exclusive property of all strains belonging to streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis (previously s. mitior) and of some strains of streptococcus mitis biovar 1. these are all dominant initiators of dental plaque formation. degradation of the carbohydrate moiety of iga1 molecules accompanied iga1 protease activity in s. oralis and protease-producing strains of s. mitis biovar 1. neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase were identified as extracellular enzymes in organisms of these taxa. by examination with enzyme-neutralizing antisera, four distinct iga1 proteases were detected in s. sanguis biovars 1 to 3, s. sanguis biovar 4, s. oralis, and strains of s. mitis, respectively. the cleavage of iga1 molecules by  streptococcal iga proteases was found to be influenced by their state of glycosylation. treatment of iga1 with bacterial (including streptococcal) neuraminidase increased susceptibility to protease, suggesting a cooperative activity of streptococcal iga1 protease and neuraminidase. in contrast, a decrease in susceptibility was observed after extensive deglycosylation of the hinge region with endo-alpha-n acetylgalactosaminidase. the effector functions of iga antibodies depend on the carbohydrate-containing fc portion. hence, the observation that oral streptococci may cleave not only the alpha 1 chains but also the carbohydrate moiety of iga1 molecules suggests that the ability to evade secretory immune mechanisms may contribute to the successful establishment of these bacteria in the oral cavity.

TI  == selective modulation of bacterial attachment to oral epithelial cells by enzyme activities associated with poor oral hygiene.
AB  == the present investigation explored the hypothesis that elevated levels of certain enzymes in the gingival crevicular environment of individuals with poor oral hygiene and/or gingival inflammation may modify the surfaces of epithelial cells  and thereby modulate the types of bacteria which attach and colonize. buccal epithelial cells treated with neuraminidase and certain proteases were used as a  model for study. bacteria studied included streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis which have been associated with gingival health, actinomyces  species which are increased in plaque associated with developing gingivitis, and  bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans which are associated with destructive periodontal diseases. treatment of epithelial cells with the enzymes studied produced selective effects on their receptivity for bacteria. neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells greatly reduced the attachment of all strains of s. sanguis and s. mitis studied. in contrast, the number of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii and a. israelii cells which attached was significantly increased. neuraminidase treatment also appeared to enhance attachment of b. intermedius and b. gingivalis. treatment of  buccal cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin or papain also selectively affected bacterial attachment. such protease treatment greatly reduced the numbers of streptococci and a. viscosus cells which attached, while the numbers of b. gingivalis and b. intermedius were significantly increased. treatment of epithelial cells with preparations of lysosomal enzymes derived from human pmns produced similar selective effects. the changes in bacterial adhesion observed by the enzyme treatments studied are consistent with the shifts in the composition of the gingival crevice flora which occur when oral hygiene is terminated and gingivitis develops.

AB  == the adhesin of bacteroides loeschei pk1295 that mediates coaggregation with streptococcus sanguis 34 and hemagglutination of erythrocytes was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. the lectinlike protein has an estimated native mr of 450,000 and consists of six subunits of identical molecular weight (mr 75,000). the purified adhesin appears to be a basic protein with a pi between 7.4 and 8.0. amino acid and n-terminal sequence analyses were carried out with the purified protein. these indicated that the protein contains a large number of asx and glx  residues as well as basic amino acid residues. the binding site of the pure adhesin retained its native configuration during purification. when preincubated  with streptococcal partner cells at ph 4.6, the adhesin prevented b. loeschei cells from coaggregating with the streptococci. an adhesin preparation adjusted to a ph of 6.8 rapidly agglutinated both streptococci and neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes. galactosides inhibited the agglutination reactions.

TI  == [xylitol, mechanisms of action and uses].
AB  == xylitol is recommended as a sugar substitute and is claimed not only to be non-cariogenic, but also to exhibit an anti-caries effect. an interesting aspect  of xylitol is that it has a certain bacteriostatic effect. xylitol is taken up by many strains of strep mutans and strep sanguis even if these organisms are unable to metabolize xylitol. it enters the bacteria by the phospho-transferase system.  xylitol-phosphate inhibits the glycolysis probably at the phosphofructokinase level, and is also de-phosphorylated and expelled through a "futile cycle". the combination xylitol and sorbitol is particularly interesting, since xylitol inhibits the metabolization of sorbitol by strep mutans and sorbitol also appears to potentiate the bacteriostatic effect of xylitol. furthermore the combination is favourable from an economical point of view since sorbitol is less expensive than xylitol. xylitol induces diarrhea if consumed in considerable amounts and is thus only suitable in products like chewing gum and tablets.

TI  == stimulation of the growth of streptococcus sanguis (nctc 7864) by zinc in vitro.
AB  == zinc, which is present in many materials used in dentistry, including restorative and endodontic materials and mouthwashes, is reputedly bactericidal. however, the addition of this element at concentrations in the range 10-50 ppm to cultures of  streptococcus sanguis (nctc 7864) stimulated the growth of the micro-organism relative to that of controls. a second antibacterial element, namely fluoride, reduced growth. similar results were obtained whether the organism was grown aerobically or anaerobically. in view of the susceptibility of some organisms to  zinc, the results of this study may help to explain conflicting reports in the literature; the results will vary depending on which organism is predominant.

TI  == formation of trimethylamine from dietary choline by streptococcus sanguis i, which colonizes the mouth.
AB  == choline is a component of the normal diet, and when humans ingest large amounts they excrete trimethylamine (which can impart a fishy body odor). in the presence of nitrite, trimethylamine can be converted to dimethylnitrosamine, a potent carcinogen. bacteria in the large intestine metabolize choline to form trimethylamine. we determined that a bacterium normally present in the oral cavity also has this capacity. mixed bacterial flora cultured from dental plaque  and saliva converted choline to trimethylamine. the only organism with trimethylamine-forming capability isolated from these mixed cultures was identified as streptococcus sanguis i (a facultative anaerobe). the other products formed when choline was cleaved were ethanol and acetate. the formation  of trimethylamine by s. sanguis i was enzyme-mediated. activity was destroyed by  heating at 100 degrees c, and obeyed michaelis-menten kinetics (k(apparent) for choline = 184 +/- 58 microm; v(max apparent) = 1.7 +/- 0.1 micromol/mg protein/h). activity was maximal at ph 7.5 to 8.5, was membrane-bound, and required a divalent metal cation (cobalt or iron). more trimethylamine was produced by bacteria incubated under a nitrogen than under an aerobic atmosphere. activity was inhibited by deanol, betaine aldehyde, hemicholinium-3, iodoacetate, semicarbazide, and 2,4-dinitrophenol, and was enhanced by sulfhydryl-reducing agents (glutathione, 2-mercaptoethanol, dl-dithiothreitol) and sodium bisulfite.  the enzyme activity that we describe in s. sanguis i is similar to that previously described in the anaerobic bacteria isolated from intestinal flora.

AB  == enterococci belonging to various species resistant to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics have been isolated from hospitalized patients in  france, the uk and the usa. all such strains examined display inducible synthesis of a membrane protein associated with resistance. the mechanism by which the membrane protein acts has not been definitively established, but it may block the access of the antibiotic to its peptidoglycan target. that the protein could be a bypass enzyme has not been ruled out. transfer of glycopeptide resistance by conjugation to either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis and by transformation of streptococcus sanguis challis has been reported. the structural and regulatory genes encoding this resistance can be localized on plasmid and, apparently, chromosomal dna. the plasmids encoding this resistance appear to differ from each other and have variable host ranges, but share at least some dna sequence homology.

TI  == colonization resistance of defined bacterial plaques to streptococcus mutans implantation on teeth in a model mouth.
AB  == we investigated the ability of streptococcus mutans c67-1 to colonize simple bacterial plaques and the effects of age and stability of the pre-formed plaque on colonization resistance. mixed-plaques of actinomyces viscosus wvu627, 'streptococcus mitior' lpa-1, and veillonella dispar omz193 were grown on tooth segments, mounted back to back for simulation of approximal sites in a model mouth for 66 h. s. mutans c67-1 was either included in the original inoculum or super-inoculated onto the developing plaque. inclusion of s. mutans c67-1 did not alter the total viable counts, but the proportional composition changed due to inter-species interactions. colonization resistance of the mixed-plaque samples developed within 24 h, although s. mutans c67-1 was always able to colonize these stagnation sites. colonization resistance of 24-hour plaque against a fresh isolate, s. mutans cp3, was also studied. there was greater colonization resistance by the basic plaque to this organism, compared with s. mutans c67-1, although the reasons for this were not clear. these initial experiments demonstrate the way in which the factors involved in bacterial colonization resistance in microbial films on teeth can be studied under controlled conditions.

AB  == streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were the least proteolytic of 8 species of oral streptococci while streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis were the most proteolytic. degradation of fitc-bsa was significantly correlated with the hydrolysis of synthetic endopeptidase substrates. as s. oralis strains proliferate in dental plaque in the absence of dietary food their success, in vivo, might be due partially to their greater proteolytic activity compared to other oral streptococci.

TI  == phenotypic characterization of streptococcus sanguis virulence factors associated with bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == certain strains of streptococcus sanguis adhere (adh+) selectively to human platelets and, in plasma, induce them to aggregate (agg+) into in vitro thrombi.  in this study, we examined 18 recent endocarditis and dental plaque isolates of microorganisms that were biotyped as s. sanguis for coexpression of platelet interactivity phenotypes with another possible virulence factor in bacterial endocarditis, dextran synthesis. detectable production of extracellular glucosyltransferase ranged from 0.2 to 66 mu/mg of culture fluid for 10 representative strains tested. production of extracellular or cell-associated glucosyltransferase, fructosyltransferase, and soluble or insoluble dextrans was  not necessarily coexpressed with platelet interactivity phenotypes, since the levels of production of soluble and insoluble dextrans varied among representative adh+ agg+ and adh- agg- strains. analysis of a second panel of 38  fresh dental plaque isolates showed that s. sanguis distributes in a reproducible manner into the possible phenotype groups. strains with different platelet interactivity phenotypes were distinguished with a panel of four murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) raised against adh+ agg+ strain 133-79 and screened  to rule out artifactual reactions with antigenic components in culture media. the mabs reacted selectively with adh+ agg+ strains in a direct-binding, whole-cell,  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and also inhibited their interactions with platelets. analysis of minimal tryptic digests of many strains, including variants that failed to bind the mabs, suggested that some noninteractivity phenotypes possess cryptic surface determinants. since the ability to adhere to platelets and induce them to aggregate is relatively stable, these traits may be  useful in a phenotyping scheme for these lancefield nontypeable streptococci.

TI  == sorbitol-fermenting predominant cultivable flora of human dental plaque in relation to sorbitol adaptation and salivary secretion rate.
AB  == the sorbitol-fermenting predominant flora of human dental plaque was studied in 12 people with low and 11 with normal salivary secretion rates before and after a period of frequent mouth rinses with sorbitol solution. a total of 277 sorbitol-fermenting isolates are described by their morphological and physiological characteristics. the flora was almost exclusively composed of gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces in people with low secretion rates and streptococcus and actinomyces  in those with normal salivation. at the species level, streptococcus mutans predominated in all. the frequent use of sorbitol resulted in an increase of the  streptococcal species mainly and particularly of streptococcus sanguis i in people with normal salivation. the counts of lactobacilli and actinomyces remained unaffected. almost all isolates appeared to belong to the resident plaque flora. succession of new sorbitol-fermenting genera to the plaque community could not be observed as a result of the frequent exposure of the mouth to sorbitol.

AB  == selective media were used to isolate a wide range of bacteria from sixty human dental plaques. glucanase activities of the isolates were determined on dextran-  and starch-containing media. all sixty samples of dental plaque yielded some colonies showing amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. the glucanase-producing organisms comprised 20% of the isolates. of these 38% were gram-positive rods, 27% gram-positive cocci, 28% gram-negative rods and 7% were gram-negative cocci.  the cultural groups most commonly represented among the glucanase-producing isolates were actinomycetaceae, streptococci, haemophili and gram-negative anaerobes. species prominent among these isolates included streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, bacterionema  matruchotii, bifidobacterium sp. and bacteroides sp. no isolates capable of degrading starch or dextran were identified as streptococcus milleri, rothia dentocariosa or fusobacterium sp. this study has shown that a wide range of bacterial species commonly isolated from human dental plaques exhibit both amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. in order to understand glucan metabolism in human dental plaques further investigation of these catabolic activities is necessary.

TI  == properties of a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) extracted from intact cells of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == cells of streptococcus sanguis strain challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kda comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. the polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. in vivo labelling of s. sanguis  cells with 32pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the hpr became dephosphorylated. antiserum raised to the s. sanguis hpr reacted on western blots with hprs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, but not with hprs from s. faecalis or s. bovis, nor with proteins from staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, actinomyces viscosus and  various lactobacilli. the s. sanguis hpr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the hprs from s. mutans an s. salivarius. the n-terminal residues (to 37) of the s. sanguis hpr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the n-terminal sequence of s. faecalis hpr. it is suggested that hpr in s. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of hpr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.

TI  == osteomyelitis associated with chronic periodontitis: a report of three cases.
AB  == correctly differentiating between periodontal abscess (localized, acute suppurative infection of the periodontium) and osteomyelitis (the extension of an infection into the bone medullary cavity) is crucial since the former may not require antibiotics for resolution, while the latter will. initial assessment and treatment of osteomyelitis should be based on clinical examination, radiographic  interpretation, and experience. three case histories of osteomyelitis are presented, ranging from a periodontally well-localized case to one involving a hemimandible and crossing the midline. successful early diagnosis and case management may benefit from scintigraphic interpretation and culture-and-sensitivity studies.

AB  == penicillin-tolerant and -sensitive strains of oral streptococci were treated with penicillin to determine the production of a post-antibiotic effect (pae). no pae  was seen with any of the s. sanguis strains tested but most strains of the other  oral streptococcal species produced a pae. cultures on nitrocellulose filters treated with penicillin were examined by scanning electronmicroscopy and showed that tolerant and sensitive strains lost the ability to adhere to the filter after application of antibiotic. when the filters were treated with beta-lactamase, before processing for microscopy, the tolerant strains but not the sensitive ones recovered and grew in a confluent lawn similar to the control  cultures that had not received antibiotic. transmission electronmicroscopic examination of similarly treated cultures produced comparable results. bizarre morphological changes were a feature of the tolerant strains of s. sanguis.

TI  == effects of varnishes containing chlorhexidine on the human dental plaque flora.
AB  == this study describes the effects of varnishes containing 0%, 10%, 20%, or 40% chlorhexidine diacetate on the microflora of human fissure dental plaque. sandarac, a natural resin, was used as the varnish base. ten subjects, each with  at least four sound fissures harboring high levels of streptococcus mutans, participated in the study. the fissures in each of the individuals were randomly  assigned to four experimental groups, in each of which one of the varnishes was tested. the varnish treatment consisted of a single application of a small amount of varnish onto the fissures. apart from the selected fissures, the rest of the dentition was left untreated. all chlorhexidine-containing varnishes selectively  suppressed s. mutans in fissure plaque, and had no effect on total viable counts  or on the numbers of actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii and streptococcus sanguis beyond one week. the extent of the suppression depended upon the concentration of chlorhexidine in the varnish, 40% chlorhexidine varnish giving the greatest suppression of s. mutans. at 22 weeks, after a single treatment with varnish containing 40% chlorhexidine, mean s. mutans counts were more than ten times lower than in the control or 10%-chlorhexidine varnish group. at that time, s. mutans was still undetectable in five out of ten experimental fissures in this group. the results suggested that sandarac varnishes containing high concentrations of chlorhexidine can be used successfully for long-term suppression of s. mutans in dental fissures.

TI  == the microflora associated with the development of initial enamel decalcification  below orthodontic bands in vivo in children living in a fluoridated-water area.
AB  == thirty-four caries-free teeth destined for orthodontic extraction were banded to  provide a protected area for the accumulation of plaque. the teeth were extracted at one, two, four, eight, and 14 days after being banded, and samples of the flora below the band were analyzed for the presence of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus 'mitior', 'mutans streptococci', actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces  naeslundii, actinomyces odontolyticus, lactobacillus species, and veillonella. after plaque sampling, the teeth were sent to the royal dental college (copenhagen) for histological analysis. the results showed that s. mutans could colonize the area below the band after one day, but that colonization was only 100% at 14 days. lactobacillus was only isolated from 2/8 samples at four days and from 4/8 samples at 14 days. s. sanguis and 's. mitior' were regularly isolated at all banding times, and veillonella was isolated from all samples. a.  viscosus was the most commonly isolated actinomyces. the numbers of streptococcus and veillonella were significantly higher at day 1 than at day 14 (p less than 0.05). s. mutans and a. viscosus were isolated more frequently at day 14 than at  day 1 (p less than 0.01). histological examination revealed that dissolution of the enamel below a band could occur after two days, but that even after 14 days dissolution could be questionable. dissolution was detected in areas where s. mutans was not isolated (8/34), but s. mutans was also present in samples showing dissolution (12/34). there was no relationship between dissolution and the numbers of s. mutans; however, the isolation frequency of s. mutans was associated with dissolution (p less than 0.05).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == procoagulant activity of endocardial vegetations and blood monocytes in rabbits with streptococcus sanguis endocarditis.
AB  == to investigate activation of the coagulation system in bacterial endocarditis, we determined the procoagulant activity of blood monocytes isolated from rabbits with streptococcus sanguis-infected or sterile catheter-induced endocardial vegetations. this activity was determined directly after isolation from the peripheral blood and after stimulation in vitro by either endotoxin or by phagocytosis of s. sanguis. the procoagulant activity of the vegetations of these rabbits was also determined. the procoagulant activity of blood monocytes of rabbits with s. sanguis endocarditis was found to be similar to the activity of monocytes of rabbits with sterile vegetations, both at the time of isolation and  after stimulation in vitro by exposure to endotoxin or phagocytosis of bacteria.  the procoagulant activity of infected vegetations was significantly higher than that of sterile vegetations. we conclude that in bacterial endocarditis the coagulation system is activated locally at the site of the vegetation. triggering probably occurs by thromboplastin generated by monocytes activated by phagocytosis of bacteria on the vegetational surface.

AB  == a structural gene for type 1 fimbriae of streptococcus sanguis fw213 was located  within a 6-kilobase fragment cloned in escherichia coli. a 1.6-kilobase internal  fragment contains an open reading frame of 927 bases coding for an immunoreactive peptide of 34,349 daltons, which corresponds in size with an observed cytoplasmic form of fimbrial peptide (p. m. fives-taylor, f. l. macrina, t. j. pritchard, and s. j. peene, infect. immun. 55:123-128, 1987). disruption of the reading frame by insertional mutagenesis results in loss of immunoreactivity. consensus sequences  for initiation of transcription and translation were identified 5' to the coding  region. transcription terminator-like sequences were found downstream of the coding region. the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned fimbrial peptide shows a strongly hydrophobic signal sequence at the amino terminus. the carboxyl-terminal region does not include a hydrophobic membrane anchor sequence  such as has been reported for other gram-positive surface structures. a hydrophobic region of 12 to 14 amino acids downstream from the putative signal sequence cleavage site exhibits homology with the streptococcus pyogenes type 6 m protein repetitive region a (s. k. hollingshead, v. a. fischetti, and j. r. scott, j. biol. chem., 261:1677-1686, 1986). functional homology at the level of  protein secondary structure with actinomyces viscosus t14v type 1 fimbriae (m. k. yeung, b. m. chassy, and j. o. cisar, j. bacteriol., 169:1678-1683, 1987) is proposed.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli of the genes of the arginine deiminase system of streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904.
AB  == the common oral bacterium streptococcus sanguis can degrade arginine via the arginine deiminase (ad) system. the three enzymes of this system, ad, ornithine carbamyltransferase (otc), and carbamate kinase (ck), catalyze the breakdown of arginine to ornithine, co2, and two molecules of ammonia, with the production of  atp from adp. the genes of the ad system, which are subject to complex regulation in the oral streptococci, have been isolated in bacteriophage lambda by screening for ad activity. the ad gene, designated arca, was expressed from recombinant bacteriophage or in cells harboring plasmid subclones from this phage at a level  up to 1,000-fold lower than the level in fully derepressed s. sanguis but apparently under the control of its own promoter. by subcloning in escherichia coli mutants defective in anabolic otc (argf argl) and ck (carb), it was demonstrated that the genes for s. sanguis otc and ck were located adjacent to the ad gene. the levels of expression of the otc and ck genes (arcb and arcc, respectively) were also very low in e. coli, although arcc expression was not as  poor as arca and arcb expression when compared with the levels found in s. sanguis. also, arcb and arcc were unable to complement the defects in their anabolic counterparts. introduction of the entire ad system or subclones which encoded only the ad gene into e. coli harboring defects in arginine and pyrimidine biosynthesis resulted in a 10- to 15-fold decrease in the level of ad  activity, suggesting that arginine or its metabolites may regulate ad expression. transposon mutagenesis was utilized to construct defined mutants of s. sanguis with mutations in the ad gene cluster. ad gene expression in these mutants indicated that the expression of the ad genes in this organism is strongly interrelated. the isolation and partial characterization of the arc genes represents the first step in the genetic manipulation of the ad system in the oral streptococci for analysis of the regulation of ad, analysis of the role of the system in plaque ecology, and utilization of the system to modulate the cariogenicity of dental plaque.

TI  == [glucosyltransferase (gtf) and immunization against dental caries in humans].
AB  == glucosyltransferase (gtf) is an extracellular or cell-associated enzyme synthesized by the "mutans" group of streptococci as well as the s. sanguis and is responsible for the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides. glucan formation in dental plaque mediates binding of s. mutans and s. sanguis to one another as well as to other bacteria. although the production of organic acids is an indispensable property of the cariogenic strains of bacteria, their ability to stick and accumulate on tooth surfaces is an almost equally significant parameter of virulence. furthermore, gtf has been proven to be an effective antigen in eliciting caries-protective secretory iga antibodies in rodent models. that led to the identification of gtf as a potential antigen for use in a human caries vaccine. the results of recent studies suggest that oral immunization with gtf, has the potential to elicit a secretory iga antibody response and to interfere with accumulation and permanent colonization of s. mutans on smooth tooth surfaces. however, it cannot be inferred from the available data whether such a vaccine is effective in caries prevention in human beings. although many modifications seem to be necessary with regard to the composition, dose, frequency and route of administration of the antigen, the preparation of a safe and effective vaccine against human caries is considered to be feasible in the near future.

TI  == classification and identification of the viridans streptococci.
AB  == this review traces the history of the human, nonhemolytic, or viridans, streptococci and describes improvements in their taxonomy wrought by study of their biochemical profiles and analysis of their nucleic acids. the goal was to define species on the basis of genetic relationships and to describe these species by their phenotypic characteristics so that they can be easily identified. this method has resulted in the division of some species. streptococcus mutans has been divided into four species, two of which are common  in humans. three more mutans group species are indigenous to animals. conversely, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, and "s. milleri" have been combined under s. anginosus. s. mitis (or "s. mitior") can be well-defined and includes s. sanguis  ii. there is genetic heterogeneity within s. sanguis, but the species is usually  easy to identify. there is also some heterogeneity in s. bovis, but most human isolates are genetically related. discussions of the taxonomy of these species are accompanied by descriptions of the characteristics by which these streptococci can be identified. among these species are potential pathogens which should be suspected in cases of endocarditis and purulent infections of liver, brain, and other tissues.

TI  == isolation of a coaggregation-inhibiting cell wall polysaccharide from streptococcus sanguis h1.
AB  == coaggregation between streptococcus sanguis h1 and capnocytophaga ochracea atcc 33596 cells is mediated by a carbohydrate receptor on the former and an adhesin on the latter. two methods were used to release the carbohydrate receptor from the gram-positive streptococcus, autoclaving and mutanolysin treatment. the polysaccharide released from the streptococcal cell wall by either treatment was  purified by ion-exchange chromatography; this polysaccharide inhibited coaggregation when preincubated with the gram-negative capnocytophaga partner. after hydrolysis of the polysaccharide by hydrofluoric acid (hf), the major oligosaccharide of the polysaccharide was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. by analysis of the hf hydrolysis of the polysaccharide and the purified oligosaccharide, this major oligosaccharide appeared to be the repeating unit of the polysaccharide, with minor components resulting from internal hydrolysis of the major oligosaccharide. gas chromatography results showed that the oligomer was a hexasaccharide, consisting of rhamnose, galactose, and glucose, in the ratio of 2:3:1, respectively. by weight, the purified hexasaccharide was a fourfold-more-potent inhibitor of coaggregation than the native polysaccharide. resistance to hydrolysis by sulfuric acid alone and susceptibility to hydrolysis by hf suggested that oligosaccharide chains of the polysaccharide are linked by phosphodiester bonds. studies with a coaggregation-defective mutant of s. sanguis h1 revealed that the cell walls of the mutant contained neither the polysaccharide nor the hexasaccharide repeating  unit. the purification of both a polysaccharide and its constituent hexasaccharide repeating unit, which both inhibited coaggregation, and the absence of this polysaccharide or hexasaccharide on a coaggregation-defective mutant strongly suggest that the hexasaccharide derived from the polysaccharide functions as the receptor for the adhesin from c. ochracea atcc 33596.

AB  == there are a number of glass-ionomer lining cements available to the profession. it is generally agreed that the glass-ionomer cements demonstrate reasonably good biocompatibility. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of six glass-ionomer cements on s. sanguis and s. mutans. forty-eight plates of tsa-srbc (10%), each with 3.0-mm-diam. wells, were divided into two groups (1 and 2) of 24 each. group 1 was inoculated with s. sanguis (10558) and group 2 with s. mutans (6715-13 w.t.). each well was filled with 4.0 mg of one of the following liners: glassic (a), shofu lining cement (b), gc lining cement (c), ever bond (d), gingiva seal (e), and ketac bond (f); the empty wells served as control. plates were incubated under microaerophilic conditions at 37 degrees c,  and checked daily over seven days for inhibition zones. average inhibition zones  (mm) at 7 days were as follows: group 1-1a = 10.00, 1b = 7.83, 1c = 18.50, 1d = 13.00, 1e = 8.67, and 1f = 9.33; group 2-2a = 3.08, 2b = 10.25, 2c = 12.75, 2d =  15.58, 2e = 8.83, and 2f = 3.20. all control wells were 0.0 gc liner and ever bond showed significantly greater overall inhibition of microbial growth than did other tested liners (p less than 0.5). a one-way anova and snk test showed that all tested liners were significantly more toxic toward s. sanguis than toward s.  mutans (p less than 0.05).

TI  == isolation and characterization of the streptococcus mutans gtfd gene, coding for  primer-dependent soluble glucan synthesis.
AB  == two glucosyltransferase genes from streptococcus mutans gs-5, gtfb and gtfc, have been previously isolated and sequenced in this laboratory. in the present communication a third gtf gene, gtfd, was isolated and characterized. isolation of the gene involved a novel procedure utilizing the integration plasmid pva891.  a peptide expressed by the 1.7-kilobase dna fragment from strain nhs1 (containing deletions in both the gtfb and gtfc genes) was initially identified in a puc18 clone bank with antiglucosyltransferase antibodies. this fragment was integrated  into the gs-5 chromosome following ligation into pva891 and transformation, yielding strain dp2. the vector together with one complete and one incomplete copy of the gtfd gene was removed from the chromosome of strain dp2 following ecori digestion, religation, and transformation of e. coli hb101. the resultant plasmid, pnh4, expressed glucosyltransferase s (gtf-s) activity. the enzyme was purified to near homogeneity and was shown to synthesize water-soluble glucan exclusively in a primer-dependent manner. the molecular mass (155 kilodaltons) and the kinetic parameters of the purified enzyme were similar to those observed  for the gtf-s enzyme previously purified from culture fluids of strain gs-5. insertional inactivation of the gtfd gene indicated that this gene is not required for in vitro sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth surfaces. furthermore, inactivation of the gtfd gene in a gtfc gtfb mutant indicated that three distinct gtf genes involved in glucan formation are present on the s. mutans gs-5 chromosome. southern blot analysis further suggested that the gtfd gene does not share demonstrable homology with the gtf genes from streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus sobrinus.

TI  == molecular surface characterization of oral streptococci by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == in order to characterize the molecular composition of oral streptococci, infrared transmission spectroscopy on freeze-dried cells dissolved in kbr was used. all infrared spectra show similar absorption bands for the strains studied with the most important absorption bands located at 2930 cm-1 (ch), 1653 cm-1 (ami), 1541  cm-1 (amii) and two bands at 1236 cm-1 and 1082 cm-1, which were assigned to phosphate and sugar groups. however, calculation of absorption band ratios normalized with respect to the integrated intensity of the ch stretching region around 2930 cm-1, show significant differences between the strains. both streptococcus mitis strains possess high ami/ch and amii/ch absorption band ratios compared to the other strains. streptococcus salivarius hbc12, a mutant strain devoid of all proteinaceous surface appendages, shows significantly lower  ami/ch and amii/ch band ratios with respect to its parent strain s. salivarius hb. two positive relationships could be established both between the amii/ch absorption band ratio and the n/c elemental surface concentration ratio of the strains previously, determined from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) and also between ami/ch and the fraction of carbon atoms at the surface involved in amide bonds, determined by xps as well. from this comparison, it is concluded that transmission infrared spectroscopy can be employed as a technique to study the molecular surface composition of freeze-dried microorganisms.

AB  == a dna segment covering the signal sequence coding region, the ribosome binding site, and the promoter of the staphylokinase (sak) 42d gene (behnke and gerlach 1987) was cloned into puc19 to form a portable expression-secretion unit (esu). fusion of human interferon alpha 1 (hifn alpha 1) and hybrid hifn alpha 1/2 genes to this sak esu resulted in secretory expression of the two gene products in both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. while most of the ifn alpha was exported  to the periplasmic space of e. coli, about 99% was secreted to the culture medium by recombinant b. subtilis strains. the total yield in e. coli was 1.2 x 10(5) iu/ml. this level of expression and export led to instability of the recombinant  strains that was spontaneously relieved in vivo by inactivation of the sak esu through insertion of an is1 element. no such instability was observed with b. subtilis although expression and secretion levels reached even 3 x 10(6) iu/ml. proteolytic degradation of ifn alpha by extracellular proteases was avoided by a  combination of constitutive expression and secretion during the logarithmic growth phase and the use of exoprotease-reduced host strains. the ifn alpha 1 protein purified from b. subtilis culture supernatant was correctly processed, carried the expected 11 amino acid n-terminal elongation that resulted from dna manipulations and proved to be homogenous in western blotting experiments. the same recombinant plasmid that directed efficient secretion of hifn alpha 1 in b.  subtilis gave poor yields when introduced into streptococcus sanguis.

AB  == circular dichroism spectroscopy is used to determine the absolute configuration of the constituent sugar residues of bacterial polysaccharides from two strains of streptococcus sanguis which are important receptors in bacterial coaggregation in the formation of dental plaque. a high-pressure liquid chromatographic method  for carbohydrate analysis of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and polysaccharides has  been extended to sugar chirality determination by collection of the eluted hplc fractions and subsequent measurement of their circular dichroism spectra. the method involves methanolysis of the polysaccharide followed by formation of o-benzoyl derivatives and hplc on reverse-phase columns. circular dichroism spectra of the collected derivatives in acetonitrile solution in the region 230 nm show large ellipticity bands resulting from "chiral exciton" interaction among the o-benzoyl chromophores which are sensitive to the orientation of hydroxyl groups in the parent sugars. the sensitivity of the method is in the submicrogram range for the absolute configuration of single sugar residues. the circular dichroism of the intact polysaccharide in aqueous solution shows cd bands from the amide chromophore in the region 180 to 220 nm which are sensitive to the chirality of 2-acetamido sugar residues.

AB  == the interaction of a high-molecular-weight salivary glycoprotein (agglutinin) with streptococcus sanguis m5 leads to the formation of bacterial aggregates. we  have previously shown that the ssp-5 surface antigen from s. sanguis m5 binds the salivary agglutinin and therefore may be involved in the aggregation process. here we report the transformation of a nonaggregating enterococcus faecalis strain with the ssp-5 gene and show that the protein is expressed on the cell surface and confers an aggregation-positive phenotype. e. faecalis s161 protoplasts were transformed with pam401 eb-5, a shuttle vector containing the s. sanguis ssp-5 gene, resulting in the isolation of e. faecalis s161eb-5. crude cell extracts from this transformant and from s. sanguis m5 were analyzed by western blotting. extracts from s. sanguis m5 possessed peptides of 190 and 205 kilodaltons that reacted strongly with polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant ssp-5 antigen. e. faecalis s161eb-5 contained only the 190-kilodalton immunoreactive protein, suggesting that the antigen may be processed differently  in e. faecalis s161eb-5. the parent strain, e. faecalis s161, did not react with  this antibody preparation. immunogold labeling of intact e. faecalis s161eb-5 and s. sanguis m5 with anti-ssp-5 immunoglobulin g showed that both organisms expressed similar levels of the antigen. both organisms formed visible aggregates upon incubation with salivary agglutinin. these results suggest that the ssp-5 antigen may mediate both the binding of agglutinin to s. sanguis m5 and the subsequent formation of bacterial aggregates.

AB  == human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) demonstrated the ability to detach actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii and streptococcus sanguis from saliva-coated  hydroxyapatite beads (sha). between 60 to 80% of bacteria were detached within 1  hour at pmn-to-bacteria ratios between 1:10 to 1:22. detachment was enhanced by treating bacteria with fresh but not heat-inactivated normal human serum. detachment of serum-treated a. viscosus was inhibited by cytochalasin b, l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone (tpck), and deoxyglucose but not  colchicine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf), n-carbobenzoxy-l-phenylalanine  chloromethyl ketone (zpck), and sodium azide. in the absence of serum treatment,  the detachment of a. viscosus was insensitive to lactose, galactose, and mannose. we conclude that pmn can efficiently detach bacteria from sha, this detachment is enhanced by serum, and this enhancement is probably dependent upon complement. additionally, detachment of a. viscosus bound to sha by pmn (1) does not appear to involve bacterial lectin activity, (2) seems to be dependent upon glycolytic metabolism, microfilament formation, and the activity of a tpck-sensitive serine  protease, and (3) is not sensitive to inhibitors of tubulin polymerization or heme-protein activity.

TI  == alveolar epithelial responses in experimental streptococcal pneumonia.
AB  == we describe an experimental model of pneumonia in wistar rats evoked by streptococcus sanguis. the lesion developed rapidly as a confluent bronchopneumonia of the single-lobed left lung. except at the extreme base, where an abscess formed, the pneumonic process thereafter resolved, and most of the lung appeared microscopically and ultrastructurally normal 8 days after infection. sequential electron microscopic studies revealed that in the areas of  lung which subsequently resolved, damage was restricted to type 1 pneumocytes. within 24 h of infection, the unaffected type 2 pneumocytes were observed to proliferate, transform into elongated pneumocytes of intermediate morphology, and then undermine and strip off the damaged type 1 cells from the subjacent basement membrane. thereafter, the intermediate type pneumocytes completed their transformation into definitive type 1 cells, thus completing the repair process.  we hypothesize that this represents an accelerated form of the normal type 1 replacement mechanism, and that uncomplicated epithelial repair following acute alveolar damage is possible if type 2 pneumocytes escape significant damage, so that they retain their capacity to proliferate and differentiate into type 1 epithelium.

AB  == streptococcus sanguis 12 and a naturally occurring mutant, 12 na, were screened for their ultrastructure and adhesive properties in vitro. negative staining showed that strep. sanguis 12 carried three types of surface structure. the majority of cells carried long fibrils that in different batches ranged in length from 80 to 207 nm, and shorter fibrils which were 51.0 +/- 15.7 nm long. both types of fibrils were primarily located at the poles of the cells. occasionally cells were seen that carried fimbriae, which are structurally distinct from fibrils, and were 3-4 nm wide and less than 1.0 micron long. strain 12 na carried no detectable surface structures. ruthenium red staining revealed that both strains carried a loose, amorphous, extracellular polysaccharide layer attached to the cell wall. streptococcus sanguis 12 na was 83% less adhesive than strain 12 in a saliva-coated hydroxyapatite assay, and 50% less adhesive in a buccal epithelial cell adhesion assay. in contrast, strain 12 na was more sensitive to aggregation by parotid saliva than strain 12, and both strains were equally aggregated by whole saliva. the cell surface hydrophobicity of the two strains was similar. extraction of surface proteins by sodium lauroyl-sarcosinate followed by sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that strep. sanguis 12 expressed more high mol.wt proteins on its surface than strain 12 na. using immunogold labelling, the fibrils of strain 12 labelled well with antiserum directed against the long fibrils, but so did the cell surfaces of both strep. sanguis 12 and 12 na. high molecular weight proteins and cell surface fibrils may be associated with adhesion in this strain.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide liners on streptococcus sanguis and s. mutans.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of 10 calcium hydroxide liners on streptococcus sanguis and s. mutans was studied. one hundred plates of tryticose soy agar-sheep red blood cells (10%), each with four distinct 3 mm diameter wells, were divided  into two groups of 50. one group was inoculated with s. sanguis and the second group with s. mutans. a 4 mg liner was placed in each of three wells; the fourth  well was left empty as a control. plates were incubated at 37 degrees c and observed at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 7 days. all liners inhibited growth of both organisms. the inhibitory zones for s. mutans were larger than inhibitory zones for s. sanguis for all tested liners. life fast set material had significantly less inhibitory effect on s. mutans. vlc dycal, life, and life fast set materials had significantly less inhibitory effect on s. sanguis at p = 0.05.

TI  == the effects of pellicle formation on streptococcal adhesion to human enamel and artificial substrata with various surface free-energies.
AB  == the influence of a pellicle on streptococcal adhesion was studied. a "ripened" two-hour salivary pellicle and an "early" five-minute salivary pellicle were formed on human enamel and artificial solid substrata with varying surface free-energies. three strains of oral streptococci, also with widely different surface free-energies, were used for adhesion studies. pellicle formation and streptococcal adhesion took place at a constant shear rate of 21 s-1. adhesion of s. mitis bms to bare and pellicle-covered enamel was low and not significantly affected by the presence of a pellicle (0.7 x 10(6) and 0.6 x 10(6) cells.cm-2, resp.), whereas the numbers of s. sanguis 12 and s. mutans ns adhering to bare enamel (4.2 x 10(6) cells.cm-2 and 13.8 x 10(6) cells, cm-2, resp) were significantly reduced by the presence of a pellicle. this reduction was almost complete after only five minutes of salivary protein adsorption (1.9 x 10(-6) and 1.1 x 10(6) cells.cm-2 for s. sanguis and s. mutans, resp.) but further reduced for s. sanguis adhering to a ripened pellicle (0.7 x 10(6) cells.cm-2). the numbers of streptococci adhering at equilibrium to bare enamel could be fitted to a thermodynamically based model, which was previously described for bacterial adhesion to homogenous artificial substrata. streptococcal adhesion to artificial substrata exposed to saliva was low, and the differences among uncoated materials were markedly reduced even after only five minutes' exposure to saliva.

TI  == cariogenicity of a lactate dehydrogenase-deficient mutant of streptococcus mutans serotype c in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == a lactate dehydrogenase-deficient (ldh-) mutant of a human isolate of streptococcus mutans serotype c was tested in a gnotobiotic rat caries model. compared with the wild-type ldh-positive (ldh+) strains, it was significantly (alpha less than or equal to 0.005) less cariogenic in experiments with two different sublines of sprague-dawley rats. the ldh- mutant strain 044 colonized the oral cavity of the test animals to the same extent as its parent strain 041,  although its initial implantation was slightly but not significantly (p greater than or equal to 0.2) less. multiple oral or fecal samples plated on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium indicator medium revealed no evidence of back mutation from ldh- to ldh+ in vivo. both ldh+ strain 041 and ldh- strain 044 demonstrated  bacteriocinlike activity in vitro against a number of human strains of mutans streptococci representing serotype a (s. cricetus) and serotypes c and e (s. mutans). serotypes b (s. rattus) and f (s. mutans) and strains of s. mitior, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius were not inhibited. thus, ldh mutant strain 044 possesses a number of desirable traits that suggest it should be investigated further as a possible effector strain for replacement therapy of dental caries. these traits include its stability and low cariogenicity in the sensitive gnotobiotic rat caries model, its bacteriocinlike activity against certain other  cariogenic s. mutans (but not against more inocuous indigenous oral streptococci), and the fact that it is a member of the most prevalent human serotype of cariogenic streptococci.

TI  == aggregation of 27 oral bacteria by human whole saliva. influence of culture medium, calcium, and bacterial cell concentration, and interference by autoaggregation.
AB  == twenty-seven oral strains of the genera actinomyces (5), bacteroides (3), and streptococcus (19) were tested for aggregation by human whole saliva, as well as  the effect of culture medium, ca-ions, and bacteria concentration thereupon. of the media tested, gf-broth gave rise to less interference by autoaggregation or higher aggregation titers than bhi and tsb, and was used throughout this study. in most cases, ca-ions (1 mm) only enhanced the rate of induced aggregation, whereas raising the bacteria concentration increased the rate of both induced- and autoaggregation. the final titers, ranging from 1-64, were hardly affected by these parameters, except those of s. rattus hg 59 and s. mutans hg 199, which were respectively increased and decreased by ca-ions. saliva-induced aggregation  was observed for 21 strains of a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. israelii, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius, s. cricetus, s. mutans, s. rattus, s. sanguis, and s. sobrinus, mostly within 15 min to 3 h. seventeen of these strains also showed autoaggregation, usually well after the onset of induced aggregation. any potential induced aggregation of b. gingivalis hg 91 was always masked by autoaggregation, as well as that of the s. mutans strains under a particular set  of conditions. the aggregation rate and titer varied considerably in a mutually unrelated and strain-dependent way. these microtiterplate data were matched by the 5 spectrophotometric patterns observed for saliva-bacterial interaction, which moreover, gave the better differentiation between induced and autoaggregation. in conclusion, most strains tested can show rapid saliva-induced aggregation in a strain-dependent way, yet strongly affected by the experimental  conditions and interference from autoaggregation.

TI  == production of mutacin-like substances by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == production of inhibitory substances by strains of the streptococcus mutans group  is well documented, but the nature of the substances implied is often unknown. of nine laboratory strains known to produce inhibitory substances, the optimal conditions for producing inhibition zones on solid media were found to vary between strains but good production was generally obtained on all-purpose media with tween 80 at 37 degrees c after 2-4 days of aerobic incubation. streptococcus sanguis ny101 was found to be more sensitive than streptococcus rattus lg-1 to all inhibitory substances produced by the s. mutans strains tested. while all strains showed some inhibition, only six showed inhibition after neutralization;  arginine incorporated in agar at 0.75% completely eliminated all inhibition zones. however 1% arginine in the overlays did not affect the production of inhibition zones by strains of s. mutans c67-1, ny257, ny266, and t8. these strains were shown to elaborate (in a reproducible fashion) inhibitory substances which were not organic acids. inhibitory activity was never obtained in liquid preparations, except for strains ny257 and t8 where it was found to be very unstable.

TI  == [in vitro study of bacterial invasion in radicular dentin].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate whether plaque bacteria invade exposed radicular dentin after root planing or chemical root treatment in vitro.  pieces of dentin were cut out from impacted third molars. the surface of all dentin pieces was treated with sandpaper (#240) so as to make the surface roughness of dentin pieces equal to that of the root surface after root planing (rp surface). half of the dentin pieces were treated with citric acid (ph 1.0) for 3 minutes (ca surface). after sterilization, each dentin piece was incubated  at 37 degrees c in a culture medium inoculated with either s. mutans or s. sanguis. after 1, 3, 7 and 28 days of incubation, the invasion of microorganisms  into the dentinal tubules was histologically examined using a light microscope. the following results were obtained. 1. the invasion of s. mutans and s. sanguis  into the dentinal tubules was observed at 1, 3, 7 and 28 days. the depth and number of bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules were positively correlated with incubation time on ca surfaces but not with rp surfaces. 2. the depth and the number of bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules were higher on the ca  surfaces than the rp surfaces. 3. since the citric acid treatment of scaled and root planed root surfaces may accelerate bacterial invasion from treated root surfaces, the use of citric acid might be harmful in patients with inadequate plaque control.

TI  == cloning and expression of an adhesin antigen of streptococcus sanguis g9b in escherichia coli.
AB  == a genomic library of streptococcus sanguis, strain g9b, was constructed and expressed in escherichia coli using a lambda gt11 expression vector. the amplified library was probed with polyclonal anti-g9b igg and 13 antigen-positive clones were isolated. a lysate of one clone, designated pp39, absorbed the adhesion-inhibitory activity of anti-g9b igg. this clone contained an insert of approximately 2000 bp and expressed unique 200 and 53 kda proteins that reacted with monospecific anti-adhesin antibody. the 200 kda protein also reacted with anti-beta-galactosidase igg, indicating that it is a fusion protein of which 84 kda represents the streptococcal adhesin. the 84 and 53 kda proteins are similar  in size to the major polypeptides in a streptococcal antigen complex which is associated with the adhesion of g9b to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. the 53 kda fragment may result from post-translational cleavage of the recombinant polypeptide.

TI  == relationship of subgingival plaque flora to lysosomal and cytoplasmic enzyme activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == examining the relationships among indicators of the acute inflammatory response in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and specific bacterial species in subgingival  plaque may provide indications of which bacterial species or groups of species may be associated with potentially destructive host-derived processes. here we report on the relationship of the subgingival plaque flora to the activity of mammalian forms of the enzymes beta-glucuronidase (beta g), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), and arylsulfatase (as) in gcf from a total of 54 4-6 mm periodontal sites  from 13 periodontitis patients. sites were scored for probing depth (pd) and bleeding on probing, and gcf was collected using filter paper strips inserted into the sulcus for 30 s, eluted in buffer and assayed for enzyme activity. 1 week later, the patients were again evaluated for pd and bleeding, and subgingival plaque was removed with a curette oriented toward the pocket epithelium. plaque samples were examined by darkfield microscopy and cultured anaerobically on selective and non-selective media. various groups of bacteria, including species of black pigmenting bacteroides (bpb), fusobacterium sp., capnocytophaga sp, streptococcus sanguis, and total facultative organisms were enumerated. relationships among the enzymes and bacterial groups expressed as colony-forming unit (cfu) counts or as a % of the total cultivable flora were assessed by spearman correlation analysis. beta g levels were significantly correlated with populations of spirochetes, b. intermedius, b. gingivalis, and total lactose negative bpb's. correlation between beta g and f. nucleatum sp. or  capnocytophaga sp. approached but did not reach statistically significant levels. in contrast, ldh activity showed a significant positive correlation with levels of b. gingivalis and total lactose negative bpb's. as levels were significantly correlated only with b. gingivalis. beta g and ldh showed a significant negative  correlation with levels of coccoid forms. thus, beta g, an acid hydrolase which can serve as a marker for primary granule release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes, was most closely correlated with the micro-organisms found in other studies to be associated with chronic adult periodontitis.

AB  == an endogenous enzyme present in cell surface extracts of streptococcus sanguis strain g9b degraded the major salivary adhesin of the organism. the enzyme showed optimal activity between 50 and 65 degrees c and was inactivated at higher temperatures. the activity at these unusually high temperatures seemed to be a consequence of release from the cell surface since intact whole g9b cells showed  greater activity at 37 degrees c. the enzyme was not found in culture supernatants of g9b cells. the ph range for the enzyme was between 5 and 9. it was inhibited by iodoacetic acid, hg2+, cu2+, edta, sds, and pmsf, but not by tlck, tpck, soybean trypsin inhibitor, cysteine, dithiothreitol, leupeptin, ca2+, mg2+ or saliva. the enzyme did not show any activity against human or rabbit igg  or human iga. enzyme activity was also found in s. sanguis strains adh- (a spontaneously occurring non-adherent mutant of g9b), and m-5.

TI  == effects of sustained-release chlorhexidine acetate on the human dental plaque flora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the effect on the human dental plaque flora of a varnish containing chlorhexidine diacetate. the in vitro release of chlorhexidine acetate from the varnish preparation was relatively fast on the first day, followed by a substantial decline in the subsequent three days. in a clinical experiment, 26 volunteers were randomly distributed over four experimental groups. after a dental prophylaxis, the subjects were treated with a single application of a placebo varnish (group i), a fluoride varnish (group ii), a chlorhexidine varnish (group iii), or a fluoride-plus-chlorhexidine varnish (group iv). saliva and pooled plaque samples from approximal surfaces were taken  before (baseline) and one, two, three, four, and six weeks after the treatments.  no suppression was found of total cultivable flora or s. sanguis after the experimental treatments. application of the fluoride varnish did not suppress the a. viscosus/naeslundii or s. mutans levels in the dental plaque. chlorhexidine suppressed a. viscosus/naeslundii until two weeks after the treatment. s. mutans  was significantly suppressed until four weeks after a single chlorhexidine application. while in some subjects s. mutans was effectively suppressed over the whole experimental period, in others s. mutans recovered quickly. in five subjects in whom s. mutans recovered quickly, the dentition was treated twice with chlorhexidine varnish, with an interval of one week between the treatments.  after two chlorhexidine treatments, s. mutans in saliva and on the teeth was suppressed more strongly than after a single treatment. however, the second chlorhexidine treatment could not prevent the return of s. mutans in the approximal areas to its original level.

TI  == isolation of a corncob (coaggregation) receptor polypeptide from fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == corncobs, which are distinct morphological units formed by the ordered coaggregation of a filamentous microorganism and streptococci, can be made in vitro by using oral strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus sanguis. previous studies have shown that strains of f. nucleatum contain one of at least  two different types of corncob receptor. the objective of this study was to isolate the receptor from f. nucleatum atcc 10953 as the first step in the elucidation of the molecular basis of corncob formation. the cell envelope fraction from this bacterium was treated with trypsin, delipidated with chloroform-methanol, and subjected to ion-exchange chromatography. a single polypeptide (apparent mr, 39,500), which was eluted from the column with 0.5 m sodium chloride and extracted with dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide to remove contaminating lipopolysaccharide, inhibited corncob formation between strain atcc 10953 and s. sanguis cc5a. similarly derived cell fractions from either f. nucleatum fdc 364 or fusobacterium necrophorum failed to effect coaggregation in  the inhibition assay. amino acid analysis of the polypeptide showed a moderately  hydrophobic character (polarity index, 41) and 11% basic residues. antiserum made against the purified polypeptide agglutinated f. nucleatum atcc 10953, neutralized the ability of this bacterium to form corncobs, and agglutinated whole cells of s. sanguis cc5a that were precoated with the receptor polypeptide. the identification and isolation of this receptor should greatly enhance our ability to define some of the complex intergeneric coaggregation mechanisms that  are thought to occur in the human oral cavity.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

TI  == aspects of dental plaque formation with special reference to colloid-chemical phenomena.
AB  == in order to investigate factors of importance for plaque formation and the rate of plaque formation 133 randomly selected individuals went through a 3-day period of plaque accumulation. from these individuals one group of "heavy" and one group of "light" plaque formers were selected for further studies. these subjects were  investigated with reference to clinical, biochemical, biophysical and microbiological variables, that in the literature have been suggested to influence plaque formation. the collected data were analysed statistically both by comparisons between the two groups and by multiple regression. in the comparative analyses there were only minor differences between the groups, and no single studied variable was considered as the only explanation to the great difference in the amount of plaque formed after 3 days between "heavy" and "light" plaque formers. the multiple regression showed that the initial bacterial colonization of tooth surfaces was dependent on the clinical wettability of tooth surfaces, the saliva-induced aggregation of oral bacteria and finally the relative salivary flow conditions around the tooth surfaces where the bacterial samples were collected. on basis of these results, it was suggested that saliva and oral bacteria could at least partly be looked upon as being a biological colloid system system. further studies were designed to investigate whether oral  bacteria could be regarded as colloid particles or not, and to study the properties of saliva as a colloid suspending medium. these studies showed that bacteria suspended in different salt solutions were dependent on ph, ionic concentration and the valency of the cations in the solutions to be able to aggregate. the aggregating capacity further seemed to be specific for different bacterial species and strains. addition of saliva from "heavy" and "light" plaque formers influenced the colloid stability of bacteria suspended in water in different ways. saliva from "light" plaque formers gave a lower colloid stability in suspensions of a plaque-forming bacterium (streptococcus sanguis) as compared  to the addition of saliva from "heavy" plaque formers. no such differences were observed in suspensions of s. salivarius, which is normally not a plaque-forming  bacterium. the results indicate that colloid-chemical processes might be involved in bacterial attachment to tooth surfaces, and that initial bacterial colonization of tooth surfaces at least partly follow general biophysical laws.

AB  == streptococcus mutans is known to be one of the most cariogenic oral microorganisms. recently, organisms classified as s. mutans have been shown to be genotypically heterogeneous and to form at least six separate species. in this study, differences in acid production between the mutans streptococci and streptococcus sanguis were investigated at ph values from 5.0 to 7.0. while all of the species investigated were able to produce acids, streptococcus sobrinus was found to be significantly more acidogenic than the others. s. sobrinus was capable of sustained acid production at ph levels below 6.0, while acid production by other species ceased or was strongly inhibited. these results indicate that s. sobrinus deserves more attention as a potentially cariogenic microorganism.

AB  == lactate influx was measured in streptococcus sanguis and in several strains of streptococcus mutans by comparing the intra- and extracellular distribution of (14c)-lactate. lactate efflux was followed enzymatically against rising external  lactate concentration. the glucose concentration was monitored in the same way. with s. sanguis omz 9, lactate was transported into the cells when a high external lactate concentration and a ph gradient were established. the transport  rate was approximately 1,000 nmol lactate per minute and milligram protein. no lactate influx could be measured with four strains of the 's. mutans group' (omz  51, 634, t3/13 and nctc 10449). metabolizing cells of s. mutans nctc 10449 were able to transport lactate even against an external lactate concentration of 92 mmol/l at ph = 7. the transport rates ranged from 1,200 to 750 nmol lactate/min mg protein decreasing with increasing external lactate concentration. while an external ph = 9 had little influence on transport, transport rates decreased to 440 nmol/min mg protein at ph = 5.

TI  == the effect of chlorhexidine on streptococcus sanguis biofilms.
AB  == the bactericidal effect of chlorhexidine on streptococcus sanguis biofilms was investigated and compared with its effect on suspensions of the organism. the biofilms were found to be more resistant to the bactericidal effects of chlorhexidine than the bacterial suspensions in terms of the number of surviving  organisms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) being 25 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively, for the suspension and the 24 h biofilm. the age of  the biofilm had a marked effect on the number of bacteria surviving. older (72 h) biofilms tended to be more resistant to chlorhexidine than younger (24 h) ones, with the mic being 200 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. addition of blood to the test system greatly reduced the bactericidal effect of the chlorhexidine, increasing the mic for the 24 h biofilm from 50 to 200 micrograms/ml.

TI  == effect of neuraminidase on the adherence to salivary pellicle of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis.
AB  == neuraminidase-sensitive adherence to experimental salivary pellicles was studied  using eight strains of streptococcus sanguis and five strains of streptococcus mitis. approximately 60% of the strains of each species showed significantly lower adherence to neuraminidase-treated versus untreated saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. in addition, the adherence of several of these streptococcal strains to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and neuraminidase-treated saliva-coated hydroxyapatite was inhibited using galactose and n-acetyl-d-galactosamine. results from these studies suggested that several salivary receptors mediate adherence of these species.

TI  == zeta potential and the adhesion of oral streptococci to polymethylmethacrylate.
AB  == adhesion of candida albicans to the acrylic fitting surface of dentures can lead  to the development of denture induced stomatitis and is suggested to be preceeded by the adhesion of indegeneous oral bacteria. bacterial adhesion can be considered as a result of attractive van der waals and repulsive electrostatic forces. in this paper we investigate the role of electrostatic interactions in the adhesion of oral streptococci to polymethylmethacrylate (pmma), the most commonly employed denture-base material. zeta potentials of the bacterial strains as well as of pmma fillings were reduced by increasing the ionic strength in the  buffer suspension, causing an elevated number of adhering s. mitis, s. sanguis and s. mutans. as streptococcal adhesion is suggested to be a prerequisite for the subsequent adhesion of candida albicans, the use of more negatively charged denture-base materials can be recommended in order to prevent streptococcal adhesion and therewith adhesion of candidae, and the occurrence of denture-induced stomatitis.

TI  == comparison of different assays for the aggregation of oral bacteria by human whole saliva.
AB  == for comparison, human whole saliva-induced aggregation was studied by phase-contrast microscopy, spectrophotometry combined with macroscopic observations, and in microtiterplate assay under identical experimental conditions for actinomyces viscosus hg 85 (t14-v) and hg 380 (t14-av), bacteroides gingivalis hg 66 (w 83), streptococcus rattus hg 59 (bht), and streptococcus sanguis i hg 169. the entire process of formation, extension, and sedimentation of aggregates could merely be observed by the combination of these  assays. the very first stages of aggregation could only be detected and quantitated by phase-contrast microscopy. within 2 1/2 min, 50% of the a. viscosus, s. rattus, and s. sanguis cells were aggregated, denoted as t50. in microtiterplates, however, aggregates were observed in general only after sedimentation at 30-45 min of incubation, expressed as ta. for interpretation of  the spectrophotometric curves, additional microscopic and macroscopic data were a prerequisite. the small decline in absorbance during the first 30-45 min (phase 1) corresponded to the formation and extension of nonsedimenting aggregates, whereas the subsequent pronounced fall in absorbance (phase 2) was caused by the  massive sedimentation of aggregates. the moment of inflexion between both phases, ti, marked the onset of sedimentation of aggregates and corresponded very well with ta, at which time already 92-98% of the cells were aggregated as quantitated by microscopy. in conclusion, only by microscopy the formation and extension of aggregates could be observed within a few minutes and quantitated in terms of aggregation rate. from 30-45 min, merely the sedimentation of aggregates was visualized in microtiterplates, whereas the time course of the overall process was recorded indirectly by spectrophotometry.

TI  == genetic transformation in some cariogenic streptococcus milleri.
AB  == only one of six streptococcus milleri strains, known to produce dental caries in  gnotobiotic rats, was found to be spontaneously transformable. at optimal competence (after 60 min incubation in transformation medium) dna uptake by this  strain, cr 287, was rapid; maximum dna was taken up by cells within 15 min of its addition to give a transformation frequency of 1 x 10(-2) transformants per colony-forming unit (cfu). with post-optimally competent cells, the rate of dna uptake was markedly decreased, although a transformation frequency similar to that of optimally competent cells was obtained. for example, after 240 min incubation in transformation medium the cells required approximately 90 min to reach maximum dna uptake and gave a transformation frequency of 6 x 10(-3) transformants per cfu. cultures retained the ability to give their maximum transformation frequency for at least 4 h, but only if a dna-cell contact time of 2 h was used. strain cr 287 and s. milleri strain nctc 10707, a transformable non-cariogenic strain, produced competence factor (cf). the cf of cr 287, but not that of nctc 10707, induced high competence in the non-spontaneously transformable cariogenic s. milleri strain nctc 11169. like s. sanguis, s. milleri must therefore produce cfs of different constitutional types. the three transformable strains could be transformed by plasmid shuttle cloning vector pva838 dna.

TI  == a comparison between the elemental surface compositions and electrokinetic properties of oral streptococci with and without adsorbed salivary constituents.
AB  == in order to characterize the functional cell surface, isoelectric points and elemental surface concentration, the ratios of nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus to carbon of saliva-coated strains were determined by ph-dependent zeta potential measurements and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and compared with those of uncoated strains. the measurements of potential were carried out on completely hydrated cells, whereas the spectroscopy was on freeze-dried micro-organisms. the small increase in the nitrogen:carbon surface concentration ratio of saliva-coated streptococci in comparison to uncoated strains varied from 0.001 (streptococcus mitis ba) to 0.029 (streptococcus sanguis ch3) and was concurrent  with an increase of the isoelectric point, ranging from 0.0 to 0.9. increases in  the oxygen:carbon ratio ranged from 0.006 (strep. mitis ba) to 0.041 (streptococcus mutans ns), whereas the phosphorus:carbon surface concentration ratio was unchanged after saliva treatment. despite the fact that isoelectric and compositional measurements were made in different states of surface hydration, a  decrease in the nitrogen:carbon ratio accompanied by an increase in oxygen:carbon ratio, was related to a decrease of the isoelectric point of the saliva-coated strains, and so analogous with previous observations for uncoated strains. although there were changes in the physico-chemical properties of the strains upon saliva coating, all more or less kept their own surface identity despite adsorption of salivary constituents, possibly indicating some capacity to protect their own physico-chemical identity.

TI  == interaction of streptococcal lipoteichoic acid with artificial tooth pellicle.
AB  == artificial pellicles were prepared by coating hydroxyapatite beads with whole saliva. radiolabelled lipoteichoic acid was isolated from streptococcus sanguis nctc 7863 by phenol extraction. various concentrations of radiolabelled lipoteichoic acid were mixed with saliva-coated hydroxyapatite in the presence and absence of high ionic strength phosphate buffer, bovine serum albumin, gelatin, unlabelled lipoteichoic acid, tween 20 and triton x-100. the amount of lipoteichoic acid binding was measured by counting the residual radioactivity of  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite after thorough washing. in one experiment the binding was measured in the presence of a mucinous glycoprotein isolated from human saliva. the data were analysed by means of scatchard and double reciprocal  plots of the bound and unbound fraction of lipoteichoic acid. the lipoteichoic acid interacted hydrophobically with the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite; the interaction was complex with multiple binding sites exhibiting a range of affinities. the mean association constant was 1.1 x 10(9) m-1 and the minimum number of binding sites was 3.9 x 10(12)/mm2 of artificial pellicle. the salivary mucin competitively inhibited the interaction, which suggests that this may be one of the salivary components involved.

AB  == enterococcus faecium bm4165 and bm4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (ly146032). strain bm4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin b-type (mls) antibiotics. the genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to mls antibiotics in strain bm4165 were carried  on plasmids pip819 and pip821, respectively; pip819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to mls antibiotics. the two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other e. faecium strains. plasmid pip819 could also conjugate to e. faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, s. pyogenes, s. lactis, and listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to s. aureus. glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.

AB  == physicochemical surface characteristics of early plaque-forming bacteria and of human tooth surfaces were measured to establish their role in bacterial adhesion  to intact dental tissue slabs. in addition, the influence of an experimental salivary pellicle was evaluated. strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, a. viscosus, and a. odontolyticus showed relatively high surface free energies (range, 99-128 mj.m-2) and carried a negative surface charge, at both physiological (mu = 0.057) and low (mu = 0.020) ionic strengths of the medium. very large differences in hydrophobicity were detected when the hexadecane adsorption test was used for measurement. powdered enamel and dentin were also negatively charged at low ionic strength but were slightly positively charged in  the physiological buffer. the surface free energy of enamel and dentin increased  upon saliva coating, whereas the surface charge was always negative. the adhesion experiments showed: (1) large differences in the binding of various bacteria to the same surface; (2) an up to 20-fold difference in the binding of the same bacterium to different surfaces, although the binding of some strains was relatively independent of the type of surface or presence of a salivary pellicle; (3) a significant decrease in adhesion when the ionic strength of the medium was  lowered, due to increased electrostatic repulsion (however, the adhesion of some  bacteria was independent of the ionic strength of the medium); (4) different time-dependent adherence kinetics, depending on both the bacteria and nature of the solid surface; and (5) a propensity for plaque streptococci to bind to uncoated dentin.

TI  == utilization of a continuous streptococcal surface to measure interbacterial adherence in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == cell-to-cell interactions are essential for the formation of dental plaque. a continuous layer of streptococcus sanguis sa-1 cells fixed to a solid surface has been used to evaluate interactions among this bacterium, haemophilus parainfluenzae, and streptococcus sobrinus. s. sanguis cells were attached to a falcon 3001 tissue culture plates or bovine enamel chips, coated with a biological adhesive. scanning electron microscopy of the chips showed the streptococci as a contiguous surface. radiolabeled bacteria were used to measure  a second-species interbacterial adherence to the streptococcal-coated culture plates. strains of h. parainfluenzae known to coaggregate (strain hp-28) and not  to coaggregate (strains hp-42 and hp-80), in suspension with s. sanguis strain sa-1, were studied for adherence. ten-fold-higher numbers of coaggregating strain hp-28 adhered in vitro to the streptococcal layer than did the non-coaggregating  strains. s. sobrinus strain 6715 did not show appreciable adherence to the s. sanguis surface. saliva did not affect the adherence of coaggregating or non-coaggregating h. parainfluenzae strains to s. sanguis strain sa-1. bovine enamel chips, coated with streptococci, mounted on modified orthodontic appliances and placed in the mouths of three volunteers, facilitated the measurement of interbacterial adherence in vivo of streptomycin-resistant strains of h. parainfluenzae (hp-28r or hp-42r). suspensions of bacteria were placed into the mouth, distributed throughout, and expectorated. after 15 or 120 minutes, the appliance with the chips was removed, the chips sonified, and colony-forming units (cfu) of streptomycin-resistant haemophili determined per chip.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == specific and nonspecific inhibition of adhesion of oral actinomyces and streptococci to erythrocytes and polystyrene by caseinoglycopeptide derivatives.
AB  == various caseinoglycopeptide derivatives prepared from mammalian milk were evaluated as inhibitors of hemagglutinations mediated by actinomyces viscosus ny1, streptococcus sanguis omz9, and, for comparative purposes, plant lectins from arachis hypogaea and bauhinia purpurea. it was found that recognition of the beta-d-galactose-(1----3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactose carbohydrate chain by actinomyces viscosus ny1 organisms and arachis hypogaea and b. purpurea agglutinins had similar structural requirements; in all cases, the desialylated bovine caseinoglycomacropeptide, on which several units of the above mentioned disaccharide are clustered, behaved as the most potent hemagglutination inhibitor. by contrast, none of the preparations tested inhibited erythrocyte agglutination by s. sanguis omz9. thus, the desialylated bovine caseinoglycomacropeptide acts as a potent and specific inhibitor of oral actinomyces adhesion to cell membranes (a soft surface) and could be used as a probe for the study of recognition mechanisms mediated by actinomyces galactose-binding lectins. during the present study, both native and desialylated variants of the same bovine glycomacropeptide also totally prevented the adhesion of actinomyces viscosus ny1, s. sanguis omz9, and s. mutans omz176 to polystyrene surfaces. comparative evaluations of various structurally different compounds gave the following results. neither mono- nor disaccharides related to caseinoglycopeptide carbohydrates prevented adhesion; highly positively or negatively charged polypeptides and polysaccharides were either not or only moderately active. besides these glycomacropeptides, an inhibitory activity was also exhibited by other mucin-type glycoproteins carrying short o-linked carbohydrate chains (including bovine submaxillary mucin), polyethylene glycol, and bovine serum albumin. consequently, caseinoglycopeptide prevention of oral bacterial adhesion to polystyrene tubes (a hard surface) takes place with no species specificity and can be compared to nonspecific inhibition exhibited by various polymers with very different structural characteristics.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and production of inhibitory substances among bacterial strains isolated from the oral cavities of balb/c mice.
AB  == in the oral cavities of balb/c mice, microbial population levels are regulated by multifactorial processes. factors include the production of inhibitory substances and the exchange of genetic material. in this work, 371 isolates from different sites (saliva, tongue, teeth, and mucosa) of the oral cavities of balb/c mice were screened for resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobial activity. antibiotic-resistant strains represented 25% of the total flora. among the predominant species, all the s. faecalis isolates showed multiresistance, and 23% of the lactobacillus murinus isolates and 15% of the staphylococcus aureus were resistant to at least one antibiotic. resistance to aminoglycosides (neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin) was most frequently encountered. in s. faecalis, high levels of resistance were recorded to neomycin and streptomycin but not to gentamicin or kanamycin. macrolides (m), lincosamides (l), streptogramin b (s), tetracycline (tc), and chloramphenicol (cm) resistance was also present in multiresistance patterns, especially among s. faecalis isolates.  hemolytic (hly+) streptococci were less resistant to mls, tc, and cm than were non-hemolytic (hly-) isolates. resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was detected only among staphylococci and with a low prevalence (4%). the frequencies of strains producing antimicrobial substances against the indicator strains (s. mutans lg-1, s. sanguis ny 101, and a. viscosus ny 1) were high for l. murinus (76%) and s. faecalis (57% for hly- and 90% for hly+), but low for s. aureus (7%). these results indicate that the indigenous oral flora could interfere with  colonization by allochthonous micro-organisms and that resistance patterns should be taken into account for the elimination of the oral indigenous flora by antibiotic treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == high-molecular-weight polymers of alpha-1,6-linked d-glucans are insoluble in alcohol solutions. whole, but not parotid, saliva prevented the precipitation of  d-glucans by 80% (vol/vol) ethanol, showing that the whole saliva contained a factor which complexed with the glucan to render it alcohol soluble. the glucan-binding factor was retained on a column of sephacryl s-200 which had been  preequilibrated with 80% ethanol. the factor was then eluted with water. passive  hemagglutination assays revealed that the glucan-binding factor could sensitize erythrocytes to agglutination with anti-poly(glycerolphosphate), suggesting that  the active glucan-binding component with lipoteichoic acid. the glucan-solubilizing factor was resistant to heat (100 degrees c), proteases, sialidase, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, trichloroacetic acid, and triton x-100. when sucrose was added to saliva, a suspension of streptococcus cricetus aht, or  a suspension of streptococcus sanguis 10556, relatively large amounts of glucan-binding factor were released in a soluble form. in addition, penicillin g  caused the release of the glucan-solubilizing component from a suspension of s. cricetus aht. it is suggested that whole saliva contains a component, tentatively identified as lipoteichoic acid, which can complex with glucans in a relatively hydrophobic solvent. this type of complex formation may be important in the adhesion of oral streptococci to saliva-coated surfaces.

AB  == mutants of actinomyces viscosus t14v lacking type 1 or type 2 fimbriae or both were selected by their failure to react with rabbit antibodies against either or  both fimbrial antigens. immunospecific double labeling with iron dextran and ferritin-conjugated antibodies showed two types of fimbriae on individual cells of the parent organism, a single type on mutant strains with type 1+2- and type 1-2+ fimbriae and no labeled or unlabeled fimbriae on a type 1-2- fimbria-deficient strain. the mutational loss of one fimbrial antigen did not appear to affect expression of the other, since bacteria with one or two types of fimbriae bound similar amounts of a monoclonal antibody directed against the fimbrial antigen present on both bacterial phenotypes. the strong adsorption of strains with type 1+2+ or 1+2- fimbriae to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite and weak adsorption of those with type 1-2+ or no fimbriae was consistent with the known involvement of type 1 fimbriae in this attachment process. similarly, the a. viscosus lectin was clearly associated with the expression of type 2 fimbriae, since only the strains with type 1+2+ or 1-2+ fimbriae participated in lactose-sensitive coaggregations with streptococcus sanguis 34. further studies using the fimbria-deficient mutant strains showed that aggregation of a. viscosus t14v in the presence of sialidase-treated human saliva involved both types of fimbriae, whereas neither type was required for the lactose-resistant coaggregation of the organism with certain streptococcal strains.

TI  == the effects of periodontal therapy on serum antibody (igg) levels to plaque microorganisms.
AB  == the influence of periodontal therapy on serum antibody titers to selected periodontal disease-associated microorganisms was assessed in 23 patients having  chronic inflammatory periodontal disease (cipd). the immunoglobulin g (igg) titers were determined by the microelisa technique in serum samples obtained prior to treatment; following a hygienic phase which included scaling, root planing, and oral hygiene instruction; following surgical treatment; and one year and two years following hygienic phase (maintenance phase). considerable individual variability existed in the magnitude of immune response to specific bacterial preparations. significant reductions in the mean antibody titers were seen to a. viscosus, s. sanguis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius, b. melaninogenicus, t. vincentii, and t. denticola by the end of the second year of maintenance. there was no consistent response to capnocytophaga. when individual patient responses were examined, 6 of the 23 were found to have elevated titers to at least one of the microorganisms in the interval between pretreatment and the end of the hygienic phase; however, in all but one case, the titers at the end of the second year of maintenance were below pretreatment levels. antibody levels to bacteria such as s. sanguis were modified during therapy. this would indicate that immune responses to microbes not generally considered to be "periodontal pathogens" may be modified by adjuvant activity associated with subgingival plaque or changes in the environment of the sulcus and that subsequent changes in titer do not necessarily reflect a role of that microorganism in the disease process.

TI  == differential modulation of adherence of oral streptococci by human neutrophil myeloperoxidase.
AB  == in this study, the modulation of adherence of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2)-producing  and non-h2o2-producing strains of oral streptococci by the host leukocyte enzyme  myeloperoxidase (mpo) was examined. it was found that exposure to mpo decreased adherence of many strains of oral streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads in the presence of exogenous h2o2 and chloride. the mpo-h2o2-cl-system increased the adherence of one strain. in the absence of exogenous h2o2, the mpo-h2o2-cl-system decreased the adherence of h2o2-producing strains only. glucose increased streptococcal h2o2 production and also increased the anti-adhesive activity of mpo in the absence of exogenous h2o2. we conclude that: (1) host leukocytes can modulate the adherence of oral streptococci via mpo; (2)  endogenous production of h2o2 by the oral streptococci can provide sufficient substrate h2o2 to drive this system; and (3) mpo will exert differential modulatory effects on the adherence of oral streptococci, based in part upon the  level of endogenous h2o2 production and in part upon the particular characteristics of the adhesins of the bacteria.

TI  == cloning and expression of a streptococcus sanguis surface antigen that interacts  with a human salivary agglutinin.
AB  == human saliva contains a high-molecular-weight glycoprotein (agglutinin) which binds to specific streptococci in a calcium-dependent reaction leading to the formation of bacterial aggregates. we report the cloning of a gene encoding a surface antigen from streptococcus sanguis m5 and show that the expressed protein inhibits agglutinin-mediated aggregation and specifically binds the salivary agglutinin in a calcium-dependent fashion. clones isolated from the immunological screening of s. sanguis m5 genomic libraries with polyclonal antibodies against whole cells were assayed for the ability to compete with s. sanguis for agglutinin. one clone, pssp-5, expressed antigens of 165 and 130 kilodaltons (kda) possessing this activity. a 3-kilobase-pair (kbp) insert fragment from this clone was used to screen a genomic library in lambda embl3 which resulted in the  isolation of clone ssp-5a. this clone contained an insert of 17 kb and expressed  proteins of 170 to 205 kda that reacted with the anti-s. sanguis antibodies. subcloning of a 5.3-kbp ecori-bamhi fragment from ssp-5a produced peb-5, which expressed streptococcal components that were indistinguishable from ssp-5a. the streptococcal antigen was purified by gel permeation and ion exchange chromatography and shown to potently compete with s. sanguis m5 cells for agglutinin. the antigen also bound purified salivary agglutinin in the presence of 1 mm cacl2. this binding was inhibited by edta. both the ssp-5 antigen and a 205-kda protein in surface protein extracts from s. sanguis m5 cross-reacted with antibodies directed against antigen b from s. mutans and spaa from s. sobrinus 6715. these results indicate that a 205-kda surface protein that is antigenically related to spaa and antigen b is involved in the binding of salivary agglutinin to s. sanguis m5.

TI  == adherence of streptococcus sanguis to conformationally specific determinants in fibronectin.
AB  == the adherence of streptococcus sanguis to specific receptors exposed or deposited at the site of endothelial damage may play an important role in the development of infective endocarditis. adherence of the challis strain of s. sanguis to gelatin (or collagen) and gelatin-binding components of plasma was examined with  an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. s. sanguis adhered poorly to immobilized gelatin and to molecular or fibrillar collagen. however, in the presence of fresh human plasma, the adherence of s. sanguis to all three substrates increased as much as eightfold. removal of gelatin-binding proteins eliminates the ability of  plasma to enhance adherence of s. sanguis to the substrates. addition of purified human plasma fibronectin (fn) to the absorbed plasma restored the adherence-promoting ability in a dose-dependent manner. a similar dose-dependent  increase in s. sanguis adherence was observed when increasing concentrations of fn alone were added to the gelatin-coated assay wells. s. sanguis adherence to immobilized fibronectin could not be inhibited by preincubating either the bacteria or the gelatin-coated assay wells with fn or by including excess soluble fn in the assay mixture. studies with peptides purified from trypsin digests of fn indicated that the 160- to 180-kilodalton (kda) fragments which retain both the gelatin-binding and the cell-binding regions of the intact molecule support adherence of s. sanguis to gelatin. the 160- to 180-kda fragments inhibited the interaction of s. sanguis with immobilized fn. in contrast, intact fn and the 31-kda amino-terminal fragment were unable to inhibit the adherence when used in  equivalent or greater molar amounts. these in vitro results suggest that in the presence of whole plasma, s. sanguis binds to immobilized gelatin or collagen via fn bound to the immobilized substrates. our finding that adherence of s. sanguis  to immobilized fn can occur in the presence of large concentrations of fn, whether in plasma or purified, indicates that a s. sanguis-binding domain is cryptic in the fn molecule while in solution and is exposed by a conformational change when the fn becomes bound to gelatin-coated plastic. the ability of peptide fragments of fn to inhibit s. sanguis adherence is consistent with this hypothesis.

TI  == characterization of an adhesion antigen of streptococcus sanguis g9b.
AB  == an antigen possessing the attributes of an adhesion has been identified in streptococcus sanguis g9b. cell surface components were extracted from g9b and a  spontaneously occurring nonadherent mutant of g9b, strain adh-, with a 2 mm barbital buffer, ph 8.6. the extract of g9b but not of adh- absorbed more than 80% of the adhesion-inhibitory activity of anti-g9b immunoglobulin g (igg). immunoblots revealed 80- and 52-kilodalton (kda) antigens present in the g9b extract but not in the adh- extract. absorption of anti-g9b igg with adh- and g9b barbital extracts showed a correlation between the loss of the 80- and 52-kda antibodies and the loss of adhesion-inhibitory activity. an antibody prepared against the 80-kda antigen excised from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels recognized the 80- and 52-kda antigens and another antigen of 62 kda but did not inhibit adhesion. however, an antibody from an electroblot containing the native protein from which the 80-kda and related antigens were derived (the 80-kda antigen complex) inhibited adhesion to the same extent as anti-g9b igg. periodate oxidation of the g9b barbital extract modified the 80-kda antigen complex and resulted in the loss of 40% of its absorbing activity. the barbital extract also contained an endogenous enzyme responsible for producing the 62- and 52-kda antigens from the 80-kda protein and which, under optimal conditions, degraded the antigen completely, resulting in the loss of antibody-absorbing activity. the 80-kda antigen complex has a molecular mass of more than 200 kda in native polyacrylamide gels and a pi of 4.1 to 4.8. these observations suggest that the adhesion antigen in s. sanguis g9b is a large glycoprotein from which an 80-kda antigen complex is derived.

(cluster x) or the combination of s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, v. parvula and s. intermedius (cluster ii) were made up of sites which exhibited less active disease and responded more  favorably to therapy. sites in other clusters exhibited moderate levels of prior  destructive disease and disease activity status closer to the mean values for all 250 sites.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == coaggregation properties of human oral veillonella spp.: relationship to colonization site and oral ecology.
AB  == the primary habitats of oral veillonellae are the tongue, dental plaque, and the  buccal mucosa. isolates were obtained from each habitat and tested for coaggregation with a battery of other oral bacterial strains. all 59 tongue isolates tested for coaggregation were veillonella atypica or veillonella dispar. all but one of them coaggregated with strains of streptococcus salivarius, a predominant inhabitant of the tongue surface but not subgingival dental plaque. these tongue isolates were unable to coaggregate with most normal members of the  subgingival flora such as actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and streptococcus sanguis. in contrast, 24 of 29 veillonella isolates, of which 20 were veillonella parvula from subgingival dental plaque samples, coaggregated strongly with the three species of actinomyces, s. sanguis, and other bacteria usually present in subgingival plaque, but they did not coaggregate with s. salivarius. the majority of isolates from the buccal mucosa (42 of 55) has coaggregation properties like those from the tongue. these results indicate that the three human oral veillonella species  are distributed on oral surfaces that are also occupied by their coaggregation partners and thus provide strong evidence that coaggregation plays a critical role in the bacterial ecology of the oral cavity.

AB  == the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis against endocarditis was assessed by  testing the bactericidal and bacteriostatic action in serum of 12 healthy volunteers who had taken the recommended antibiotics according to laid down guidelines. blood was obtained from these subjects every two hours for 12 hours after oral intake of amoxicillin (3 g as a single dose), clindamycin (600 mg a single dose) or erythromycin (1.5 g plus another 0.5 g after six hours), the serum being tested against three strep. viridans strains. two of the three strains were "tolerant", i.e. in relation to the minimal inhibition concentration (mic) their growth was inhibited, but--in relation to the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc)--they were not killed. a bacteriostatic effect by amoxicillin and clindamycin was demonstrated by a micromethod against all three strains during the 12-hour period. but erythromycin did not achieve bacteriostasis in all serum samples. a bactericidal effect was demonstrated only in those samples that  contained amoxicillin, and then only against the non-tolerant of the three strains. these results support the view that amoxicillin and clindamycin are effective in the prophylaxis against strep. viridans bacteraemia because of their constant bacteriostatic effect, as measured in serum.

TI  == role of the arginine deiminase system in protecting oral bacteria and an enzymatic basis for acid tolerance.
AB  == the arginine deiminase system was found to function in protecting bacterial cells against the damaging effects of acid environments. for example, as little as 2.9  mm arginine added to acidified suspensions of streptococcus sanguis at a ph of 4.0 resulted in ammonia production and protection against killing. the arginine deiminase system was found to have unusual acid tolerance in a variety of lactic  acid bacteria. for example, for streptococcus rattus fa-1, the ph at which arginolysis was reduced to 10% of the maximum was between 2.1 and 2.6, or more than 1 full ph unit below the minimum for glycolysis (ph 3.7), and more than 2 units below the minimum for growth in complex medium (ph 4.7). the acid tolerance of the arginine deiminase system appeared to be primarily molecular and to depend on the tolerance of individual enzymes rather than on the membrane physiology of  the bacteria; ph profiles for the activities of arginine deiminase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, and carbamate kinase in permeabilized cells showed that the enzymes were active at phs of 3.1 or somewhat lower. overall, it appeared that ammonia could be produced from arginine at low ph values, even by cells with damaged membranes, and that the ammonia could then protect the cells against acid damage until the environmental ph value rose sufficiently to allow for the reestablishment of a difference in ph (delta ph) across the cell membrane.

AB  == coaggregation between actinomyces viscosus t14v and streptococcus sanguis 34 depends on interaction of a lectin on a. viscosus t14v with a cell surface carbohydrate on s. sanguis 34. this carbohydrate was isolated, and its chemical makeup was established. the carbohydrate remained attached to s. sanguis 34 cells through extraction with triton x-100 and treatment with pronase. it was cleaved from the cell residue by autoclaving and purified by differential centrifugation  and column chromatography on deae-sephacel and sephadex g-75. the polysaccharide  contained phosphate which was neither inorganic nor monoester. treatment with naoh-nabh4, followed by escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, or with 48% hf at  4 degrees c, followed by nabh4, yielded inorganic phosphate and oligosaccharide alditols. therefore, the polysaccharide is composed of oligosaccharide units joined together by phosphodiester bridges. the structure and stereochemistry of the main oligosaccharide alditol was established previously (f. c. mcintire, c. a. bush, s.-s. wu, s.-c. li, y.-t. li, m. mcneil, s. tjoa, and p. v. fennessey, carbohydr. res. 166:133-143). permethylation analysis, 1h and 31p nuclear magnetic resonance studies on the whole polysaccharide revealed the position of the phosphodiester linkages. the polysaccharide is mainly a polymer of (6) galnac(alpha 1-3)rha(beta 1-4)glc(beta 1-6)galf(beta 1-6)galnac(beta 1- 3)gal(alpha 1)-opo3. it reacted as a single antigen with antiserum to s. sanguis  34 cells and was a potent inhibitor of coaggregation between a. viscosus t14v and s. sanguis 34. quantitative inhibition of precipitation assays with oligosaccharides, o-allyl n-acetylgalactosaminides, and simple sugars indicated that specific antibodies were directed to the galnac end of the hexasaccharide unit. in contrast, coaggregation was inhibited much more effectively by saccharides containing betagalnac. thus, the specificity of the a. viscosus t14v  lectin is strikingly different from that of antibodies directed against the s. sanguis 34 polysaccharide.

TI  == cloning of a streptococcus sanguis adhesin which mediates binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  == chromosomal dna from a salivary aggregating strain of streptococcus sanguis 12 was partially digested with psti and ligated into the plasmid vector puc18 and transformed into escherichia coli jm83. a total of 1,700 recombinant clones of e. coli were examined by a colony immunoassay with antisera raised against either s. sanguis 12 whole cells or s. sanguis 12 surface fibrils. five clones which reacted with one or the other antiserum were shown to be unique by western blotting (immunoblotting) and restriction endonuclease digestion. one recombinant plasmid psa2 expressed two proteins with mrs of 20,000 and 36,000. the 36,000-mr  protein has been designated ssab. both proteins were purified to homogeneity by sephadex g-75 and ion-exchange chromatography. the proteins were present in mutanolysin digests of whole-cell lysates of s. sanguis 12 and in the non-saliva-aggregating variant 12na and the hydrophilic variant 12l. polyclonal antiserum raised against the ssab protein reacted strongly with the cell surfaces of s. sanguis 12 and 12na but not with that of 12l. ssab inhibited the adhesion of s. sanguis 12na to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite, indicating that the adhesin mediates the binding to the ph-sensitive receptor.

TI  == the predominant cultivable microbiota of active and inactive lesions of destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were taken from active and inactive lesions in 33 subjects exhibiting active destructive periodontal diseases. active diseased sites were those which showed a significant loss of attachment within a 2-month interval as computed by the "tolerance method". the predominant cultivable species from 100 active sites were compared with those found in 150 inactive sites of comparable pocket depth and attachment level loss. among the 33 subjects, w. recta, b. intermedius, f. nucleatum, b. gingivalis and b. forsythus  were elevated more often in active sites; whereas, s. mitis, c. ochracea, s. sanguis ii, v. parvula and an unnamed actinomyces sp. were elevated in inactive sites. the likelihood of a site being active was increased if b. forsythus, b. gingivalis, p. micros, a. actinomycetemcomitans, w. recta, or b. intermedius were detected in that site, and decreased if s. sanguis ii, the actinomyces sp., or c. ochracea were detected.

TI  == adherence of streptococci to surface-modified glass.
AB  == four types of surface-modified glass were prepared. aminopropyl glass was prepared by alkylsilylation of glass slides with gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. this glass carries primary amino groups which may be protonated at ph 7.2. owing to the presence of both positively charged ions and hydrophobic ethoxyl groups, the glass is considered to be amphipathic. three other types of surface-modified glass slides were prepared from aminopropyl glass by forming schiff's bases with three aldehydes: glucose, glyoxylic acid and hexanal. the aldehyde-treated slides were subsequently reduced using sodium borohydride. thus, the surface of the glass was rendered hydrophilic, ampholytic  or hydrophobic, respectively. the adherence of two streptococcus sanguis strains  and two streptococcus mutans strains to the surface-modified glass slides was studied. different strains showed differences in adherence to these slides depending on their physico-chemical surface properties. for s. sanguis atcc 10556, hydrophobic bonds seemed to be most important, while in s. mutans omz 176, ionic interactions made the highest contribution to adhesion. hydrogen bonds seemed to contribute least to adherence.

TI  == transformation of streptococcus sanguis to intrinsic penicillin resistance.
AB  == a series of step-level penicillin-resistant derivatives of streptococcus sanguis  v288 (challis) were obtained through successive genetic transformations. the dna  donor used was a laboratory-derived, penicillin-resistant multistep mutant of the recipient strain. detection of the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of wild-type and transformants revealed five major pbps. while it was found that s.  sanguis can acquire intrinsic resistance in a stepwise manner and the mechanism was similar to those of some other organisms (changes in penicillin-binding protein affinity and/or in extent of penicillin binding), multiple-pbp changes accompanied a single step-level of resistance. all of the pbps showed varying degrees of decreased affinity for [3h]benzylpenicillin with increasing penicillin resistance. of these, the consistent, dramatic and progressive decrease of pbp 4  binding was most notable. after an initial decrease at the first step-level of resistance, pbp 5 was restored to wild-type levels, indicating a possible important role in survival. genetic linkage of the first two step-levels of resistance was demonstrated by examination of transformation frequencies and by hit-kinetics experiments. a convenient method is described for the quantitative comparison of fluorographs containing pbps with a wide range of affinities for penicillin.

TI  == effects of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-pa) on streptococcus sanguis-infected endocardial vegetations in vitro.
AB  == the effects were studied of in-vitro exposure to tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-pa) on endocardial vegetations isolated from rabbits with streptococcus sanguis endocarditis as well as on str. sanguis-infected plasma clots. for both vegetations and clots t-pa induced lysis of the infected fibrin matrix, demonstrated by a release of streptococci into the incubation medium and  by an increase in the concentration of fibrin degradation products. the clots decreased in weight, whereas only partial lysis of the vegetations was obtained.  addition of plasminogen to the incubation medium did not enhance the effect of t-pa on vegetations. fibrinolysis by t-pa did not interfere with the antimicrobial action of benzylpenicillin on the bacteria in a fibrin matrix. it is concluded that t-pa can degrade the fibrin matrices of infected endocardial vegetations and plasma clots. reduction of vegetation size by t-pa may prove to be useful in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the tetracycline resistance determinant of and several promoters from within the conjugative transposon tn919.
AB  == tn919 is a 15- to 16-kilobase (kb) tetracycline resistance conjugative transposon that was originally isolated from streptococcus sanguis fc1. the tetracycline resistance determinant (tet) was found on a 4.2-kb hindii fragment by in vitro deletion analysis. this fragment was subcloned to a pwv01 origin capable of directing replication in escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and streptococcus lactis, and expression was observed in all three genera. in all cases, expression was weaker when only the 4.2-kb cloned fragment rather than the full transposon was present. the resistance gene is of the streptococcal tetm class and codes for a protein of approximately 70 kilodaltons. the restriction map resembles that of  the tetm gene of tn1545 (p. martin, p. trieu-cuot, and p. courvalin, nucleic acids res. 14:7047-7058, 1986), which codes for a protein of 72.5 kilodaltons. a  number of transposon-derived promoter-bearing fragments were also cloned and sequenced. these closely resemble the consensus sequence of e. coli and b. subtilis promoters. fusion experiments with a truncated lacz gene indicate the possibility of an open reading frame for one of the promoters.

TI  == intergeneric rosettes: sequestered surface recognition among human periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the human oral bacteria, streptococcus sanguis and bacteroides loescheii, when mixed in equal numbers in vitro, formed large settling coaggregates. as the relative number of each cell type was changed, coaggregates became smaller until  at cell-type ratios of 10 to 1, rosettes formed. rosettes consisting of a streptococcal cell in the center surrounded by bacteroides cells exhibited surface recognition properties of only the bacteroides, which coaggregated with many other cell types such as actinomyces naeslundii, and formed large settling multigeneric aggregates. the ecological significance of these results derives from the following: (i) the direct demonstration that intergeneric coaggregates can protect the central cell from or prevent its access to other cells in the environment, and (ii) the potential for these effects to occur during bacterial succession of various cell types observed in progressively more severe stages of  human periodontal disease.

TI  == nitrate- and nitrite-reducing bacteria in the achlorhydric stomach.
AB  == the microbial composition of samples of gastric juice from eight achlorhydric patients was determined by aerobic and rigorously anaerobic culture techniques. bacteria from 16 genera were commonly isolated, but representatives of only three genera, (streptococci, neisseriae and haemophili) were isolated from every patient. nitrate and nitrite were both reduced by veillonellae, haemophili, staphylococci, corynebacteria, lactobacilli, flavobacteria and fusobacteria, but  the potential rate of nitrate reduction by suspensions of veillonellae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and members of the enterobacteriaceae were up to ten times more rapid than the rate of nitrite reduction. conversely, although all neisseria spp. reduced nitrite only some strains reduced nitrate. streptococci did not reduce nitrate. streptococcus sanguis reduced nitrite when grown with haematin; other streptococci did not reduce nitrite. bacterial nitrate and nitrite reduction were active over the ph range 6-8, similar to the ph range of the achlorhydric stomach. from a knowledge of the composition of the bacterial flora and their potential rates of nitrate and nitrite reduction under prevailing conditions, predictions were made about the tendency of nitrite to accumulate during nitrate reduction. studies of the transient accumulation of nitrite by mixed cultures of h. parainfluenzae and n. subflava were consistent with these predictions. haemophili and veillonellae could be responsible for the accumulation of nitrite in the gastric juice of some patients, whereas streptococci and neisseriae would tend to remove nitrite from the stomach as rapidly as it formed.

TI  == host-vector system for integration of recombinant dna into chromosomes of transformable and nontransformable streptococci.
AB  == we describe a genetic system in which transformation of streptococcus pneumoniae  and streptococcus sanguis was used to insert recombinant dna into the conjugative chromosomal element omega (cat tetm) 6001 (omega 6001). the element containing the recombinant dna was then transferred by conjugation to the chromosome of transformable and nontransformable streptococci. when escherichia coli plasmid pdp36 was used as donor in transformation, it was capable of inserting 5.9 kilobases of heterologous dna into the chromosome of competent streptococcal strains carrying omega 6001; the transformants were scored for erythromycin resistance. genetic analysis showed that in a fraction of the erythromycin-resistant transformants the integration via flanking homology of the heterologous dna caused inactivation of the tetm gene of omega 6001. by analyzing the stability of the resistance markers, we found that stable integration of heterologous dna was achieved only in the erythromycin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive transformants. it was possible to detect conjugal transfer of the heterologous sequences from stable transformants to strains of s. pneumoniae, s. sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus faecalis. the omega 6001-pdp36 host-vector system opens new possibilities for gene transfer in  streptococci. by this method cloned streptococcal dna (possibly mutagenized in vitro) can be returned to the original host, greatly facilitating complementation tests and fine physiological studies.

TI  == evidence for natural gene transfer from gram-positive cocci to escherichia coli.
AB  == high-level resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin type b (mls) antibiotics in escherichia coli bm2570 is due to the presence on the conjugative  plasmid pip1527 of the mls resistance determinant ermbc, which is almost identical to the erm genes previously described in plasmid pam77 from streptococcus sanguis (ermam) and in transposon tn917 from enterococcus faecalis  (ermb). this gene and its regulatory region are located downstream from the insertion sequence is1. the 23s rrna methylase encoded by pip1527 differs by three and six amino acids from those encoded by tn917 and pam77, respectively. unlike the streptococcal elements which confer the inducible mls phenotype, the ermbc gene is expressed constitutively in e. coli and bacillus subtilis, due to several mutations in the regulatory region. transcription of the ermbc gene starts from three different sites following three overlapping promoters which function in both e. coli and b. subtilis. promoters p2 and p3 are located within  the region homologous to pam77 and tn917, and p1 is a hybrid promoter constituted by -35 and -10 sequences located at the end of is15 and in the streptococcal region, respectively. these results constitute evidence for the recent in vivo transfer from streptococcus spp. to e. coli. this transfer could have been mediated by transposons such as tn917 or tn1545 from streptococcus pneumoniae, which also bears an mls determinant that is homologous to ermb. we speculate that the insertion sequences is15 and is1 could have played a role in the expression and dissemination of ermbc, which has been found in numerous strains of enterobacteria.

TI  == response of a streptococcus sanguis strain to arginine-containing peptides.
AB  == for dental plaque organisms such as streptococcus sanguis, the ecological importance of the ability to utilize arginine as an energy source has been established in previous studies. the present investigation was undertaken to determine the ability of a strain of s. sanguis to process unsubstituted arginine-containing peptides. the organism was grown under glucose-limited conditions in a chemically defined medium, and peptide was added to washed, resting cells in a ph-stat at ph 7.0. filtrates taken at appropriate time intervals were assayed for peptide, free amino acids, and metabolites. irrespective of the position of the arginine residue, all peptides tested were attacked, although those that possessed a c-terminal arginine (including a tetrapeptide) were processed at a faster rate than were those in which arginine was n terminal. however, c-terminal arginine was cleaved only slowly from a peptide containing 24 residues. in each case, most of the released arginine was converted to ornithine via the arginine deiminase pathway. such peptidase activities appeared to occur at or near the cell surface and were probably constitutive. it was found that the organism grew in chemically defined medium containing arginine that was present solely in the form of a tripeptide, and also that a strain of s. mutans possessed only a limited ability to attack arginine-containing peptides and was unable to utilize the released arginine.

TI  == streptococcus sanguis surface antigens and their interactions with saliva.
AB  == saliva-binding molecules of streptococcus sanguis and their receptors were investigated. streptococcal cell surfaces were extracted with a barbital buffer and examined immunochemically. strains g9b and blackburn, which adhere specifically to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite via immunologically related adhesins, possess 80-, 62-, and 52-kilodalton (kda), and 52-, 42-, and 29-kda polypeptides, respectively, which correlate with adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. nonadherent strains adh- and m-5 lack these antigens. in an immunoblot overlay, the putative adhesins bound to a 73-kda receptor present in submandibular saliva but not in parotid saliva. g9b also contains a 160-kda surface protein which bound to an unidentified receptor in both submandibular and parotid saliva samples. blackburn barbital-extracted components bound to 78- and  70-kda receptors in parotid saliva. these bacterial-salivary interactions may be  important in the regulation of oral ecology.

AB  == a lytic bacteriophage for actinomyces viscosus t14v (the reference strain for actinomyces coaggregation group a) was isolated from raw sewage. this phage, designated bf307, also lysed the t14v-derived nonfimbriated mutant pk455-2 as well as a. viscosus mg-1 and t14av but not the other serotype 2 or serotype 1 strains of this species that were tested or any of nine actinomyces naeslundii isolates. phages bf307 belonged to bradley morphological group c and was similar  in appearance to the a. viscosus mg-1 phages av-1 and av-3, which do not productively infect a. viscosus t14v. a. viscosus mg-1 mutants selected for resistance to phage bf307, av-3, or ct7 (a human dental plaque isolate with the same host range as bf307) were coresistant to the other two phages but sensitive  to av-1. these results indicate that the receptors on a. viscosus mg-1 for phages bf307, av-3, and ct7 are identical or share a common precursor and that the receptor for phage av-1 is distinct. comparison of the genomes of bf307, av-3, and ct7 revealed that their dnas were similar in size but distinguishable by restriction analysis. two altered coaggregation phenotypes were identified among  the phage bf307-resistant mutants of strains mg-1, t14v, t14av, and pk455-2. class i mutants had lost the ability to interact with coaggregation group 1 streptococci, and class ii mutants did not coaggregate with either group 1 or group 2 streptococci. these results are consistent with the proposal that the phage bf307 receptor on these a. viscosus strains is related to one of the structures that mediates coaggregation with oral streptococci. a model to delineate the various coaggregation mediators on the surface of actinomyces coaggregation group a cells is presented, and the use of these phages to probe surface components of human oral actinomyces strains is discussed.

AB  == six species of microorganisms commonly found within the oral cavity were exposed  for either one minute or two hours to 5% lidocaine liquid topical anesthetic and  benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic. mixtures of microorganisms and anesthetics  were diluted and plated onto a brain heart infusion medium. reduction in cell viability was 73-100% after exposure to the anesthetic agents when compared with  the saline/buffer controls. a significant reduction (p < .005) in cell growth by  streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces viscosus,  and candida albicans was associated with a one-minute and two-hour exposure to lidocaine, benzocaine, 5% lidocaine, and the benzocaine vehicle control. five percent lidocaine reduced growth of the test orgainisms more than benzocaine in one-minute exposures to s. mutans, a. viscosus and s. salivarius and with a two-hour exposure to s. salivarius.five percent lidocaine was bacteriocidal or fungicidal to all microorganisms for both time periods whereas, benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic was predominately bacteriostatic or fungistatic after one-minute exposures and bacteriocidal or fungicidal after two hours.the results  indicated that two dental liquid topical anesthetics containing lidocaine or benzocaine possessed considerable antimicrobial activity to selected oral microorganisms. the exclusive use of a topical liquid anesthetic may be an adequate means to render the oral mucosa aseptic before injection of a local anesthetic.

TI  == microbiological and immunological studies of adult periodontitis in patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
AB  == the subgingival microflora and serum antibody response was examined in periodontitis patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm), impaired glucose tolerance (igt), and normal glucose tolerance (ngt). the predominant cultivable microflora was determined for subgingival plaque sampled from two deep periodontal pockets in each of eight adult periodontitis patients with niddm. indirect immunofluorescence for bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides  gingivalis, and haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans was used to examine these same  samples as well as 186 additional subgingival plaque samples from 47 patients with moderate to severe generalized periodontitis including 25 subjects with niddm, six subjects with igt, and 16 subjects with ngt. serum antibody levels to  13 microorganisms including seven oral bacterial species and one nonoral control  species were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa) in 377 subjects including 84 normal subjects without periodontal disease, 112 normal subjects with periodontitis, 19 periodontally normal subjects with igt, 65 periodontitis patients with igt, 15 periodontally normal subjects with niddm, and 82 periodontitis patients with niddm. three hundred eighty-two bacterial isolates were recovered from the eight patients. b. intermedius was the most frequently isolated microorganism constituting 16% of the total isolates followed by wolinella recta and b. gingivalis, which each accounted for 13% of the total. streptococcus sanguis was the most prevalent microorganism, which was found in 75% of the sites. subgingival plaque samples examined by immunofluorescence demonstrate a high prevalence of black-pigmented bacteroides and suggest that the proportion of b. gingivalis but not b. intermedius is higher in niddm with periodontitis than in other groups.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == interaction between wild-type, mutant and revertant forms of the bacterium streptococcus sanguis and the bacterium actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in vitro and in the gnotobiotic rat.
AB  == in vitro, streptococcus sanguis inhibits the growth of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a presumed aetiological agent of localized juvenile periodontitis. when provided with glucose and good aeration, a growing culture of strep. sanguis was found to produce hydrogen peroxide at concentrations in excess of the maximum ld50 reported for strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans. this concentration of hydrogen peroxide also inhibits the growth of the producer organism. a mutant of strep. sanguis was isolated that lacked the ability to produce alpha-haemolysis on blood agar. this mutant had less than 3 per cent of its parent's level of pyruvate-oxidase activity, and made no detectable hydrogen  peroxide. in vitro, the mutant had also lost the ability to inhibit the growth of a. actinomycetemcomitans. a spontaneous revertant, isolated by its ability to produce alpha-haemolysis, was found to have regained parental levels of pyruvate-oxidase activity and hydrogen-peroxide production and could inhibit the  growth of a. actinomycetemcomitans in vitro. a gnotobiotic rat model was used to  demonstrate that strep. sanguis and a. actinomycetemcomitans interact in vivo and that this interaction depends on hydrogen-peroxide production by strep. sanguis.

TI  == partial characterisation of the inhibitory substances produced by streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  == the production of inhibitory substances was sought by deferred antagonism. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, but no detectable bacteriocin.  actinomycetes and neisseria pharyngis were particularly susceptible to the lethal action of hydrogen peroxide. streptococcus milleri produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin-like substances. s. oralis strains were inhibited by the bacteriocin-like products of strains of streptococcus bovis, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius. inhibition was due neither to complete bacteriophage nor to fermentation end-products. extracellular polysaccharides formed during growth could not protect sensitive strains from the effect of hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocin-like substances.

AB  == streptococcus sanguis i gave a significantly greater percentage coverage (cell-pellicle attachment) of saliva-coated glass in the presence of sucrose than did strep. sanguis ii (p less than 0.025), and both these gave greater percentage coverages than the other species tested, between which no significant differences were noted. there was a large number of significant differences in clump size (cell-cell attachment) between species-pairs. among the mutans streptococci, there were significant differences in the percentage coverage between streptococcus rattus/streptococcus mutans (p less than 0.05) and strep. rattus/streptococcus sobrinus (p less than 0.01), and in clump size between all species-pairs with the exception of streptococcus cricetus or strep. sobrinus and strep. mutans. the rank order of species in relation to fissure caries was mutans streptococci greater than streptococcus salivarius greater than streptococcus milleri greater than strep. sanguis greater than streptococcus faecalis greater than streptococcus mitis greater than streptococcus lactis. there was a significant correlation between percentage coverage in vitro and fissure caries in vivo for strains of strep. sanguis (p less than 0.05) and pooled strains of strep. mitis and strep. sanguis (p less than 0.01). on comparing data for adherence in the presence or the absence of sucrose, the sugar had no effect on the percentage coverage of the seven species tested, but significantly increased  the clump size of the mutans streptococci (p less than 0.01) and strep. sanguis (p less than 0.05).

AB  == two novel antibacterial substances (designated mutalipocins) have been isolated from the culture supernatant of streptoccus mutans strain 32k (serotype c). the mutalipocins were purified by extraction of the culture supernatant with light petroleum (b.p. range 30-60 degrees c), followed by lobar column chromatography on lichroprep rp-8. hplc indicated that both mutalipocin preparations (ml-i and ml-ii) were homogeneous. the mr values of ml-i and ml-ii were less than 1000. both mutalipocins were unaffected by treatment over the ph range 3.0-10.0, or with phospholipase a or proteolytic enzymes, but were partially inactivated by treatment with lipase or phospholipase c. ml-ii was resistant to heat treatment.  tlc indicated that ml-i and ml-ii contained unsaturated, aldehyde and/or ketone,  and ester groups. the inhibition of s. mutans by ml-i and ml-ii was due to bactericidal, rather than bacteriostatic, activities. the antibacterial spectra of ml-i and ml-ii were narrower and more species-specific than those of bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

AB  == bacteroides loescheii pk1295 fimbriae, which mediate the lactose-sensitive coaggregation with streptococcus sanguis 34 and the lactose-insensitive coaggregation with actinomyces israelii pk14, were injected into mice to raise adhesin-specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs). supernatants of hybridomas were screened for the capacity to inhibit coaggregation and agglutinate intact bacteria. of the 10 mabs that were isolated, 4 were specific and potent inhibitors of the coaggregation between b. loescheii and s. sanguis and two other mabs specifically inhibited the b. loescheii-a. israelii interaction. none of the six mabs which inhibited adherence were capable of agglutinating whole cells of b. loescheii, whereas the four remaining mabs agglutinated whole cells but had no effect on coaggregation. fab fragments of two mabs, one that inhibited the coaggregation with s. sanguis and another that inhibited the interaction with a.  israelii, also were shown to inhibit the respective coaggregation interactions, suggesting that each of the immunoglobulins recognized its adhesin molecule at or near the active sites. by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation, the s. sanguis adhesin-specific mabs reacted with a 75-kilodalton polypeptide present in fimbria-enriched preparations, whereas the a. israelii adhesin-specific mabs recognized a 45-kilodalton polypeptide in the same preparations. by screening hybridoma supernatants directly for their capacity to block coaggregation, we isolated mabs which were used to establish that the b. loescheii-s. sanguis and the b. loescheii-a. israelii interactions were mediated by different adhesins.

TI  == regulation of arginine-ornithine exchange and the arginine deiminase pathway in streptococcus lactis.
AB  == streptococcus lactis metabolizes arginine by the arginine deiminase (adi) pathway. resting cells of s. lactis grown in the presence of galactose and arginine maintain a high intracellular ornithine pool in the absence of arginine  and other exogenous energy sources. addition of arginine results in a rapid release of ornithine concomitant with the uptake of arginine. subsequent arginine metabolism results intracellularly in high citrulline and low ornithine pools. arginine-ornithine exchange was shown to occur in a 1-to-1 ratio and to be independent of a proton motive force. the driving force for arginine uptake in intact cells is supplied by the ornithine and arginine concentration gradients formed during arginine metabolism. these results confirm studies of arginine and  ornithine transport in membrane vesicles of s. lactis (a. j. m. driessen, b. poolman, r. kiewiet, and w. n. konings, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa, 84:6093-6097). the activity of the adi pathway appears to be affected by the internal concentration of (adenine) nucleotides. conditions which lower atp consumption (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, high ph) decrease the adi pathway activity, whereas uncouplers and ionophores which stimulate atp consumption increase the activity. the arginine-ornithine exchange activity matches the adi pathway most probably by adjusting the intracellular levels of ornithine and arginine. regulation of the adi pathway and the arginine-ornithine exchanger at the level of enzyme synthesis is exerted by glucose (repressor, antagonized by cyclic amp) and arginine (inducer). an arginine/ornithine antiport was also found in streptococcus faecalis ds5, streptococcus sanguis 12, and streptococcus milleri rh1 type 2.

TI  == enzymatic modification of glycocalyx in the treatment of experimental endocarditis due to viridans streptococci.
AB  == the presence of abundant surface polysaccharide, or glycocalyx, on viridans streptococci has been associated with failure to eradicate the organism from experimental cardiac vegetations during penicillin treatment. the role of glycocalyx in retarding sterilization was tested by in vivo administration of dextranase, an endohydrolase that attacks internally situated alpha (1-6) linkages. dextranase and penicillin, either singly or in combination, were used to treat experimental endocarditis. after two days of therapy, 100% of animals treated with penicillin or dextranase alone had infected vegetations, whereas only 25% treated with penicillin and dextranase had infected vegetations (p less  than .01). after five days of therapy, 100% of the animals treated with penicillin had infected vegetations, versus none that were treated with penicillin and dextranase (p less than .01). we conclude that glycocalyx acts to  retard antibiotic activity in vegetations and that partial enzymatic digestion of the glycocalyx facilitates penicillin sterilization of the infected valve.

AB  == a flow cell system was developed which allowed the study of bacterial adhesion to solid substrata at well-defined shear rates. in addition, the system enabled the  solid surfaces to be coated with a proteinaceous film under exactly the same shear conditions. in this flow cell system, adhesion of three strains of oral streptococci from a phosphate-buffered solution onto three different substrata was studied as a function of time in the absence and presence of a bovine serum albumin (bsa) coating at a shear rate of 21 s-1. to obtain a wide range in surface free energies (gamma) representative strains (gamma b 38-117 mj m-2) and  solid substrata (gamma s 20-109 mj m-2) were selected. the number of bacteria adhering was counted microscopically. in the absence of a bsa coating a linear relation was found between the number of bacteria adhering at saturation (nb,s) and the calculated interfacial free energy of adhesion (delta fadh) for each of the three strains. in the presence of a bsa coating the number of bacteria adhering was greatly decreased in all cases. however, despite the presence of the bsa coating there was still a linear relation between the number of bacteria adhering at saturation and the interfacial free energy of adhesion, calculated on the basis of the surface free energy of the uncoated substrata. it can be concluded that the bare, uncoated substratum still influenced bacterial adhesion  in spite of the marked influence of a bsa coating.

TI  == microbial aspects of preventive regimes in patients with overdentures.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test effects of preventive regimes using fluoride and chlorhexidine to prevent caries and periodontal diseases in 34 patients with  overdentures. the patients, who were treated with immediate overdentures, were distributed at random into three experimental groups. in these groups, different  gels--a placebo, a fluoride, and a chlorhexidine-fluoride gel--were tested by daily application. supragingival plaque samples from selected surfaces of two abutment teeth were taken at one week, and at one, three, and six months after initial insertion of the overdenture. the placebo and fluoride gel influenced neither total cfu nor s. sanguis and a. viscosus/naeslundii counts. in the placebo group, but not in the fluoride group, s. mutans levels increased significantly, indicating the caries risk involved in overdentures. the use of chlorhexidine-fluoride gel resulted in a long-term suppression of total cfu. further, s. mutans was found to be selectively suppressed to below detection level. a. viscosus/naeslundii was initially strongly suppressed, but after three  months a partial return of the population was noticed. s. sanguis was relatively  insensitive to the chlorhexidine-fluoride gel. it is concluded that a daily application of a chlorhexidine-fluoride gel is effective against plaque formation and s. mutans on abutment teeth in overdentures.

TI  == purification and characterization of streptococcus pyogenes erythrogenic toxin type a produced by a cloned gene in streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the gene of streptococcus pyogenes erythrogenic toxin type a (spea) has been previously cloned in streptococcus sanguis (challis) and produces extracellular erythrogenic toxin type a (et a). the et a produced and secreted by this heterologous host was purified to homogeneity and shown to have properties identical to et a produced by s. pyogenes strain ny-5; i.e., serological identity in immunodiffusion, migration in sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, mitogenic activity, inhibition of mitogenic activity by specific antibody, and precipitation by an international scarlatina antitoxin preparation. the cloned spea gene specified an et a which had a molecular weight identical to that of et  a from s. pyogenes previously reported from this laboratory. nh2-terminal sequence determination of the purified protein showed the first nine residues to  be gln gln asp pro asp pro ser gln leu; this is consistent with predictions made  from the nucleotide sequence of the spea gene according to weeks and ferretti and different from the sequence published by johnson et al.

TI  == efficacy of orally administered penicillin v for prophylaxis of experimentally induced streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == four oral penicillin v regimens were compared for the ability to prevent streptococcus sanguis infection of experimentally induced valvular heart lesions  in rabbits. challenge doses of 10(4), 10(6), and 10(8) cfu of a penicillin-susceptible strain of s. sanguis were used in this study. measured by  recovery of test organisms from endocardial lesions, the lowest-concentration inoculum was infective for 53% of the recipients; the higher-concentration inocula were infective for all recipients. a single-oral-dose penicillin v regimen (36 mg/kg of body weight) prevented endocarditis when rabbits were challenged with 10(4) cfu, but protection diminished with increasing inoculum concentrations. in contrast, addition of a second penicillin v dose (18 mg/kg of  body weight) administered with a 7-h interval between doses achieved fully effective prophylaxis against even the highest inoculum tested (10(8) cfu). a repeated set of experiments in which half the dose of penicillin v was administered showed significantly reduced protection against s. sanguis endocarditis.

TI  == role of immunoblotting in the diagnosis of culture negative and enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  == serum samples from patients with endocarditis and septicaemia due to enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus bovis, and streptococcus sanguis were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all four species. in e faecalis endocarditis there was a strong igm response to e faecalis antigenic bands of 112, 88-90, and 45-47 kd and a strong igg response to 88-90 and 45-47 kd bands. in e faecium endocarditis there was a pronounced igg response to an e faecium band of 82-90 kd. for s bovis endocarditis, there was a strong igg response to several components of s bovis including bands of 66, 58, 52 and 4 kd. for s sanguis, there was a strong igg response to bands of 80-82, 76, 60 and 45 kd. these patterns of antibody production were absent in patients with uncomplicated septicaemia and in controls. the delineation of these patterns enabled confirmation of the final diagnosis in seven patients initially suspected of having culture negative endocarditis.

TI  == effect of sodium and amine fluoride treatment on adsorption and ultrastructure of s. mutans and s. sanguis.
AB  == a new modification of hydroxyapatite (ha) adherence assay is presented to study the effect of two chemically different fluorides, sodium fluoride (2% solution) and amine fluoride (elmex sol. concentrate) on the adsorption of s. mutans (atcc  27351) and s. sanguis (atcc 10556). vaseline-coated glass rods were rolled in ha  powder, after which the rods were either coated or not coated with salivary pellicle. both strains adsorbed better to saliva-coated rods. pretreatment of the rods with fluorides did not much affect the adsorptions. treatment of bacteria with the fluorides, however, very significantly reduced the adsorption in both strains (p less than 0.001). the fluoride treatments also reduced bacterial viabilities, and electron microscopy revealed a distinct toxic effect, in particular among the amine fluoride treated specimens.

TI  == environmental ph as a factor in the competition between strains of the oral streptococci streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, and "s. mitior" growing in continuous culture.
AB  == strains of streptococcus mutans (biotype 1), streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitior have been grown in mixed continuous culture in a semidefined medium under glucose limitation at a growth rate of d = 0.1 h-1. the effect of varying the environmental ph on the proportions of the different populations within the community has been determined. initially the populations were allowed  to reach steady state at ph 7.0 when s. sanguis was dominant with s. mutans and "s. mitior" maintaining similar populations. the medium ph was then lowered in steps of 0.5 ph units from ph 7.0 to 4.5, and the community was grown at each step for at least 15 generations. viable counts of each species were made at 24-h intervals. the population ratios established at ph 7.0 remained relatively stable when the environmental ph was set at ph 6.5. however, after the medium ph was lowered to 6.0 (days 18-27), the population of s. mutans began to increase and the s. mitior population began to decline. a further change was seen at ph 5.5 (days 27-34) when s. mutans became dominant, s. sanguis declined, and s. mitior was not detectable. at ph 4.5, both s. mutans and s. sanguis were reduced in numbers, but survived until the experimental run was terminated (44 days). samples of culture fluid were taken throughout the experiment and analyzed for the presence of the acid products of glucose metabolism. the amounts of lactic acid produced by the community increased as the environmental ph was lowered.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == relationship between dental plaque indices and bacteria in dental plaque and those in saliva.
AB  == a variety of indices has been developed for the quantitation of dental plaque. the aim of this study was to determine the correlation between the loe plaque index and the number of bacteria on the same tooth. furthermore, the effect of plaque accumulation on the salivary counts of some dental plaque organisms was estimated. twenty volunteers were asked to abstain from all oral hygiene for a one-week period. clinical indices and bacteriological samples were taken at the start and at the end of the experimental period. after an interval of seven days, the experiment was repeated. the relationship between the loe plaque index and the total bacterial counts on the same area of the tooth was found to be highly significant. after seven days without oral hygiene, the total counts and the actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii and streptococcus sanguis counts in dental plaque had increased by approximately two log units, while the streptococcus mutans counts had increased by more than one log unit. the large increase in the number  of bacteria on the teeth was reflected in the salivary counts of the actinomyces  species, but not in the s. sanguis or s. mutans counts. this was due to differences in ecological habitats of these species in the mouth. highly significant correlations were found between the s. mutans level in dental plaque  and the salivary level, and between the s. mutans counts of the subjects in the first and second trials of the experiment.

TI  == bacterial antigens induce collagenase and prostaglandin e2 synthesis in human gingival fibroblasts through a primary effect on circulating mononuclear cells.
AB  == our previous work suggests that one mechanism through which connective tissue breakdown might occur in periodontal diseases is the production of metalloproteinases, including collagenase, by gingival fibroblasts. in this study we investigated whether highly purified preparations of lipopolysaccharide (lps)  and lipoteichoic acid (lta) from a number of putative periodontal pathogens could induce monolayer cultures of human gingival fibroblasts to synthesize collagenase and prostaglandin e2. using both biochemical assays and immunocytochemical techniques, we found that cells synthesized only very small amounts of collagenase in direct response to lps or lta (0.1 to 20.0 micrograms/ml). at the  highest dose of both antigens, prostaglandin e2 production was increased. we then studied whether lps and lta could signal collagenase production by interacting primarily with a different cell type. our results show that lps and lta were each able to stimulate cultures of human blood mononuclear cells (greater than 95% monocytes) to release collagenase-inducing cytokines. by indirect immunocytochemistry, we found that a large proportion of human gingival fibroblasts was activated to produce collagenase by supernatants from lps- and lta-stimulated mononuclear cells, whereas gingival fibroblasts cultured with supernatants from unstimulated mononuclear cells were not. furthermore, in a population of activated fibroblasts we demonstrated, using a double-labeling technique, that some cells made collagenase and the specific tissue inhibitor of  metalloproteinases (timp) simultaneously. as yet, the collagenase-inducing signals remain poorly characterized but the interleukins-1 and tumor necrosis factors seem likely candidates.

TI  == the relationship between glycosyltransferase production and membrane fatty acid composition of streptococcus sanguis nctc 7865 grown in the presence of protonmotive force inhibitors.
AB  == the fatty acid composition of streptococcus sanguis nctc 7865 was not altered by  changing the cation composition (na+/k+) of the growth medium; glucosyltransferase (gtf; ec 2.4.1.5) also remained constant. in contrast, fructosyltransferase (ftf-s; ec 2.4.1.10) production was reduced by at least 50%  in medium with a high na+ concentration. growth in the presence of ionophores (gramicidin, nigericin or valinomycin) resulted in an increased proportion of saturated fatty acids, principally octadecanoic acid (c18:0), while the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, predominantly octadecenoic (c18:1) and hexadecenoic (c16:1) acids, decreased. gtf-s production was reduced in the presence of ionophores whereas ftf-s production was completely abolished. tween 80 significantly increased both gtf-s production and the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the cytoplasmic membrane; ftf-s production was unaltered by tween 80. the production of gtf-s was inversely proportional to the  c18:0:c18:1 fatty acid ratio of the cytoplasmic membrane. it was concluded that ftf-s production is directly influenced by protonmotive force (pmf), whereas gtf-s production is affected more by the physical properties of the cytoplasmic membrane, in particular its fatty acid composition. however, as perturbations in  pmf generation can lead to variations in membrane fatty acid composition it can be argued that pmf indirectly influences gtf production by changing the saturated:unsaturated or c18:0:c18:1 fatty acid ratio of the cytoplasmic membrane.

TI  == molecular basis of bacterial adhesion in the oral cavity.
AB  == the two varieties of fimbriae identified on oral strains of actinomyces have distinct functional properties. the type 1 fimbriae of actinomyces viscosus t14v  mediate attachment to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. type 2 fimbriae--on a. viscosus and the only fimbriae detected on a. naeslundii wvu45--are associated with lectin activity. interaction of these fimbriae with complementary receptors  initiates bacterial attachment to streptococcus sanguis 34 and sialidase-treated  epithelial cells and the killing of actinomyces by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns). galactose, n-acetylgalactosamine (galnac), and related oligosaccharides inhibit these processes, and mutants lacking type 2 fimbriae do not participate in them. the actinomyces lectin is similar to lectins from ricinus communis and bauhinia purpurea that agglutinate certain strains of oral streptococci, block attachment of actinomyces to epithelial cells, and inhibit killing of actinomyces by pmns. the s. sanguis receptor for the actinomyces lectin comprises repeating hexasaccharide units with galnac termini. used as probes, the peanut agglutinin,  with specificity for gal(beta-3)galnac, and the lectin from b. purpurea detect a  160-kilodalton (kdal) band in sds-page-separated epithelial cell extracts and a 100-kdal band in pmn extracts. these may be receptors for type 2 fimbriae. a. viscosus genes encoding subunits of types 1 and 2 fimbriae have been cloned in escherichia coli; the type 1 subunit is 65 kdal and the type 2 subunit is 59 kdal. submandibular immunization of mice with a mixture of type 1 and type 2 fimbriae evokes the production of iga and igg antibodies in serum and saliva that inhibit in vitro adsorption of a. viscosus to sha. these antibodies may modulate  colonization of teeth by this organism.

TI  == fimbria-associated proteins of bacteroides loescheii pk1295 mediate intergeneric  coaggregations.
AB  == bacteroides loescheii pk1295 serves as a coaggregation bridge between streptococcus sanguis 34 and actinomyces israelii pk14, two gram-positive oral bacteria that are otherwise unable to coaggregate. whereas coaggregation with s.  sanguis 34 is inhibited by lactose, no simple sugar was found that inhibited coaggregation with a. israelii pk14. coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of b. loescheii pk1295 were isolated for the purpose of identifying the surface components responsible for the interaction with each coaggregation partner. selection for spontaneously occurring cog- mutants gave rise to two phenotypic classes of mutants. type i lost the ability to coaggregate with s. sanguis 34, whereas type ii failed to coaggregate with either s. sanguis 34 or a. israelii pk14. purified fimbriae from the parent agglutinated cells of both partners, and  agglutination with s. sanguis 34 was inhibited by lactose. denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis demonstrated the presence of both a 75- and a 43-kilodalton (kda) protein associated with parental fimbriae, but only a 43-kda protein was seen with fimbriae prepared from the type i mutant. neither polypeptide was found in similar preparations from the type ii  mutants. our data suggest that coaggregation of b. loescheii pk1295 with both gram-positive partners is mediated by fimbria-associated proteins present on the  surface of the gram-negative organism and that the 75- and 43-kda polypeptides are responsible for the recognition of s. sanguis 34 and a. israelii pk14 cells,  respectively.

TI  == structure of a new hexasaccharide from the coaggregation polysaccharide of streptococcus sanguis 34.
AB  == the major constituent of a coaggregation polysaccharide from streptococcus sanguis 34 is a hexasaccharide, isolated as the alditol. the proposed structure is alpha-d-galpnac-(1----3)-beta-l-rhap-(1----4)-beta-d-glcp-(1----6) -beta-d-galf- (1----6)-beta-d-galpnac-(1----3)-d-galol, based upon g.l.c.-m.s. of alditol acetates and partially methylated alditol acetates, f.a.b.-m.s., 1h-n.m.r. spectroscopy, g.l.c.-m.s. of trimethylsilylated (+)- and (-)-2-butyl glycosides, and cleavage by alpha-n-acetylgalactosaminidase. the structural deduction was facilitated by cleavage of the hexasaccharide at the furanoside linkage by 48% hydrogen fluoride, and reduction of the product, to yield alpha-d-galpnac-(1----3)-beta-l-rhap-(1----4)-beta-d-glcp-(1----6) -d-galol.

TI  == a mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved  laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. the advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. the effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (chx) and (ii) three pulses of chx (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/l) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. only l. casei survived the continuous provision of chx; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to chx. after each chx  pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. again, l. casei was least affected, while a. viscosus, b. intermedius, and f. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. counts of s. mutans were affected more by chx than those of s. sanguis or s. mitior. the effect of successive pulses of chx on the viability of some bacteria and on acid  production (as measured by ph-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to chx had occurred. the fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.

TI  == mechanisms of platelet aggregation by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the direct aggregation of platelets is thought to be an important event in the pathogenesis of viridans streptococcal endocarditis, but the mechanisms for platelet activation are unknown. we evaluated the processes by which two endocarditis-producing strains of viridans group streptococci activated human platelets in vitro, as measured by platelet cyclooxygenase activity, secretion, and aggregation. addition of either streptococcal strain to platelets suspended in whole plasma resulted in a mean lag phase of 15.3 min, followed by platelet secretion and brisk aggregation. the lag phase duration was dependent on the platelet donor and appeared to be a function of direct platelet-bacterial interaction. aggregation was partially inhibited by 20 mum [corrected] indomethacin and blocked completely by 1 mg of apyrase, an extracellular adp hydrolase, per ml. neither strain aggregated washed platelets suspended in tyrode solution alone. however, both strains produced maximal aggregation when the platelet suspension was supplemented with 10% (final concentration) normal plasma. studies with factor-deficient plasmas demonstrated that exogenous fibrinogen was required for aggregation. one or more additional plasma components were needed, which eluted with a molecular weight of 67,000 to 130,000 on gel permeation chromatography. these cofactors have not been described for other platelet agonists, which suggests that viridans streptococci may aggregate human  platelets by a novel mechanism.

TI  == comparison of single and multiple doses of prophylactic antibiotics in experimental streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == single-doses or short-term administration of beta-lactam antibiotics alone or combined with aminoglucoside antibiotics have failed to consistently prevent experimental streptococcal endocarditis induced by high inocula of bacteria poorly susceptible to killing by these antibiotics. the optimal duration of administration of antibiotics for successful prophylaxis under these circumstances has not been established. we therefore tested, in rats with catheter-induced sterile aortic vegetations, the duration of administration of antibiotic necessary to prevent endocarditis induced by bacterial inocula 100 to  10,000 times the 90% infective dose of two tolerant viridans-group streptococci and two streptococcus faecalis strains. multiple-dose regimens of amoxicillin alone or of amoxicillin combined with gentamicin were studied. against the two viridans group streptococci, successful prophylaxis was achieved with multiple doses of amoxicillin alone given over 24 to 48 hr and by the combination of amoxicillin and gentamicin given for 6 to 24 hr. against the two s. faecalis strains, multiple-dose regimens with amoxicillin alone failed, but the combination of amoxicillin and gentamicin was successful when administered for 48 to 72 hr. thus, after challenge with high bacterial inocula, repeated doses of a  beta-lactam antibiotic alone were sufficient to prevent viridans streptococcal endocarditis, but multiple doses of a bactericidal combination (beta-lactam plus  aminoglucoside), as necessary for the treatment of established endocarditis, were a prerequisite for successful prophylaxis of s. faecalis endocarditis.

TI  == role of sialic acid in the kinetics of streptococcus sanguis adhesion to artificial pellicle.
AB  == evaluation of the kinetics of adhesion of streptococcus sanguis 10556 to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite revealed that sialic acid played a role in the formation of a stable cell-substratum complex. in a previous paper (m. m. cowan,  k. g. taylor, and r. j. doyle, j. dent. res. 65:1278-1283, 1986) the adhesion was found to take place in two distinct stages: a reversible equilibrium, probably governed by long-range forces, followed by a transition to higher-affinity binding. in the present study, artificial pellicle was treated with neuraminidase, and kinetic adsorption and desorption experiments with s. sanguis  were conducted. the depletion of sialic acid from pellicle decreased the initial  adsorption rate constant only slightly. the rate constant describing the initial  desorption was unaffected. however, no transition to the second (high-affinity) association occurred. while s. sanguis desorption from control pellicles exhibited two sequential rates, with the second rate being approximately 10 times slower than the first, all desorption from sialo-deficient pellicles occurred at  one rate that was equivalent to the initial rate constant for control desorption. the cells did not reach an equilibrium with the sialo-deficient pellicle, even after 6 h. competing sialic acid did not decrease the rate or extent of adsorption, but desorption occurred to a greater extent when cells had adsorbed in the presence of sialic acid. these data suggest that sialic acid plays little  role in the initial association of cell and pellicle but that it is necessary for the transition to high-affinity binding and the concomitant decreased propensity  to desorb.

TI  == novobiocin-resistant mutants of streptococcus sanguis with reduced cell hydrophobicity and defective in coaggregation.
AB  == mutants of streptococcus sanguis resistant to novobiocin (novr-mutants) were isolated after mutagenesis of strain challis with ethyl methanesulphonate. the resistance phenotype was transferred by dna-mediated transformation back into the parent strain at high frequency suggesting resistance was due to mutation(s) in a single gene or in closely-linked genes. cells of novr-mutants had normal morphology and secreted similar proteins to the wild-type strain. however, mutant cultures had slower growth rates, the mutant cells had reduced hydrophobicity, and they showed a reduced degree of coaggregation with actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. cell envelopes prepared from novr-mutants differed from wild-type cell envelopes in that they (a) were impaired in ability to coaggregate with a. viscosus cells, and (b) had altered protein composition as detected by sds-page. the results suggest that hydrophobic proteins in the cell envelope of s. sanguis may be necessary for coaggregation of this bacterium with actinomycetes.

TI  == nitrite accumulation during anaerobic nitrate reduction by binary suspensions of  bacteria isolated from the achlorhydric stomach.
AB  == binary suspensions of bacteria isolated from the gastric juice of achlorhydric patients were used to determine conditions which favour nitrite accumulation during nitrate reduction. suspensions of veillonella parvula and haemophilus parainfluenzae accumulated nitrite during nitrate reduction in the absence of nitrite-reducing neisseria subflava or streptococcus sanguis. the maximum concentration of nitrite that transiently accumulated decreased predictably as the ratio of nitrite-removing bacteria to nitrite-accumulating bacteria increased. this ratio, but more importantly the bacterial density, determined the duration of nitrite accumulation. these results are correlated with the previously reported tendency of nitrite to accumulate in the gastric juice of hypogammaglobulinaemic and pernicious anaemic patients, and with the extremely high incidence of gastric cancer in the two groups.

TI  == molecular cloning and characterization of a streptococcus sanguis dnase necessary for repair of dna damage induced by uv light and methyl methanesulfonate.
AB  == we developed a method for cloning cellular nucleases from streptococci. recombinant lambda gt11 bacteriophage containing streptococcal nuclease determinants were identified by the production of pink plaques on toluidine blue  o dnase plates. we used this technique to clone a 3.2-kilobase-pair ecori fragment with dnase activity from the chromosome of streptococcus sanguis. the locus was designated don (dnase one) and could be subcloned and stably maintained on plasmid vectors in escherichia coli. minicell analyses of various subclones of the don locus allowed us to determine the coding region and size of the don nuclease in e. coli. the don gene product had an apparent molecular mass of 34 kilodaltons and degraded native dna most efficiently, with lesser activity against denatured dna and no detectable activity against rna. s. sanguis don deletion mutants were constructed by transformation of competent cells with in vitro-prepared plasmid constructs. s. sanguis don deletion mutants retained normal transformation frequencies for exogenously added donor dna. however, when  compared with don+ wild-type cells, these mutants were hypersensitive to dna damage induced by uv light and methyl methanesulfonate. an s. sanguis don-specific dna probe detected homology to chromosomal dna isolated from streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans bratthall serogroups d and g. our results suggested that the don locus was the s. sanguis allele of the previously described s. pneumoniae major exonuclease and was involved in repair of dna damage. furthermore, hybridization studies suggested that the don locus was conserved among species of oral streptococci.

TI  == energetics of the initial phase of adhesion of streptococcus sanguis to hydroxylapatite.
AB  == the initial adhesion of streptococcus sanguis 10556 to artificial salivary pellicle and to bare hydroxylapatite was studied at several temperatures between  18 and 37 degrees c. when the natural logarithms of rate constants for adsorption and desorption were plotted against reciprocal temperatures in arrhenius plots, curved lines were obtained, indicating that the thermodynamic quantities of enthalpy and entropy of activation were temperature dependent. for the bare hydroxylapatite system, the heat capacity (delta cp = dh/dt) was large and negative. delta cp was also negative for adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite, although its value was lower. negative heat capacities, when coupled with favorable entropy, are often indicative of either electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions. when electrolyte (100 mm ammonium sulfate) was added to the cell-hydroxylapatite bead mixture, the rate and extent of adhesion were decreased. addition of nonpolar p-dioxane (10% [vol/vol], final concentration) to the mixture enhanced binding. this suggests that electrostatic linkages participate in the primary adhesion of streptococci to both substrata. the strongly positive entropy values and the lesser temperature dependence of the saliva-coated hydroxylapatite system suggest that another entropy-driven process  is imposed on the electrostatic linkages. this supports a role for hydrophobicity, suggesting that a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic forces mediate the initial adhesion of s. sanguis to the salivary pellicle.

AB  == samples of hydroxyapatite (ha) beads smaller than 1 mg were coated with 10 microliter of either saliva, serum, or human crevicular fluid before being added  to a suspension of streptococcus sanguis or bacteroides gingivalis. in some assays, preparations of a granular fraction, elastase, or cathepsin g from human  leukocytes were used to coat ha or to treat saliva-coated ha (sha) before mixing  with bacteria. the number of cells adhering to the beads was then counted under a scanning electron microscope by a standardized procedure. more cells were found to adhere to sha in this assay than in the conventional large-scale assay. human  crevicular fluid, even when diluted up to three times, completely inhibited the adherence of s. sanguis to ha. a 100% inhibition of s. sanguis adherence was also observed when ha was coated with the granular fraction of leukocytes, and a 65% inhibition observed when sha was treated with the enzyme preparation. when used to coat ha, elastase and cathepsin g reduced the adherence of s. sanguis by 30 and 50%, respectively. the binding of s. sanguis to elastase- or cathepsin g-treated sha was also reduced. b. gingivalis 33277 was found to adhere in high numbers to sha. coating ha with crevicular fluid or with the lysosomal enzyme preparation had a limited negative effect. we postulate that crevicular fluid prevents the adherence of s. sanguis by virtue of either its enzyme content or its albumin content or both.

TI  == membrane-associated and solubilized atpases of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the proton-translocating, membrane atpases of oral streptococci have been implicated in cytoplasmic ph regulation, acidurance, and cariogenicity. membranes were isolated from streptococcus mutans gs-5 and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 following salt-induced lysis of cells treated with lysozyme and mutanolysin. the  atpase activities of these membranes were 1.8 and 1.1 units per mg membrane protein, respectively. f1 atpases were washed free from the membranes and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography (fplc). hydrolytic activities of the f1 atpases were maximal at ph values between 6.0 and 6.6, whereas the membrane-bound enzymes had ph maxima of 7.5 (s. sanguis) and 6.0 (s. mutans). the f1 atpases of the streptococci were similar to the well-characterized enzyme of escherichia coli; they consisted of five different polypeptides and had apparent, aggregate molecular weights of from 335 to 350 kd. the membrane-bound atpases were characterized biochemically and found to be similar to those of proton-translocating atpases of e. coli and streptococcus faecalis. km values for the membranes with respect to atp were found to be 0.9 and 1.0 mmol/l for s. mutans and s. sanguis, respectively. both enzymes had specificities for purine triphosphates and were active with a variety of divalent cations, although optimal activity occurred with atp and mg. the membrane-associated enzymes were sensitive to the inhibitors dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (dccd) and azide, but insensitive to ouabain and vanadate.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == serological relationships between serotype-iii streptococcus sanguis and lancefield group-h streptococci.
AB  == certain strains of streptococcus sanguis and group-h streptococci have been shown to have similar physiological properties and serological specificities. serological studies revealed that serotype-iii s. sanguis shared a common antigen with the so-called "british" group-h streptococci, but not with the "american" group-h streptococci. serotype-iii antigen was extracted in cold 5% trichloroacetic acid from isolated cell walls of s. sanguis atcc 10558, and purified chromatographically. the purified serotype-iii antigen consisted of neutral and amino sugars and some phosphorus, and was negatively charged. hapten  inhibition of the quantitative precipitin reaction between serotype-iii antigen and antiserum indicated the strong possibility of alpha-glucosidic linkages being an immunodeterminant of the antigen.

TI  == a collagen-like immunodeterminant on the surface of streptococcus sanguis induces platelet aggregation.
AB  == the basis of similarities in the mechanism of human platelet aggregation induced  by soluble collagen and the dental plaque bacterium streptococcus sanguis was analyzed. structural and functional comparisons were made by using molecular probes, including rabbit antibody fractions reactive with components on s. sanguis and a synthetic, collagen-like octapeptide mimicking segments from cyanogen bromide fragments 6 and 4 of types i and iii collagen, respectively. when platelets were pretreated with tryptic peptides or class ii antigen of s. sanguis or with the synthetic, collagen-like octapeptide, the onset of aggregation in response to s. sanguis and collagen was prolonged. when compared to other peptides of similar size and charge, the collagen-like peptide's action  towards platelets was shown to be selective. indeed, absorption of antiserum to s. sanguis cells with particulate type i collagen removed specificities directed  at a single s. sanguis antigen. these observations suggested that a common platelet-interactive immunodeterminant on soluble types i and iii collagens, particulate type i collagen, and s. sanguis cells was present. selective inhibition by antibody was used to show structural similarities between the s. sanguis surface proteins and collagen. when either agonist was pretreated with anti-s. sanguis igg or fab fragments, the lag time to onset of platelet aggregation was increased. greater increases in the lag time to aggregation was seen when s. sanguis cells or collagen were pretreated with anti-s. sanguis igg or fab fragments made relatively specific for the class ii antigen. neutralization of the platelet-interactive action of the octapeptide by anti-s. sanguis antibody fractions showed that the immunodeterminant common to s. sanguis and collagen triggered platelets in plasma to aggregate. although the anti-s. sanguis antibodies could inhibit fibrillogenesis, this action was apparently independent of interactions with platelets. in contrast, s. sanguis could bind or adhere to platelets by different determinants. our data suggest that platelets have at least two distinct sites that bind collagen or s. sanguis. one of these may be a common site for collagen and s. sanguis agonists.

TI  == characterization of a rat salivary sialoglycoprotein complex which agglutinates streptococcus mutans.
AB  == rat saliva agglutinated streptococcus mutans ingbritt and nctc 10449 and streptococcus sanguis nctc 7864 but not s. mutans nctc 10921, gs 5, or lm 7, streptococcus sobrinus 6715-13 or omz 65, or streptococcus cricetus hs 6, as measured turbidometrically. the specificity of agglutination by rat saliva was the same as that by human saliva. agglutination was associated with a mucin complex (rat salivary agglutinin complex [rs-a]) of sulfated sialoglycoproteins,  with a trace of associated lipid and an apparent mr of 1.6 x 10(6), isolated by gel-filtration fast protein liquid chromatography. the complex was dissociated in a high-ionic-strength buffer containing 6 m urea and then fractionated by gel filtration and anion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography into four sulfated sialoglycoprotein components, designated rs-a-1q1, rs-a-1q2, rs-a-1q3, and rs-a-2, with rs-a-1q2 being polydisperse through differential glycosylation of the polypeptide backbone. the dissociation destroyed agglutination activity. the polypeptide backbones contained up to 42% serine plus threonine and up to 40% glycine plus alanine plus proline plus valine. the carbohydrate moiety of the rs-a sialoglycoproteins consisted of n-acetylgalactosamine, sialate, galactose, fucose, n-acetylglucosamine, and small amounts of mannose, with the predominant sugar being n-acetylgalactosamine. agglutination was inhibited by 1 mm edta but was restored by 1.5 mm cacl2. agglutination was also inhibited by 5 mm cacl2; nonimmune sera; cationic polymers; and wheat germ, lentil, soybean, and peanut lectins. however, agglutination was not affected by lipoteichoic acid, various anionic proteins, or various sugars. neuraminidase treatment of rs-a did not affect activity, but tryptic digestion of s. mutans did prevent agglutination. the results are consistent with calcium bridging the negative groups within the rs-a complex and allowing the approach of rs-a to the bacterial cell surface to effect a specific conformational attachment.

TI  == characterization of lectinlike surface components on capnocytophaga ochracea atcc 33596 that mediate coaggregation with gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  == the interactions between capnocytophaga ochracea atcc 33596 and streptococcus sanguis h1, actinomyces naeslundii pk984, or actinomyces israelii pk16 are dependent on specific recognitions between heat-sensitive adhesins on c. ochracea and heat-stable structures (probably carbohydrate-containing receptors) on the surfaces of these gram-positive coaggregation partners. the coaggregation of c. ochracea with each of these three organisms was inhibited by l-rhamnose and d-fucose and to a lesser extent by beta-methyl-galactoside. the reaction with s.  sanguis was the most sensitive, while the coaggregation with a. israelii was the  least sensitive and was only partially inhibited by each of the sugars that were  considered to be effective inhibitors. a more effective inhibition of the coaggregation between c. ochracea and a. israelii was achieved by adding a combination of the 6-deoxysugars and n-acetylneuraminic acid. to further characterize the coaggregations, naturally occurring coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of c. ochracea were obtained from several different selections. three phenotypically distinct groups of mutants were were isolated. type 1 mutants failed to coaggregate with s. sanguis only. type 2 mutants lost ability to interact with both s. sanguis and a. naeslundii. type 3 mutants failed to coaggregate with all three coaggregation partners. characterization of the cog- mutants by sugar inhibition studies made it possible to distinguish three classes of adhesin activity.

TI  == the effect of sucrose on the colonization of acrylic by candida albicans in pure  and mixed culture in an artificial mouth.
AB  == the roles of sucrose and microbial interactions in the colonization of acrylic by candida albicans in an artificial mouth were investigated. the acrylic was colonized by pure cultures of the organism but a visible plaque was not produced  whether or not sucrose was present. salivary bacteria had no effect in the absence of sucrose but when sucrose was present the numbers of c. albicans were significantly increased. it is suggested that this phenomenon is related to the production of extracellular polysaccharides by salivary streptococci in the presence of sucrose. in mixed culture of c. albicans and streptococcus salivarius cj2, growth of the latter was inhibited in the presence of sucrose. this inhibition was due to factors other than ph, although no such antagonism could be demonstrated on solid media.

TI  == responses of platelets to strains of streptococcus sanguis: findings in healthy subjects, bernard-soulier, glanzmann's, and collagen-unresponsive patients.
AB  == the ability of endocarditis and dental strains of streptococcus sanguis to induce platelet aggregation in plasma (prp) from normal subjects were examined and compared to responses of prp with known platelet membrane glycoprotein (gp) and response defects. s. sanguis strains differed in their ability to induce normal prps to aggregate. strains that induced prp aggregation in more than 60% of donors were significantly faster agonists (mean lag times to onset of aggregation less than 6 min) than those strains inducing response in prps of fewer than 60% of donors. platelets from patients with bernard-soulier syndrome aggregated in response to strains of s. sanguis. in contrast, platelets from patients with glanzmann's thrombasthenia and from a patient with a specific defect in response  to collagen were unresponsive to s. sanguis. these observations show that gpib and v are not essential, but gpiib-iiia and gpia are important in the platelet response mechanism to s. sanguis. indeed, the data suggests that the platelet interaction mechanisms of s. sanguis and collagen may be similar.

TI  == rate of plaque formation--some clinical and biochemical characteristics of "heavy" and "light" plaque formers.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to give a clinical and biochemical characterization of two groups of individuals with different rates of plaque formation. from 133 individuals, 9 "heavy" and 10 "light" plaque formers were selected. the mean plaque index after 3 days of plaque accumulation, on buccal surfaces of premolars and first molars, was 2.6 for the "heavy" and 0.6 for the "light" plaque formers. the following variables were determined: periodontal status, dfs, dietary habits, salivary secretion rate and buffer effect, s. mutans and lactobacillus counts in saliva, salivary content of iga, lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase and lysozyme, saliva-induced aggregation of certain oral streptococci, gel electrophoresis of saliva, amino acid composition of saliva and the acquired pellicle and retention depth of the dentogingival area. comparing the two groups of plaque formers, statistically significant differences were found for the following three variables: parotid saliva-induced aggregation of a  strain of s. sanguis, content of glutamic acid in the acquired pellicle and retention depth of the dentogingival area for maxillary premolars. large variations for all studied variables were found, both within and between the groups. several factors may be involved in plaque formation and none of the studied variables alone could explain the large difference in the amount of plaque formed after 3 days between the "heavy" and "light" plaque formers.

TI  == purification and biochemical properties of a bacteriocin from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == extracts of certain strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are inhibitory to strains of streptococcus sanguis such as s. sanguis atcc 10556. the isolation of a protein from an a. actinomycetemcomitans sonic extract which copurified with the inhibitory activity was accomplished by preparative isoelectric focusing, sephadex g-100 gel filtration chromatography, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page). the resulting isolated protein, which focused at a ph of 6.1 to 6.3, appeared as a single band in anionic nondissociating page analysis. this protein could be dissociated into two subunits with molecular weights of 50,000 and 70,000, which were resolvable by page analysis. a 1,758-fold increase in specific activity was seen in the purified inhibitory protein compared with the crude sonic extract starting material. the properties of the inhibitory activity in the a. actinomycetemcomitans extract are characteristic of a bacteriocin. accordingly, we propose the name actinobacillicin for the inhibitory protein.

TI  == a bacteriocin of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == an inhibitory factor from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 was isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin (actinobacillicin). the bacteriocin was active against streptococcus sanguis strains, streptococcus uberis (fdc1), and actinomyces viscosus t14 as well as other strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, but not against other crevicular bacteria, including other streptococci and actinomycetes. the activity of this bacteriocin was inhibited by pronase, trypsin, and heat (45 min at 56 degrees c) but not by dnase, rnase, phospholipase, exposure to uv light, or low ph (1.0 to 6.5). although actinobacillicin markedly inhibited glycolysis in s. sanguis, the primary mechanism of its bactericidal action appears to be alterations in cell permeability, with the resultant leakage of rna, dna, and other essential intracellular macromolecules. these findings provide an ecologic explanation for  the reciprocal growth relationship between a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. sanguis/actinomyces viscosus observed in localized juvenile periodontitis.

TI  == oxygen sensitivity of sugar metabolism and interconversion of pyruvate formate-lyase in intact cells of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == pyruvate formate-lyase (pfl) (formate acetyltransferase; ec 2.3.1.54) of oral streptococci is essential for metabolizing sugar into volatile compounds (formate, acetate, and ethanol). this enzyme is extremely sensitive to oxygen, and its activity is irreversibly inactivated by oxygen. when streptococcus sanguis was anaerobically starved, a part of the active form of pfl was converted into a reversible inactive form that was tolerant of oxygen. this reversible inactive enzyme could be reactivated to the active enzyme by anaerobic sugar metabolism, with the recovery of volatile compound production. the pfl in streptococcus mutans was not converted into an oxygen-tolerant inactive form by anaerobic starvation, and after exposure of the cells to oxygen the pfl could not be reactivated. these findings suggest that s. mutans can produce acids rapidly under anaerobic conditions because of its capacity to keep pfl active and that s. sanguis can protect its sugar metabolism from oxygen impairment because of its interconversion of pfl.

TI  == randomized prospective study of ceftazidime versus ceftazidime plus cephalothin in empiric treatment of febrile episodes in severely neutropenic patients.
AB  == in a prospective randomized study, ceftazidime monotherapy was compared with a combination of ceftazidime plus cephalothin in 102 febrile neutropenic patients.  thirty bacteriologically documented infections, of which 23 were bacteremias, in  48 clinically assessable patients were treated with ceftazidime alone. twenty-four bacteriologically proven infections, of which 18 were bacteremias, in 42 clinically assessable patients were treated with a combination of ceftazidime  and cephalothin. the clinical response rates in assessable patients were 77% for  ceftazidime monotherapy and 88% for the combination. the bacteriological clearance rate was 70% for ceftazidime monotherapy and 79% for the combination. efficacy against gram-negative pathogens appeared to be excellent, with 93% clearance for ceftazidime monotherapy and 100% clearance for the combination. the bacteriological clearance of gram-positive infections was only 60% for both regimens, with failures mainly due to streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus sanguis, which are primarily resistant to both ceftazidime and cephalothin. after addition of vancomycin to those infections which did not respond to empiric therapy, bacteriological clearance rates of 94% (ceftazidime plus vancomycin) and 90% (ceftazidime and cephalothin plus vancomycin) were achieved. three superinfections were registered in the ceftazidime group and two were seen in the combination group. other adverse effects of ceftazidime were minimal and were not enhanced by combination with cephalothin. it is concluded that ceftazidime is an  effective drug for the empiric treatment of febrile neutropenic patients, especially if one is prepared to modify therapy if resistant gram-positive strains or mycotic infections are encountered. neither the clinical nor bacteriological cure rates could be substantially improved by adding cephalothin  to ceftazidime in initial empiric treatment of febrile neutropenic patients.

TI  == the growth of oral bacteria on saliva.
AB  == the present experiments were aimed at studying the degradation of salivary glycoproteins by the oral microflora. to this end, s. sanguis i strain ny476 and  s. sanguis ii (s. mitior) strain ny581 were grown continuously in human-whole saliva. under these conditions, the strains produced a variety of cell-associated hydrolytic activities, including glycosidases, exo- and endopeptidases, and esterases. s. sanguis ii generally exhibited higher levels of enzyme activity than did s. sanguis i, in particular of neuraminidase that was produced only by s. sanguis ii. in accordance, s. sanguis ii had a higher cell yield and consumed  a higher proportion of the sugars and sialic acid in the glycoproteins than did s. sanguis i. interestingly, s. sanguis i, which is devoid of neuraminidase, is known to have a lectin with specificity for sialic acid, whereas s. sanguis ii has affinity for galactose residues in the glycoproteins. we propose that specific binding of glycoproteins by oral bacteria constitutes a mechanism to collect nutrients in the vicinity of the cell. the special ability of s. sanguis  ii to utilize saliva for growth was further exemplified by its selection in batch-wise enrichments of dental plaque on saliva. the microflora in these enrichment cultures always consisted of peptostreptococcus micros, s. sanguis ii, and fusobacterium nucleatum as the dominant organisms. further, s. mitis and gemella haemolysans were generally found to be present. the enrichment cultures produced a wide variety of mainly cell-bound hydrolytic enzymes. this resulted in almost complete breakdown of salivary glycoproteins in the culture.

TI  == development of high-frequency delivery system for transposon tn919 in lactic streptococci: random insertion in streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis 18-16.
AB  == the conjugative transposon tn919, originally isolated in streptococcus sanguis fc1, is capable of low-frequency transfer (10 and 10 per recipient) on membrane filters to a wide number of streptococcal recipients including the industrially important lactic streptococci. the introduction of pmg600 (lac lax; a lactose plasmid capable of conjugative transfer at high frequencies and which, in certain hosts, confers an unusual clumping phenotype) into a streptococcus lactis ch919 donor, generating s. lactis ch001, resulted in a significant improvement in the transfer frequency of tn919 to s. lactis ck50 (1.25 x 10 per recipient). in addition, these matings could be performed on agar surfaces, allowing the recovery of a greater number of recipients than with filter matings. tn919 also transferred at high frequency to s. lactis subsp. diacetylactis 18-16s but not to streptococcus cremoris strains. insertion in 18-16s transconjugants generated from filter matings with an s. lactis ch919 donor was random, occurring at different sites on the chromosome and also in plasmid dna. thus, the conditions necessary for the practical exploitation of tn919 in the targeting and cloning of genes from a member of the lactic streptococci, namely, high-frequency delivery and random insertion in host dna, were achieved.

TI  == a simple method for determining extracellular polysaccharide-producing ability of oral streptococci.
AB  == a simple method is described for determining the types of extracellular polysaccharides produced by oral streptococci. the method yields quantitative results in which the amount of polysaccharides produced is normalised with respect to dna. results correlate well with previously published data for oral streptococci, except in the case of streptococcus oralis for which there is no previously published data. all species within the mutans group produced both soluble and insoluble glucan; while soluble fructan was only produced by strains  of streptococcus rattus and streptococcus mutans. the major extracellular polysaccharide produced by streptococcus salivarius was soluble fructan, although some strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. most streptococcus sanguis strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. soluble fructan was produced by some strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis. the latter also produced soluble and insoluble glucan. no detectable extracellular polysaccharide was elaborated by streptococcus milleri, streptococcus faecalis or streptococcus lactis.

TI  == the effect of smokeless-tobacco extracts on the growth of oral bacteria of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == aqueous tobacco extracts were used to supplement a basic salts solution (bss) and a microbial medium. thin-layer chromatography revealed sucrose in only one of four extracts. discs saturated with extracts (0.1-50 mg/ml) failed to inhibit growth of any of the micro-organisms. supplementation (10 mg/ml) of bss with the  tobaccos lacking sucrose resulted in augmented growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguis whereas the sucrose-containing brand augmented only strep. sanguis growth. thus extracts of these smokeless tobaccos would serve as a growth substrate for three species of oral streptococci which are frequently associated with human dental caries.

TI  == a simplified diagnostic system for cultural detection and enumeration of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a simple dip-slide test (cariescreen sm) based on msb selective agar was devised  for detection and quantitation of streptococcus mutans in oral samples. for this  test, a bacitracin tablet is dissolved in a vial containing buffered saline diluent. paraffin-stimulated saliva is collected in this diluent vial. a dip slide which incorporates a modified msb agar (minus bacitracin) is immersed briefly in the diluted saliva. after addition of a co2-generating tablet, the screw-cap dip slide is closed tightly in the vial and incubated for two days at 37 degrees c and one day at room temperature. s. mutans populations in saliva are estimated by comparison with a colony density chart. growth of reference strains  of s. mutans was equivalent on cariescreen sm dip slides and on msb agar plates.  reference strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus milleri did not grow on cariescreen sm dip slides. aliquots of saliva from 50 schoolchildren and 51 adults were tested by the dip-slide method and by conventional plating methods in msb agar. very good correlation (0.93) between the two methods was obtained. this simplified s. mutans detection system is suitable for use by clinical personnel in dental clinics or other non-laboratory settings for identification of subjects potentially at risk for caries.

TI  == effect of protease on cell surface structure, hydrophobicity and adhesion of tufted strains of streptococcus sanguis biotypes i and ii.
AB  == protease treatment of s. sanguis biotype i strains (aki and cr311) and s. sanguis biotype ii strains (cn3410 and psh1b) reduced cell surface hydrophobicity of all  strains by up to 87.7% and reduced adhesion to saliva coated hydroxyapatite beads (s-sha) by up to 90%. all four strains carried lateral tufts of fibrils of two lengths on the cells. tuft fibrils and hydrophobicity were lost simultaneously from s. sanguis ii cn3410 when these properties were monitored simultaneously over 3 h. a ruthenium red positive layer, 37 +/- 6 nm thick, outside the cell wall of s. sanguis i cr311 was more resistant than the tuft to protease digestion. after 2 h of protease treatment tuft fibrils of s. sanguis i aki and 311 were gradually digested while still on the cells, whereas most of the tuft fibrils of s. sanguis ii psh1b remained apparently undamaged on the cells, and tuft fibrils of s. sanguis ii cn3410 were removed intact from the cell surface and found in the supernatant.

TI  == [bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  == considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has  gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. the present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth  pattern and acid production of s. mutans, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. faecalis, s. viridans, l. casei and l. acidophilus in vitro by using photo electrical colorimeter and ph meter. in conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending  on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.

TI  == interbacterial adhesion between pseudomonas aeruginosa and indigenous oral bacteria isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == interbacterial adhesion between strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and strains of  indigenous oral bacteria, both of which were isolated from the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, was investigated by the phenomenon of the coaggregation reaction. a total of 22 strains of p. aeruginosa were isolated from the oral cavity of 17 patients and examined for their abilities to coaggregate with 5 strains each of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii. coaggregation reactions were common between these oral bacteria and both the mucoid and nonmucoid variants of p. aeruginosa. all strains of p. aeruginosa were also able to agglutinate neuraminidase-treated or untreated human erythrocytes of blood types a, b, and o. positive coaggregation reactions were further characterized by determining the effects of several sugars, and of heat and protease treatments of the bacteria. none of the coaggregtion reactions were inhibited by 0.05 m lactose, galactose, glucose, fucose, or mannose. all coaggregation reactions were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive components of the pseudomonas. thus, the interbacterial adhesions between p. aeruginosa and the oral bacteria studied appears to involve  adhesins on the pseudomonas cell, which bind to complementary receptors, on the cell surfaces of oral bacteria. the apparent prevalence and diversity of interbacterial adhesions between p. aeruginosa strains originating from the oral  cavity of cystic fibrosis patients and strains of the indigenous oral bacteria suggest that some of these reactions may affect the extent to which p. aeruginosa colonizes in the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, and thereby, influence  susceptibility of the host to infection.

TI  == expression of streptococcus sanguis antigens in escherichia coli: cloning of a structural gene for adhesion fimbriae.
AB  == chromosomal dna from streptococcus sanguis fw213 was partially digested with ecori and ligated into the positive-selection cloning vector pop203(a2+). the ligation mixture was used to transform escherichia coli k-12, and 4,500 transformants were examined. the tetracycline-resistant colonies had inserts averaging 3.2 kilobases. the entire colony bank was screened by colony immunoassay with polyclonal rabbit serum raised against s. sanguis fw213 whole cells. thirty recombinant colonies produced stable positive reactions of various  intensities, indicating that s. sanguis antigens could be expressed in e. coli. restriction endonuclease digestion of these clones suggested that 26 of the clones were unique. only two clones, vt616 and vt618, gave positive reactions with fimbria-specific antisera. that the gene coding for the antigen was located  on the plasmid was confirmed by demonstrating that the presence of the plasmid was linked to antigen production. western immunoblot analyses of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels showed that both clones produced  a fimbrial peptide of mr 30,000. the two recombinant plasmids were shown by southern analysis and restriction mapping to contain the same 6-kilobase ecori fragment inserted in opposite orientations. southern hybridization confirmed that this fragment is present in s. sanguis genomic dna. the mr 30,000 protein gene was expressed in both orientations, suggesting that the fimbrial promoter is located on the 6-kilobase fragment. these results show that at least one streptococcal fimbrial gene can be cloned and expressed in e. coli.

TI  == reconstitution of atp-dependent calcium transport from streptococci.
AB  == membrane vesicles of three streptococcal strains (streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus lactis, and streptococcus sanguis) were extracted with octyl-beta-d-glucoside in the presence of escherichia coli lipid and glycerol. for reconstitution, the detergent extract was mixed with bath-sonicated e. coli lipid, in the presence of octyl-beta-d-glucoside, and proteoliposomes were formed by a 25-fold dilution. atp-dependent calcium accumulation by proteoliposomes was  comparable to that found in parent vesicles. recovery of this calcium transport activity was dependent on the inclusion of an osmolyte protein stabilant (glycerol, etc.) during solubilization. the properties of atp-driven calcium transport were studied in the reconstituted system. in proteoliposomes, atp-linked calcium accumulation was not affected by the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or by the ionophores, valinomycin and  nigericin, in the presence of potassium, or by n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an  inhibitor of the f0f1-atpase. on the other hand, calcium transport was completely blocked by micromolar levels of orthovanadate; half-maximal inhibitions were observed at 0.4, 4, and 4 microm vanadate, for s. faecalis, s. lactis, and s. sanguis, respectively. this marked sensitivity to orthovanadate suggests operation of an e1e2-type ion-motive pump. these data demonstrate that, in a reconstituted system, calcium transport is not linked to an atp-dependent proton  circulation via the f0f1-atpase, but rather is driven by a calcium-translocating  atpase. thus, calcium extrusion from the cytosol of enteric, lactic acid, or oral streptococci is mediated by an atp-linked process analogous to the ion-motive atpases of eukaryotic membranes.

TI  == penicillin-induced effects on streptomycin uptake and early bactericidal activity differ in viridans group and enterococcal streptococci.
AB  == in vitro studies with penicillin and [3h]streptomycin in four strains of streptococci (s. faecalis, s. sanguis, and s. mitis) were performed by simultaneously measuring the rates of bacterial killing and uptake of streptomycin. in s. faecalis, penicillin stimulated streptomycin uptake, as has been shown by moellering and weinberg (r. c. moellering, jr., and a. n. weinberg, j. clin. invest. 50:2580-2584, 1971). moreover, the antibiotic combination was associated with an enhanced bactericidal rate which temporally correlated with beta-lactam-induced aminoglycoside uptake. in contrast, in viridans group streptococci (s. sanguis and s. mitis) penicillin had no effect on streptomycin uptake and a minimal effect on bactericidal rate when compared with either drug alone. these data suggested that the stimulation of streptomycin uptake in streptococci by penicillin is strain or species specific and that important differences exist between enterococci and viridans group streptococci regarding the mechanisms of beta-lactam-aminoglycoside potentiation.

TI  == multigeneric aggregations among oral bacteria: a network of independent cell-to-cell interactions.
AB  == a radioactivity-based assay was developed to define the participation of radioactively labeled cell types within the milieu of unlabeled partners in multigeneric aggregates. the cell types in these multigeneric aggregations consisted of various combinations of 21 strains representing five genera of human oral bacteria. the coaggregation properties of each cell type, when paired individually with various strains, were delineated and were unchanged when the microbes took part in the more complex multigeneric aggregations. competition between homologous labeled and unlabeled cells for binding to a partner cell type was achieved only when the homologous cells were mixed together before the addition of their partner cells. attempts to displace a labeled cell type from an aggregate by subsequent addition of a large excess of the same unlabeled cell type were unsuccessful, which suggested that the forces that bound different cell types together were very strong and the cell-to-cell interactions were stable. however, a cell type that exhibited only lactose-reversible coaggregations with partners was easily and selectively released by the addition of lactose to multigeneric aggregates otherwise consisting solely of lactose-nonreversible cell-to-cell interactions. this not only indicates the independent nature of individual coaggregations but also suggests the involvement of lectinlike adhesins in these sugar-inhibitable coaggregations. although the molecular mechanisms responsible for multigeneric aggregations are unknown, the principle of a common partner cell type serving as a bridge between two otherwise noncoaggregating cell types was firmly established by the observation of sequential addition of one cell type to another. thus, competition, bridging, coaggregate stability, independent nature of interactions, and partner specificity are the key principles of adherence that form the framework for continued studies of multigeneric aggregates. while the human oral cavity is a prime example of a complex microbial community, collectively the community appears to consist of simple and testable individual interactions.

TI  == characterization of monoclonal antibodies specific for adhesion: isolation of an  adhesin of streptococcus sanguis fw213.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies reactive to an adhesive strain of streptococcus sanguis (fw213) and nonreactive to a nonadhesive mutant (jl7) were derived from the fusion of myeloma line x63ag8.653 and spleen cells from balb/c mice immunized with live s. sanguis cells. five cell lines, belonging to subclasses of immunoglobulin g, produced monoclonal antibodies specifically directed against the adhesive strain. all five antibodies also failed to react with five additional, independently isolated, nonadhesive mutants. a spontaneous mutant of  fw213 (vt508) that no longer reacted with monoclonal antibody f51 (mabf51) was isolated by serial agglutination with the antibody. langmuir adsorption isotherms of vt508 indicated that this mutant also had altered ability to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite further confirming the specificity of mabf51 for adhesion. electron microscopy revealed that vt508 had lost the peritrichous fimbriae associated with the adhesion of fw213. mabf51 was used to purify the adhesin from lysozyme cell extracts by using an affinity column of mabf51 linked  to sephacryl s1000. purity was suggested by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and crossed immunoelectrophoresis (ciep). the adhesin had a molecular weight greater than 150,000 and was not denatured in sodium dodecyl sulfate reducing gels. two peaks of near electrophoretic mobility were detected in ciep when the purified material was run against polyclonal antibody to the whole cell. tandem ciep analysis and immunoprecipitation provided evidence that the two peaks represented the same antigen in two different forms.

TI  == viridans streptococcal endocarditis: clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic correlations.
AB  == infections caused by species within the viridans streptococci have been associated with different clinical characteristics. we studied 36 patients with viridans streptococcal endocarditis. complications were seen in 10 (32%) of 31 patients with native valve endocarditis and four (80%) of five with prosthetic valve endocarditis and included death in two, valve replacement in six, persistent infection in three, emboli in two, and congestive heart failure in nine. two-dimensional echocardiograms demonstrated vegetations in 26 (72%) of 36, flail mitral valves in seven, disruption of aortic valve prosthesis in one, and perivalvular abscesses in three (two streptococcus sanguis i and one streptococcus intermedius i). all twelve patients with native valve endocarditis  who suffered complications had vegetations detected by two-dimensional echocardiography, whereas seven patients with native valve endocarditis without vegetations, as detected by two-dimensional echocardiography, had no complications (p = .03). we found no significant correlation between streptococcal species and clinical outcome. to confirm our identifications, we sent 16 identical viridans streptococcal endocarditis isolates to five institutions; only three of 16 were identified as the same species by all five institutions. we conclude that viridans streptococcal endocarditis can be associated with a virulent clinical course and that there is marked variability in species designations of individual strains by different laboratories.

TI  == kinetic analysis of streptococcus sanguis adhesion to artificial pellicle.
AB  == studies of equilibria between streptococcus sanguis and artificial pellicle have  suggested that there are multiple binding sites for the organism. in the present  study, adhesion of s. sanguis to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite was examined by means of kinetic methods. cell-pellicle complex formation was measured from initiation of binding to equilibrium. rate constants were calculated for forward  reactions (adsorption) and reverse reactions (desorption). initial binding obeyed reversible, first-order kinetics, whereas desorption of bound cells followed biphasic kinetics. initial desorption proceeded approximately ten times faster than the slower second rate. the results are consistent with the mechanism c + p  reversible cp* in equilibrium with cp in which cp* represents the reversible equilibrium that shifts at a discrete rate to the high-affinity cp state. thus, the biphasic binding behavior that has been previously deduced from equilibrium studies may be attributed to a time-dependent shift from close apposition to pellicle, stabilized by low-specificity forces, to a higher-affinity binding.

AB  == it has been proposed that recurrent aphthous ulceration (rau) is caused by hypersensitivity to oral streptococci. this hypothesis is based on reports that rau patients have increased levels of circulating igg antibodies against oral streptococci, and that rabbit antisera prepared against oral streptococci are cross-reactive with oral mucosa. using indirect immunofluorescence, we have investigated both of these reported phenomena. end-point titers of serum antibodies against three different strains of oral streptococci were assayed from nine rau subjects with active ulcers and compared with those of nine control subjects. titers ranged from 1:2 to 1:64 in both groups and do not appear to have any clinical or immunopathogenic significance. cross-reactivity was studied using hyperimmune rabbit antisera raised against five different strains of oral streptococci. homologous bacterial titers ranged from 1:1024 to 1:8192, but none  of these anti-streptococcal sera produced heterologous titers greater than 1:32 with oral mucosa. this apparent low level of cross-reactivity with oral mucosal antigens appears to be non-specific and clinically insignificant. in previous reports, we have used both leucocyte migration and lymphocyte blast transformation to study cell-mediated immunity to viridans streptococci in rau (gadol et al., 1985; greenspan et al., 1985). none of our results supports an immunopathogenic role for oral streptococci in rau.

TI  == inhibition of the interaction of streptococcus sanguis with hexadecane droplets by 55- and 60-kilodalton hydrophobic proteins of human saliva.
AB  == the effect of salivary secretions on the hydrophobicity of streptococcus sanguis  was investigated. pretreatment of the bacteria with paraffin-stimulated whole saliva resulted in a 79% inhibition of adhesion to hexadecane droplets. column chromatography on sepharose 4b and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoretic analysis indicated that the inhibitory activity of saliva resided in a fraction containing material of approximately 60,000 molecular weight. the active components, which we have termed the hydrophobic components (hc), bind to octyl-sepharose beads. pretreatment of s. sanguis with hc resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the streptococcus-hexadecane interaction that reached a maximum of 85%. furthermore, hc effectively blocked the ability of s. sanguis to adhere to hydroxyapatite beads coated with either whole saliva or hc.  sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis indicated that hc eluted from  octyl-sepharose consisted primarily of two proteins (60 kda and 55 kilodaltons) which could be resolved by high-pressure liquid chromatography. both of these proteins were able to inhibit the binding of s. sanguis to hexadecane in a dose-dependent manner; however, the 60-kilodalton molecule was slightly more effective in this assay. amino acid analysis of these proteins showed that both proteins contained a high percentage of nonpolar amino acids. these findings suggest that certain components of saliva influence the interaction of s. sanguis with hydrophobic surfaces.

TI  == acid tolerance, proton permeabilities, and membrane atpases of oral streptococci.
AB  == differences in acid tolerance among representative oral streptococci were found to be related more closely to the dynamic permeabilities of the bacteria to protons than to differences in the sensitivities of cell membranes to gross damage caused by environmental acidification. for streptococcus mutans gs-5, streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419, gross  membrane damage, indicated by the release of magnesium from whole cells, occurred at ph values below about 4 and was rapid and extensive at ph values of about 3 or less. a more aciduric, lactic acid bacterium, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, was  more resistant to environmental acidification, and gross membrane damage was evident only at ph values below 3. assessments of the movements of protons into s. mutans cells after an acid pulse at various ph values indicated that permeability to protons was minimal at a ph value of about 5, at which the average half time for ph equilibration across the cell membrane was about 12 min. the corresponding values for the less aciduric organism s. sanguis were ph 7 and  8.2 min, and the values for the intermediate organism s. salivarius were ph 6 and 6.6 min. the atpase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide acted to increase markedly the permeability of each organism to protons, and this action indicated that permeability involved not only the passive inflow of protons but also active outflow through the proton-translocating membrane atpase. membranes were isolated from each of the bacteria, and ph profiles for atpase activities indicated ph optima of about 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 for s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans,  and l. casei, respectively. thus, the ph profiles for the enzymes reflected the acid tolerances of the bacteria and the permeabilities of whole cells to protons.

TI  == high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of bacterial fatty acid composition for chemotaxonomic characterization of oral streptococci.
AB  == a high-performance liquid chromatographic method was developed to analyze the fatty acid composition of bacterial lipids. after saponification of lipids extracted from bacteria, the liberated fatty acids were labeled with a fluorescence reagent, 4-bromomethyl-7-acetoxycoumarin, followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic separation and fluorescence detection. all bacterial fatty acids were simultaneously separated within 30 min and sensitively determined. this method was applied to the chemotaxonomic characterization of oral streptococci. the fatty acid composition of phospholipids and total lipids distinguished streptococcus mutans from any other  species examined and showed that streptococcus sanguis had a close taxonomic relationship with streptococcus salivarius.

TI  == calcium-dependent salivary agglutinin with reactivity to various oral bacterial species.
AB  == human parotid agglutinins from three individuals were isolated by adsorption to and desorption from strains of streptococcus mutans belonging to serotypes a, b,  c, d, and e and strains of lactobacillus casei, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus sanguis. the desorption was achieved by suspending centrifuged saliva-coated microorganisms in 10 mm phosphate buffer (ph 6.8) containing 0.154  m sodium chloride. after another centrifugation, agglutinin activity was recovered in the supernatants. the l. casei strain was not agglutinated by any of the agglutinin extracts or by saliva, but all the other strains were agglutinated to a variable extent. however, all strains, including the nonagglutinating l. casei strain, adsorbed and desorbed agglutinins active for other strains. the agglutinin extracts from s. mutans serotype c, s. sanguis, and a. viscosus were purified and characterized by electrophoretic and immunological techniques. the purified preparations were positively stained for protein and carbohydrate, and the molecular weights were estimated to be 440,000. all agglutinin extracts needed calcium in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mm to be active, and for a single strain, all agglutinins gave the same degree of agglutination, indicating that the isolated agglutinins may be of the same molecular species, a hypothesis that  was also confirmed by the preliminary characterization of the purified agglutinins. this type of agglutinin, which seems to exert its activity among various bacterial species, could be important in mediating bacterial coaggregation and thus may add to the effect of specific agglutinins in the clearance of bacteria from the human mouth.

TI  == estimation of growth parameters for some oral bacteria grown in continuous culture under glucose-limiting conditions.
AB  == the coexistence of bacteria in natural environments can often be explained in terms of competition for a growth-limiting substrate(s), and the outcome of such  competition depends upon relevant growth parameters such as substrate affinity and yield. dental plaque bacteria are frequently carbon and energy limited. growth parameters for seven oral streptococcus species and one actinomyces viscosus strain were estimated under glucose-limited conditions in continuous culture. in all strains, mixed-acid fermentation occurred at low growth rates, while amounts of lactate increased at higher growth rates. two important growth parameters, mumax and y glucose, were very similar in the two serotype c streptococcus mutans strains (t8 and ingbritt), one of the serotype d/g streptococcus mutans strains (omz65), and the two streptococcus milleri strains (699b3 and b448). two other serotype d/g s. mutans strains (kir and b13) were divergent from this group and had lower mumax values and a lower y glucose. the maintenance energy coefficients were lower in the s. mutans serotype c strains, and the highest values were observed in the s. milleri strains. while a. viscosus had a lower mumax, its lower maintenance rate and significantly higher yield indicate that it deals much more efficiently with glucose than do the streptococci. the most striking feature of amino acid utilization was that arginine was completely consumed by s. milleri strains; similarly, a. viscosus used up all available asparagine as did one of the s. milleri strains at faster growth rates. it is suggested that the ability of strains of s. milleri and s. sanguis to utilize arginine in addition to carbohydrate as a source of energy may explain why such organisms increase in proportion in the plaque of subjects consuming diets almost devoid of fermentable carbohydrate.

TI  == fibrinolytic therapy in bacterial endocarditis: experimental studies in dogs.
AB  == an investigation was undertaken to assess the value of adding streptokinase therapy to standard penicillin treatment of artificially induced infective endocarditis due to streptococcus sanguis. in pigs a low-grade infection could be induced which closely simulated streptococcal endocarditis in man, but for technical reasons this model proved unsatisfactory for further experimentation. in dogs the induction of s. sanguis endocarditis produced a more severe illness with a short natural history. dogs were divided into two groups, one treated with penicillin alone, the other with penicillin and streptokinase. a five-day course, in which twice daily injections of an acylated streptokinase-plasminogen complex  were given, caused a substantial reduction in the size of vegetations and possibly a higher proportion of cures and less damage to the valves. infarction of the brain, almost certainly due to embolism, was significantly greater in the  streptokinase treated group, but the same was not true of the kidneys. the possible value of such treatment for certain kinds of bacterial endocarditis in man, especially in the right side of the heart, is discussed.

AB  == the role of extracellular matrix material (emm) synthesized from sucrose (s) by streptococcus mutans ib-1600 in altering the demineralizing potential of artificial plaque was evaluated with an intraoral enamel demineralization test (iedt). the artificial plaque samples were prepared from cells cultivated in todd-hewitt broth (thb) supplemented with various s concentrations and by mixing  thb-grown cells with increasing proportions of emm (heat-killed thb + 2% s-cultivated cells). the samples were also evaluated for cell density (dna content) and acidogenicity in vitro (ph-stat), as well as for in situ ph changes  during a 45-minute intra-oral test following a 10% glucose rinse. an increase in  the proportion of emm relative to cell density was associated with an increase in enamel demineralization. this trend reversed when the ratio of cells to emm was less than 1:19. experiments involving strains of s. mitis, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius suggested a similar effect of emm. the intra-oral ph data suggest that the presence of emm may enhance demineralization by altering diffusion properties of plaque.

TI  == kinetics of adhesion of the oral bacterium streptococcus sanguis ch3 to polymers  with different surface free energies.
AB  == the kinetics of adhesion of streptococcus sanguis ch3 from suspension to polymers with different surface free energies were studied by using three bacterial concentrations (2.5 x 10(7), 2.5 x 10(8), and 2.5 x 10(9) cells per ml-1). substratum surface free energies (gamma s) ranged from 18 to 120 erg cm-2. the kinetics of bacterial adhesion to these surfaces showed a typical two-step adhesion process, indicating an equilibrium in both steps. in the initial adhesion step (step 1), low equilibrium numbers of adhering bacteria were counted on substrata with surface free energies lower than 55 erg cm-2. a maximal number  adhered on substrata with higher surface free energies. at the lowest bacterial concentration tested, the highest number of bacteria were found on substrata with a surface free energy around 55 erg cm-2. for each substratum, step 2 started after a characteristic time interval tau, being short (30 min) for gamma s less than 50 and long (120 min) for gamma s greater than 50 erg cm-2. the relationship between the substratum surface free energy and the number of bacteria adhering at equilibrium after step 2 was similar to, although less distinct than, that during step 1 with a slight indication of a bioadhesive minimum around gamma s = 35 erg  cm-2. the results are indicative of a two-step adhesion model, in which step 1 is controlled by macroscopic substratum properties.

TI  == comparative capacity of orally administered amoxicillin and parenterally administered penicillin-streptomycin to protect rabbits against experimentally induced streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == a single-intramuscular-dose immunization regimen with a penicillin g-streptomycin combination was compared with three oral-dose amoxicillin regimens for the capacity to prevent streptococcus sanguis infections of experimentally induced valvular heart lesions in rabbits. challenge doses of 10(4), 10(6), and 10(8) cfu of a strain of s. sanguis equally susceptible to penicillin and amoxicillin were  used in this study. measured by recovery of test organisms from endocardial lesions, the lowest concentration of these inocula was infective for 60% of the recipients; the two higher-concentration inocula were infective for all recipients. the penicillin g-streptomycin combination provided complete protection against infection with inocula of all sizes. a single-oral-dose amoxicillin regimen (50 mg/kg of body weight) prevented endocarditis when rabbits were challenged with 10(4) cfu, but protection diminished with increasing inoculum concentrations. similar results were achieved when five oral doses of amoxicillin (8.5 mg/kg of body weight) added at 8-h intervals were included in the single-oral-dose regimen. in contrast, when rabbits received two oral doses of amoxicillin (50 mg/kg of body weight) with a 10-h interval between doses, prophylaxis was fully effective with even the highest inoculum concentration.

TI  == gingivitis.
AB  == gingivitis is caused by substances derived from microbial plaque accumulating at  or near the gingival sulcus; all other suspected local and systemic etiologic factors either enhance plaque accumulation or retention, or enhance the susceptibility of the gingival tissue to microbial attack. microbial species specifically associated with gingival health include streptococcus sanguis 1, s.  d-7, and fusobacterium naviforme. bacteria involved in the etiology of gingivitis include specific species of streptococcus, fusobacterium, actinomyces, veillonella, and treponema and possibly bacteroides, capnocytophaga, and eikenella. microbial colonization and participation is sequential, with the complexity of the associated flora increasing with time. the pathogenesis has been separated into the initial, early, and established stages, each with characteristic features. the initial lesion is an acute inflammation which can be induced experimentally by application of extracts of plaque bacteria to normal gingiva. the early lesion is characterized by a lymphoid cell infiltrate predominated by t lymphocytes, characteristic of lesions seen at sites of cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. the early lesion can be induced by application of purified contact antigens to the gingival tissues of previously sensitized animals. as the clinical condition worsens, the established lesion appears, predominated by b lymphocytes and plasma cells. established lesions may  remain stable for indefinite periods of time, they may revert, or they may progress. periodontal destruction does not result from the conversion of a predominantly t cell to a predominantly b cell lesion as has been suggested, but  rather from episodes of acute inflammation. clinical manifestations of gingivitis are episodic phenomena characterized by discontinuous bursts of acute inflammation. most lesions are transient or persistent but not progressive. attachment loss may precede alveolar bone loss and may occur without the manifestations of a concurrent or a precursor gingivitis. on the other hand, the  evidence indicates that a portion of gingivitis lesions can and does progress to  periodontitis. gingivitis and the periodontal microflora differ in children and adults. clinical signs of gingivitis either do not appear as plaque accumulates,  or they are greatly delayed in children, and the inflammatory infiltrate consists mostly of t lymphocytes. the conversion to a b cell lesion does not appear to occur. the evidence supports the conclusion that gingivitis is a disease, and that control and prevention is a worthwhile goal and a health benefit.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == whole-cell rhamnose concentrations were measured in 48 strains of streptococci resembling streptococcus sanguis and s. mitior. physiological characteristics were tested by the api-20/strep system, and it was found that "typical" s. sanguis (arginine positive, aesculin positive) contained significant amounts of rhamnose, while "typical" s. mitior (arginine negative, aesculin negative) contained very low or undetectable amounts of rhamnose. both groups contained dextran-positive and dextran-negative strains. organisms that were more difficult to speciate (those giving positive results in the arginine or the aesculin test,  but not in both) could also be divided into a rhamnose-positive and a rhamnose-negative group; with one exception, all of the rhamnose-positive strains gave a positive result with arginine in the api-20/strep test. there were several discrepancies between the results of conventional tests for arginine and aesculin hydrolysis and those of the corresponding api test. the results of conventional tests for arginine hydrolysis did not correlate closely with rhamnose content, and conventional tests for aesculin hydrolysis were less sensitive than api tests. with the api-20/strep system, s. sanguis can almost always be distinguished from s. mitior by its ability to hydrolyse arginine.

TI  == the effect of lowering the ph on the composition and metabolism of a community of nine oral bacteria grown in a chemostat.
AB  == nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at d = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. after an initial period of steady-state growth at ph 7.0, ph control was discontinued. the ph then decreased until it stabilized at ph 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the eh rose from -165 mv to +160 mv. the lowering in ph resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. at ph 7.0, 'streptococcus mitior', veillonella alcalescens and s. sanguis were most numerous while at ph 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. the proportions of s. mutans within the community also increased while s. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and bacteroides intermedius was not detected below ph 4.6. the survival at ph 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. relative to ph 7.0, the community growing at ph 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider ph range but amino acid metabolism decreased. in general, when ph control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for b. intermedius, which was still not detected. the inverse relationship between s. sanguis and s. mutans, and the increase in proportions of l. casei and s. mutans during growth in a low ph environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.

TI  == characterization of genetic transformation in streptococcus mutans by using a novel high-efficiency plasmid marker rescue system.
AB  == we developed a marker rescue system for study of competence development and genetic transformation in streptococcus mutans. the system involved the recombinational rescue of a tetracycline resistance (tcr) determinant by a homologous, inactive locus (tcs because of a small deletion). streptococcal cells harboring this in vitro-prepared tcs construct (pva1208) were restored to tcr when plasmid (pva981) dna was used as donor material. pva981 contained the intact streptococcal tcr locus and was unable to autonomously replicate in streptococci. marker rescue with this system followed first-order kinetics and occurred at a frequency 8- or 160-fold higher than did transformation with homologous chromosomal or plasmid dna, respectively. by using the rescue system, we were able to confirm that competence of s. mutans appeared to be inducible. this was indicated by a sequential increase and then decrease in tcr transformation frequencies during growth in complex medium. also, donor dna binding was not sequence specific, since the recovery of tcr transformants was reduced by increasing the concentrations of heterologous dna. we investigated the fate of donor dna and the kinetics of plasmid establishment in the transformation of s. mutans with plasmid dna. monomeric plasmid molecules transformed s. mutans as a second-order process, whereas multimeric plasmid dna and chromosomal markers were recovered as a first-order process. approximately 50% of the initially bound donor plasmid dna was found to remain in a trichloroacetic acid-insoluble form. our results suggested that molecular cloning in s. mutans would be conducted most efficiently by using helper plasmid systems or shuttle vectors and that gene transfer by transformation of s. mutans occurred in a manner similar to that observed in streptococcus sanguis.

TI  == molecular cloning and characterization of scrb, the structural gene for the streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase.
AB  == a dna fragment encoding the sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase component of the streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system has been recovered from a plasmid-based genomic library of strain gs5. the locus, designated scrb, was found to reside within a 2.9-kilobase-pair restriction fragment present on the chimeric molecule pva1343 (7.3 kilobase pairs). minicell analysis of pva1343-directed translation products revealed that  the scrb product synthesized in escherichia coli v1343 was a single peptide of mr 57,000. this polypeptide was reactive with antiserum prepared against s. mutans intracellular invertase, which has been previously shown to have an mr of 43,000  to 48,000. the basis of this difference in mr was not established but may represent a posttranslational proteolytic event which occurred in s. mutans but not in recombinant v1343. sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase purified to homogeneity from v1343 exhibited michaelis constants of 180 mm for sucrose and 0.08 mm for sucrose-6-phosphate. deletion analysis of pva1343 facilitated the assignment of a coding region for the hydrolase within the insert, as well as an orientation for  the transcription of scrb. scrb-defective strains of s. mutans constructed by additive integration of an insertionally inactivated scrb locus exhibited the sucrose sensitivity characteristic of this mutant class. similar loci were detected by dna-dna hybridization in additional strains of s. mutans and two strains of streptococcus cricetus, but not in single strain representatives of s. rattus, s. sobrinus, s. sanguis i and ii, s. salivarius, or s. mitis.

TI  == strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus attach to different pellicle receptors.
AB  == we compared the levels of adsorption of streptococcus mutans jbp and streptococcus sobrinus 6715 to experimental pellicles formed from unsupplemented  and glucosyltransferase (gtf)-supplemented saliva. pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite beads from gtf or from saliva-gtf mixtures possessed detectable gtf activity. low levels of gtf activity were also detected in clarified whole human saliva, but not in samples of submandibular saliva. the adsorptive behavior of s. mutans jbp to pellicles formed from saliva or saliva-gtf mixtures was strikingly different from that of s. sobrinus 6715. s. mutans jbp adsorbed in higher numbers to pellicles formed from whole or submandibular saliva than to buffer-treated hydroxyapatite under the assay conditions used, in which blocking  with albumin was used. in contrast, s. sobrinus 6715 attached in lower numbers and did not show enhanced adsorption to pellicles prepared from saliva. pellicles prepared from the high-molecular-weight mucin fraction of submandibular saliva effectively promoted adsorption of s. mutans jbp, but none of the saliva fractions tested enhanced the attachment of s. sobrinus 6715 above the levels of  buffer controls. exposure of pellicles which contained gtf to sucrose to permit in situ synthesis of glucan markedly enhanced attachment of s. sobrinus 6715 but  not attachment of s. mutans jbp. also, the presence of sucrose throughout the adsorption period did not enhance attachment of s. mutans jbp. both organisms possessed cell-associated gtf, and gtf preparations derived from s. sobrinus 6715 and streptococcus sanguis fc-1 behaved like gtf derived from s. mutans jbp. s. sobrinus 6715 attached in high numbers to dextran-treated hydroxyapatite, whereas s. mutans jbp did not. these observations suggest that s. mutans jbp cells possess an adhesin which binds to salivary components in the pellicles. in contrast, s. sobrinus 6715 cells appear to possess an adhesin which binds to glucan in the pellicles. four additional strains of s. mutans and four additional strains of s. sobrinus behaved qualitatively like strains jbp and 6715, respectively, and thus the differences observed appear to be representative of these species. collectively, our data indicate that s. mutans and s. sobrinus attach to different receptors in experimental pellicles.

AB  == we have analysed and compared the fine specificity and behavior in various immunoassays of 10 mouse monoclonal antibodies, from three independent laboratories, directed against iga1, iga2 or non-iga2m(2). the following observations were made. (1) although all of the monoclonal antibodies were specific for a particular iga subclass or isoallotype in a radioimmunoassay, three of them were not specific when tested in indirect immunofluorescence on plasma cells derived from pokeweed-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes. in this highly sensitive system, contrary to direct immunofluorescence previously performed using formalin-fixed lymphoid tissue, the anti-iga1 69.114 reacted with some of the iga2 plasma cells, the anti-iga2 dldb7 reacted with some of the iga1  plasma cells and the anti-iga2 16.512 dimly reacted with all igm plasma cells. (2) among the eight anti-iga subclass antibodies, seven were directed against the ch2 domain of iga whereas the anti-iga1 1-155-1 recognised an epitope destroyed by streptococcus sanguis iga1 protease and localised in the hinge region of iga1. the two anti-isoallotype antibodies were directed against epitope(s) probably localised in the 65 c-terminal amino acid residues of the alpha-ch3 domain. all of the 10 antibodies were able to react with endogeneously produced surface iga on b-cells. (3) using monoclonal anti-iga subclass antibodies in radioimmunoassay may be hazardous in the absence of knowledge of their affinity constants and of careful control experiments: some of the antibodies were not sensitive in radioimmunoassays designed to measure the serum titer of specific iga1 and iga2 antibodies. moreover, major differences were observed between the different monoclonal reagents with respect to the influence of the size of iga on a solid-phase sandwich radioimmunoassay. while three of the anti-iga1 underestimated dimeric iga relative to monomeric iga, the fourth anti-iga1 and all the anti-iga2 overestimated dimeric iga relative to monomeric iga, by a factor sometimes close to 7.

TI  == characterization of human dental plaque formed on hydrogen-ion-sensitive field-effect transistor electrodes.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate (with scanning electron microscopy and  microbiological characterization) the bacterial deposits which accumulate on hydrogen-ion-sensitive field-effect transistor electrodes (ph-isfet) under conditions normally employed for telemetric monitoring of changes in human dental plaque ph. electrodes were mounted in a carrier appliance which was worn for two, four, and six days. the plaque ph response to a sucrose solution increased with the age of the plaque, as expected from previous studies. after two days, the electrode was shown to be almost completely covered with cocci. at days 4 and 6 there was a dramatic increase in the number of rods present in the plaque. adjacent enamel surfaces showed similar accumulations of bacteria. the total number of bacteria which had accumulated per unit area by day 4 was very similar  for the electrode and enamel surfaces. on both surfaces the plaque contained approximately 25% streptococci, and the dominant species was streptococcus sanguis (approximately 75%). the plaque which accumulated on ph-isfet electrodes  could not be distinguished visually or microbiologically from that which formed on control enamel surfaces.

TI  == highly efficient protoplast transformation system for streptococcus faecalis and  a new escherichia coli-s. faecalis shuttle vector.
AB  == a highly efficient protoplast transformation system for streptococcus faecalis has been developed by systematically optimizing different parameters. up to 10(6) transformants per micrograms of dna were consistently obtained within 3 days, and cell wall regeneration of protoplasts was virtually 100%. a systematic search for useful vectors showed that the broad-host-range plasmid pip501 could transform s. faecalis at a high frequency (6.3 x 10(4) transformants per microgram). by combining a high-copy-number derivative of pip501, designated pgb354, with the escherichia coli vector pacyc184, we constructed a new e. coli-s. faecalis shuttle vector (pam401) having nine unique restriction sites. in a shotgun cloning experiment, we ligated a tetracycline resistance determinant from streptococcus sanguis chromosomal dna into pam401 by direct transformation of s.  faecalis, establishing the utility of the protoplast transformation system and of the new shuttle vector.

TI  == some remarks about laser-induced mass spectrometry of bacteria.
AB  == in order to investigate the availability of laser-induced mass spectrometry for the determination of bacteria, ten strains of the genera escherichia and streptococcus were chosen. gram-negative as well as gram-positive lysogenic and non-lysogenic, pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains were examined. giant pulses  of a nd: yag laser (frequency quadrupled, wave-length 265 nm) were used to vaporize and partly ionize the bacterial material. the time-of-flight mass spectra obtained could be discriminated by using the stepwise discriminant analysis provided by bmdp software package. two different methods relating centrifugation and washing procedures were used. with the first method a correct  classification between 50.0 and 90.9 per cent (s. sanguis) by means of mass spectra of positive ions and a correct classification between 27.1 and 80.4 per cent (s. lactis-25) by means of mass spectra of negative ions was observed. using the second method a correct classification between 40.7 and 93.3 per cent (s. lactis-25) by means of mass spectra of positive ions and a correct classification between 56.7 and 95.0 per cent by means of mass spectra of negative ions was obtained. here s. sanguis with 93.3 and s. lactis-25 with 81.7 per cent were significantly differentiated. in this context it must be emphasized that a correct classification of 27 per cent must be considered statistically significant, if 10 different strains are used.

TI  == adherence of streptococcus sanguis to hydroxyapatite coated with lysozyme and lysozyme-supplemented saliva.
AB  == the adherence of [3h]thymidine-labeled streptococcus sanguis strains to bare hydroxyapatite and to hydroxyapatite coated with a range of concentrations of lysozyme, poly-l-lysine, poly-l-glutamic acid, whole saliva supernatant, and combinations of some of the above was studied. adherence of several strains of s. sanguis to bare hydroxyapatite and saliva-coated hydroxyapatite was compared. saliva present as a pellicle on the hydroxyapatite inhibited adherence of some strains (903, m-5, 73x11) and stimulated that of others (s35, b-4, 66x49). strains 903 and s35 were chosen for further study. adherence of both strains was  stimulated up to fivefold by the presence of adsorbed lysozyme or poly-l-lysine on the hydroxyapatite, whereas poly-l-glutamic acid inhibited adherence (80 to 95%). adherence of strain s35 to hydroxyapatite coated with combinations of saliva and (i) lysozyme, (ii) poly-l-lysine, or (iii) poly-l-glutamic acid was unaffected compared with adherence to hydroxyapatite coated with saliva alone. in contrast, adherence of strain 903 to hydroxyapatite coated with combinations of saliva and either lysozyme or poly-l-lysine was inhibited up to ca. 90% compared  with hydroxyapatite coated with saliva alone. strain 903 was also unaffected by combinations of poly-l-glutamic acid and saliva on the hydroxyapatite. adherent cells of both strains were completely (greater than 90%) eluted with high-ionic-strength buffer from either bare hydroxyapatite or hydroxyapatite coated with lysozyme alone. adherent cells of strain s35 were only poorly eluted  (25%) from hydroxyapatite coated with either saliva alone or saliva and lysozyme. strain 903 elution from hydroxyapatite coated with either saliva alone or saliva  and lysozyme was essentially complete. these observations were taken to indicate  that the two test strains adhered to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite by different mechanisms. protein-coated hydroxyapatite was shown not to be saturated under the conditions described here. examination by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the variously supplemented salivary pellicles formed on the hydroxyapatite demonstrated that major changes in salivary protein composition did not occur when lysozyme, poly-l-lysine, or poly-l-glutamic acid was used to supplement saliva. lysozyme-dependent aggregation of strain 903 was shown not to occur under the conditions of our experiments. we suggest that the basis for stimulation of adherence to hydroxyapatite coated only with lysozyme is an increase in the cationic surface area available for electrostatic adherence of the microorganisms.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == use of the photoaffinity cross-linking agent n-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic acid to characterize salivary-glycoprotein-bacterial interactions.
AB  == the present study has utilized the iodinatable cross-linking agent n-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidosalicylic acid (asa) to examine the specific interaction between the proline-rich glycoprotein (prg) of human parotid saliva and streptococcus sanguis g9b. the binding of 125i-asa-prg to streptococcus sanguis g9b displayed saturation kinetics, reversibility and was inhibited by unlabelled prg. inhibition studies with other glycoproteins and saccharides indicated that binding was mediated by a bacterial adhesin with specificity towards n-acetylneuraminic acid, galactose, and n-acetylgalactosamine. after cross-linking, the 125i-asa-prg-adhesin complex could be extracted with sds and separated from uncoupled 125i-asa-prg by gel filtration on sepharose cl-6b. approx. 1% of the 125i-asa-prg was cross-linked to the bacterial surface. examination of the 125i-asa-prg-adhesin complex by sds/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis/fluorography on 5% -(w/v)-polyacrylamide gels revealed that prg was bound to two bacterial components. these findings support our previous suggestion that human salivary glycoproteins can specifically interact with oral  streptococci and that these interactions occur between the glycoprotein's carbohydrate units and lectin(s) on the bacterial cell surface.

TI  == identification of a streptococcus sanguis receptor for salivary agglutinins.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize a fraction from oral streptococci containing receptor activity for salivary agglutinin molecules. several species and strains of streptococci were disrupted in a ribi press. the supernatant was nuclease-treated and subjected to differential centrifugation. receptor activity  in the fractions was measured by the inhibition of saliva-mediated bacterial aggregation. in addition, bacterial strains were tested for their ability to aggregate and to deplete saliva of agglutinin activity. three patterns of activity were observed: streptococcus sanguis m5 depleted saliva of agglutinin activity and aggregated well; streptococcus sanguis cc5a depleted saliva of agglutinin but did not aggregate well; and streptococcus faecalis s-161 neither depleted saliva of agglutinin nor did it aggregate. the 105,000 g supernatant fractions derived from ribi-disrupted streptococcus sanguis m5 and cc5a, but not  from streptococcus faecalis, showed dose-dependent inhibition of saliva-mediated  aggregation. this inhibitory activity was non-dialyzable, had the same heat and trypsin sensitivity as that seen with intact bacteria, and was not due to enzymatic digestion of the salivary agglutinin. iso-electric focusing revealed a  single active region with a pi of 5.5 which was clearly separated from the bulk of the bacterial proteins.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a 60-kilodalton salivary glycoprotein with agglutinating activity against strains of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a bacterial agglutinin specific for strains of streptococcus mutans was isolated  from human saliva. physiochemical analyses showed the agglutinin to be a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 60,000. the agglutinin aggregated four of the eight strains of streptococcus mutans tested but did not aggregate the strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis tested. chemical modification of carbohydrate moieties of the agglutinin with sodium metaperiodate had no effect on aggregation, whereas modification of the polypeptide portion with trypsin abolished aggregating activity. a set of five murine hybridoma antibodies was employed to further analyze the agglutinin.  two carbohydrate-specific antibodies, directed against d-mannose and n-acetylgalactosamine moieties, respectively, failed to block agglutinin- or whole saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells. in contrast, two antibodies directed against pronase-sensitive antigenic sites blocked both agglutinin- and saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells. western blot analysis with the agglutinin-specific hybridoma antibodies demonstrated the agglutinin in whole saliva and in artificial tooth pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite beads incubated with saliva. these results suggest that a 60-kilodalton glycoprotein of human saliva is a bacterial agglutinin with specificity for certain strains of s. mutans. they further suggest that aggregation is mediated by polypeptide rather than carbohydrate determinants of the glycoprotein.

TI  == active streptokinase from the cloned gene in streptococcus sanguis is without the carboxyl-terminal 32 residues.

(1984) mgg, mol. gen. genet. 196, 360-365] while the molecular weight of the native streptokinase is 47 000. the structural and activity differences of the cloned streptokinase (csk) as expressed by s. sanguis and the native streptokinase (nsk) were investigated. from a partially purified csk, two active  fractions were obtained by reversed-phase hplc. the minor fraction cskl was nearly as active as sk in plasminogen activation. the major fraction csks had only about one-fourth of the specific activity. the structures of cskl and csks were studied and compared to the known amino acid sequence of sk [jackson, k. w., & tang, j. (1982) biochemistry 21, 6620-6625]. from the nh2- and cooh-terminal sequences and amino acid composition of the cyanogen bromide (cnbr) fragments, it could be deduced that cskl and csks are without 31 and 32 residues, respectively, from the cooh-terminal end of sk. since the cloned gene contained the full sk structure, the missing structures must have been due to posttranslational proteolysis. an sk fragment similar in size to csk was observed from a chymotryptic digest of sk.

TI  == enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of antibodies to nutritionally variant streptococci in patients with endocarditis.
AB  == the viridans streptococci are responsible for 50%-55% of microbial endocarditis.  among these varied species, the nutritionally variant streptococci (nvs) have recently been associated with culture-negative endocarditis and are responsible for 5%-10% of all streptococcal endocarditis. the isolation and identification of these bacteria has been hampered by the extremely fastidious nature of their growth requirements as well as by their slow growth rate. in addition, their antibiotic sensitivity varies greatly, a characteristic leading to a higher rate  of morbidity and mortality than is found in patients with non-nvs endocarditis. for these reasons sera from patients with nvs endocarditis were examined for antibodies to the nvs serotype i antigen by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. seventy-four percent of patients with nvs endocarditis had elevated titers to this antigen. none of the sera from controls and only 6.7% of the sera from patients with non-nvs streptococcal endocarditis showed increased titers. these results indicate that antibody to the nvs serotype i antigen can serve as a marker for nvs endocarditis.

TI  == construction of plasmid vectors for the detection of streptococcal promoters.
AB  == plasmid vectors have been constructed for detecting dna fragments that exhibit promoter activity in streptococcus sanguis. the plasmids are able to replicate in both s. sanguis and escherichia coli, and contain an erythromycin resistance marker which is expressed in both hosts. selection for promoter activity is dependent upon the insertion of appropriate dna fragments upstream from a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene (cat) from staphylococcus aureus. to facilitate this insertion, a pair of vectors, pmu1327 and pmu1328, were constructed with the polylinker from m13mp 18 in either orientation. the to  transcriptional terminator of phage lambda is present downstream from cat. translation stop codons in all reading frames are located between the polylinker  and the initiation codon of cat. these plasmids have been used to isolate dna fragments from s. sanguis, s. lactis and s. cremoris that exhibit promoter activity in s. sanguis.

TI  == the influence of diet on the growth of streptococcal bacteria on the molar teeth  of monkeys (macaca fascicularis).
AB  == the rates of regrowth of bacteria in developmental grooves on these teeth were determined. plaque was removed from palatal grooves up to 96 h after cleaning and the number of bacteria and of individual streptococcal species were determined; streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitior were the major ones. in monkeys fed one of three different diets, the numbers of each species reached stable levels 18-24 h after tooth cleaning. the median doubling times of the streptococcal population were 4.69, 3.82 and 4.25 h for two maintenance diets and a sucrose diet, respectively. the median doubling times of  individual species ranged from 2.01 to 4.38 h and appeared to be independent of the composition of the various diets. there was no difference in the number of bacteria in 18 h-old plaque from discrete sites in fed or fasted monkeys, nor in  the numbers of streptococci, except that the size of the strep. mitior population increased significantly with fasting. thus host-derived substrates, possibly salivary components, may be used by plaque bacteria and support their on growth in developmental grooves in the absence of food.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the effect of an intensive antimicrobial treatment on the number of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus/actinomyces naeslundii, and the total colony-forming units (cfu) in plaque. the dentition of human volunteers was treated in a dental office with either chlorhexidine (5%) or stannous fluoride (8%). following the office treatment with chlorhexidine, selected volunteers rinsed daily at home for seven  or 49 days with chlorhexidine solution (0.2%), while another group flossed daily  at home for seven days with dental floss impregnated with chlorhexidine. on days  one, seven, 21, 35, and 49 after the local applications, we took saliva samples and plaque samples from fissures, smooth surfaces, and approximal areas. chlorhexidine and stannous fluoride suppressed s. mutans and the actinomyces species on all surfaces and in saliva. s. mutans on tooth surfaces was suppressed for approximately seven days and returned to the baseline level at day 21. a. viscosus/naeslundii was suppressed for more than seven days on the teeth. s. sanguis and the total cfu returned to the baseline level within seven days on all surfaces and in saliva. rinsing or flossing with chlorhexidine suppressed s. mutans during the period of time that these supplements were used. brushing for seven days with chlorhexidine gel (1%) without a preceding intensive chlorhexidine treatment had virtually no effect on s. mutans in approximal areas  and in saliva, but suppressed s. mutans in fissures and on smooth surfaces.

TI  == characterization of nutritionally variant streptococci by biochemical tests and penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == a comparative study of 60 strains of nutritionally variant streptococci (nvs) with 34 strains of streptococcus mitis and 37 strains of streptococcus sanguis ii showed the presence of a red chromophore which was absent in the other streptococcal species. by using the conventional microbiological tests, only small differences were found between the nvs and the two other related species. in contrast a clear-cut delineation was found by the api 20 strep system of identification. all nvs contained pyrrolidonylarylamidase, an enzyme which was absent in s. mitis and s. sanguis ii strains, and lacked the alkaline phosphatase enzyme which was present in 56% of s. mitis strains and 62% of s. sanguis ii strains. according to the additional enzymatic and biochemical tests of the api 20 strep system, there were three biotypes among nvs. the major biotype included  33 of 60 strains which were characterized by the presence of both alpha- and beta-galactosidases and the capacity to hydrolyze trehalose. this biotype also showed a specific pattern of penicillin-binding proteins. these results show that nvs are recognized as a separate variety distinct from s. mitis and s. sanguis ii species, despite some common biochemical properties. moreover, the delineation of 33 strains with a specific biotype and a specific penicillin-binding protein pattern strongly suggests that a large part of nvs strains belong to an individual species.

TI  == microbial adhesion to fibronectin in vitro correlates with production of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  == microbial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (nbte) is an important early event in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. fibronectin is a ubiquitous mammalian glycoprotein with diverse functions which binds to certain bacteria but not to others. in this study, we determined that fibronectin is present on the surface of nbte (after catheter-induced aortic valve trauma) but not on normal rabbit cardiac valvular endothelium. the adhesion of various bacteria and yeasts to human fibronectin in tissue culture wells was then measured. microorganisms with a high isolation frequency from endocarditis cases (staphylococcus aureus, candida tropicalis, c. albicans, streptococcus faecalis, s. sanguis) bound significantly better (p less than 0.01) to fibronectin in vitro than other organisms (escherichia coli, c. krusei, pseudomonas aeruginosa) rarely implicated in this disease. microbial adhesion to  fibronectin correlated closely with the propensity of each organism to produce endocarditis in rabbits (e.g., id50) with preexistent nbte. a similar distribution was noted after binding of soluble radiolabeled fibronectin to bacteria in suspension. the results suggest that fibronectin, expressed on the surface of nbte, may mediate microbial adhesion of circulating organisms to initiate colonization during the early pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.

TI  == longitudinal microbiological investigation of a hospitalized population of older  adults with a high root surface caries risk.
AB  == intact root surfaces of chronically hospitalized subjects were sampled periodically to enumerate bacterial species believed to be associated with root caries. bacteria were cultivated and enumerated using a series of selective and enriched media. microbial counts, isolation frequencies, and percent cultivable flora data were analyzed for caries-active and caries-free surfaces and subjects. s. mutans, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, total lactobacilli, and veillonella accounted for a mean of less than 20% of the cultivated flora, with mitis salivarius agar cultivable streptococci averaging less than 5%. the microbial count data were highly variable, precluding the finding of significant  differences in caries association for either subjects or sites. streptococci, especially s. mutans, correlated highly with lactobacilli in the samples.

TI  == trypsin-susceptible cell surface characteristics of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the adherence of streptococcus sanguis to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite was markedly reduced by treatment of the cells with trypsin. in scatchard plots of adherence data, protease-treated s. sanguis did not exhibit the characteristic positive slopes, suggesting that trypsin prevented cooperative interactions between the cells and artificial pellicle. trypsin also reduced the tendency of s. sanguis to bind to hexadecane and to octyl-sepharose. when sodium dodecyl sulfate was used to elute s. sanguis from columns of octyl-sepharose, it was observed that the elution profiles of trypsin-treated cells were more complex than those of control cells. water and salts were incapable of removing the cells from octyl-sepharose. the results suggest that adherence to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite, binding to hexadecane and to octyl-sepharose depend on trypsin-susceptible cell surface molecules.

TI  == comparative studies on the effect of growth conditions on adhesion, hydrophobicity, and extracellular protein profile of streptococcus sanguis g9b.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis g9b was grown in continuous culture at different generation times and ph values in media containing either glucose or fructose and differing  in the concentrations of na+ and k+. the growth ph, carbohydrate, and cation concentration each affected the yield of organisms, their ability to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads, and their hydrophobicity, as measured by adhesion to hexadecane. there was no correlation between adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and hydrophobicity, the values for hydrophobicity varying between 44 and 83% for organisms that adhered poorly and between 24 and 75% for those that adhered effectively. for organisms grown in batch culture at ph 6.0 or 7.0 there was similarly no correlation between adhesion and hydrophobicity. the growth conditions also had a considerable influence on the production of extracellular protein. the total amount was greater at ph 7.5 than at other ph values, and there were also differences in the individual components in response to changes in generation time, ph, carbohydrate source, and cation concentration. two protein bands were identified, namely, glucosyltransferase and protein p1 (also called antigen b or i/ii). however, there was no correlation between a particular protein component and adhesion.

TI  == regulation of glycolytic rate in streptococcus sanguis grown under glucose-limited and glucose-excess conditions in a chemostat.
AB  == the biochemical mechanisms of the acidogenic potential of streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 grown in glucose-excess and glucose-limited continuous culture were studied. the rate of acid production during the glucose metabolism by the cells grown under glucose limitation (glucose-limited cells) was 2.1 to 2.6 times that  by the cells grown in an excess of glucose (glucose-excess cells). when the glucose-limited cells were metabolizing glucose, intracellular concentrations of  glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and pyruvate were  higher, and that of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate was lower, than those when the glucose-excess cells were metabolizing glucose. the levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate were not significantly different  between these cells. the activities of glucose-phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system in decriptified cells and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in cell-free extracts of the glucose-limited cells were higher than those in the glucose-excess cells. the activities of glucokinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and pyruvate kinase in cell-free extracts of these cells were not different significantly. we conclude that the high glycolytic activity of the glucose-limited cells results from the increase in the synthesis of glucose-phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

TI  == colonization of the human oral cavity by a strain of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans strain jh1001 produces a bacteriocin that can kill virtually all other strains of this micro-organism. the ability of jh1001 to colonize the human oral cavity was tested in a study involving five subjects and three different infection regimens, all of which involved multiple exposures to large numbers of organisms. two and one-half years after infection, jh1001 was found to have persistently colonized three of the subjects. the indigenous s. mutans in one subject were reduced below the level of detection. levels of (total) s. mutans and s. sanguis were not affected in persistently colonized subjects. mutants of indigenous s. mutans resistant to the bacteriocin were not observed. the results indicate the importance of host variability and infection regimen for superinfection by this strain of s. mutans. the efficient replacement of indigenous s. mutans by jh1001 in one subject lends support to the eventual application of replacement therapy to the prevention of dental caries.

AB  == species identifications of 71 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from blood and 4 reference strains were made by the api 20 strep system (api system s. a., montalieu-vercien, france) and the conventional method. there are high levels of agreement between results obtained with the both methods for determining acidification from carbohydrate except inulin. the api 20 strep system correctly  identified 74.7% of the viridans streptococci with 9.3% low descrimination, 12% incorrect and 4% unidentified. all strains of s. mitis, s. mutans, s. salivarius  and s. anginosus-constellatus were correctly identified. the correct identification rates for s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. mg-intermedius were 88.9%, 68% and 61% respectively. the difference of inulin reaction and the taxonomy discrepancy may be the cause of different identification. the study indicates that the api 20 strep system has a good potentiality for species identification of viridans streptococci at present time, however, further refinement in needed.

TI  == fluoride uptake and fluoride resistance in oral streptococci.
AB  == fluoride uptake was examined in the highly f-sensitive streptococcus salivarius strain 25975, the f-resistant mutant flr103, and the relatively insensitive s. sanguis h7pr3. f was taken up by all strains from media at neutral ph, containing 1 or 10 micrograms f/ml (0.053-0.526 mmol/l), and uptake was directly proportional to the delta ph that was maintained by the cells. the final intracellular concentrations of f in the f-resistant strains were higher than those in the f-sensitive strain. similar differences in f uptake were observed in buffer at ph 5.5, although both delta ph and f uptake were higher in all strains  at the lower ph. these experiments demonstrate that resistance to f does not necessarily involve the exclusion of f from the cells. the lower uptake of f by f-sensitive cells is attributed to the finding that f dissipates the transmembrane ph gradient, and this, in turn, limits the concentration of intracellular f.

TI  == anaerobic and aerobic metabolism of sorbitol in streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitior.
AB  == sorbitol-fermenting strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitior were grown both anaerobically and in the presence of oxygen in a sorbitol-containing complex medium. washed-cell suspensions were incubated with an excess of sorbitol, and the production of lactate, formate, ethanol, and acetate was analyzed. moreover, we determined the lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate-lyase activities in cell-free extracts of anaerobically grown cells. the anaerobically grown cells produced lactate, formate, ethanol, and acetate under anaerobic conditions. when these cells were exposed to air, the amounts of formate, ethanol, and acetate were reduced in comparison with those of the strictly anaerobic cells. cells grown in the presence of oxygen only produced detectable levels of lactate and acetate. anaerobically grown cells possessed lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate-lyase activities under strictly anaerobic conditions. the level of pyruvate formate-lyase was dramatically reduced when cells were exposed to air, while the level of lactate dehydrogenase  was about the same as that under strictly anaerobic conditions. thus, the results indicate that s. sanguis and s. mitior both metabolize sorbitol differently under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. this difference may depend on the oxygen-sensitivity of the pyruvate formatelyase of these micro-organisms.

AB  == cell surfaces of aggregation, adherence, and hydrophilic variants of streptococcus sanguis were compared with cell surfaces of the parent strain with  regard to their protein and antigenic constituents. cell surface molecules were released by digestion with mutanolysin. extraction with sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) urea, lithium diiodosalicylate, and boiling water did not solubilize any material which stained with agno3 in an sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. the parent organism s. sanguis 12, which aggregates in saliva, adheres to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and is hydrophobic, was found to possess a prominently staining 160,000 molecular weight (mw) protein. this protein was almost completely absent from strain 12na, a hydrophobic nonaggregating variant,  and was completely absent from the hydrophilic nonaggregating strain 12l. trypsinization of strain 12 resulted in the coincident loss of the 160,000-mw protein and the ability to aggregate in saliva. trypsin treatment reduced but did not eliminate the hydrophobic character of the cells. boiling destroyed their ability to aggregate, but did not alter their hydrophobicity. cell wall digests of strain 12 contained a number of proteins which were absent from strains 12na and 12l. mutanolysin digests of cell walls of the hydrophilic strains contained almost no material that was visible in a silver-stained sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. culture supernatants contained a number of proteins which were immunologically cross-reactive with cell surface proteins. the hydrophilic organisms released a number of 60,000- to 90,000-mw proteins not seen in culture  supernatants from the parent strain.

TI  == the surface free energy of oral streptococci after being coated with saliva and its relation to adhesion in the mouth.
AB  == contact angle measurements on layers of bacteria were used to determine the bacterial surface free energy (gamma b) of a variety of oral streptococcal strains, both without and after being coated with human whole saliva. at least four isolates of each species, either freshly isolated or laboratory strains, were used. the species streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius were homogeneous, having high surface free energies, and were not affected by saliva treatment (gamma b = 106 +/- 12 and 107 +/- 10 erg x cm-2 in the absence and presence of saliva coating, respectively; n = 20). s. mitis had a very low surface free energy (46 +/- 15; n = 5), which was significantly increased after salivary adsorption (71 +/- 14 erg x cm-2; p less than 0.002). the species s. milleri contained strains with both high and low gamma b. calculation of the interfacial free energy of adhesion (delta f adh) for bacteria from a saliva suspension to solid surfaces with various arbitrary surface free energies (gamma  s) showed that, theoretically, most strains will encounter thermodynamically favorable conditions for adhesion to surfaces with a gamma s above 62 erg x cm-2. however, s. mitis strains not coated with saliva would only be able to adhere to  surfaces with gamma s lower than this value. saliva-coating reverses the calculated relationship with gamma s for these strains. the results indicate that an enamel surface with a low gamma s value would be thermodynamically unfavorable for adhesion of most oral streptococci.

TI  == environmental regulation of carbohydrate metabolism by streptococcus sanguis nctc 7865 grown in a chemostat.
AB  == carbohydrate metabolism by the oral bacterium streptococcus sanguis nctc 7865 was studied using cells grown in a chemostat at ph 7.0 under glucose or amino acid limitation (glucose excess) over a range of growth rates (d = 0.05 h-1-0.4 h-1).  a mixed pattern of fermentation products was always produced although higher concentrations of lactate were formed under amino acid limitation. analysis of culture filtrates showed that arginine was depleted from the medium under all conditions of growth; a further supplement of 10 mm-arginine was also consumed but did not affect cell yields, suggesting that it was not limiting growth. except at the slowest growth rate (d = 0.05 h-1) under glucose limitation, the activity of the glucose phosphotransferase (pts) system was insufficient to account for the glucose consumed during growth, emphasizing the importance of an  alternative method of hexose transport in the metabolism of oral streptococci. the pts for a number of sugars was constitutive in s. sanguis nctc 7865 and, even though the cells were grown in the presence of glucose, the activity of the sucrose-pts was highest. the glycolytic activity of cells harvested from the chemostat was affected by the substrate, the ph of the environment, and their original conditions of growth. glucose-limited cells produced more acid than those grown under conditions of glucose excess; at slow growth rates, in particular, greater activities were obtained with sucrose compared with glucose or fructose. maximum rates of glycolytic activity were obtained at ph 8.0 (except for cells grown at d = 0.4 h-1 where values were highest at ph 7.0), while slow-growing, amino acid-limited cells could not metabolize at ph 5.0. these results are discussed in terms of their possible significance in the ecology of dental plaque and the possible involvement of these bacteria in the initiation but not the clinical progression of a carious lesion.

AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

AB  == of 46 viridans streptococci isolated from cases of probably true bacteremia, 26 strains or 56% could be grouped serologically in the lancefield system. eight strains (17%) were identified as serogroup h (characteristic of streptococcus sanguis), ten strains (22%) as serogroup w (a new group antigen found in s. sanguis) and eight strains (17%) as serogroup k (related to s. mitis (mitior)). the high number of serogroupable viridans streptococci was specially due to the introduction of serogroup w and indicates the importance of this serogroup in cases of bacteremia. a set of six diagnostic tests (production of hydrogen peroxide, arginine and esculin hydrolysis, polysaccharide production, voges-proskauer reaction, mannitol fermentation) was used for speciation of the viridans streptococci; in addition, search for spreading zones around the colonies was included in the diagnostic procedure. spreading zones were only present in s. sanguis and occurred more frequently in group h strains than group  w strains. the 46 viridans streptococci were tested in genetic transformation. the prevalence of spontaneous competence in strains isolated from the blood was high, particularly in s. sanguis serogroup h (88%) and w (50%). for serogroup h,  spontaneous competence was found as frequently among invasive strains as among carrier isolates previously studied.

AB  == in this report over 400 subgingival plaque samples taken from over 110 patients were examined microscopically and culturally for 30 bacterial parameters. the patients could be placed into six disease categories based upon clinical criteria. the bacterial profile of each clinical category was generally distinctive of that category. periodontal patients who had been successfully treated and maintained had plaques that were populated by significantly higher proportions of streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, a. odontolyticus and  s. mutans and significantly lower proportions of b. gingivalis and spirochetes compared to the five untreated disease categories. the spirochetes were the overwhelming microbial type in the plaques of adult periodontitis (ap) patients,  averaging about 45% of the microscopic count. the bacteriological results could not distinguish between ada type iii and iv periodontitis, suggesting that the same type of infection was occurring in an active site in any ap patient. the patients designated as early onset periodontitis (eop) differed from the other patients by their relative youth and by their significantly higher proportions of bacteroides gingivalis and/or b. intermedius. two types of eop were recognized in which the most diseased variant was characterized by having an average of 49% spirochetes in the plaque. four localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients were notable in not having detectable a. actinomycetemcomitans. the data indicate that the various types of periodontitis, with the possible exception of ljp are specific anaerobic infections involving spirochetes and to a lesser extent b. gingivalis and b. intermedius.

AB  == the normal microbial colonization of sites in the body's tissues by certain bacteria requires that the bacteria first bind to extracellular secreted constituents, cell-surface membranes, or cell matrixes. this study examines two interactions of a variety of bacteria with the cell matrix noncollagenous proteins fibronectin and laminin and with basement membrane (type iv) collagen. adherence of bacteria to matrix proteins coated on tissue culture wells was examined with the use of radiolabeled bacteria. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus sanguis bound well to fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen, whereas a variety of gram-negative organisms did not bind. the interaction of soluble laminin, fibronectin, and type iv collagen with bacteria was monitored by nephelometry with the use of a platelet aggregometer. s. aureus aggregated in response to fibronectin, laminin, or type iv collagen. in contrast, gram-negative organisms did not aggregate with these proteins. it appears that fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen can bind and aggregate certain gram-positive bacteria, and this binding is dependent on the surface characteristics of the organism. these adhesion molecules may play a role in the normal colonization of sites by microorganisms and in invasion during infections.

TI  == isolation of actinomyces bacteriophage from human dental plaque.
AB  == human dental plaque samples were screened for the presence of bacteriophage for actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus sanguis. none of the 336 samples yielded phage for s. sanguis, but 10 contained virulent actinomyces phage. a high host cell specificity was observed in that one phage isolate infected only a. viscosus t14v, eight phage isolates infected only a. viscosus mg-1, and one infected both  strains. none was capable of productively infecting various other actinomyces strains that represented the six actinomyces coaggregation groups. because phage-containing samples occurred randomly in this survey, no correlation between the individual collecting the samples, dental clinic, or type of patient and the  presence of phage in the sample was noted. examination of one of the samples that yielded phage for the presence of a natural host strain for that particular phage resulted in the isolation of two strains which were identified as a. viscosus serotype ii and actinomyces naeslundii serotype i. this is the first report of an a. naeslundii host strain and actinomyces bacteriophage of human dental plaque origin. the finding of both phage and host strains in the same dental plaque sample along with the observation of high host cell specificity by these phage provide indicators that support an active role for actinomyces bacteriophage in oral microbial ecology. the use of these freshly isolated phage as probes to study actinomyces coaggregation properties is discussed.

TI  == molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b  (mls) in streptococci.
AB  == resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (mls phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. genes coding for mls resistance are located on plasmids and one mls resistance transposon has been described. mls resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (mdal) that code either for mls or for both mls and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci  of groups a, b, c, d (streptococcus faecalis) and g. these plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). one smaller non-conjugative mls resistance plasmid has been isolated from str. sanguis (4.5 mdal). in group d (str. faecalis, str. faecium) streptococci, mls resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). these multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. the mls resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of str. faecalis, are located on  a transposon of 3.3 mdal, tn917. hybridization studies, with mls determinants as  probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne mls resistance sequences. elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including mls) in streptococci of groups a, b, c, d (str. bovis), f,  g, str. pneumoniae, str. mitis, str. sanguis and str. milleri. strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid dna. in some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. such elements, from str. pyogenes and str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.

TI  == comparison of single doses of amoxicillin or of amoxicillin-gentamicin for the prevention of endocarditis caused by streptococcus faecalis and by viridans streptococci.
AB  == recent recommendations for the prophylaxis of endocarditis in humans have advocated single doses or short courses of antibiotic combinations (beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside) for susceptible patients in whom enterococcal bacteremia might develop or for patients at especially high risk of developing endocarditis  (e.g., patients with prosthetic cardiac valves). we tested the prophylactic efficacy (in rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations) of single doses of amoxicillin plus gentamicin against challenge with various streptococcal strains  (two strains of streptococcus faecalis, one of streptococcus bovis, and three of  viridans streptococci); we then compared this efficacy with that of single doses  of amoxicillin alone. successful prophylaxis against all six strains was achieved with single doses of both amoxicillin alone and amoxicillin plus gentamicin. this protection, however, was limited, for both regimens, to the lowest bacterial-inoculum size producing endocarditis in 90% of control rats and was not extended to higher inocula by using the combination of antibiotics. we concluded  that a single dose of amoxicillin alone was protective against enterococcal and nonenterococcal endocarditis in the rat, but that its efficacy was limited and could not be improved by the simultaneous administration of gentamicin.

TI  == recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  == recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. the survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. all species survived well or grew in serum. haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguis and group a streptococci were killed in all urine samples. the number of colony-forming units of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and group b streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. these data suggest  that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.

TI  == immune complex hyperlipidemia induced by an apolipoprotein-reactive immunoglobulin a paraprotein from a patient with multiple myeloma. characterization of this immunoglobulin.
AB  == an antibodylike paraprotein has been isolated from a patient with multiple myeloma and autoimmune hyperlipoproteinemia. the paraprotein bound to apolipoprotein b (apo b)-containing lipoproteins that formed macromolecular aggregates, and globules thought to be aggregated complexes of lipoproteins and reactive immunoglobulins were observed circulating within the retinal blood vessels of this patient. this binding specificity permitted purification of the paraprotein from both the agglutinated immune complexes and from the plasma. the  protein is an iga, kappa-immunoglobulin which exists primarily in a polymeric state. capillary immunoprecipitation demonstrated reactivity with very low density lipoproteins (vldl) and low density proteins (ldl), but not with high density lipoproteins (hdl). delipidated apo b and apo e, but not apo a or apo c,  formed precipitates with this immunoglobulin. in using a radioimmunoassay format, the affinity of the immunoglobulin was greatest for vldl and decreases sequentially for intermediate density lipoproteins and ldl. no binding occurred with a dispersion of ldl lipids or with hdl. deglycosylation did not change the binding to ldl. the apolipoproteins b and e bound with similar affinity, but no binding occurred with apo a-i or apo a-ii. weak binding appeared to occur with apo c. this paraprotein immunoprecipitated apo b-containing lipoproteins from all classes of vertebrates tested. displacement of the lipids of ldl by triton x-100  resulted in the formation of an apo b-triton complex which, however, did not bind to the immunoglobulin; apparently the binding site on apo b was lost. upon enzymatic digestion with the iga-specific protease from streptococcus sanguis the immunoglobulin was cleaved into fc and fab fragments, and the binding of ldl occurred only with the latter, consistent with the behavior of an immunoglobulin. the immunoreactivity of this paraprotein with apo b and apo e raises the interesting possibility that it may be binding to a site on these apolipoproteins which is reactive with the apo b, e receptor of the plasma membrane, a site which is conserved throughout the vertebrate phylum.

TI  == cloned gtfa gene of streptococcus mutans lm7 alters glucan synthesis in streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == streptococcus mutans lm7 (bratthall serotype e) chromosomal dna was partially digested with ecori and ligated into the positive-selection plasmid vector pop203(a2+). the ligation mixture was transformed into escherichia coli, and transformants were selected for tetracycline resistance. recombinant-bearing clones were screened for their ability to ferment raffinose, using the procedure  of robeson et al. (j. bacteriol. 153:211-221, 1983). one raffinose-fermenting clone was isolated and found to contain a plasmid with an insert consisting of four ecori fragments totalling approximately 10.3 kilobases (kb). this strain was capable of growth on defined medium plus raffinose or sucrose and generated reducing sugars from a sucrose substrate. southern hybridization analysis of the  four ecori fragments revealed homology not only to s. mutans lm7 chromosomal dna  but also to s. mutans serotypes b, c, and f. subcloning of this fragment array into a streptococcal e. coli shuttle vector indicated that a 2.4-kb ecori fragment was essential for sucrase activity. e. coli minicell experiments revealed a gene product of 55 kilodaltons. these data along with restriction endonuclease analysis and southern hybridizations suggested that the cloned s. mutans lm7 gene was closely related to the gtfa gene cloned by robeson et al. from s. mutans ps13 (bratthall serotype c). the shuttle plasmid containing the 2.4-kb fragment was transformed into streptococcus sanguis, which subsequently displayed increased sucrase activity in both intracellular and extracellular fractions. elevated levels of synthesis of alcohol-insoluble and water-insoluble  glucans were observed with crude extracellular fractions of the s. sanguis strain bearing the 2.4-kb fragment. an isolate cured of the shuttle plasmid plus the 2.4-kb fragment displayed wild-type s. sanguis glucan synthesis. in s. sanguis, this gtfa allele may play a role in glucan synthesis by interacting with extant high-molecular-weight glucosyltransferases.

TI  == bactericidal activity of human lysozyme, muramidase-inactive lysozyme, and cationic polypeptides against streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus faecalis: inhibition by chitin oligosaccharides.
AB  == the basis of the bactericidal activity of human lysozyme against streptococcus sanguis was studied. experiments were designed to evaluate the role of lysozyme muramidase activity in its bactericidal potency. inactivation of the muramidase activity of lysozyme was achieved by reduction of essential disulfides with dithiothreitol (dtt) or by incubation with the chitin oligosaccharides chitotriose and chitobiose. muramidase-inactive lysozyme, prepared by reduction with dtt, was equal in bactericidal potency to native lysozyme. solutions of native chicken egg white lysozyme and human lysozyme exhibited equal bactericidal potency yet differed ca. fourfold with respect to lytic (muramidase) activity. the above results suggested that the bactericidal activity of lysozyme is not dependent upon muramidase activity. chitotriose and chitobiose were found to inhibit both lytic and bactericidal activities of lysozyme. the bactericidal activity of muramidase-inactive lysozyme (reduction with dtt) was also inhibited  by chitotriose and chitobiose. further investigations demonstrated that chitotriose and chitobiose were also potent inhibitors of the bactericidal activity of the cationic homopolypeptides poly-l-arginine and poly-d-lysine. these latter results suggested that the essential bactericidal property of lysozyme was its extreme cationic nature and that some bacterial endogenous activities, inhibitable by chitotriose and chitobiose, were essential for expression of the bactericidal activity of either native or muramidase-inactive lysozyme or of the cationic homopolypeptides. experiments with streptococcus faecalis whole cells, cell walls, and crude autolysin preparations implicated endogenous autolytic muramidases as the bacterial targets of chitotriose and chitobiose. the essentially identical responses of s. sanguis and s. faecalis to  chitotriose in bactericidal assays with muramidase-inactive lysozyme and polylysine suggested that muramidase-like enzymes exist in s. sanguis and, furthermore, play an essential role in cationic protein-induced loss of viability of the oral microbe.

TI  == streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone (cam373) also produced by staphylococcus aureus and identification of a conjugative transposon (tn918).
AB  == streptococcus faecalis rc73 was found to harbor a conjugative plasmid (pam373) which confers a mating response to a sex pheromone (cam373) excreted by plasmid-free members of the same species. the pheromone was also detected in culture filtrates of all of 23 staphylococcus aureus strains but in only 2 of 22  coagulase negative staphylococcus strains. streptococcus sanguis challis and g9b  also produced the activity, but 10 other streptococcus sanguis strains did not. the activity was also produced by streptococcus faecium 9790. a tetracycline resistance (tc) determinant present in s. faecalis rc73 was not associated with pam373 but served as a useful marker in efforts to identify pam373 among other plasmids present in the strain. analyses of the tc determinant showed that it was located on a conjugative transposon very similar to tn916. designated tn918, the  transposon could insert into pam373 as well as into two other hemolysin plasmids. whereas pam373 derivatives transferred very well between strains of streptococcus faecalis, the plasmid would not establish in staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus sanguis. however, a derivative of pam373 carrying tn918 proved to be a useful delivery vehicle for generating transposon insertions into multiple sites on the staphylococcal chromosome.

AB  == antibodies raised against a fimbriated, adhesive strain of streptococcus sanguis  (fw213) were found to block the adhesion of this organism to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. antibodies were made specific for adhesion antigens by adsorption with isogenic, nonadhesive mutants (for rabbit polyclonal adsorbed antibody) or selection based on nonreactivity with two nonadhesive mutants (for monoclonal antibody). rabbit antibody raised against isogenic, nonfimbriated nonadhesive mutants served as a control for antibodies present, but not related to fimbriation. adsorbed antibody and monoclonal antibody were shown to be specific  for fimbriae (antigen 1), since both antibodies could be seen by immune electron  microscopy to bind 3.6-nm fimbriae, reacted only with the fimbriated parent and not the mutants in a whole bacterial cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and  could immunoprecipitate fimbriae from fimbrial extracts of fw213. antibodies isolated from preimmune and mutant sera did not react with fimbriae in any of the above assays. only adsorbed antibody and monoclonal antibody were capable of blocking the adhesion of fw213 to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. adsorbed antibody, purified to immunoglobulin g (igg), was an effective inhibitor of adhesion without causing interfering cellular aggregation. monoclonal igg, papain-cleaved to fab fragments to prohibit cell-to-cell cross-linking, was also  a potent inhibitor of s. sanguis fw213 adhesion. both igg from mutant sera and fab fragments from normal mouse igg could not be shown to block adhesion. these data further support the hypothesis that s. sanguis fimbriae are involved in adhesion.

AB  == strains of oral streptococci maintain an intracellular ph (phi) that is more alkaline than the external ph (pho). the delta ph (phi-pho) was about 0.6 in neutral media and about 0.9 in media of ph 5.5. addition of 10 micrograms of f- per ml at ph 7.0 reduced the delta ph in streptococcus salivarius to 0.17. the reduction of delta ph in s. sanguis h7pr3 was less pronounced, whereas the delta  ph in s. mutans ib 1600 was unaffected. the f- -resistant mutant of s. salivarius, strain flr103, maintained a delta ph of 0.51 with 100 micrograms of f- per ml. addition of f- to cells in media below ph 6.0 led to a reduction of delta ph in all strains. the anion had no effect on the transmembrane electrical  gradient of either mutant or parental cells of s. salivarius at ph 7.0. the principal effect of f- addition at neutral ph, therefore, was on the delta ph component of the proton motive force. at ph 5.5, 100 micrograms of f- per ml reduced the transmembrane electrical gradient from 71 to 40 mv in the parent and  from 80 to 42 mv in the mutant. we propose that the greater sensitivity of cells  to f- at lower medium ph stems from the rapid dissipation of delta ph by the anion. thus, ph equilibration in media of low ph would lead to a greater reduction of metabolic activity than when it occurs in media at neutral ph. the data also suggest that the growth of streptococci, with or without added f-, is limited when the intracellular ph falls below about 5.7.

TI  == in-vitro inhibition of mycobacteria by viridans streptococci.
AB  == eleven strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis and 13 other species of mycobacteria were examined for susceptibility to 26 strains of viridans streptococci. susceptibility was detected by the simultaneous antagonism technique, but not by  tests of deferred antagonism. it is concluded that in-vitro inhibition of mycobacterial growth by actively growing streptococci is due to a peroxide-mediated antagonism which is too variable to be of value for identification. however, a standard bactericidal test with hydrogen peroxide is worth investigation because this might provide a simple inexpensive aid for the identification of m. avium-intracellulare serotypes.

TI  == chemical properties and immunobiological activities of streptococcal lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) were chromatographically purified from crude phenol-water extract of whole cells of some streptococcal species, which included streptococcus pyogenes sv, streptococcus mutans 6715, and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. among these, special attention was paid to s. pyogenes lta for analyses of chemical composition and biological activities. all lta preparations  contained equimolar amounts of glycerol and phosphorus. chemical analyses showed  that s. pyogenes lta contained glycerophosphate, alanine, glucose, and fatty acids (as palmitic acid) at molar ratio of 1 : 0.1 : 0.1 : 0.25. the crude phenol-water extract and isolated lta from s. pyogenes sv were found to be mitogenic for spleen cells of balb/c and balb/c (nu/nu) mice, but not for thymus  cells of balb/c mice. the mitogenicity of deacylated lta (dlta) was significantly lower than that of lta. it was also found that various lta preparations possessed polyclonal b cell activation ability and adjuvant activity both in vivo and in vitro, as demonstrated by using hemolytic plaque assay. lta, but not dlta, induced macrophage activation which resulted in tumor cytotoxicity in mice. limulus lysate activity of s. pyogenes lta was approximately 1,000 fold lower than that of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. these results indicate that streptococcal lta possesses various immunobiological activities that modulate lymphoreticular system in vivo and in vitro.

TI  == enhanced killing of penicillin-treated gram-positive cocci by human granulocytes: role of bacterial autolysins, catalase, and granulocyte oxidative pathways.
AB  == staphylococci pretreated with subminimal inhibitory concentrations (submic) of cell-wall active antibiotics exhibit increased susceptibility to killing by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns), even when phagosome information is impaired  by the mold metabolite, cytochalasin b. to investigate the role of specific bacterial factors in the process, studies were carried out with organisms lacking catalase (streptococci) or cell-wall autolytic enzymes and compared to findings with staphylococcus aureus 502a. neutrophil factors were studied using inhibitors, oxygen radical scavengers, myeloperoxidase (mpo)-deficient pmns, or pmns from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease (cgd). documentation of the enhanced susceptibility of the streptococcal strains to killing by pmns following submic penicillin pretreatment required the use of cytochalasin b. enhancement of killing occurred independent of the presence or absence of bacterial autolysins or catalase. submic penicillin pretreatment of s. pneumoniae r36a specifically promoted the susceptibility of these organisms to killing by myeloperoxidase (mpo)-mediated mechanisms (enhancement lost using mpo-deficient or azide-treated cells). factors other than mpo or toxic oxygen products generated by the pmn respiratory burst are responsible for enhanced killing of penicillin-pretreated s. aureus 502a (enhancement preserved using mpo-deficient,  azide-treated, or chronic granulomatous disease patient cells). these studies define methods to study the interaction of antimicrobial agents and pmns in the killing of microorganisms. they also demonstrate that penicillin treatment can change the susceptibility of gram-positive cocci to the action of specific pmn microbicidal mechanisms. the mechanism of the enhancement appears to be bacterial strain-dependent and not predictable by bacterial autolysin or catalase activity.

AB  == streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (g-tase)-together with either streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces viscosus, or lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. the ph in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. in the absence of gtase, the bacteria other than s. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. the ph of the plaque formed with gtase alone did not show the ph decrease seen when the plaque  contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.

AB  == seventeen mutants of streptococcus sanguis fw213 nonadherent to saliva-coated spheroidal hydroxyapatite were isolated after mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate, nitrosoguanidine, nitrous acid, hydroxylamine, or 2-aminopurine. enrichment for nonadherent mutants was accomplished by successive  adsorptions of the adherent strains to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. after enrichment, variant colonial morphology on tryptic agar was used as a screening technique for selection of nonadherent mutants, with loss of colonial opacity frequently associated with loss of adherence ability. these mutants were further  characterized for additional surface properties, including twitching motility, saliva-induced aggregation, coaggregation with actinomyces species, surface hydrophobicity, and presence of fimbriae. results from these assays indicated that the nonadherent mutants fell into six phenotypic groups. a correlation between the loss of adherence ability, a decrease in cell fimbriation, and a decrease in surface hydrophobicity is apparent.

TI  == competence-specific autolysis in streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis strain wicky activated to competence for genetic transformation is known to undergo a rapid decrease in optical density upon transfer to an alkaline buffer containing reducing agents. we studied the mechanism of this autolysis-like process and made the following observations. the process was specific because preincubation of the competence inducing factor with a specific inactivating protein prevented both cellular lysis and acquisition of  competence for genetic transformation. the optical density decrease of competent  bacteria involved the release of a large fraction of intracellular protein, rna and lipid. however, no hydrolysis of phospholipid and no degradation of cell wall polymers including peptidoglycan could be detected. no peptidoglycan hydrolase activity capable of degrading radiolabelled s. sanguis cell walls was detected in unfractionated s. sanguis extracts. it is suggested that autolysis of competent s. sanguis involves the activity of a novel type of murein hydrolase that introduces only a limited number of bond breaks into the peptidoglycan.

TI  == leukocyte migration inhibition in recurrent aphthous ulceration.
AB  == leukocyte inhibitory factor (lif) production in response to streptococcal antigens and oral mucosa was examined as a possible pathogenic mechanism in recurrent aphthous ulceration (rau). mononuclear cells from rau patients and controls were stimulated with antigens prepared from two species of streptococci  and from oral mucosa. candida albicans and foreskin were tested as control antigens. there were some statistically significant differences in leukocyte migration inhibition between patients and controls with some concentrations of streptococcus sanguis (atcc 10556) and c. albicans, and a trend toward low migration indices with oral mucosa. however, the roughly equal numbers of patients and controls responding positively to each antigen and the large background variation suggest a lack of biological significance. lif production did not increase consistently in the early stages and did not correlate with ulcer development in patients studied sequentially. we conclude that lif production (at least in response to the antigens tested) plays no pathogenic role in rau. our data do not support the hypothesis that a specific cell-mediated sensitivity to streptococcal antigens is involved in rau.

TI  == lactate dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans: purification, characterization,  and crossed antigenicity with lactate dehydrogenases from lactobacillus casei, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == a cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (ldh; ec 1.1.1.27) from streptococcus mutans omz175 was purified to homogeneity as judged  by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. the purification consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation of the cytoplasmic fraction, deae-sephacel and blue-sepharose cl.6b chromatography, and sephacryl s200 gel permeation. the catalytic activity of the purified enzyme required the presence of fructose-1,6-diphosphate with a broad optimum between ph 5 and 6.2. the concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate required for half-maximal velocity was  around 0.02 mm and was affected by the pyruvate concentration. the enzyme seemed  to have at least two binding sites for the activator which interact in a cooperative manner. increasing concentrations of fructose-1,6-diphosphate up to 2 mm enhanced the relative affinity of the enzyme for pyruvate and modified the pyruvate saturation curve from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. the enzyme activity showed also a sigmoidal response to nadh, exhibiting two binding sites for the cofactor with a hill coefficient of about 1.9. the molecular weight of the native enzyme was 150,000 as determined by gel permeation on sephacryl s200. monomers (38,000 daltons) and dimers (85,000 daltons) were observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis; the latter form was dissociated after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, and the enzyme could be considered a tetramer. antibodies obtained against the purified s. mutans omz175 ldh cross-reacted with the sodium  dodecyl sulfate-dissociated forms of ldhs from different s. mutans serotypes, streptococcus sanguis omz9, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, and actinomyces viscosus ny 1. a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed us to detect a very close relationship between the native states of l-ldhs from s. mutans serotypes and s. sanguis. cross-reactions were also observed with the ldhs from a. viscosus and l. casei, the latter being the least related. a very weak immunological relationship was obtained between the l-ldh from s. mutans omz175 and the d-ldh from lactobacillus leichmannii, whereas no cross-reaction could be  detected with mammal ldhs.

TI  == effect of environmental conditions on the fluoride sensitivity of acid production by s. sanguis nctc 7865.
AB  == growth and environmental conditions affected the fluoride (f) sensitivity of acid production by streptococcus sanguis nctc 7865. cells grown glucose-limited in a chemostat were generally more sensitive than those harvested from cultures in which there was an excess of glucose (amino acid-limited). there was no consistent relationship between the growth rate of cells and their f sensitivity. slower-growing cells (mean generation time = 14 hr) were more sensitive than those growing quickly when glucose was the limiting nutrient, whereas the faster  growing cells from the glucose-excess culture were most susceptible. the ph of the environment markedly affected the f sensitivity of cells: 2 mm f- was sufficient to abolish acid production by cells incubated at ph 5.0, whereas 24 mm f- did not totally inhibit glycolysis at ph 7.0 or 8.0. regardless of ph and growth conditions, the cationic composition of the environment had the most pronounced effect on acid production and fluoride sensitivity. cells washed and re-suspended in kcl were more acidogenic and more sensitive to f than the same cells treated with saline. at ph 7.0 and 8.0, saline-washed cells were comparatively unaffected by f, while glycolysis by the same cells at the same ph  but washed in kcl could be inhibited by up to 80%. these results suggested that f inhibition could not be explained merely on the basis of hf uptake at low ph values. since it has been shown previously that the activity of the energized membrane is maintained by k+ and dissipated in the presence of na+, it was proposed that proton motive force (pmf) might be involved in the uptake of f-.

TI  == contribution of stereochemical interactions in the adhesion of streptococcus sanguis c5 to experimental pellicles.
AB  == parameters for the adsorption of streptococcus sanguis c5 to experimental salivary pellicles were determined to assess the relative contributions of stereochemical and less specific hydrophobic-electrostatic interactions in this process. s. sanguis c5 cells possess hydrophobic surfaces and also an adhesin which exhibits stereochemical binding to sialic acid-containing salivary receptors. the adsorption of s. sanguis c5 to untreated pellicles was significantly better described by a two-site adsorption model than by a one-site  model (p less than 0.001). one class of binding sites had an affinity for the organism that was more than 400 times that of the second class of binding sites.  however, adsorption of the organism was better described by a one-site model to asialo pellicles prepared by neuraminidase treatment which destroyed the receptors for the organism's adhesin. the affinity of the organism to sites in asialo pellicles was low, and approximated that to the low-affinity sites in untreated pellicles. these observations suggest that, in the absence of stereochemical interactions involving the organism's adhesin and specific salivary receptors, s. sanguis c5 cells only exhibit low-affinity binding to experimental pellicles. this was substantiated by studies which showed that adsorption of the organism to albumin-coated hydroxyapatite and to polystyrene beads was also better described by a one-site model, and it occurred with only low affinity.

AB  == the acidurance of glycolysis by intact cells of streptococcus mutans gs-5, streptococcus salivarius atcc 25925, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 was found to be highly dependent on membrane functions affected by gramicidin, which  increases the proton permeability of cell membranes. plots of % glucose utilized  during two hours against suspension ph values for cells suspended in 100 mm phosphate buffer plus 1 mm mgcl2 plus 13.9 mm glucose indicated, for 50% glucose  utilization, ph values of 5.0 for s. mutans, 5.7 for s. salivarius, and 6.2 for s. sanguis. gramicidin treatment shifted these values to 6.0, 6.3, and 6.9, respectively. growth of s. mutans and s. salivarius in complex media proved to be more acid-sensitive than was glycolysis, and in batch cultures, there was a well-defined, post-growth phase of glycolysis. minimum ph values for growth and for glycolysis in medium with excess glucose were approximately 4.8 and 4.4, respectively, for s. mutans, and 4.9 and 4.3 for s. salivarius. s. sanguis was less aciduric and showed little differential acid sensitivity, with minimum ph values of about 5.2 for both growth and glycolysis. fluoride acted to eliminate the differences in acidurance of growth and glycolysis for s. mutans or s. salivarius and to render both processes more acid-sensitive. thus, glycolysis was more fluoride-sensitive than was growth. growth was found to be acid-limited in media with initial glucose levels greater than 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5% (weight/volume) for s. sanguis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius, respectively, and to be glucose-limited at lower levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effects of oxygen on pyruvate formate-lyase in situ and sugar metabolism of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the strictly anaerobic metabolism of sugar in strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis was studied because deep layers of dental plaque are strictly anaerobic. galactose-grown cells of these streptococcal strains had higher pyruvate formate-lyase activity than did glucose-grown cells. among these  strains, two strains of s. mutans had a significantly higher pyruvate formate-lyase activity than did the others. this enzyme is extremely sensitive to oxygen, and even in situ the enzyme was inactivated by exposure of the cells to air. lactate was less than 50% of the total end product of the strictly anaerobic incubation of the galactose-grown cells of s. mutans with excess glucose, and a significant amount of formate, acetate, and ethanol was produced through the catalysis of pyruvate formate-lyase. but the cells exclusively produced lactate when exposed to air for 2 min before the anaerobic incubation. the metabolism of  sorbitol by s. mutans was seriously impaired by the exposure of the cells to oxygen, and the metabolic rate was reduced to less than 1/20 of that found under  strictly anaerobic conditions because of the inactivation of pyruvate formate-lyase. s. sanguis produced a smaller amount of the volatile products from glucose than did s. mutans because of the low level of pyruvate formate-lyase. however, the pyruvate formate-lyase in situ in s. sanguis was less sensitive to oxygen than was that in s. mutans. because of this low sensitivity, s. sanguis metabolized glucose more rapidly under aerobic conditions, whereas the rates of the aerobic and anaerobic metabolism of glucose by s. mutans were similar, which  suggests that s. mutans rather than s. sanguis can sustain the rapid sugar metabolism in the deep layers of dental plaque.

[gene 20 (1982) 51-62], has been determined. the nmt amino acid (aa) sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence contains extensive homology to aa sequences of cognate nmts specified by: (1) plasmid pe194 from staphylococcus  aureus, 30% g + c, ermc; (2) plasmid pam77 from streptococcus sanguis, 43% g + c; as well as to (3) a chromosomal determinant from bacillus licheniformis 759, 46%  g + c, ermd, cloned in a recombinant plasmid pbd90. these findings suggest that all four nmt structural genes could have evolved from a common progenitor sequence despite the wide range of % g + c of the erm genes reflecting their current respective hosts. comparison of the four nmt sequences with respect to localized hydrophobicity averaged over a moving window of 11 aa indicates that the common features of localized hydrophobicity that characterize the c-terminal  portion of the erme and ermd proteins are distinguishable from a contrasting pattern of hydrophobicity that characterizes the ermc and pam77-coded proteins.

TI  == characterization of protein and mannan polysaccharide antigens of yeasts, moulds, and actinomycetes.
AB  == antigens in coccidioidin were compared with purified subfractions via tandem immunoelectrophoresis (iep) and by a combination of advancing line and crossed iep. rocket iep was suitable for titrating the reactions and showing the relationship between column fractions. these techniques required multicomponent antisera produced by hyperimmunization over many months and by the use of known standard migration pairs. the iep variations were used to chart the development of antisera against coccidioidin factors, to monitor antigen purifications, and to test the immunochemical homogeneity of an isolated antigen. mannose-based heteroglycans of cryptococcus neoformans were recovered from the culture filtrate. after precipitation of the major viscous glucuronoxylomannan (gxm) with ethanol or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, the supernate is reserved because it contains a galactoxylomannan (galxm). after removal of glucuronic acid from the gxm, the resulting xylomannan of serotype a was amenable to 13c-nuclear magnetic  resonance (nmr) spectrometry; it revealed nonreducing xylose, alpha-1,3-mannose,  and alpha-1,2/1,3 disubstituted mannose, thus confirming by an independent means  what was previously known. the characterization sequence of galxm included: (1) gas-liquid chromatography (glc) of neutral sugars as peracetylated aldononitriles; (2) methylation-fragmentation glc mass spectrometry to determine  the glycosidic linkages; and (3) 13c-nmr showing similarities to mannan of saccharomyces cerevisiae. affinity chromatography of the galxm on concanavalin a  separated the galactoxylo component from an adsorbed mannoprotein. selection of monoclonal antibodies (mabs) relies on presumptive enzyme immunoassays (eias) or  radioimmunoassays for rapid screening of clones and for determination of isotypes; however, higher resolution confirmatory tests are needed to obtain mabs of desired specificity. mabs against candida tropicalis mannan were labeled with  horseradish peroxidase to use for detecting mannan in serum. mabs against the partially purified "m" factor of histoplasmin were characterized by the enzyme-linked immunoelectro-transfer blot technique (eitb), revealing unsuspected complexity in the antigen. secreted proteins of nocardia asteroides were isoelectrically focused; three proteins, identified by eitb as promising to be specific for that actinomycete, were cut out of gels and used to immunize mice for production of mabs. the fimbriae of actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii that mediate lactose-reversible coagglutination with streptococcus sanguis have been used to evoke mabs.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the streptococcal erythromycin resistance (emr) plasmid psm7 (6.4 kb) and the e.  coli vector pacyc184 (4.0 kb) were fused at their single ecori sites to form the  bifunctional chimeric plasmid psm7184 (10.4 kb) in which the emr determinant was  placed under control of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) promoter of  pacyc184. in the sense orientation (orientation i) of psm7, the cat promoter directed expression of emr in the e. coli host strains 294 and db11 more efficiently than did the indigenous transcription signals of psm7, which were functional in the opposite orientation ii. in streptococcus sanguis (challis), the level of emr was independent of the orientation of psm7 in pacyc184, showing  that the cat promoter was not recognized in the gram-positive host. the growth of e. coli (psm7184i) in a defined medium containing glycerol as carbon source, or containing glucose plus extraneous cyclic 3'-5' adenosine monophosphate (camp) led to an emr level which was 15-30 times higher than that of cultures grown on glucose. these results showed that under control of the cat promoter, emr is subject to camp-mediated catabolite repression and provided conclusive evidence that the enhancement of emr expression in e. coli carrying psm7184i is controlled at the transcriptional level. besides enabling us to determine the orientation of transcription of the emr gene in psm7 and related vectors, this work also made available new bifunctional cloning vehicles able to replicate in both e. coli and s. sanguis.

TI  == streptococcus-escherichia coli shuttle vector psa3 and its use in the cloning of  streptococcal genes.
AB  == a shuttle vector that can replicate in both streptococcus spp. and escherichia coli has been constructed by joining the e. coli plasmid pacyc184 (chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance) to the streptococcal plasmid pgb305 (erythromycin resistance). the resulting chimeric plasmid is designated psa3 (chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistance) and has seven unique restriction sites: ecori, ecorv, bamhi, sali, xbai, nrui, and sphi. molecular cloning into the ecori or ecorv site results in inactivation of chloramphenicol resistance, and cloning into the bamhi, sali, or sphi site results in inactivation of tetracycline resistance in e. coli. psa3 was transformed and was  stable in streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans in the presence of erythromycin. we have used psa3 to construct a library of the s. mutans gs5 genome in e. coli, and expression of surface antigens in this heterologous host has been confirmed with s. mutans antiserum. a previously cloned determinant that specifies streptokinase was subcloned into psa3, and this recombinant plasmid was stable in the presence of a selective pressure and expressed streptokinase activity in e. coli, s. sanguis (challis), and s. mutans.

TI  == the relationships between streptococcal species and periodontopathic bacteria in  human dental plaque.
AB  == the existence of antagonistic and commensal relationships between microorganisms  was investigated. the predominant cultivable flora in 172 plaque samples from active and non-active sites in 32 human subjects with destructive periodontitis was determined. the presence of putative periodontopathic organisms (bacteroides  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, wolinella recta, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and eikenella corrodens) in a site was correlated with the absence of certain viridans streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus uberis and streptococcus intermedius), and vice versa. a strong commensal relationship was found between b. gingivalis and strep. intermedius. the second study involved 3 subjects with intractable periodontitis  whose plaque harboured large numbers of one or more of these periodontopathic organisms. this plaque contained fewer organisms capable of inhibiting the growth of the periodontopathic strains in vitro when compared with a clinically-healthy  control subject. intermediate levels of inhibitors were found in plaque taken from non-active lesions. the majority of inhibitors in plaque from the healthy control were viridans streptococci. hydrogen-peroxide production by these organisms appears to be the principal mechanism of growth inhibition for periodontopathic organisms. bacterial interactions may thus be causally related to both periodontal health and disease.

AB  == sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured  higher levels of neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high streptococcus sanguis levels and total gram-positive cocci and fewer  gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of streptococcus salivarius and veillonella sp. sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; strep. mutans,  veillonella sp. and lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. sucrose intake was negatively related to  concentrations of neisseria sp. on the tongue and total gram-positive bacilli in  saliva. a definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. the high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the  generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.

TI  == infectivity and natural transmission of the bacterium streptococcus mutans in monkeys (macaca fascicularis) at different ages.
AB  == oral inoculation of adolescent monkeys with laboratory strains of streptococcus mutans resulted in only sporadic implantation. oral colonization of all strains,  except possibly one, was not enhanced by dietary sucrose compared with glucose nor by precleaning of accessible tooth surfaces. infant animals were more susceptible to implantation by laboratory-maintained strains of strep. mutans than adolescent or adult animals. this difference was magnified when in-vivo maintained strep. mutans strains were used. strep. mutans was readily acquired by uninfected adolescent animals from infected cage mates. strep. mutans-free adolescent monkeys exhibited significant-salivary iga and serum-igg response to strep. mutans antigen, possibly representing a cross-reaction to indigenous streptococcus sanguis. uninfected infant animals showed no salivary or serum response to strep. mutans. there was no change in salivary iga antibody to strep. mutans in adolescent animals after implantation or in recipient animals after acquisition of strep. mutans.

AB  == sixteen consecutively-born monkeys were used in a longitudinal study to determine the changes occurring in the total number of bacteria in the palatal grooves of the upper left first deciduous molar teeth, following the introduction of a sucrose-based diet. the total number of bacteria recovered from the grooves increased significantly following the diet change. twenty-nine days after the diet change, the number of streptococcus mutans had increased from a median value of less than 10(2) to approx. 10(7) per groove, and the number of streptococcus sanguis decreased. these changes in the number of strep. mutans occurred prior to the detection of dental caries. grooves that became carious harboured significantly more bacteria and more strep. mutans than did grooves remaining caries-free six months after the diet change.

TI  == some factors affecting the diffusion of [14c]-lactate in human dental plaque.
AB  == the apparent diffusion rate, d, of lactate was significantly retarded in dental plaque fluid and a simulated plaque fluid consisting of a chemically-defined solution of salts, amino acids and albumin in phosphate buffer at ph 6.5. metabolic utilization of lactate in live plaque residue reduced d for lactate into such samples of residue, compared with killed samples. d in plaque residue was lower than in a previous study. increasing the packing density of killed plaque residue of streptococcus sanguis cells reduced d. pre-incubation of plaque residue with sucrose or sucrose + naf reduced d for lactate. no such relationship was found when streptococcus mutans was so treated, but d for lactate was lower when the cells were grown in tryptone-soy broth supplemented with 5 per cent sucrose compared with unsupplemented broth. the retardation of lactate increased  with an increase in ion-exchange capacity of cation- and anion-exchange sephadex  gel-model systems. thus, the apparent diffusion coefficient of lactate in dental-plaque residue is influenced by the chemical composition of the plaque aqueous phase, by metabolism of lactate, by plaque tortuosity, sucrose metabolism and ion-exchange interactions.

TI  == molecular cloning of a pip501 derivative yields a model replicon for the study of streptococcal conjugation.
AB  == we have previously constructed a derivative of the broad host range streptococcal plasmid pip501, a conjugative plasmid designated pva797, that confers chloramphenicol resistance and contains a unique ecori site in a non-essential region of the plasmid molecule. pva797 (30.7 kb) when cloned in toto as an ecori  fragment into the positive selection vector pop203(a2+) gave a recombinant, pva904 (37.7 kb), which was able to replicate in escherichia coli and in streptococcal species. it can be phenotypically monitored in either genus by specific drug resistance markers (chloramphenicol resistance in streptococci, tetracycline resistance in e. coli). pva904 segregates into e. coli minicells where it specifies the production of at least 13 polypeptides. many of the polypeptides are missing in minicells containing a transfer-defective, deletion derivative of pva904. pva904 is an ideal model replicon for the study of streptococcal conjugation because it is a shuttle plasmid thus enabling manipulation using procedures established for e. coli. specifically, it should be possible to define the genetic basis of streptococcal conjugation by coupling mutagenesis protocols and minicell protein analyses in e. coli with evaluation of transfer function in streptococci.

AB  == in the present investigation, the proportions of streptococcus mutans, lactobacilli, streptococcus sanguis, veillonellae, and an unidentified actinomyces-like organism in dental plaque on occlusal fissures of first mandibular molars were monitored at 6-month intervals over a 3-year period in 368 children who were initially in grades 1 or 2. teeth destined to become decayed exhibited a significant increase in the proportions of s. mutans from 6 to 24 months before the diagnosis of dental decay. lactobacilli were sporadically detected but when present were associated with dental decay. children whose teeth exhibited the greatest number of decayed surfaces had, at all time periods, significantly higher proportions of s. mutans than did children who were caries free. many teeth had high proportions of s. mutans at their entry into the study. about 10% of the monitored teeth erupted during the period of observation, and in these teeth both s. mutans and lactobacilli could be significantly associated with decay. in these newly erupted teeth s. mutans outnumbered lactobacilli by ca. 20 to 1. s. sanguis, veillonellae, and the unidentified actinomyces-like organism could not be associated with the development of decay. these findings strongly implicate s. mutans and possibly lactobacilli as dental pathogens and suggest that if decay is to be controlled by strategies based upon a s. mutans infection, then the various tactics used probably will have to be performed on primary teeth, as these teeth are the most likely sources of infection for the permanent teeth.

TI  == the gene for type a streptococcal exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) is located in bacteriophage t12.
AB  == the infection of streptococcus pyogenes t25(3) with the temperate bacteriophage t12 results in the conversion of the nontoxigenic strain to type a streptococcal  exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) production. although previous research has established that integration of the bacteriophage genome into the host chromosome is not essential for exotoxin production, the location of the gene on the bacteriophage or bacterial chromosome had not been determined. in the present investigation, recombinant dna techniques were used to determine whether the gene specifying type a streptococcal exotoxin (spea) production is located on the bacteriophage chromosome. bacteriophage t12 was obtained from s. pyogenes t25(3)(t12) by induction with mitomycin c, and after isolation of bacteriophage dna by phenol-chloroform extraction, the dna was digested with restriction enzymes and ligated with escherichia coli plasmid php34 or the streptococcus-e. coli shuttle vector psa3. transformation of e. coli hb101 with the recombinant molecules allowed selection of e. coli clones containing bacteriophage t12 genes. immunological assays with specific antibody revealed the presence of type a streptococcal exotoxin in sonicates of e. coli transformants. subcloning experiments localized the spea gene to a 1.7-kilobase segment of the bacteriophage t12 genome flanked by sali and hindiii sites. introduction of the psa3 vector containing the spea gene into streptococcus sanguis (challis) resulted in transformants that secreted the type a exotoxin. immunological analysis showed that the type a streptococcal exotoxin produced by e. coli and s. sanguis transformants was identical to the type a exotoxin produced by s. pyogenes t25(3)(t12). southern blot hybridizations with the cloned fragment confirmed its presence in the bacteriophage t12 genome and its absence in the t25(3) nonlysogen. therefore, the gene for type a streptococcal exotoxin is located in the bacteriophage genome, and conversion of s. pyogenes t25(3) to toxigenicity occurs in a manner similar to the conversion of corynebacterium diphtheriae to toxigenicity by bacteriophage beta.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological features associated with the treatment of active periodontosis lesions.
AB  == clinical, microbiological and immunological factors were examined using data from a subject with periodontosis. the subject was monitored at bimonthly intervals for 26 months at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on  probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. using attachment level measurements  and the tolerance method of analysis, sites with active disease and control (inactive) sites of equal pocket depth were selected. subgingival plaque samples  were taken from these sites for predominant cultivable and dark field evaluation  before, and 5 and 13 months after treatment by widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline. 50 isolates from each of 5 sites monitored before and after treatment were characterized and, if possible, identified. active sites showed between 2 and 6 mm of attachment loss prior to therapy and "gained" between 2 and 9 mm of attachment after therapy. the control sites "gained" 0 to 1 mm of attachment after therapy. bleeding on probing was significantly reduced after treatment, whereas plaque accumulation increased significantly in the sampled sites. similar changes were seen in the remaining sites. the proportions of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and selenomonas sputigena were elevated in active sites, while proportions of bacteroides intermedius were elevated in control sites. 5 months after treatment, proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans, s. sputigena and eikenella corrodens were significantly decreased in the previously active sites and proportions of b. intermedius and e. corrodens were significantly decreased in the control sites. 13 months after therapy, the proportions of fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga species had increased.  multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine models which could "predict" the outcome, attachment level change in the previous monitoring period. the proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. sputigena, which were associated with destruction, coupled with the proportions of streptococcus sanguis ii and campylobacter concisus which were associated with "gain" could predict prior attachment level change with an r2 of 0.93. humoral antibody response to a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. sputigena significantly increased in  a period in which multiple actively breaking down sites were detected. antibody responses to 20 other species tested did not significantly change during the course of monitoring. crevicular fluid and tissue levels of antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in 5 of 6 active destructive lesions prior to therapy.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == exogenous thymidine and reversal of the inhibitory effect of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim on streptococci.
AB  == the practice of using sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (sxt) for the selective isolation of streptococcus pyogenes and as a taxonomic character in the presumptive identification of streptococci was applied to 17 strains of different groups of streptococci to determine their characteristic behaviour in the presence of exogenous thymidine. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and group d enterococci utilized thymidine, the first two species obtaining a maximum reversal of the inhibitory effect of sxt at thymidine concentrations of 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.6 micrograms/ml or higher, respectively. for group d enterococci, the degree of reversal of the inhibitory effect was proportional to  the thymidine concentration. in contrast, the four viridans species studied (streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis ii) and streptococcus pneumoniae were unable to utilize thymidine from an exogenous source and thus growth remained inhibited even at the highest concentrations of thymidine tested. for selective isolation and identification of streptococci only stable media with batch-to-batch consistency  are recommended together with a known quantity of thymidine.

TI  == human neutrophil migration under agarose to bacteria associated with the development of gingivitis.
AB  == in clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. this study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health  and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (be) in buffer and pooled human serum (phs) from pure cultures of streptococcus sanguis. actinomyces viscosus, a  naeslundii, bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium sp and veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. in addition,  fractions of s sanguis culture fluids (cfs) from sephadex g-10 chromatography were evaluated. all be solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees c and heat-inactivated prior to testing. all bes in buffer attracted neutrophils, with  the greatest responses seen to s sanguis and b intermedius followed by a viscosus. migration to all bes in phs was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all bes are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. a viscosus be activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. cfs of s sanguis, a viscosus, and to a  lesser degree, fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. evidence from [3h]fmlp competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that s sanguis cfs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. of the bacteria associated with health, s sanguis and a viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. this observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased  neutrophil transmigration in early disease.

AB  == studies of blastogenesis of lymphocytes in culture from juvenile periodontitis (jp) patients have been inconclusive. experiments demonstrating differences in lymphocyte blastogenesis to preparations of putative periodontopathogens in jp and phytohaemagglutinin (pha) were performed. variables in the blastogenesis assay system recently reported were controlled which included using a range of cell and activator concentrations, incubation times of 3, 5 and 7 days, conical-bottomed microtest wells and chemical inhibitors during labeling of dna which permits accurate assessment of lymphocyte blastogenesis. using these modified culture conditions, stimulated lymphocytes of localized (ljp) and generalized (gjp) forms of jp patients did not differ significantly from stimulated lymphocytes of healthy subjects in counts incorporated, stimulation index, incubation time, cell concentration or activator dose required for maximal blastogenesis to bacterial preparations of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (y-4), bacteroides gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochraceus, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sanguis and treponema denticola. unstimulated lymphocyte cultures reflecting the autologous mixed lymphocyte response (amlr) were increased for ljp compared to healthy subjects although not statistically significant. unstimulated lymphocyte cultures of gjp were decreased compared to healthy subjects and ljp (p less than 0.05). these observations indicate that gjp patients may have abnormalities in t- and b-lymphocyte regulatory mechanisms.

TI  == transformation of streptococcus sanguis challis with streptococcus lactis plasmid dna.
AB  == streptococcus lactis plasmid dna, which is required for the fermentation of lactose (plasmid plm2001), and a potential streptococcal cloning vector plasmid (pdb101) which confers resistance to erythromycin were evaluated by transformation into streptococcus sanguis challis. plasmid plm2001 transformed lactose-negative (lac-) mutants of s. sanguis with high efficiency and was capable of conferring lactose-metabolizing ability to a mutant deficient in enzyme iilac, factor iiilac, and phospho-beta-galactosidase of the lactose phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system. plasmid pdb101 was capable of high-efficiency transformation of s. sanguis to antibiotic resistance, and the plasmid could be readily isolated from transformed strains. however, when 20 plm2001 lac+ transformants were analyzed by a variety of techniques for the presence of plasmids, none could be detected. in addition, attempts to cure the lac+ transformants by treatment with acriflavin were unsuccessful. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to demonstrate that the transformants had acquired a phospho-beta-galactosidase characteristic of that normally produced by s. lactis  and not s. sanguis. it is proposed that the genes required for lactose fermentation may have become stabilized in the transformants due to their integration into the host chromosome. the efficient transformation into and expression of plm2001 and pdb101 genes in s. sanguis provides a model system which could allow the development of a system for cloning genes from dairy starter cultures into s. sanguis to examine factors affecting their expression and regulation.

TI  == group a streptococcal peptidoglycan-polysaccharide inhibits phagocytic activity of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == injection of sterile aqueous preparations of the peptidoglycan-polysaccharide of  group a streptococci (pg-aps) produces chronic inflammation in several animal models. chronic bacterial infection may be involved in some aspects of the pathogenesis of inflammation associated with the accumulation of pg-aps. accordingly, the effect of pg-aps on human neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte [pmn]) bactericidal activity was studied with the supposition that this interaction may contribute to the inflammation observed. concentrations of pg-aps greater than 10 micrograms/ml inhibited the ability of pmns to kill staphylococcus aureus. this inhibition was not due to a cytotoxic effect of pg-aps on pmns, nor did pg-aps inhibit pmn metabolism required for the formation  of microbicidal oxygen reduction products. pg-aps concentrations of 10 micrograms/ml or greater in the presence of 10% normal serum inhibited the attachment of bacteria to pmns by 49% as compared with control cell populations.  the concentrations of pg-aps required to inhibit uptake of staphylococcus aureus  were identical to those required for inhibition of pmn bactericidal activity. this inhibition did not occur in the presence of serum-free medium or medium with sera that had been heated to inactivate complement. these results show that pg-aps interacts with serum to inhibit pmn-mediated killing of s. aureus, most probably by interfering with bacterial uptake.

TI  == plasmid transformation of streptococcus lactis protoplasts: optimization and use  in molecular cloning.
AB  == the parameters affecting polyethylene glycol-induced plasmid transformation of streptococcus lactis lm0230 protoplasts were examined to increase the transformation frequency. in contrast to spreading protoplasts over the surface of an agar medium, their incorporation into soft agar overlays enhanced regeneration of protoplasts and eliminated variability in transformation frequencies. polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 3,350 at a final concentration of 22.5% yielded optimal transformation. a 20-min polyethylene glycol treatment of protoplasts in the presence of dna was necessary for maximal  transformation. the number of transformants recovered increased as the protoplast and dna concentration increased over a range of 3.0 x 10(6) to 3.0 x 10(8) protoplasts and 0.25 to 4.0 micrograms of dna per assay, respectively. with these parameters, transformation was increased to 5 x 10(3) to 4 x 10(4) transformants  per microgram of dna. linear and recombinant plasmid dna transformed, but at frequencies 10- to 100-fold lower than that of covalently closed circular dna. transformation of recombinant dna molecules enabled the cloning of restriction endonuclease fragments coding for lactose metabolism into s. lactis lm0230 with the streptococcus sanguis cloning vector, pgb301. these results demonstrated that the transformation frequency is sufficient to clone plasmid-coded genes which should prove useful for strain improvement of dairy starter cultures.

TI  == a possible mechanism for the cellular coaggregation between actinomyces viscosus  atcc 19246 and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10557.
AB  == the cells of actinomyces viscosus atcc 19246 (av19246) and streptococcus sanguis  atcc 10557 (ss10557) coaggregated immediately after mixing in 40 mm-tris/hcl buffer. optimal conditions were ph 7.5 in the presence of ca2+ at 0.1 mm or higher. na2 edta and its analogues, na2mgedta and na2mnedta at 7.5 mm inhibited the coaggregation. trypsin and heat treatment impaired the reactive site on av19246 cells, but not on ss10557 cells. the coaggregates, once formed, dissociated gradually during extended incubation at 37 degrees c; this was prevented by addition of sufficient ca2+. the disaggregation appears to be a spontaneous denaturation of the proteinaceous reactive site on av19246 cell surface. thus, the coaggregation involves the interaction of a lectin-like substance on the surface of av19246 with a carbohydrate site on ss10557. native ss10557 cell walls possessed reactivity with av19246 cells but 5% (w/v) tca-extracted cell wall residues did not. a carbohydrate moiety extracted from ss10557 exhibited a high potency in blocking coaggregation, and coaggregates were dissociated upon addition of the carbohydrate. lactose, galactose and n-acetyl-d-galactosamine (the latter two are major constituents of the antigen extract) also significantly inhibited the coaggregation, but the other antigen components, glucose and rhamnose, did not. relative inhibitory activity, expressed as molar potency, of carbohydrate antigen, lactose, galactose and n-acetyl-d-galactosamine respectively, was approximately 26 x 10(3):16:4:1. ss10557 cells and cell walls reacted only with a ricinus communis (castor bean) agglutinin-120 but not with glycine max (soybean) agglutinin, arachis hypogaea (peanut) agglutinin or phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin (phytohaemagglutinin).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci: evidence for nonspecific adsorption to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite surfaces.
AB  == it is proposed that binding of oral streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite (sha) surfaces is a multifactorial process involving both specific and nonspecific receptors. in this context, specific binding is described as a high-affinity, saturable interaction between the cell and binding surface. conversely, nonspecific binding is considered to be a nonsaturable, generalized,  low-affinity reaction. experimental differentiation of specific binding from nonspecific binding was achieved with a competition assay which utilized a large  excess of nonradiolabeled bacteria to compete with the 3h-labeled cells for attachment to receptors on 1.5 mg of sha crystals. competition assays of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis adhesion clearly demonstrated that  the total binding isotherm was composed of a saturable specific binding reaction  and a minor nonspecific binding component. this was further substantiated by analysis of nonlinear scatchard plots of the total binding data. the competition  data for streptococcus mutans binding indicated that ca. 50% of the s. mutans binding appeared to be specific, although saturation of the sha surfaces with bacterial cells could not be demonstrated. experiments measuring desorption of radiolabeled cells from sha crystals into buffer showed that ca. 50% of the bound s. mutans cells were removed after 4 h, whereas less than 5% of the s. sanguis cells were eluted from the sha surfaces. the kinetics of attachment were studied  by using an extract of persea americana as a noncompetitive inhibitor of adherence. the total cell binding data for these experiments suggested a very rapid binding reaction followed by a slower rate of attachment. it was concluded  from these three different experimental approaches that adherence of selected oral streptococci to sha surfaces involves specific, high-affinity and nonspecific, low-affinity binding reactions. the concept is developed that in vitro streptococcal attachment to sha can be described as a two-reaction process  in which the low-affinity interaction of the cell with the sha surface precedes the establishment of the stronger, specific bonds needed for the maintenance of streptococci in the oral cavity.

AB  == previous studies have compared the adhesion of [3h]thymidine-labeled streptococcus sanguis to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) and buffer-coated hydroxyapatite (ha) beads. although the hypotonic buffer used in these assays was adjusted to simulate saliva, it does not necessarily provide the optimal parameters for the quantitative estimate of adhesion under in vitro conditions. optimization is necessary to provide the maximum sensitivity of the assay for detecting the effects of various salivas as well as for quantitating the effect of environmental growth conditions on the adhesion of s. sanguis to sha and ha. a major distinction between the adhesion of s. sanguis to sha and ha was observed when the bacterial concentration was varied. at high cell concentrations, the number of cells adhering to sha was twice the number adhering to ha. such differences were not detected at low cell concentrations. the optimal ph for the  adsorption to both sha and ha was 6. changes in the ionic strength or addition of mono- or divalent cations found in saliva had little effect on adhesion to ha. in contrast, high concentrations of monovalent cations inhibited adhesion to sha. anions such as carbonate, chloride, and sulfate did not have specific effects on  adhesion, whereas acetate inhibited adhesion to both sha and ha. fluoride inhibited adhesion to both sha and ha, suggesting an interaction between fluoride and hydroxyapatite. these results indicated that 2 mm phosphate buffer at a ph of 6 containing 5 mm kcl and 1 mm cacl2 was the optimal buffer for studying the in vitro adhesion of s. sanguis to sha.

TI  == the origin and composition of multiple forms of dextransucrase from streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == multiple forms of purified dextransucrase have been observed in the presence of low detergent concentrations ( luzio , g.a., grahame , d. a. and mayer, r.m. (1982) arch. biochem. biophys. 216, 751-757). we now show these forms to arise partly as a result of proteolysis, and partly due to incomplete dissociation of the enzyme. upon 25 degrees c incubation of the crude enzyme, several new bands appeared with little or no change in total activity. the electrophoretic pattern  of aged, crude enzyme was similar to that of partially purified enzyme. specific  detection of dextransucrase on sds gels revealed a single polypeptide of 174 kda, which is converted to a 156 kda protein during the aging process. the observation indicates the occurrence of proteolysis. the polypeptide composition of several of the enzyme forms was determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. forms ia and iia are composed exclusively of 174 kda polypeptides. forms iii and iva consist of 156 kda units, as does the newly observed form ic. it is likely that form ib contains both 174 and 156 kda polypeptides. the results indicate that incomplete dissociation of aggregates of the 174 kda unit accounts for all of the bands observed on native gels run on fresh culture extracts. additional enzyme forms result from aggregation of the 156 kda proteolysis product alone, and from  aggregation with unproteolyzed units to form hybrid aggregates.

TI  == the conditioning role of saliva in streptococcal attachment to hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the solution properties of saliva and its role in conditioning both the substrate and the bacterial surface have been investigated with regard to the attachment of oral streptococci to hydroxyapatite surfaces. saliva from eight subjects was used and the attachment of three organisms, streptococcus mutans strains fa-1 (serotype b) and kpsk2 (serotype c) and s. sanguis t175-1, was studied. an adsorbed salivary layer on a hydroxyapatite surface substantially reduced the affinity of the organisms for the surface. adsorbed saliva on the bacterial surfaces, however, tended to increase the organisms' affinity for saliva-coated apatite. the source of saliva was important in determining the extent of inhibition of attachment. the data indicated that the negatively charged and hydrophilic nature of salivary conditioning films was important in controlling bacterial adsorption to hydroxyapatite. the results also suggested that hydrophobic salivas could promote binding of the more hydrophobic bacteria known  to be early colonizers of the teeth.

TI  == sucrase and maltase activities in supragingival dental plaque in humans of streptococcal, actinomyces and lactobacilli species.
AB  == 20 reference strains and 72 isolated strains from dental plaque of streptococci,  actinomyces, and lactobacilli species were examined for sucrase and maltase activities. the type of sucrase in the different strains was determined by use of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. the enzyme activities were determined  as formation of monosaccharide, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. although  variations occurred in enzyme activities between reference and isolated strains,  the same general pattern was noticed. strains of streptococcus mutans and s. salivarius showed regularly the highest sucrase activities, followed by strains of actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii. most lactobacilli belonged to the bacteria with low sucrase activity like s. sanguis and s. mitior. in some lactobacilli strains, however, a high sucrase activity was observed. the level of sucrase activity in s. mutans strains was dependent on biotype/serotype, as strains of biotype v/serotype e showed high activities, biotypes i and iv corresponding to serotypes c, f, and d showed intermediate activity, and biotype  iii/serotype a always showed low activity. in most of the strains the sucrases were composed of enzymes with specificity against both alpha-glucosidic linkage and beta-fructosidic linkage of the sucrose molecule, but in varying ratios. in all species, exept s. sanguis and s. mitior, lower maltase than sucrase activity  was observed, but even in the two species mentioned the maltase activities were relatively low. on the basis of observations of selected reference strains in every species examined both sucrases and maltases are to some extent inducible.

TI  == role of granulocytes in the induction of an experimental endocarditis with a dextran-producing streptococcus sanguis and its dextran-negative mutant.
AB  == the role of granulocytes in the induction of endocarditis with a dextran-producing streptococcus sanguis and a dextran-negative mutant of this strain was studied. the number of colony-forming units of streptococcus sanguis needed to colonize the vegetations in 50% of the rabbits (id50) was significantly lower for the parent strain than for the dextran-negative mutant. however, in granulocytopenic rabbits the id50s of both strains did not differ measurably. dextran-negative streptococci were more readily cleared from the circulation than dextran-positive, but in this respect no difference was found between control and granulocytopenic rabbits, which indicates that clearance cannot account for the difference in id50 between the two strains in the control group. at serum concentrations of 5% and lower, in-vitro granulocytes phagocytosed the dextran-negative streptococci more rapidly than the dextran-positive. the intracellular killing of the streptococci was no influenced by dextran production. this study suggests that an impaired phagocytic removal of attached bacteria from the vegetational surface can be a factor promoting the induction of endocarditis by dextran-producing streptococci.

TI  == colonization of the subgingival area by bacteroides gingivalis.
AB  == the initial event in colonization of the subgingival area by b. gingivalis is its attachment to host cells and gram-positive bacteria in pre-formed plaque. the level of b. gingivalis is partly governed by products of other plaque bacteria, especially by sanguicin. once b. gingivalis resides in its nidus and starts to proliferate, expulsion of pre-existing residents may occur, especially of attached gram-positive bacteria, through the inhibitory action of the b. gingivalis product, hematin. the bacteriocin produced by black-pigmented bacteroides also seems to play an important role in their establishment. melaninogenicus possessed strong inhibitory activity against actinomyces species. this was not completely confirmed with fresh isolates of b. gingivalis from advanced periodontitis patients. various factors other than inhibitory substances produced by b. gingivalis and related bacteria can also affect the colonization of this species. since the crevice area is influenced by gingival fluid, the nature of specific antibody and the other affecting components should be considered collectively with the interaction between new predominant colonizers and other pre-existing residents.

TI  == a conceptual model for the co-existence of streptococcus spp. and actinomyces spp. in dental plaque.
AB  == one of the most important questions in ecology is how to explain the co-existence of the variety of physiologically related organisms in the same habitat. a model  is presented for the co-existence of streptococcus species and actinomyces species in dental plaque. the hypothesis is that these organisms co-exist because they simultaneously utilize several carbon and energy substrates. the hypothesis  follows from the observation that the growth yield of oral streptococci and actinomyces in saliva is limited by carbohydrate. preliminary experiments were undertaken to test the hypothesis using mixed chemostat cultures and gnotobiotic  rats. competition between s. mutans k1r and a. viscosus ut2 in mixed chemostat cultures on glucose and asparagine was hampered by the early appearance of high-glucose-affinity variants of a. viscosus. from the physiological characteristics of s. sanguis and s. milleri, it might be predicted that simultaneous utilization of carbohydrate and arginine would enable these organisms to co-exist with s. mutans in an ecosystem. to test this mechanism under natural conditions, germ-free rats were inoculated with a combination of s. mutans k1r and s. sanguis p4a7 or the combination s. mutans k1r and s. milleri b448. the rats were fed on three different diets: (1) 58% cornstarch; (2) 48% cornstarch and 10% sucrose; and (3) 53% cornstarch and 5% arginine. the results of this experiment demonstrated that dietary arginine caused a significant decrease of the ratios k1r/p4a7 and k1r/b448 in dental plaque.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the contributions of granulocytes to the prevention and therapy of streptococcus  sanguis endocarditis with procaine benzylpenicillin (pbp) was investigated in rabbits. depletion of granulocytes by treatment with mechlorethamine appeared to  have no significant effect on either the prophylactic or therapeutic activities of pbp. administration of 3,000 iu of pbp before inoculation with s. sanguis retarded the course of the endocarditis for only 24 h whether granulocytes were normal or depressed in numbers. prophylaxis with either 15,000 or 30,000 iu of pbp was equally effective in non-granulocytopenic and granulocytopenic rabbits. treatment of established infections with pbp at doses of 3,000 to 300,000 iu of pbp at 12-h intervals for 48 h was equally effective in rabbits with normal and depressed numbers of granulocytes. the effect of 3,000 iu of pbp was equivalent,  however, to that of granulocytes alone, as shown by the fact that the numbers of  cfu per gram of vegetation in the granulocytopenic rabbits treated with this dose of pbp and in the non-pbp-treated control rabbits were not significantly different.

TI  == regulation of glucose metabolism in oral streptococci through independent pathways of glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate formation.
AB  == in vivo rates of glucose uptake and acid production by oral streptococci grown in glucose- or nitrogen-limited continuous culture and batch culture were compared with the glucose phosphorylation activities of harvested, decryptified cells. the strains examined contained significant phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) activity, measured by a glucose 6-phosphate (g6p) dehydrogenase-linked assay procedure, but this activity was insufficient to account for the in vivo glucose uptake rates. however, atp was a superior phosphoryl donor to phosphoenolpyruvate, and unlike the pts, phosphoryl transfer  with atp was insensitive to bacteriostatic concentrations of chlorhexidine, suggesting glucokinase-mediated g6p formation. again, g6p formation from the pts  and glucokinase reactions was not commensurate with some of the glucose uptake rates observed, implying that other phosphorylation reactions must be occurring.  two novel reactions involving carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate were identified in some of the strains. no g6p formation was detected with these potential phosphoryl donors, but in the presence of phosphoglucomutase, glucose 1-phosphate (g1p) formation was evident, which was insensitive to chlorhexidine.  g1p is a precursor of glycogen, and good correlation was obtained between g1p formation activity and endogenous metabolism of washed cells measured either as a rate of acid production at a constant ph 7 or as a decrease in ph with time in the absence of titrant. a "league table" of abilities to synthesize g1p and produce acid from endogenous metabolism was compiled for oral streptococci grown  in batch culture. this indicated that streptococcus mutans ingbritt and streptococcus sanguis challis were unable to form g1p or produce much acid endogenously, whereas increasing activities were obtained with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. in particular, s. mitis had the highest g1p formation activities and was able to decrease the ph to less than 5 in 15 min by endogenous metabolism alone. the data are consistent with the intracellular accumulation of free glucose driven by proton motive force when pts activities are low and the subsequent phosphorylation to either g6p for  metabolism via glycolysis or g1p for glycogen biosynthesis. the accumulation of acetyl phosphate during glucose-limited growth and the availability of arginine for catabolism to carbamyl phosphate provide an explanation as to why some glucose-limited oral streptococci continue to synthesize glycogen under these conditions, which might prevail in plaque.

TI  == adherence of streptococcus sanguis to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite: evidence for  two binding sites.
AB  == the characteristics of bacterial adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite were examined for a salivary aggregating strain of streptococcus sanguis, strain 12, and for its nonaggregating variant, strain 12na. both strains were found to adhere in similar numbers to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite that had been preincubated at 4 degrees c overnight. preincubation of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite overnight at 37 degrees c reduced subsequent adherence of s. sanguis 12 by approximately 10%, whereas adherence of s. sanguis 12na was reduced by over 80%. preincubation at 37 degrees c in the presence of neuraminidase reduced adherence of s. sanguis 12 by over 90% and caused some additional reduction in adherence of s. sanguis 12na. the data were analyzed with langmuir isotherms, scatchard plots, and hill plots. some evidence of cooperativity was seen. a peak in the scatchard plot for s. sanguis 12 binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite preincubated at 4 degrees c disappeared after preincubation at 37  degrees c, suggesting the loss of a salivary receptor. many more organisms were found to bind when adherence was measured by assays counting the number of organisms remaining in suspension after the beads had settled. these weakly binding organisms, which were removed by washing, demonstrated adherence characteristics similar to those of the firmly bound organisms. both strains were strongly hydrophobic. it is proposed that the binding of s. sanguis 12 and 12na involves two types of receptor on the salivary pellicle. one type of receptor is  stable at 37 degrees c, but sensitive to neuraminidase; the second type is inactivated by prolonged incubation at 37 degrees c. s. sanguis 12 may bind to both types of receptor, whereas s. sanguis 12na binds only to the second type. the neuraminidase-sensitive receptor might be involved in saliva-mediated aggregation.

AB  == seven streptococci isolated from the normal urogenital flora were selected for the production of an inhibitory activity toward neisseria gonorrhoeae on solid medium. this activity was abolished when catalase was added to the medium in the  case of streptococcus mitis isolates 22, 25, 74 and streptococcus sanguis ii isolate 70 suggesting the involvement of hydrogen peroxide. the inhibitory activities produced by the other isolates (streptococcus faecalis) were trypsin sensitive (isolates 12 and 14) or stable (isolate 59). hydrogen peroxide production by s. sanguis ii was quantitatively evaluated by reference to a standard curve representing the inhibitory effect of various concentrations of commercial h2o2 on n. gonorrhoeae growth. after 22 h of incubation a yield of 5.3 m mol h2o2 i-1 was reached on solid medium while in liquid medium values of 2.8 and 7.3 m mol h2o2 i-1 were obtained, respectively, in non-agitated and agitated  cultures after 8 h of incubation.

TI  == ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin.
AB  == the present study describes the ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin (pfn). avid binding of 125i-pfn was found for streptococcus mutans (serotypes a to h), streptococcus sanguis, group a streptococcus pyogenes  and staphylococcus aureus, while other gram-positive bacterial species tested demonstrated only weak or negligible pfn binding ability. two gram-negative bacterial species, bacteroides gingivalis and escherichia coli, did not significantly bind pfn. 125i-pfn binding to s. mutans 6715 cells was decreased by pretreatment with unlabeled pfn, and the radiolabeled pfn bound to the cell surface was released on addition of unlabeled pfn. strong inhibition of 125i-pfn  binding to s. mutans 6715 cells was obtained by protease pretreatment, while partial inhibition was also observed following treatment with acid, alkali, lipase, and monoclonal anti-polyglycerophosphate. these results suggest that pfn  binding to s. mutans cells is reversible and that pfn receptors on the cell surface appear to be heat-stable multiple proteins.

TI  == evidence that glucose and sucrose uptake in oral streptococcal bacteria involves  independent phosphotransferase and proton-motive force-mediated mechanisms.
AB  == sugar transport and glycolysis in streptococcus sanguis nctc 7865, streptococcus  mitis atcc 903, streptococcus salivarius nctc 8606 and several strains of streptococcus mutans were investigated by following the rate of acid production by washed bacteria at a constant ph of 7.0. the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) was inhibited by low concentrations of chlorhexidine. when this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine was added to cells washed and re-suspended in kcl, glucose uptake and glycolysis continued at a greatly-reduced rate. chlorhexidine abolished glucose and sucrose uptake and metabolism in bacteria washed and incubated in saline. the na+-inhibition was reproduced in kcl-washed bacteria using the cyclic peptide ionophores, valinomycin and gramicidin, to dissipate k+ and h+ gradients  across the cell membrane. glucose metabolism by strep. mutans b13 was more resistant to chlorhexidine than that of strep. mutans nctc 10449 or strep. sanguis but was more sensitive to the ionophores. valinomycin had a greater inhibitory effect on strain b13 than the other two. that ion gradients are important in the chlorhexidine-resistant glucose-uptake mechanism was confirmed using the classical uncoupling agents, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol and kscn. glucose metabolism was inhibited in the presence of both the uncouplers and the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine and significant inhibition was also observed in the absence of the pts inhibitor. lactate or the atpase inhibitor, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (dccd), had similar inhibitory effects on the non-pts uptake system.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == role of monocytes in polyclonal immunoglobulin production stimulated by sonicates of periodontally associated bacteria.
AB  == these studies were initiated to investigate monocyte regulation of polyclonal antibody responses of human peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated by sonicates  of periodontally associated bacteria. with pokeweed mitogen (pwm) as a positive reference, the role of monocytes in the peripheral blood lymphocyte response to streptococcus sanguis and wolinella hvs was examined by manipulating the number of monocytes and lymphocytes in culture. in comparison to pwm, optimal responses  to the bacterial sonicates required very few monocytes (0.3% of the total cultured cells). restoration of monocytes to physiological levels resulted in suppression of the response. pwm-stimulated responses were optimal at 5 to 15% monocyte content and were abolished after monocyte depletion. individuals who were low responders or nonresponders to bacterial sonicates responded at normal levels after manipulation of monocyte concentration. nonresponders produced normal levels of antibody when the monocyte concentration was reduced to 0.3% but were inhibited after monocyte reconstitution. the effects of monocyte concentration were tested over a wide dose range of bacterial sonicate and found  to conform to the observed pattern throughout the dose range tested (10 to 1,000  micrograms/ml). the contrasting monocyte requirement of peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated with pwm versus bacterial sonicates may reflect a quantitative difference in optimal macrophage concentration or may be due to a qualitative difference in lymphocyte-monocyte interactions in response to these activators.

TI  == association of neuraminidase-sensitive receptors and putative hydrophobic interactions with high-affinity binding sites for streptococcus sanguis c5 in salivary pellicles.
AB  == the relationship of neuraminidase-sensitive receptors and putative hydrophobic interactions to high- and low-affinity binding sites in experimental salivary pellicles for streptococcus sanguis c5 was investigated. nascn, an inhibitor of hydrophobic interactions, reduced the number of cells which adsorbed to pellicles to a greater extent than nacl or kcl when both low and high streptococcal concentrations were used in assays. however, nascn was not more effective than nacl or kcl in desorbing 3h-labeled salivary pellicle components from hydroxyapatite, and nascn pretreatment of either strain c5 cells or the salivary  pellicles did not destroy or remove either the streptococcal adhesions or the pellicle receptors. neuraminidase treatment of pellicles or the presence of sialic acid-containing gangliosides only inhibited s. sanguis adsorption when low streptococcal concentrations were used. at these concentrations, s. sanguis adsorbs primarily to high-affinity pellicle binding sites. adsorption isotherms indicated that neuraminidase-sensitive interactions were mainly responsible for the high affinity of these binding sites, whereas putative hydrophobic interactions inhibitable by nascn were mainly associated with the numbers of binding sites available. sugar inhibition studies suggested that the two classes  of binding sites previously demonstrated in untreated salivary pellicles for s. sanguis c5 are not the result of a partial conversion of high-affinity sites to low-affinity sites due to removal of sialic acid residues.

AB  == a number of strains of streptococcus sanguis were found to aggregate in nonimmune serum and in crevicular fluid. all strains which aggregated in serum also aggregated in saliva, but some strains which aggregated in saliva did not aggregate in serum. aggregation was destroyed by treatment of serum or crevicular fluid with neuraminidase and was inhibited by gangliosides. treatment of serum with proteases reduced aggregating activity. adsorption of serum to hydroxyapatite did not reduce the aggregating activity. the aggregating factor was partially purified by gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was found to be an acidic glycoprotein with a molecular weight of greater than 200,000, comprised of subunits with molecular weights of approximately 100,000. it did not appear to be an immunoglobulin and could not be identified with any other serum component tested. the possible role of the aggregating factor in providing nonimmune protection against colonization of s. sanguis in the gingival crevice and blood is discussed.

TI  == a neuraminidase from streptococcus sanguis that can release o-acetylated sialic acids.
AB  == the naturally occurring sialic acids can have different types of n- and o-substitutions, resulting in more than 20 known isomers and compounds. most methods for the detailed study of these various sialic acids require that the molecules be first released from their alpha-glycosidic linkage. when mild acid hydrolysis is used for this purpose, significant destruction of o-substituent groups occur. on the other hand, the presence of o-substituent groups renders the sialic acid molecule partially or completely resistant to the action of the currently known neuraminidase. to circumvent this problem, we searched for a neuraminidase whose activity is not affected by o-substitution. we reasoned that  because streptococcus sanguis from the human oral cavity is continually exposed to o-substituted sialic acids, its extracellular neuraminidase might not be blocked by o-substitution. we therefore purified this enzyme 3100-fold (56% yield) using ammonium sulfate precipitation, n-(p-aminophenyl)oxamic acid-agarose affinity chromatography, and chromatography on quaternary aminoethyl (qae)-sephadex, sulfopropyl (sp)-sephadex, and sephacryl s-200. the purified preparation is free of other significant glycosidase activities and proteolytic activities. it is capable of quantitatively releasing all the o-acetylated sialic acids that we studied with the single exception of the 4-o-acetylated sialic acid of equine submaxillary mucin. the activity of the enzyme is also not restricted by the type pf sialic acid linkage or the nature of the underlying oligosaccharide. however, it has maximal activity on gangliosides only in the presence of detergents. the general properties of this enzyme are described and its substrate specificities are contrasted with those of the commonly used neuraminidase from vibrio cholerae.

AB  == to study the role of surface components in the selective binding and aggregation  of platelet-rich plasma (prp) by strains of viridans streptococci, we treated the binding, aggregation strain streptococcus sanguis i 2017-78 by sonication or trypsinization. morphologically identifiable electron-dense fibrils were released from the cell wall, apparently from an inner electron-dense layer, under conditions that left cells intact. these controlled conditions were determined to cause submaximal loss in adhesion to platelet ghosts and prp aggregation by treated, washed s. sanguis. soluble components were recovered from the controlled sonic or l-(tosylamido 2-phenyl)ethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin treatments. each showed dose-response inhibition of aggregation when preincubated with prp before challenge with fresh, untreated s. sanguis. the time to onset of prp aggregation was inhibited by 50% with 0.2 mg of tpck-trypsin peptides or 1.0 mg of the sonicate per ml per 2 x 10(8) platelets. components of both preparations were immunologically cross-reactive, but lipoteichoic acid was not a major antigen of either. by weight, the tpck-trypsin peptides were virtually all protein; the sonicate residues identified were about 50% protein and 7% hexose. each was a complex mixture of components as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. more than 8 tpck-trypsin peptides and 16 sonicate components were so identified. in contrast, at least four or five components from either preparation were recognized as surface determinants by a rabbit antiserum to whole homologous microbes. platelet-binding ligands of s. sanguis could be among these determinants.

TI  == comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  == oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. strains of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, and bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. strains of b. intermedius, s. salivarius, s. mutans, and b. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. an overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. this suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol  to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of s. sanguis and a. viscosus and increased numbers of s. mutans. analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the s. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. these observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. the data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.

TI  == inhibition of microbial iga proteases by human secretory iga and serum.
AB  == microbial iga proteases cleave human serum iga1 immunoglobulin, but human secretory iga is resistant to hydrolysis. we have found this resistance to be due to an inhibition of protease activity that is mediated by the fab region of secretory iga. the iga proteases of the genus neisseria are more sensitive to inhibition than is the protease of streptococcus sanguis. there is also a serum inhibitor of neisseria proteases that co-chromatographs with igg. monoclonal (myeloma) human igg proteins and plasma protease inhibitors such as alpha-1-antitrypsin and alpha-2-macroglobulin do not inhibit. human sera do not contain inhibitor to s. sanguis protease activity. we conclude that microbial iga proteases are subject to inhibition by iga in secretions and igg in serum, and this activity is most consistent with being an anti-enzyme antibody. the insensitivity of s. sanguis iga protease to inhibition is unexplained but provides further evidence that the iga proteases are structurally diverse.

AB  == the properties of an extracellular neuraminidase produced by a streptococcus sanguis strain (isolated from a confirmed case of subacute bacterial endocarditis) during growth in a defined medium was examined in this investigation. this enzyme, isolated from concentrated culture supernatants of s. sanguis biotype ii, was active against human alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, n-acetylneuramin lactose, bovine submaxillary mucin, and fetuin. neuraminidase production paralleled bacterial growth in defined medium and was maximal in the early stationary phase of growth but decreased dramatically, probably owing to protease production, during the late stationary phase. the enzyme was purified to near homogeneity by a combination of salt fractionation, ion-exchanged chromatography on deae-sephacel, and gel filtration on sephadex g-200. these procedures yielded an enzyme preparation that possessed a specific activity of 174.4 mumol of sialic acid released per min per mg of protein against human alpha-1 acid glycoprotein. the km value for this enzyme with human alpha-1 acid glycoprotein as substrate was 2.5 x 10(-3) m, and the enzyme possessed a ph optimum of 6.5. the s. sanguis neuraminidase had a molecular weight of approximately 85,000 as estimated by gel filtration and approximately 90,000 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the enzyme was stable at temperatures of 4 and 37 degrees c for 3 h, but approximately 50% of the enzymatic activity was lost within 30 min at 50 degrees c, with 100% of the enzymatic activity being destroyed within 10 min at temperatures of greater than or equal to 65 degrees c.

TI  == resistance in oral streptococci after repeated two-dose amoxycillin prophylaxis.
AB  == twelve normal volunteers received two doses of 3 g amoxycillin at weekly intervals on up to five occasions. amoxycillin-resistant oral streptococci were not isolated from any subject beforehand, but they had appeared in all eleven subjects (who could be included in the analysis) by the end of the investigation, and in one subject after one administration of double dose amoxycillin. resistant streptococci were undetectable in all volunteers 13 weeks after their last dose of amoxycillin. all resistant streptococci identified were streptococcus sanguis  (non-dextran-producing), many were highly resistant to amoxycillin and some were  also moderately resistant to erythromycin. the minimum bactericidal concentrations for the most resistant streptococcal strains isolated were less than the peak serum amoxycillin concentrations expected following a 3 g oral dose of amoxycillin. in the majority of volunteers the counts of oral resistant streptococci had greatly declined by about 6 weeks following the last administration of a double dose of amoxycillin. if further dental treatment liable to cause bacteraemia is required within six weeks of double dose amoxycillin prophylaxis an alternative regimen should be sought.

TI  == new actinomyces and streptococcus coaggregation groups among human oral isolates  from the same site.
AB  == the coaggregation properties of recent human oral streptococcal and actinomyces isolates from the same site were determined and compared with the coaggregation properties of well-characterized stock strains of these two kinds of bacteria. streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, and phenotypically similar strains of actinomyces were isolated from subgingival samples from periodontally healthy older individuals, from persons participating  in an experimental gingivitis study, and from young persons with localized (juvenile) and generalized (severe) periodontitis. all 34 of the actinomyces isolates coaggregated with reagent strains of s. sanguis that represented the four streptococcal coaggregation groups. most of these actinomyces exhibited coaggregations identical to those of actinomyces stock strains. however, five isolates of an actinomyces wva-963 serovar exhibited a coaggregation pattern different from any previously described, which was used to define coaggregation group f. all coaggregations with members of this group were lactose inhibitable.  only 57% (8 of 14) of the recent s. sanguis isolates coaggregated with actinomyces reagent strains. but when the nonreactive streptococcal isolates were tested for their ability to coaggregate with actinomyces from the same patient, a new, highly specific coaggregation pattern (group 6) for s. sanguis was discovered. coaggregation of these streptococci was observed only with certain isolates of a. naeslundii (members of coaggregation group d) from the same site,  and none of these coaggregations were inhibited by lactose. subsequent testing revealed that streptococci of group 6 coaggregated with group d actinomyces from  other sources but not with actinomyces of other coaggregation groups. only two strains of s. sanguis failed to coaggregate with any strain of actinomyces tested. these results indicate that nearly all fresh isolates of these species obtained from both diseased and healthy sites exhibit specific, nonrandom patterns of coaggregation and suggest the widespread occurrence of in vivo cell-to-cell recognition between oral actinomyces and streptococci.

AB  == fresh oral isolates from human dental plaque were selected on the basis of their  spherical morphology. in a double-blind experiment, their species identity and ability to coaggregate with human oral actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii were determined. of the 110 isolates characterized, 30 were identified as either streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus-constellatus, or veillonella parvula; none of these coaggregated with the actinomycetes. the remaining 80 isolates were identified as streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mg-intermedius, or streptococcus morbillorum. of these 49 isolates (61%) coaggregated with actinomycetes, and nearly 90% (43 of 49 isolates) exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations. compared with previously  characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of streptococci, 82% of the fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregations. the other 18% made up a new coaggregation group that possessed a related lactose-inhibitable coaggregation pattern. thus, most fresh isolates that coaggregated exhibited lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with human oral actinomycetes. it is suggested that these coaggregations are mediated by a network of lectin-carbohydrate interactions similar to those already characterized in previous studies with stock cultures of actinomycetes and streptococci.

TI  == quantitative screening of clinical isolates for immunoglobulin a protease production.
AB  == the production of immunoglobulin a (iga) protease is a potentially useful marker  in differentiating pathogenic from nonpathogenic species of clinical isolates; however, current quantitative assay methods are too tedious for routine application. a simple quantitative method was developed to screen clinical isolates for iga protease production. this method is based on the specificity of  reaction between iga and alpha chain-specific antiserum in an immunochemistry analyzer (beckman instruments, inc., brea, calif.). colonies of iga protease producers (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, and haemophilus influenzae) were picked from solid media, transferred to brain heart infusion containing iga1, and incubated at 37 degrees c for at least 2 h to provide a detectable decrease in iga concentration. the standard deviation for randomly picked colonies within a species was about +/- 15%. several iga protease-negative species caused no detectable reduction in the iga content of the system. the specificity of the iga measurement eliminates the requirements for extensive purification and radiolabeling of substrate and provides the basis for a well-defined iga protease activity unit (micrograms of iga1 cleaved per minute per milliliter of culture).

TI  == interaction of human plasma fibronectin with cariogenic and non-cariogenic oral streptococci.
AB  == the interaction of purified human plasma fibronectin (fn) with bacteria was studied with a variety of oral streptococci. each of the strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis  tested was aggregated by fn to various degrees, depending on the concentration of fn added to the test mixtures. binding assays performed with radiolabeled fn and  various strains of streptococci demonstrated various capabilities to bind fn, and the amount of fn bound by each strain was paralleled by its fn-induced aggregation, with s. mutans 6715 giving the highest values in both assays. because of the avid binding of fn by certain strains of potentially cariogenic streptococci, we investigated the possibility that fn may be present in human saliva and may be adsorbed from saliva onto artificial tooth pellicles. immunoreactive fn was detected in paraffin-stimulated whole saliva by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of saliva adsorbed onto gelatin-coated cuvettes and by immunoelectroblots (western blots) of salivary components separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gels. furthermore, immunoreactive fn was found to be present in artificial tooth pellicles formed by incubating hydroxyapatite beads with whole human saliva. these results demonstrate that certain strains of oral streptococci bind to and are aggregated  by fn. the presence of fn in artificial tooth pellicles suggests that this macromolecule may play a role in the attachment of potentially cariogenic and other oral streptococci to dental tissues.

AB  == the interference between alpha-streptococcal strains obtained from patients with  repeated tonsillitis and a collection of group a streptococcal strains were studied. for this purpose three in vitro methods were designed and compared. the  results obtained by a simple plating technique suitable for screening purposes were found to correlate well with those using more laborious techniques. in a limited scale some of the alpha- and beta-streptococcal combinations were tested  under in vivo conditions using a tissue cage model allowing repeated sampling. in most instances agreement between the results of the in vitro and in vivo methods  was registered. several alpha-strains having inhibitory capacity to the majority  of a collection of group a streptococci belonging to different serotypes were found, but also alpha-strains with an inhibitory activity restricted to few group a isolates within a certain serotype. also beta-streptococcal strains with growth inhibiting activity towards some alpha-strains were found. as the methods were chosen to eliminate many of the unspecific inhibitory factors and the beta-hemolytic test strains showed a pattern of inhibition that varied for each of the reference alpha-strains the activity is most likely attributed to bacteriocin-like substances.

TI  == significance of penicillin tolerance in vivo: prevention of experimental streptococcus sanguis endocarditis.
AB  == to determine whether in-vitro tolerance to penicillin among viridans streptococci influences the efficacy of penicillin in vivo, we studied four strains of dextran-producing. streptococcus sanguis serotype ii. all four strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.1 mg/l penicillin or less; one was not-tolerant, one intermediate, and two were tolerant to the lethal action of penicillin. the combination of penicillin and streptomycin killed all strains completely within 24 h in vitro. sera from rabbits injected with penicillin were inhibitory for all strains, but were bactericidal only for the non-tolerant strain. the incidence of endocarditis in untreated rabbits with left heart catheters was 100% after inoculation of each of the four strains. despite attempted prophylaxis with procaine penicillin g, endocarditis developed in 44 of 70 rabbits (63%) injected  with the tolerant strains, contrasting with 2 of 22 (9%) for the non-tolerant strain (p=0.0001). the probability that penicillin would fail to prevent endocarditis was directly related to its minimal bactericidal concentration for each strain (r=0.95). in contrast, the combination of penicillin plus streptomycin always prevented endocarditis. we conclude that penicillin tolerance can be a crucial determinant of the response of viridans streptococci to penicillin in vivo.

AB  == the production and the persistence of competence factor (cf) and competence factor inactivator (cfi) of four different strains of streptococcus sanguis in three media (todd hewitt broth, medium ii and medium iv) have been examined with  respect to kinetics. both the medium used and the strains examined offered implications on the activities of cf and cfi. cf was not detectable in the culture filtrates of strains wicky (nctc 9124) and 445. strain blackburn (nctc 10231) showed activity only in todd hewitt broth and strain 14567 in todd hewitt  broth and medium iv. the activity persisted for 2 to 7 hours during exponential growth. in culture filtrates of the strains wicky and blackburn the three media yielded high cfi activity persisting during the entire growth period. the strains 445 and 14567 were less potent cfi producers in medium ii and medium iv, and no cfi was detected in the culture filtrates from todd hewitt broth. medium ii was the most suitable medium for cfi production and seems appropriate for further studies and isolation of the factor. in medium iv no strain had cf activity. this medium was supplemented with serum, albumin, tyrosine or glutamic acid, and cf and cfi production and persistence by strain 14567 were studied in relation to growth phases. cf and cfi activities were observed in the different supplemented  media during short periods of growth, but could not be related to any given phase of growth. the presence of cfi in a culture eliminated or reduced the cf activity, and a specific interaction of cf and cfi was observed. the cfi from the strain wicky inactivated cf from the strains challis (nctc 7868) and blackburn, but not from the strains 13b and 14567. the cfi from the strains 445 and 14567 reduced the activity of cf produced by the strains 13b and 14567, but not cf from the strains challis and blackburn.

TI  == modulation of bacterial aggregation by pmn and platelet extracts.
AB  == human parotid saliva contains agglutinins which bind to the surface of streptococci and induce the formation of bacterial aggregates. bacterial aggregation can be blocked by proteins released from viable pmns and platelets or by sonic extracts prepared from these cells. pmn and platelet inhibitors display  characteristic differences in molecular weight, protease, and temperature sensitivity. the mechanism of action of the inhibitors appears to involve a direct interaction with the salivary agglutinins rather than with the bacteria. it is thus possible that pmn and platelet-derived products might modulate saliva-mediated bacterial aggregation and thereby influence the course of infections in the oral cavity.

TI  == a complex attenuator regulates inducible resistance to macrolides, lincosamides,  and streptogramin type b antibiotics in streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b resistance specified by streptococcus sanguis plasmid pam77 involves an adenine methylase, whose synthesis, demonstrable both phenotypically and by analysis of methionine-labeled proteins made in bacillus subtilis minicells, is inducible by erythromycin, lincomycin, and streptogramin type b antibiotics. localization of the methylase structural gene, including its control region in dna fragments obtained with restriction endonucleases, has been deduced from dna blot experiments with characterized target and probe dnas from other streptococci, combined with dna sequence analysis and comparison of the putative streptococcal methylase sequence with that of a cognate methylase in staphylococcal plasmid pe194. the streptococcal methylase migrates electrophoretically in polyacrylamide gels with the mobility of a 29,000-dalton protein. the sequence organization of the putative streptococcal methylase mrna leader sequence partially resembles its staphylococcal counterpart and can support a similar mechanism of secondary structure rearrangement leading to methylase synthesis. the deduced 5' leader sequence preceding the pam77 methylase structural gene sequence comprises approximately 155 nucleotides within which one can identify a putative control peptide 36 amino acid residues in length (in contrast to 19 in the pe194 peptide) and at least 14 possible classes of overlapping inverted complementary repeat sequences (in contrast to 3 in the pe194 control region), one of which can sequester the sequence aggag 7 nucleotides upstream from the putative (methionine) start codon of the streptococcal methylase. comparison of the pam77  and pe194 methylase amino acid sequences and their respective nucleotide sequences shows 51% conservation of amino acid residues (124 of 244) and 59% conservation of nucleotide residues (433 of 738), which suggests a common origin  for the two methylase structural gene sequences. differences in mrna base composition associated with conserved amino acid residues occur mostly in the third nucleotide ("wobble") position of codons and may reflect adaptation of methylase genes to optimal expression in host cells with differing codon use patterns.

TI  == streptococcal r plasmid pip501: endonuclease site map, resistance determinant location, and construction of novel derivatives.
AB  == the streptococcal resistance plasmid pip501 (30 kilobase pairs [kb]) encodes resistance to chloramphenicol (cmr) and erythromycin (emr) and is capable of conjugative transfer among numerous streptococcal species. by using a streptococcal host-vector recombinant dna system, the cmr and emr determinants of pip501 were localized to 6.3-kb hindiii and 2.1-kb hindiii-avai fragments, respectively. pip501 was lost at a frequency of 22% in streptococcus sanguis cells grown at 42 degrees c but was stable in cells grown at 37 degrees c (less than 1% frequency of loss). sequences from a cryptic multicopy plasmid, pva380-1, were substituted for the pip501 emr determinant in vitro, and the resulting recombinant plasmid, designated pva797, was recovered in transformed s. sanguis cells. the replication of pva797 was governed by the pva380-1 sequences based on  temperature-stable replication and incompatibility with pva380-1-derived replicons. the self-ligation of partially cleaved hindiii pip501 dna fragments allowed the localization of a pip501 region involved in autonomous plasmid replication. a small pip501 derivative (pva798) obtained from this experiment had a greatly increased copy number but was unstably inherited. our data indicate that the sequences encoding the resistance determinants and some of the plasmid replication machinery are relatively clustered on the pip501 molecule. the properties of pva797 and pva798 indicate that these molecules will enhance current streptococcal genetic systems from the standpoint of conjugative mobilization (pva797) and gene amplification (pva798).

AB  == although some strains of streptococci seem to be virtually inert to mecillinam, the growth of other strains, notably certain viridans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis) was inhibited by relatively low concentrations  of the drug. inhibition of the synthesis of peptidoglycan, rna, protein, and dna  in two tolerant strains, s. mutans fa-1 and gs-5, was studied over a wide range of concentrations of mecillinam, benzylpenicillin, and cefoxitin. the responses of both strains to all three beta-lactams were very similar; that is, synthesis of insoluble peptidoglycan was most susceptible. inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis was followed rapidly and sequentially by substantial but less severe inhibitions of rna and protein synthesis. significant inhibition of dna synthesis was not observed. binding studies with [14c]benzylpenicillin alone or after preexposure of membrane preparations to benzylpenicillin, mecillinam, or cefoxitin suggest that reasonably selective binding of a beta-lactam antibiotic to one or two of the major penicillin-binding proteins (pbp 1 or pbp 4) of s. mutans gs-5 and fa-1 may be the initial step in the series of events that results in the inhibition of growth and in the inhibition of insoluble peptidoglycan assembly and of rna and protein synthesis.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide excretion by oral streptococci and effect of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == approved type strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the rate of hydrogen peroxide excretion, oxygen uptake, and acid production from glucose by washed-cell suspensions of these strains were studied, and the levels of enzymes  in cell-free extracts which reduced oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or hypothiocyanite (oscn-) in the presence of nadh or nadph were assayed. the effects of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide on the rate of acid production and  oxygen uptake by intact cells, the activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts, and the levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates were also studied. all strains consumed oxygen in the presence of glucose. s. sanguis, s. mitis, and anaerobically grown s. mutans excreted hydrogen peroxide. there was higher nadh oxidase and nadh peroxidase activity in aerobically grown cells than  in anaerobically grown cells. nadph oxidase activity was low in all species. acid production, oxygen uptake, and, consequently, hydrogen peroxide excretion were inhibited in all the strains by lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide. s. sanguis and s. mitis had a higher capacity than s. mutans and s. salivarius to recover from this inhibition. higher activity in the former strains of an nadh-oscn oxidoreductase, which converted oscn- into thiocyanate, explained this  difference. the change in levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates after  inhibition of glycolysis by oscn- and the actual activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts in the presence of oscn- indicated that the primary target  of oscn- in the glycolytic pathway was glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

AB  == mouthrinsing with snf2 reduced the streptococcus mutans population in plaque and  saliva and the proportion of streptococcus sanguis in plaque. the effect was of short duration: 2 weeks after treatment the values of s. mutans in plaque and saliva were even higher than the pretreatment values. topical snf2 applications reduced the s. mutants population in plaque and saliva but did not reduce the proportion of s. sanguis in plaque. the effect was more prolonged : 4 weeks after treatment the s. mutans population in interproximal plaque remained significantly reduced and the salivary levels of the organism had not fully returned to pretreatment levels. both snf2 treatments significantly increased the salivary levels of lactobacilli. the values of lactobacilli in saliva remained significantly increased 4 weeks after the snf2 mouthrinsing but had almost returned to pretreatment levels within 2 weeks after the topical snf2 applications. the findings suggest that the cariogenic potential of dental plaque is differently affected depending on whether a drug is administered as a mouthrinse or is applied topically.

TI  == adp-like platelet aggregation activity generated by viridans streptococci incubated with exogenous atp.
AB  == to explore the possibility that streptococcus sanguis aggregation of platelet-rich plasma (prp) might be mediated by soluble agents, we tested cell-free s. sanguis supernatant for aggregation activity. the supernatant of untreated s. sanguis was without measurable prp aggregation activity. in contrast, the cell-free supernatant of atp-incubated s. sanguis produced an immediate wave of prp aggregation. the supernatant with prp aggregating activity  contained insufficient protease to produce a response. the response increased with the time of incubation with atp. active supernatant was desalted and chromatographed on nucleotide-calibrated columns of dowex 1-x8. an active adp function was identified. the activity was insensitive to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, but was sensitive to both ca2+ and ca2+-mg2+ chelating  agents, cold (4 degrees c), heat (80 degrees c), ph (optimum between ph 7 and 8), apyrase, and sodium molybdate. in addition, preincubation of prp with adenosine inhibited activity. strains of viridans streptococci were screened for activity.  aggregation-promoting strains showed two times more activity than did other strains. although it was not vigorously excluded that the adp was discharged from the microbes, the existence of an exogenous atpase on s. sanguis was strongly suggested. the expression of the activity was associated with the lag time to onset of prp aggregation with intact s. sanguis. this activity could, therefore,  be a synergistic promoter of prp aggregation and an additional virulence factor in endocarditis.

TI  == corncob formation between fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == corncob formation in dental plaque was believed to be limited to strains of bacterionema matruchotii and streptococcus sanguis. we observed recently that strains of fusobacterium nucleatum also interacted with s. sanguis to form corncobs. since the fusobacteria are among the first anaerobic filaments to colonize subgingival plaque, these interactions could serve as a connecting link  between the transformation of supra- to subgingival plaque. to further characterize these interactions, quantitative in vitro studies of the kinetics of corncob formation of the fusobacteria were undertaken. these studies indicated that fewer streptococci were needed to saturate f. nucleatum strain 364 compared  to strain 10953. corncob formation with both strains was enhanced with increasing ph up to ph 8, at which point autoaggregation of the streptococci occurred. variation in ionic strength and divalent cations had little effect on the interaction, and edta suppressed aggregate formation only slightly. detergents at concentrations above 0.05% also inhibited corncob formation. electron micrographs suggested that attachment of the cocci to the fusiforms was mediated through localized tufts of fimbriae, as they are in the bacterionema system. however, although both trypsin and heat treatment of the streptococci inhibited corncob formation with fusobacteria, the effects were not as complete as those seen in bacterionema species. unlike the bacterionema model, trypsin and heat treatment of the fusobacteria resulted in inhibition of corncob formation. these results suggest that several different receptors may be involved in corncob formation.

TI  == cysteine toxicity for oral streptococci and effect of branched-chain amino acids.
AB  == cysteine was bactericidal to strains of streptococcus mutans and s. salivarius in concentrations that were nontoxic to s. sanguis, s. milleri, or s. mitior when these microorganisms were incubated in a saliva protein-based synthetic medium. cysteine toxicity for s. mutans also occurred after incubation in synthetic base  medium supplemented with amino acids as the nitrogen source for growth. the bactericidal effect of cysteine for s. mutans or s. salivarius in the saliva protein medium was influenced by the cysteine oxidative activity associated with  the saliva protein fraction. valine alone or in combination with leucine or isoleucine was effective in overcoming cysteine toxicity for susceptible strains  of s. mutans or s. salivarius. cysteine toxicity for these oral streptococci may  be due to cysteine inhibition of an enzymatic step in the valine-leucine biosynthetic pathway.

TI  == purification and properties of pyruvate kinase from streptococcus sanguis and activator specificity of pyruvate kinase from oral streptococci.
AB  == it was found that pyruvate kinases with two different regulatory characteristics  were distributed among oral streptococci. the pyruvate kinases of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus bovis were activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas the enzymes of both streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. pyruvate kinase  (ec 2.7.1.40) from s. sanguis nctc 10904 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the enzyme had a molecular weight of 250,000 to 260,000 and consisted of four identical subunits.  whereas the pyruvate kinase from s. mutans was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (k. abbe and t. yamada, j. bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), the enzyme  from s. sanguis was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. in the presence of 0.5 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and adp, were hyperbolic, and the km values were 0.13 and 0.30 mm, respectively. without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves for both substrates were sigmoidal. gdp, idp, and udp could replace adp. like the enzyme from s. mutans, the enzyme from s. sanguis required a divalent cation, mg2+ or mn2+, and a monovalent cation, k+ or nh4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by pi. when the concentration of pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and hill coefficient for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate  increased. the remarkable fluctuation of intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate observed in the cells growing under glucose limitation and nitrogen limitation implies that the intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, in cooperation with that of pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in s. sanguis in vivo.

TI  == successful single-dose amoxicillin prophylaxis against experimental streptococcal endocarditis: evidence for two mechanisms of protection.
AB  == amoxicillin prophylaxis against experimental endocarditis due to one nontolerant  and two tolerant strains of streptococci was studied in rats. single-dose amoxicillin protected against the two tolerant strains in animals challenged with the 90% infective dose (id90), but protection diminished with increasing inoculum sizes. protection against the nontolerant strain was successful with inocula that were 100- and 1,000-fold larger than the id90. close correlation existed between  the speed of bacterial killing in vitro, the time of exposure to bactericidal levels in vivo, and the range of inocula against which prophylaxis was effective. amoxicillin seemed to protect by at least two mechanisms. (1) when in vitro tests indicated adequate bacterial killing, protection was independent of the inoculum  size and was probably conferred by bacterial killing. (2) when in vitro tests indicated bacterial inhibition but not killing, protection was inoculum-dependent and was probably mediated by inhibition of bacterial adherence.

TI  == effect of penicillin on the adherence of streptococcus sanguis in vitro and in the rabbit model of endocarditis.
AB  == the effect of penicillin treatment of streptococcus sanguis in vitro, on subsequent bacterial density in the bloodstream and on cardiac valves in the rabbit model of endocarditis was studied. as experimental tools for this study, isogenic pairs of s. sanguis differing in resistance to streptomycin or rifampin  were prepared by genetic transformation. rabbits with traumatized heart valves received an intravenous inoculation of penicillin treated (1 mug/ml) and untreated s. sanguis, each marked by resistance to either streptomycin or rifampin. the number of penicillin-treated and untreated bacteria attached to the valvular surfaces was determined by differential counting on streptomycin or rifampin containing media. penicillin pretreatment reduced cardiac valve colonization 5 min after inoculation ("adherence ratio" x 10(8) was 4.11 for the  control and 3.66 for the penicillin-treated bacteria, p < 0.001). the results were not due to differences in serum killing or bacterial densities in the bloodstream. there was no difference in valvular bacterial densities 24 h after bacterial inoculation (adherence ratio x 10(8), 7.26 untreated vs. 6.34 penicillin-pretreated, p > 0.10). in vitro experiments were performed using platelet-fibrin surfaces to test the possibility that penicillin-induced loss of  lipoteichoic acid was responsible for decreased streptococcal adherence. pretreatment of s. sanguis cultures with inhibitory concentrations of penicillin  or with antiserum against lipoteichoic acid and precoating of the platelet-fibrin surfaces with lipoteichoic acid, all caused reduction in bacterial adherence. the findings are interpreted as support for the role of lipoteichoic acid as an adhesin in s. sanguis interactions with particular host tissue surfaces.

AB  == previous studies have indicated that a galactosephilic component present on the bacterial cell surfaces of streptococcus sanguis atcc 10557 may be responsible for the salivary glycoprotein-mediated binding of the cells. the purpose of this  study was to investigate the purification and characterization of galactosephilic cell surface component from s. sanguis atcc 10557. a galactosephilic component involving fibrils on the cell surfaces was isolated by the techniques of freezing and thawing, and purified by an affinity chromatography on beta-d-galactose binding-bio-gel p-2 followed by gel filtrations on bio-gel p-150 and on bio-gel p-30. both disk gel electrophoresis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the purified product was homogeneous. the isoelectric point of the purified sample was 8.5 to 9.0. treatment of the purified sample with pronase e reduced remarkably either the hemagglutinating activity or the precipitation reaction with proline-rich glycoprotein in human parotid saliva, suggesting that the active site may be present on the peptide moieties. when sugar specificity was examined by hemagglutination-inhibition test, d-galactose was the strongest inhibitor. the results of this study suggest that the galactosephilic component may be a bacterial lectin.

TI  == aggregation of human platelets and adhesion of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == platelet vegetations or thrombi are common findings in subacute bacterial endocarditis. we investigated the hypothesis that human platelets selectively bind or adhere strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans and aggregate, as a result, into an in vitro thrombus. earlier ultrastructural studies suggested that aggregation of platelets over time by staphylococcus aureus was preceded in order by adhesion and platelet activation. we uncoupled the adhesion step from activation and aggregation in our studies by incubating streptococci with platelet ghosts in a simple, quantitative assay. adhesion was shown to be mediated by protease-sensitive components on the streptococci and platelet ghosts rather than cell surface carbohydrates or dextrans, plasma components, or divalent cations. the same streptococci were also studied by standard aggregometry techniques. platelet-rich plasma was activated and aggregated by certain isolates of s. sanguis. platelet ghosts bound the same strains selectively under ca2+- and plasma-depleted conditions. fresh platelets could activate after washing, but ca2+ had to be restored. aggregation required fresh platelets in ca2+-restored plasma and was inducible by washed streptococcal cell walls. these reactions in the binding and aggregometry assays were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. surface microfibrils on intact s. sanguis were identified. these appendages appeared to bind s. sanguis to platelets. the selectivity of adhesion of the various s. sanguis strains to platelet ghosts or ca2+- and plasma-depleted fresh washed platelets was similar for all donors. thus, the platelet binding site was expressed widely in the population and was unlikely to be an artifact of membrane aging or preparation. since selective adhesion of s. sanguis to platelets was apparently required for aggregation, it is suggested that functionally defined receptors for ligands on certain strains of s. sanguis may be present on human platelets. some differences in the selectivity and rate of the aggregation response were noted among platelet donors, although the meaning of the variability requires further study. nonetheless, these interactions may contribute to platelet accretion in the initiation and development of vegetative lesions in the subacute bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == iga1 half molecules in human multiple myeloma and the in vitro production of similar fragments from intact iga1 molecules.
AB  == this paper describes an iga related protein vla which occurred in the serum and urine of a patient with multiple myeloma. the protein was isolated from urine; it had a molecular mass of 70,000 daltons. it was shown to be a two chain iga half molecule, consisting of a deleted alpha heavy chain, with a molecular mass of 42,000 daltons, which was disulphide linked to a normal kappa type light chain. fabc fragments were produced from an unrelated myeloma iga. these had the same biochemical properties as protein v1a, except for the absence of the disulphide linkage between the deleted heavy chains and the light chains. protein vla and the fabc fragments could both be cleaved by iga1 protease from streptococcus sanguis, which indicates the presence of the alpha 1 hinge region. an inventory of its antigenic determinants and their similarity to those of previously characterized f(abc)2 fragments, indicates that protein vla, like the fabc fragments, contains the ch1 and ch2 domains, but lacks most of the ch3 domain. the fact that cleavage by iga1 protease from s. sanguis yields a fab fragment but fails to yield a ch2 domain demonstrates that cleavage by the enzyme is not only  restricted to the pro227-thr228 bond in the iga1 hinge region.

AB  == the influence of bacterial cell concentration on estimates of the number of binding sites and the affinity for the adsorption of a strain of streptococcus sanguis to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite was determined, and the possible presence of multiple binding sites for this organism was tested. the range of concentrations of available bacteria varied from 4.7 x 10(6) to 5,960 x 10(6) cells per ml. the numbers of adsorbed bacteria increased over the entire range tested, but a suggestion of a break in an otherwise smooth adsorption isotherm was evident. values for the number of binding sites and the affinity varied considerably depending upon the range of available bacterial concentrations used  to estimate them; high correlation coefficients were obtained in all cases. the use of low bacterial cell concentrations yielded lower values for the number of sites and much higher values for the affinity constant than did the use of high bacterial cell concentrations. when data covering the entire range of bacterial concentrations were employed, values for the number of sites and the affinity were similar to those obtained by using only high bacterial cell concentrations.  the simplest explanation for these results is that there are multiple binding sites for s. sanguis on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces. when present in low concentration, the streptococci evidently attach to more specific high-affinity sites which become saturated when higher bacterial concentrations are employed. the possibility of multiple binding sites was substantiated by comparing estimates of the adsorption parameters from a computer-simulated isotherm with those derived from the experimentally generated isotherm. a mathematical model describing bacterial adsorption to binary binding sites was further evidence for the existence of at least two classes of binding sites for s. sanguis. far fewer streptococci adsorbed to experimental pellicles prepared from saliva depleted of bacterial aggregating activity when low numbers of streptococci were used, but the magnitude of this difference was considerably less when high streptococcal concentrations were employed. this suggests an association between salivary components which possess bacterial-aggregating activity and bacterial adsorption to high-affinity specific binding sites on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.

TI  == the binding of human salivary alpha-amylase by oral strains of streptococcal bacteria.
AB  == the ability of various oral streptococci to bind salivary alpha-amylase to their  cell surfaces was investigated. samples of cells were mixed with whole cleared saliva and the alpha-amylase remaining after removal of the cells was assayed by  radial diffusion in starch-containing agarose. seventy-five per cent of streptococcus sanguis strains bound the enzyme but strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus mitior did not. sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of strep. sanguis cells which had been mixed with saliva showed that alpha-amylase is bound to the surface of the cells and can be recovered from them intact. the ability of strep. sanguis strains to bind the enzyme did not correlate with biotype, ips production or ability to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. the cell-surface receptor responsible for the binding of alpha-amylase to strep. sanguis (nctc 7865) is a heat-stable component, possibly  protein in nature, which is closely associated with the cell wall.

TI  == heterofermentative glucose metabolism by glucose transport-impaired mutants of oral streptococcal bacteria during growth in batch culture.
AB  == spontaneous mutants defective in a membrane component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-glucose phosphotransferase system were isolated by plating cells of streptococcus sanguis 10556, streptococcus mutans gs5-2 and nctc 10449 on agar containing lactose and 2-deoxyglucose. toluenized cells of these mutants  were defective in their ability to catalyse the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose. the parental strains were mainly homofermentative when grown in batch culture in the presence of various sugars. nevertheless, the mutants produced acetate, formate and ethanol when cultured in  the presence of glucose but were homofermentative when grown in the presence of lactose or maltose. analysis of one mutant isolated from strep. sanguis (mutant gs26) revealed normal levels of glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, puruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. this last enzyme was dependent on fructose 1,6-diphosphate for catalytic activity. the determination of the intracellular level of fructose 1,6-diphosphate (fdp) during growth of the cells  in batch culture showed that the mutant strains contained 2 to 15 times less fdp  than the parental strains. growth experiments performed at ph 6.0 and 7.0 with strep. sanguis and its pts-negative mutant gs26 suggested that the regulation of  pyruvate metabolism in this bacterium include the intracellular level of fdp and  the initial hydrogen concentration of the growth medium. the results also suggested that, in these bacteria, an active pts is required to maintain the intracellular concentration of fdp high enough to keep the cell homofermentative  during growth in batch culture.

TI  == control of sugar utilization in the oral bacteria streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguis by the phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == three different strep. salivarius (g2, g5 and g29) and two strep. sanguis (gs3 and gs12) mutants affected in the phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase system were selected on agar plates containing lactose and 2-deoxyglucose. all 5  were defective in a membrane-bound component of the transport system and grew less rapidly than the parent strain in 5 mm glucose-containing medium. mutants g2 and g29 grew poorly in the presence of 5 mm mannose. growth on mixed substrates revealed that the mutants and wild-type parents behaved differently. wild-type strains in medium containing glucose plus another sugar (lactose, galactose, melibiose, raffinose or trehalose for strep. salivarius and lactose, galactose or trehalose for strep. sanguis) always exhausted most of the glucose before utilizing the other sugar. the mutants used the second sugar concurrently or preferentially to glucose. in medium containing glucose plus fructose or mannose, the wild types consumed both sugars concurrently whereas the mutants utilized the second sugar before glucose. mutants g2 and g5 were insensitive to repression by  fructose and released glucose into the medium when grown in the presence of 0.4 per cent lactose. mutant g5 also released galactose. sugar release was not detected with the wild types. the strep. salivarius mutants contained normal levels of glucokinase and beta-galactosidase but g5 was almost totally devoid of  galactokinase activity after growth on lactose. on galactose, the activity was restored. it seems that the phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase system is involved in the regulation of sugar utilization in these two streptococci.

TI  == inhibition by the antimicrobial agent chlorhexidine of acid production and sugar  transport in oral streptococcal bacteria.
AB  == oral streptococci transport sugars via the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase (pep-pts) system. in a specific assay of this system, low concentrations of chlorhexidine abolished the activity of the glucose and sucrose pts in batch-grown cells of streptococcus mutans ingbritt and b13, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitis atcc 903, strep. milleri nctc 10709 and strep. salivarius nctc 8606. intact cells and cells made permeable to the assay reagents with toluene were used. toluenized cells were more sensitive to chlorhexidine than intact cells (0.09 and 0.25 mm, respectively). this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine reduced acid production from glucose in ph fall experiments to values higher than are obtained solely from endogenous metabolism. the effect of  chlorhexidine on rates of acid production was determined at ph 7.0 using cells washed with either 135 mm nacl or 135 mm kcl. in general, faster rates of acid production from the metabolism of glucose and sucrose were obtained with potassium-treated cells. addition of the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine markedly reduced or totally abolished acid production by nacl-treated cells; a greater residual-activity was detected in the same cells washed with kcl (except with strep. mutans b13 and strep. mitis atcc 903). the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine had little or no effect on the viability of cells. the results confirm the existence of sugar uptake systems in  oral streptococci additional to the pts and provide an explanation for the additive anti-caries effect of mouth-rinses containing both fluoride and chlorhexidine.

TI  == characterization of a galactose-specific lectin from actinomyces viscosus by a model aggregation system.
AB  == a simple model system has been developed in which lectin-mediated aggregation of  glycoprotein-coated beads can be monitored by following the decrease in light scattering at 650 nm. aggregation has been characterized with the lectin of actinomyces viscosus t14v. its dependence on ph, temperature, and stirring rate was examined, and the number of bacterial cells in relation to the number of latex beads resulting in optimal aggregation was established. this system has the advantage of permitting the study of a single ligand of defined structure. the ligand density was determined with radiolabeled glycoproteins. under the conditions of the assay, ligand leakage was less than 3%, and ligands were not displaced from the beads by various proteins, glycoproteins, or by other components present in the assay mixture. latex beads coated with asialofetuin aggregate upon the addition of a. viscosus t14v cells. by contrast, when asialofetuin was first extensively treated with purified galactose oxidase, no aggregation occurred. only after reduction with nabh(4) was aggregation restored, demonstrating that galactose termini of asialofetuin are essential for the binding of a. viscosus lectin. an absolute requirement for calcium was also demonstrated. various sugars inhibited aggregation in the following order, starting with the most effective: lactose, methyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside, galactose, n-acetylgalactosamine, methyl-alpha-d-galactopyranoside. beads coated  with fimbriae from a. viscosus coaggregated with neuraminidase-treated human erythrocytes and with streptococcus sanguis cells. in each instance the aggregation was inhibited by lactose, indicating that the a. viscosus lectin is located in the fimbriae. cells grown under different conditions differed in their effectiveness in aggregating glycoprotein-coated beads, suggesting differences in lectin density or accessibility. two different experimental designs were used to  establish the minimum ligand density for aggregation to occur. in one type of experiment, a threshold concentration was found for asialo alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein, but not for asialofetuin. with an alternate approach in which a different population of galactose residues was exposed, a threshold phenomenon was also demonstrated for asialofetuin. the importance of structural ligand features in the aggregation assay is discussed in view of these findings.

AB  == a glucophospholipid was detected in an incubation mixture containing udp-glucose, mgcl2, atp, and a particulate enzyme prepared from streptococcus sanguis. the synthesis of this lipid was inhibited strongly by udp and moderately by ump. the  molar ratio of glucose to phosphate in the purified lipid was found to be 1:1. glucose and glucose 1-phosphate were released by mild alkaline hydrolysis of the  glucophospholipid. the lipid produced by mild acid degradation of the purified lipid yielded a thin-layer chromatographic profile similar to that of acid-treated undecaprenol. one of the minor components exhibited the same mobility as untreated undecaprenol. to characterize further the lipid moiety of the glucophospholipid, a polyisoprenol was purified from the neutral lipid of s.  sanguis. the polyisoprenol was converted in the presence of atp, udp-glucose, and the particulate enzyme into a lipid which exhibited the same thin-layer chromatographic mobility as the glucophospholipid. the structure of the polyisoprenol was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry  to be an undecaprenol with an internal cis-trans ratio of 7:2. these results indicate that the glucophospholipid is glucosyl monophosphoryl undecaprenol. the  glucosyl moiety of the glucophospholipid was shown to be incorporated in the presence of the particulate enzyme into a macromolecule which was characterized as a lipoteichoic acid by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and deae-cellulose column chromatography. this result indicates that glucosyl monophosphoryl undecaprenol is the direct glucosyl donor in the synthesis of lipoteichoic acid.

TI  == hydrophobic interactions and the adherence of streptococcus sanguis to hydroxylapatite.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis demonstrated a high affinity for hydrocarbon solvents. when aqueous suspensions of the organism were mixed with either hexadecane or toluene, the cells tended to bind to the nonaqueous solvent. increases in temperature resulted in a greater affinity of cells for hexadecane. interaction between the cells and hexadecane was also enhanced by dilute aqueous sodium chloride and by low ph (ph less than 5). the results suggest that the cell surface of s. sanguis  has hydrophobic properties. isolated cell walls also tended to partition into the nonaqueous solvent. amino acid analyses of the walls revealed the presence of several amino acids which possess hydrophobic side chains. it is likely that the  hydrophobic amino acids associated with the cell wall contribute to the hydrophobicity of intact s. sanguis. when the adherence of s. sanguis to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite was measured, it was found that hydrophobic bond-disrupting agents, such as the li+ cation, the scn- anion, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, were capable of inhibiting the cell-hydroxylapatite union. in addition, it was observed that both urea and tetramethylurea were inhibitors of the adherence, although the latter reagent was the superior inhibitor. the results suggest that the adherence of s. sanguis to saliva-coated smooth surfaces is at least partially dependent on the formation of hydrophobic bonds between the cell and adsorbed salivary proteins. hydrophobic bonding may contribute to cooperative interactions involving s. sanguis and saliva-coated hydroxylapatite (nesbitt et al., infect. immun. 35:157-165, 1982).

TI  == failure of erythromycin in preventing bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == use of oral erythromycin to prevent bacterial endocarditis has been accepted in the treatment of penicillin-allergic patients who required oral or sinusal surgery. a case of streptococcus sanguis endocarditis, however, developed in a patient following intravenous erythromycin administration during surgery on the maxillary sinus. the organism isolated proved resistant to erythromycin. this isolation of an erythromycin-resistant organism, together with previous reports of the drug's failure in preventing endocarditis in animal models, and recognition of the bacteriostatic action of erythromycin, argue for caution in our current practice of using erythromycin as a single drug therapy to prevent endocarditis in the patient who is allergic to penicillin.

TI  == [bacteriologic study of 125 cases of streptococcal infectious endocarditis].
AB  == streptococci remain the bacterial group the most frequently associated with microbial endocarditis. this paper points out the ability of the different species to cause endocarditis. 128 streptococci are isolated from patients with microbial endocarditis (127 from blood cultures, 1 from a valve). isolates are speciated by biochemical tests and the determination of their group antigen. the  viridans streptococci most frequently isolated are s. sanguis i (27 p. cent), s.  mitis (16.5 p. cent) and s. sanguis ii (9.6 p cent). a comparative survey of the  results is rather difficult due to the methodological and taxonomical divergences.

AB  == a plasmid that is able to replicate in both escherichia coli and streptococcus sanguis has been constructed by the in vitro joining of the pacyc184 (cmr tcr) and pva749 (emr) replicons. this plasmid, designated pva838, is 9.2 kb in size and expresses emr in both e. coli and s. sanguis. its cmr marker is expressed only in e. coli and may be inactivated by addition of dna inserts at its internal ecori or pvuii sites. the pva838 molecule also contains unique sali, sphi, bamhi, nrui and xbai cleavage sites suitable for molecular cloning. pva838 may be amplified in e. coli but not in s. sanguis. we have used the pva838 plasmid as a  shuttle vector to clone streptococcal plasmid fragments in e. coli. such chimeras isolated from e. coli were readily introduced into s. sanguis by transformation.

TI  == helper plasmid cloning in streptococcus sanguis: cloning of a tetracycline resistance determinant from the streptococcus mutans chromosome.
AB  == a model system for testing the helper plasmid cloning system of gryczan et al. (mol. gen. genet. 177:459-467, 1980) was devised for the streptococcus sanguis (challis) host-vector system. in this system, linearized pva736 plasmid efficiently transformed an s. sanguis (challis) host containing a homologous plasmid, pva380-1, but did not transform a plasmidless host or a host containing  a nonhomologous plasmid, pva380. in addition, whereas monomeric circular pva736 transformed a plasmidless host with two-hit kinetics, it transformed a pva380-1-containing host with one-hit kinetics. this helper plasmid cloning system was used to isolate two hindiii fragments (5.0 megadaltons [mdal] and 1.9  mdal in size) from the chromosome of streptococcus mutans v825 which conferred high-level tetracycline resistance. one tetracycline-resistant clone was examined and found to contain three plasmids which were sized and designated pva868 (9.0 mdal), pva869 (9.5 mdal), and pva870 (9.8 mdal). results of southern blot hybridization and restriction endonuclease digestion confirmed that all three chimeras were composed of two hindiii fragments of the s. mutans v825 chromosome, as well as a large portion, varying in size for each chimera, of the 2.8 mdal cloning vector, pva380-1. incompatibility observed between pva380-1 and each of the chimeras indicated that replication of the chimeras was governed by the pva380-1 replicative origin. southern blotting experiments revealed that the chimeras hybridized to tn916, providing the first evidence that transposon-related genes of enteric streptococcal origin are disseminated among oral streptococci.

AB  == a method for the speciation of viridans streptococci (devoided of group antigens) is described. the major identification criteria are based on the reaction of a series of biochemical tests such as acid production in lactose, inuline, raffinose, mannitol and sorbitol, hydrolysis of arginine, esculin and na hippurate, and production of polysaccharides in 5% sucrose media. a total of 460  strains were isolated from human specimens and identified as follows: 118 streptococcus mitis, 102 s. sanguis ii, 75 s. sanguis i, 87 s. milleri (streptococcus mg-intermedius), 28 s. mutans, 25 s. salivarius, 14 s. morbillorium, 2 s. uberis and 9 unspeciated. susceptibility to antibiotics was studied for 318 strains: 63% of them were susceptible to all drugs tested; 37% of the strains were resistant to one or several antibiotics as follows: 34% to tetracycline, 8.5% to macrolides and related drugs, 5.3% to streptomycin and/or kanamycin (mic greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml), 5% to penicillin (mic = 1-4 micrograms/ml) and 4% to chloramphenicol.

AB  == spontaneously occurring coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of oral actinomycetes and streptococci were isolated and used to study interactions between cells of these two kinds of bacteria. cog- mutants of each kind of bacteria were isolated by a simple enrichment scheme. parent strains were mixed with a coaggregating partner strain, coaggregated cells were removed by low-speed centrifugation, and non-coaggregated cells were recycled by the addition of more  partner strain cells. cog- mutants constituted up to 10% of the parent strain cell type in the final enriched cell suspension. unlike their respective parent strains, cog- mutants of actinomyces viscosus t14v and actinomyces naeslundii atcc 12104, and a. naeslundii i exhibited no lactose-reversible coaggregation with certain oral streptococcus sanguis strains. however, these cog- mutants were not altered in their coaggregations with another s. sanguis strain, h1, a member  of a streptococcal coaggregation group that exhibits only lactose-nonreversible coaggregations with oral actinomycetes. although all coaggregations between s. sanguis h1 and these actinomycetes appear to be alike, examination of a cog- mutant of s. sanguis h1 revealed that, like its parent, it coaggregated with a. viscosus t14v and its cog- mutants, but unlike its parent, it did not coaggregate with the two a. naeslundii strains or their cog- mutants. thus, it was concluded  that at least two types of surface components are important in mediating coaggregation between s. sanguis h1 and actinomycetes. the cog- mutant of s. sanguis allowed detection of these components, which were indistinguishable in previous studies.

TI  == the acquisition of streptococcus mutans by infant monkeys (macaca fascicularis) and its relationship to the initiation of dental caries.
AB  == the acquisition and transmission of streptococcus mutans by 16 consecutively born infant monkeys (macaca fascicularis) was studied. the 16 infant monkeys were weaned in four groups and caged together to form a commune. transmission from mother to infant occurred infrequently. streptococcus mutans was isolated from nine of the mothers but only from the dental plaque of two infant monkeys at weaning at which time the predominant streptococci were s. sanguis and s. mitior. one further animal was colonized by s. mutants during the formation of the commune, but only after it was caged with an infant harbouring the same organism. for 46 d after the completion of the commune, the monkeys were fed a starch-based diet during which time s. mutans of serotypes c, e or h were isolated from the faeces of all 16 animals and from the dental plaque taken from the developmental  groove of the first deciduous molar of 11 animals. faecal transmission appeared to be an important factor in the spread of s. mutans between monkeys in the commune. the monkeys were then fed a caries-promoting high sucrose diet resulting in a rapid increase in the proportion of s. mutans in the plaque and in the faeces. streptococcus mutans serotype e was more frequently isolated from both plaque and faeces and its predominance may in part be due to the production of a  bacteriocin active in vitro against s. mutans serotype h and other species of oral streptococci isolated from monkey dental plaque. the proportion of s. mutans in the developmental groove 8 d after the introduction of the high sucrose diet was significantly related to both the caries status of the groove and the total caries score 6 months later. the results suggest that, in this model of human dental caries, s. mutans is the major bacterial factor in the initiation of tooth decay.

TI  == growth inhibition of oral streptococci in saliva by anionic proteins from two caries-free individuals.
AB  == mixed saliva from two caries-free individuals possessed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus mutans and s. sanguis. this inhibitory activity was attributed to the presence of a group of four anionic proteins each of which strongly inhibited the growth of the oral streptococci in a saliva protein-based  medium but not in a medium containing amino acids as a nitrogen source. these proteins, with isoelectric points of 4.70, 4.90, 4.98, and 5.05, respectively, neither reacted with antisera to immunoglobulin a, g, or m nor appeared to be functionally related to a number of salivary peroxidases, lactoferrin, or lysozyme. on this basis, they may represent a previously unreported group of growth-inhibitory antimicrobial factors occurring in the saliva of some individuals.

AB  == cell was components from streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10558 stimulated the release of 45ca from prelabeled mouse calvariae in organ culture. bone resorbing activity was not blocked by fetal calf serum. it was, however, blocked by calcitonin, an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, partially blocked endogenous but not antigen-stimulated 45ca, suggesting that antigen-stimulated bone resorption was not mediated by prostaglandins. the antigen preparations also had an inhibitory effect on the incorporation of 3h-proline and 3h-thymidine into explants of rabbit and rat calvariae, respectively. the inhibitory effect of antigen on 3h-proline incorporation was not altered by the presence of calcitonin, which suggests that it represented a real inhibition of protein synthesis and not a reflection that the bones were resorbing. these findings indicate that plaque bacterial antigens may contribute directly to the progressive loss of alveolar bone during periodontal disease. the assumption that only gram-negative organisms play an important role in the etiology of periodontal disease appears incorrect.

AB  == a comparison was made of acid production by cells of streptococcus mutans ingbritt and s. sanguis nctc 7865 that had been washed twice and incubated in different concentrations of sodium and potassium ions. organisms were grown under defined conditions in a chemostat under both glucose limitation and glucose excess conditions at a dilution rate of 0.1 h(-1) (mean generation time, 6.9 h).  acid production after a pulse of glucose, sucrose, and fructose was measured by ph fall experiments and as a rate at ph 7.0. s. mutans produced more acid than s. sanguis as measured by either criterion, although statistically faster rates of acid production and lower terminal ph values were obtained when cells of both species were suspended in kcl rather than in nacl, with 200 mm kcl resulting in the lowest terminal ph in ph fall experiments. sodium ions inhibited acid production: 183 mm nacl reduced the glycolytic rates of s. mutans and s. sanguis  metabolizing glucose at ph 7.0 in 135 mm kcl by 39 and 33%, respectively. the most pronounced stimulatory effect of potassium on acid production was by washed  cells of s. sanguis that had been grown under arginine and under phosphate limitation. the ph fell by a further 0.86 and 1.21 ph units, respectively, and to below the critical ph for enamel demineralization when these cells were metabolizing glucose in 135 mm kcl compared with the same concentration of nacl.  this enhancement of acid production was not due to potassium translocation, as had been suggested previously, because no movement of potassium ions across the cell membrane could be detected. an alternative explanation is proposed in which  sodium ions are excluded from the cell at the expense of membrane energy, i.e., the proton motive force, which could otherwise be used for the transport of sugars.

TI  == oxygen toxicity in streptococcus sanguis. the relative importance of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis, whose growth appears to be independent of the availability of iron, makes no hemes, contains neither catalase nor peroxidase, and can accumulate millimolar concentration levels of h2o2 during aerobic growth. it possesses a single manganese-containing superoxide dismutase whose concentration  can be varied over a 50-100-fold range by manipulating the availability of oxygen during growth. cell extracts contain a soluble nadh-plumbagin diaphorase which mediates o2- production in vitro and presumably also in vivo. plumbagin increased oxygen consumption by s. sanguis and imposed an oxygen-dependent toxicity. cells  grown aerobically and containing elevated levels of superoxide dismutase were resistant to this toxicity. dimethyl sulfoxide, which was shown to permeate s. sanguis freely, was used as an indicating scavenger of oh. an in vitro enzymic source of o2- plus h2o2 generated formaldehyde from dimethyl sulfoxide, an indication of oh. production. either superoxide dismutase or catalase inhibited this oh. production and iron salts augmented it. intact, aerobic cells of s. sanguis also gave evidence of oh. production, in the presence of plumbagin, but all of it appeared to be generated outside the cells. in addition, 0.5 m dimethyl sulfoxide did not diminish the oxygen-dependent toxicity of plumbagin. we conclude that, in s. sanguis, o2- can exert a toxic effect independent of the production of oh..

(ii) gal beta (1 leads to 3)galnac alpha  och2c6h5 was the most potent beta-galactoside inhibitor; it had 20 times the potency of lactose. (iii) anionic nonaromatic amphipathic compounds were good inhibitors; sodium deoxycholate (i) was equal to lactose; sodium dodecyl sulfate  (ii) had 15 times the potency of lactose; there was 90 to 100% irreversible inhibition when t14v was treated with 0.005 m (ii). treatment of ss34 with ii had no effect. (iv) synergism of inhibition was observed between lactose and i or lactose and ii, e.g., inhibition by 0.01 m lactose = 5%; inhibition by 0.01 m i = 9%; inhibition by 0.01 m lactose + 0.01 m i = 87%. (v) the irreversible inhibition by ii was prevented when 0.25 m lactose or 0.25 m i was present during treatment of t14v with 0.005 m ii. (vi) synergism and prevention by lactose or by i of irreversible inhibition by ii suggest that all three react at the same site  on t14v lectin. we hypothesize that the t14v lectin combining site for ss34 carbohydrate has specific affinity for beta-galactosides and for anionic nonaromatic amphipathic molecules. this site can be saturated by either kind of reagent to exclude the other reagent or to inhibit coaggregation.

TI  == role of granulocytes in experimental streptococcus sanguis endocarditis.
AB  == we investigated the role of granulocytes during the induction and course of experimental streptococcus sanguis endocarditis in rabbits by depleting blood granulocytes with nitrogen mustard. the induction of the endocarditis was not influenced by granulocytopenia: the 50% infectious dose was 5.4 x 10(4) colony-forming units in normal and granulocytopenic rabbits. however, granulocytopenia influenced the curse of the endocarditis, as shown by a significant increase in the number of colony-forming units per gram of vegetation (p less than 0.02) from 24 to 72 h after the injection of 10(5) colony-forming units of s. sanguis. this rise did not occur in the control rabbits. furthermore, bacteremia was significantly higher in the granulocytopenic rabbits (p less than  0.05) during the first 48 h compared with the control rabbits. this was not because of altered clearance of the streptococcus inoculum or seeding of streptococci from extracardiac bacterial foci. we concluded that granulocytes have no measurable effect on the induction of s. sanguis endocarditis, but during the course of the endocarditis, granulocytes keep the endocardial infection in check.

TI  == microbial populations growing in the presence of fluoride at low ph isolated from dental plaque of children living in an area with fluoridated water.
AB  == longitudinal microbiological examinations have been made of dental plaque from a  site approximal to the upper central incisors of 10 8-year-old children living in an area with water fluoridation. differential counts of viable bacteria, made using a selective medium containing various levels of fluoride (0 to 100 mug/ml)  at ph levels of 7.0 to 5.5, demonstrated an effect of both ph and fluoride on the numbers and types of bacteria isolated. strains of streptococcus and neisseria grew after only 16 h of incubation at ph levels as low as 6.0 with fluoride levels up to 50 mug/ml. the most commonly isolated streptococci were streptococcus mitior and s. salivarius. s. mutans was isolated less frequently and was inhibited by 20 and 50 mug of fluoride per ml at ph 6.0 and 6.5, respectively. veillonella strains were the most resistant isolates, being isolated after 16 h of incubation on media at ph 6.0 with 100 mug of fluoride per ml. despite their known fluoride resistance, actinomyces spp. were often only detected on the selective media after 72 h of incubation. the ph of the medium had a definite selective effect, as the number of colonies growing on the fluoride-free basal media at ph 6.0 was only 30% of that at ph 7.0. representative strains of s. mutans, s. mitior, s. sanguis, and s. milleri were tested for their ability to utilize glucose at the ph and fluoride levels of the  medium on which they were initially isolated. fluoride reduced the initial glycolytic rate of the cells, but in 5 of the 13 strains tested the final amount  of glucose used after 2 h of incubation was the same in the presence or absence of fluoride. the isolation of bacteria capable of growth in the presence of fluoride over a significant portion of the ph range that occurs in plaque in vivo could explain in part the finding that fluoride does not have a dramatic effect on the plaque community. fluoride in plaque may reduce the ecological advantage afforded to aciduric s. mutans strains by carbohydrate substances. in the in vivo situation this could mean that, even with high carbohydrate intake, fluoride may  permit s. mitior to compete with s. mutans within the plaque ecosystem.

TI  == adsorption of lysozyme from human whole saliva by streptococcus sanguis 903 and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == several strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of micrococcus  lysodeikticus as the substrate. mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. the greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with s. sanguis (biotype i), serotype b of s. mutans, and the fresh s. salivarius isolates. the lowest mean depletion was noted with s. mitis (15%) and biotype ii s. sanguis (ca. 30%). the remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. in studies with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees c, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees c was very similar. on the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption  depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. the extent of adsorption, however, was independent of ph's of 3.9 to 8.3. when a low concentration of s. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20  mug of lysozyme added per ml. salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral  microorganisms (a. viscosus wvu 626 and wvu 627, s. sanguis 73x11, s. mutans bht, and s. salivarius ng) was similar to that of s. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees c. on the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. a comparison of ph and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis  903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (glcnac)(4) suggested that adsorption by s. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. the possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.

TI  == enzymatic modification of bacterial receptors on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == certain properties of experimental pellicles formed by the adsorption of salivary components on hydroxyapatite surfaces change over time. to determine whether enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment could induce such changes, pellicles were treated with saliva which had been incubated for 18 h at 35 degrees c to promote the elaboration of microbial enzymes. this treatment markedly reduced the numbers of streptococcus mutans mt3 and jbp and s. sanguis fc-1 and c5 cells which attached, but it had little or no effect on the attachment of s. mitis re7, actinomyces viscosus ly7 and ck-8, bacteroides gingivalis 381, or b. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius 581. heating the incubated saliva at 60 degrees c for 30 min partially reduced its pellicle-modifying activity, whereas heating at 80 degrees c for 30 min or 100 degrees c for 15 min completely eliminated such activity. this indicated that the saliva contained heat-labile substances, presumably enzymes, which could affect the pellicle receptors involved in the attachment of s. mutans and s. sanguis. treatment of saliva-treated hydroxyapatite with commercially obtained enzyme preparations also affected bacterial attachment. thus, treatment with galactose oxidase reduced the numbers of the s. mutans strains which attached, whereas treatment with neuraminidase reduced the adsorption of s. sanguis fc-1 but not that of s. sanguis c5. treatment with beta-glucosidase preparations derived from  almonds significantly reduced the attachment of all of the streptococcal strains  studied, but, when subjected to isoelectric fractionation, the adherence-inhibiting activity did not correlate directly with beta-glucosidase activity. treatment of the pellicles with trypsin or eight other glycosidases did not affect streptococcal attachment. exposure of the enzymatically modified pellicles to fresh saliva did not restore the streptococcal receptors. collectively, the data suggest that some bacterial receptors in the pellicle coating of teeth can be modified by enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment, and these interactions may affect oral bacterial ecology.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == oral flora of children with "nursing bottle caries".
AB  == s. mutans averaged about 60% of the total cultivable flora of dental plaque obtained from caries lesions, white spot margins of these lesions, or clinically-sound areas of upper anterior teeth, and averaged about 27% in plaque  from mostly clinically-sound areas of posterior teeth of six children with nursing bottle caries; its concentrations in saliva averaged about 10% of the total cultivable flora. nearly all of 107 isolated s. mutans strains belonged to  the serotype group c/e/f. the proportion of s. sanguis, in contrast to those of s. mutans, were very low in plaque from upper anterior teeth and higher in plaque from posterior teeth. the proportions of s. salivarius in saliva were unusually low, and this organism was not detected in the saliva of most subjects. lactobacilli were found in nearly all plaque samples; plaque and carious material from cavities contained higher levels than plaque associated with white spots or  clinically-sound tooth surfaces. the findings provide further support for the role of s. mutans in the initiation of human dental caries. in the case of lactobacilli, they support other evidence suggesting only the limited involvement of these organisms in the initiation of caries lesions, but a more extensive role in their progression. in addition, they clearly illustrate the marked effect of diet on the dental plaque flora.

TI  == effect of extracellular polysaccharides on diffusion of naf and [14c]-sucrose in  human dental plaque and in sediments of the bacterium streptococcus sanguis 804 (nctc 10904).
AB  == it has been postulated that extracellular polysaccharides form a barrier to diffusion in dental plaque. diffusion coefficients, d, were measured for naf and  [14c]-sucrose in glucan-free and glucan-containing sediments of strep. sanguis 804 at 37 degrees c. there was a tendency for naf and [14c]-sucrose to diffuse faster as the carbohydrate concentration in the sediments increased. naf diffused only 38 per cent more slowly in cell-free glucan sediment than in water, suggesting that glucan per se does not form a barrier to diffusion. the diffusion coefficient for naf was positively correlated with carbohydrate concentration in  individual plaque samples from 15 subjects and incubation of 3 plaque samples with sucrose resulted in both an increase in carbohydrate concentration in the plaque and an increase in d for naf. thus the presence of extracellular polysaccharides in plaque leads to slightly faster rates of diffusion. nevertheless, the total time for diffusion through plaque may be increased if the presence of extracellular polysaccharides results in thicker layers of plaque.

AB  == streptococcus sanguis is a major component of early dental plaque. the ability of s. sanguis to adhere to salivary pellicle appears to involve specific bacterial surface receptors. the nature of these receptors is still not known; however, the component molecules may be subject to environmental control as has been shown for teichoic acids and certain proteins. to study these environmental effects, a chemostat was employed to vary the growth conditions of streptococcus sanguis strain g9b. this strain has been used extensively to study the adhesion of [(3)h]thymidine-labeled batch-grown cells to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads.  the effects of dilution rate, ph, and carbon source on adhesion were studied with a competition assay in which the labeled batch cells were used as a reference standard. in this assay, cells from the chemostat were harvested and compared for their ability to inhibit adhesion of labeled cells relative to unlabeled control  batch-grown cells. subsequent studies used chemostat grown cells labeled with [(3)h]thymidine as a reference standard so that results were internally controlled and reflected only the particular alteration in environment which was  studied. these results indicated that when glucose was used as a growth-limiting  substrate, cells grown at relatively high dilution rates (d = 0.5 h(-1); mean generation time = 1.4 h) behaved similarly to batch-grown cells and appeared to compete for the same binding sites. cells grown at d = 0.1 h(-1) (mean generation time = 7 h) no longer competed with either batch-grown cells or chemostat cells grown at d = 0.5 h(-1). moreover, adsorption isotherms of such slow-growing cells (d = 0.1 h(-1)) suggested that binding was no longer specific. when fructose was  used as the growth-limiting carbohydrate, cells grown at d = 0.1 h(-1) did not show this loss of specificity and competed nearly as well as control batch-grown  glucose cells. however, the effect of ph appeared to be independent of carbohydrate source, because cells grown in either glucose or fructose at ph 5.5  at d = 0.1 h(-1) lost the ability to compete with reference batch or chemostat cells grown at d = 0.5 h(-1). this effect was very sharp, since cells grown in the ph range from 6 to 7.5 at d = 0.5 h(-1) competed nearly as well as control cells. a similar effect of ph was found for batch cultures grown with excess glucose. these studies reinforce the idea that the environment can profoundly affect the bacterial surface and consequently the ability of the organism to adhere, a property which appears to be a primary event in some infectious diseases and in dental plaque formation.

TI  == construction of plasmid vectors for gene cloning in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis.
AB  == the construction and some properties of new hybrid plasmids which are able to replicate in both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis are presented. a 5.5 md  hybrid plasmid pjp9 was constructed from pbr322 (tc, ap) and pub110 (nm) plasmids. pim1 (7.0 md) and pim3 (7.7 md) plasmids are its different erythromycin resistant derivatives. tetracycline, ampicillin, neomycin and possibly erythromycin resistance genes are expressed in e. coli while neomycin and erythromycin resistance genes are expressed in b. subtilis. insertional inactivation of only one gene is possible using the pjp9 plasmid as a vector in b. subtilis. however, insertional inactivation of at least two different genes can be achieved and monitored in e. coli and b. subtilis transformants in cloning experiments with pim1 and pim3 plasmids. insertional inactivation of antibiotic resistance genes present in pjp9 plasmid was achieved by cloning of streptococcus sanguis dna fragments generated by appropriate restriction endonucleases. the pjp9 plasmid and its derivatives were found to be stable in both hosts cells.

TI  == positive coooperativity in the binding of streptococcus sanguis to hydroxylapatite.
AB  == the adherence of streptococcus sanguis to hydroxylapatite beads has been analyzed by binding isotherms, langmuir isotherms, and scatchard plots. for saliva-coated  beads, the scatchard curves contained components with both positive and negative  slopes. the results are interpreted as evidence for positive cooperativity in the binding process. although all scatchard curves were similar in shape, distinct differences were observed between saliva samples from different individuals. salivary agglutinins against whole s. sanguis cells did not appear to influence the shapes of the curves or the extent of adherence. in addition, different strains of s. sanguis yielded similar scatchard plots. when the binding of s. sanguis to buffer-coated hydroxylapatite beads was analyzed by scatchard plots or binding isotherms, curves were generated which suggested that either direct ligand-ligand or nonspecific interactions were occurring. hill plots of the adherence data yielded curves with slopes greater than unity for saliva-coated beads, providing additional support for the view that the interactions between s. sanguis and the pellicle involve cooperative phenomena. in contrast, a hill plot  for the binding data of s. sanguis to buffer-coated hydroxylapatite beads gave a  curve with a slope of 0.91 +/- 0.07, suggesting negative cooperativity or limited specificity. when adherence data were plotted by the langmuir method, curves were obtained which could not discriminate between the binding of the bacteria to the  hydroxylapatite beads coated with either saliva or buffer. it was also observed that several different proteins and whole saliva tended to inhibit adherence. scatchard plots, however, describing the binding of s. sanguis to the proteincoated beads were unique and revealed possible specific and nonspecific interactions. scatchard analyses of binding data may be useful in understanding the mechanism(s) of adherence of streptococci to smooth surfaces.

TI  == enolases from fluoride-sensitive and fluoride-resistant streptococci.
AB  == the enolase from a highly fluoride-sensitive strain of streptococcus salivarius and its fluoride-resistant mutant, as well as those from strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans with intermediate and low sensitivities to fluoride have been shown to be inhibited by fluoride. comparisons of the purified, strain-specific enzymes showed a high degree of similarity for all preparations. the michaelis constants for the substrate 2-phosphoglycerate were 1.3 x 10(-4) to 2.4 x 10(-4) m, ph optima were 7.3 to 7.7, and mg2+ optima were 2 meq/liter for all. inhibition by fluoride required the presence of inorganic phosphate and was competitive in nature, and the calculated modified inhibition indices were found to be in the range from 3.3 x 10(-14) to 5.8 x 10(-14) m4. percent inhibitions were determined under standardized conditions (0.16 mm naf, 2 mm mgso4, 0.5 mm pi, and 0.5 mm 2-phosphoglycerate) and were found to range from  53.3 to 65.9% for all of the purified enzymes. the differences do not appear to be meaningful metabolically. inhibition was reduced to about 14% at ph 6.0. from  the similarities in the behavior of the strain-specific enzymes it is concluded that the differences in the glycolytic sensitivities of the different strains of  streptococci to fluoride are not the consequence of any kinetic differences between the respective enolases.

TI  == sucrose-induced ecological response of experimental dental plaques from caries-free and caries-susceptible human volunteers.
AB  == microbial succession, experimental cariogenicity, and sucrose metabolism were examined in dental plaques which developed on sterile bovine enamel inserts in acrylic palatal appliances. the appliances were worn for a period of 14 days by 10 caries-free and 10 caries-susceptible human volunteers. three of six enamel inserts on each appliance were exposed extraorally to 10% sucrose in 0.85% saline six times a day, and three were exposed simultaneously to 0.85% saline as a control environment. the responses of the plaques to the high-sucrose environment in both caries status populations were compared. in all plaques, exposure to 10%  sucrose stimulated the succession of veillonella spp., lactobacillus spp., streptococcus salivarius, and, to a lesser extent, streptococcus mutans and a decline in levels of streptococcus sanguis, neisseria spp., and gram-negative anaerobic rods. plaques from caries-free mouths, in contrast to those from caries-susceptible mouths, harbored higher levels of veillonella spp., gram-negative anaerobic rods, and neisseria spp. and lower levels of lactobacillus spp. sucrose-exposed plaques from caries-free mouths also induced less enamel microhardness changes and formed less lactic acid from [14c]sucrose during a 60-min incubation at 37 degrees c than did comparable plaques from caries-susceptible mouths. the experiments revealed consistent differences in the ecological response to a cariogenic substrate environment in plaques from the two populations, with plaques from caries-free subjects exhibiting less cariogenic potential than those from caries-susceptible subjects.

TI  == bacteremia caused by viridans streptococci in 71 children.
AB  == a review of the hospital records of 71 patients from whose blood viridans streptococci were isolated showed that in 13 cases the patient's illness was definitely related to the bacteremia: 4 patients had endocarditis, 3 had pneumonia, 2 had peritonitis and 1 each had meningitis, a scalp wound infection,  sinusitis and otitis media. the bacteremia may have contributed to the two deaths among these 13 patients. in 45 cases the viridans streptococci may have contributed to the patient's illness: 15 patients had an infection of the lower respiratory tract and 7 an infection of the upper respiratory tract, 8 were neonates with suspected septicemia, 3 had soft tissue infections, 3 had leukemia  and sepsis, and 9 had miscellaneous infections; the bacteremia was unrelated to the two deaths in this group. in another 13 cases the viridans streptococci could not be related to the patient's illness. the species most frequently isolated were streptococcus mitis, s. sanguis ii and s. mg-intermedius. the outcome of the bacteremia was generally good, even among the 11 patients not treated with antibiotics. when viridans streptococci are cultured from a single blood sample,  further samples of blood and, if feasible, specimens from the associated focus of infection should be obtained for culture; further blood cultures are especially important in cases of suspected endocarditis.

TI  == bacterial adhesion in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. effect of subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations on streptococcal adhesion in vitro and the development of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (nbte) is important in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. subinhibitory concentrations (submic) of some antibiotics decrease bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells in vitro. we utilized an in vitro assay system to study the effect of submic of various antibiotics on streptococcal adhesion to a fibrin-platelet matrix (simulating nbte). the results were (a) bacterial adhesion of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus faecalis to nbte was significantly reduced by vancomycin, penicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and streptomycin (p less than 0.01 vs. controls) but not rifampin or trimethoprimsulfametrole; (b) the effect was dose-dependent and increased with duration of exposure to antibiotic; (c) reduction in bacterial adhesion did not correlate with altered retention by hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. this reduction in adhesion correlated with a diminished capacity of submic exposed streptococcus sanguis (1/4 vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) x 4 h) to produce endocarditis in vivo. after intravenous inoculation of 10(6) colony-forming units of preincubated organisms into rabbits with traumatized aortic valves, 6 of 22 developed endocarditis vs. 17 of 22 controls (p = 0.03). these results may be relevant to prophylaxis of endocarditis since exposure of bacteria to submic of various antibiotics may reduce bacterial adherence both, to mucosal surfaces, and to damaged cardiac valves.

TI  == vancomycin prophylaxis of experimental streptococcus sanguis. inhibition of bacterial adherence rather than bacterial killing.
AB  == using a strain of streptococcus sanguis tolerant to vancomycin to infect aortic vegetations in rats, we found that prophylactic intravenous vancomycin given 30 min before bacterial challenge decreased the incidence of endocarditis from 88 to 8% (p less than 10(-5)). because peak vancomycin serum levels were below the minimal bactericidal concentration, mechanisms of protection other than bacterial killing were investigated. s. sanguis were incubated with inhibitory concentration of vancomycin (50 microgram/ml) for 10 h and washed. 85% of rats (73/86) inoculated with control bacteria developed endocarditis, whereas only 42% (33/78) of those inoculated with vancomycin-exposed bacteria did so (p less than  10(-5)). when rats were killed 30 min after bacterial challenge, s. sanguis were  detected by culture of the vegetations in 44% of rats injected with control bacteria, but in only 13% of those challenged with vancomycin-exposed bacteria (p less than 0.03). enhanced clearance of vancomycin-exposed streptococci was not responsible for this protection because blood cultures showed no difference in the level and duration of bacteremia after injection of control or vancomycin-exposed s. sanguis. moreover, this protection was not abolished in neutropenic rats injected with vancomycin-exposed bacteria, despite more prolonged bacteremia. these results suggest that vancomycin exerted its protection by lowering adherence of tolerant s. sanguis to vegetations rather than through bactericidal activity or enhanced clearance of bacteria by phagocytic cells. in the choice of antibiotics for prophylaxis of endocarditis, reduction of bacterial adhesion may be a criterion as important as bacterial killing.

TI  == new method that uses binding of immunoglobulin a to group a streptococcal immunoglobulin a fc receptors for demonstration of microbial immunoglobulin a protease activity.
AB  == a new method is described for the detection of bacterial immunoglobulin a (iga) protease which splits iga into fab and fc fragments. the method takes advantage of a recent finding that receptors for iga fragments occur commonly among type 4  group a streptococci. the bacterial preparation to be tested for protease activity was first incubated with radiolabeled purified iga1 myeloma protein, and the proportion of radioactivity bound to a standard suspension of the streptococci was then measured. since isolated fab fragments do not bind to streptococcal iga receptors, a decrease in the amount of radioactivity bound to the streptococci, as compared with the amount before digestion, indicates the presence of protease in the test preparation. using this method, protease activity was detected in neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus sanguis, but  not in escherichia coli or branhamella catarrhalis.

TI  == secretory immunity and the bacterial iga proteases.
AB  == the characteristics and functions of microbial iga proteases are reviewed. these  enzymes represent a structurally heterogeneous group of proteins that are secreted into the extracellular environment by bacteria capable of causing human  disease. the iga proteases, which vary in their requirements for metal ions, are  neutral endopeptidases whose role in the infectious process is not known but whose pronounced substrate specificity for human proteins of the iga1 subclass has repeatedly been demonstrated. as reagents, the iga proteases are useful in cleaving iga molecules to yield intact fc alpha and fab alpha fragments that will allow the study of the structure and function of the two large regions of iga immunoglobulin proteins. the role, if any, of these enzymes in promoting infection by pathogenic members of the genera neisseria, hemophilus, and streptococcus is not known, although the secretory immune system is primarily mediated by antibodies of the iga isotype, among which are iga1 subclass proteins, and these proteins are susceptible to cleavage by iga protease. the determination of the role of these enzymes in the pathogenesis of human infection must await clearer understanding of antigenicity and antibody function at secretory sites and of the relative roles of the two subclasses of human iga in immune defense.

AB  == two new media were developed, containing only the dialyzable components of todd hewitt broth (th) with (medium ii) or without (medium iv) inactivated horse serum. the two media were used to detect activity of the competence factor (cf) and the competence factor inactivator (cgi) of streptococcus sanguis, and in preliminary experiments of cf isolation. because all the dissolved substances with molecular weight (mol. wt.) less than 12,000 can be removed from these media by dialysis, leaving the cf and possible other high mol. wt. substances formed by growth in the dialysis tube, the use of these media should facilitate the isolation of cf and other high mol. wt. substances involved in genetic transformation of s. sanguis. dialysis experiments suggest a mol. wt. greater than 12,000 of the cfs of the strains challis and 13b. the cf of strain 13b was further isolated by sephadex gel filtration and was eluted in the fractions of low mol. wt. compounds.

TI  == genetic transformation in streptococcus sanguis. competence factor and competence factor inactivator.
AB  == genetic transformation in streptococcus sanguis is a complex, multi-step process, involving several factors. the competence factor (cf), occurring in the culture filtrates of some strains, is essential in streptococcal transformation, but other factors are also involved. the presence of serum during growth is not obligatory for the preparation of active culture filtrate, but serum increases the amount and duration of cf activity of some strains. the stability of the cf activity differs distinctly in filtrates prepared from various strains. this observation can be explained by the presence of a previously undescribed factor--names the competence factor inactivator (cfi)--which inactivates the cf in culture filtrates during the transforming experiment as well as during storage. the cfi is thermolabile and is estimated from the filtrates by heating (65 degrees c for 15 min). the properties of the cfi suggest that it may be a protein with enzymatic activity. the cfs from the strains challis and 13b resist  heating to 100 degrees c for 2 h, and are stable for at least 72 h if the cfi is  absent or has been inactivated by heating. the cf activity in the filtrates is inactivated by pronase and chymotrypsin, suggesting that the cf may be of a polypeptide nature.

TI  == role of streptococcus sanguis (strain wicky) cell surface-located deoxyribonucleic acid-binding factor in transformation of a homologous strain.
AB  == in a previous report we demonstrated the presence of a factor binding deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) in vitro (bf) in cell leakage fluids from transformable streptococcus sanguis strains wicky, challis, and blackburn. bf originating from strain wicky was purified to homogeneity, and its properties are described. in this work, it was found that bf occurs at the surface of wicky cells in two forms, loosely bound (lb-bf) and strongly bound to the cell envelope. it was demonstrated that lb-bf formed fast-sedimenting complexes with exogenous dna at the surface of wicky cells. about 10-fold-more dna became associated as a fast-sedimenting complex in competent than in incompetent cells.  thus, lb-bf is a cell receptor for exogenous dna. however, the comparison of the  effects of some agents on the transformation yield and the formation of lb-bf-dna complexes, showed that the influence of these agents on both observed phenomena is not parallel and may be even opposite. these results are interpreted to mean that the lb-bf-dna complexes do not take part in transformation. the problem of participation of bf strongly bound with the cell membrane fraction remains to be  elucidated.

TI  == lectin-like constituents of foods which react with components of serum, saliva, and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == hot and cold aqueous extracts were prepared from 22 commonly ingested fruits, vegetables, and seeds. when tested by agar diffusion, extracts from 13 and 10 of  the foods formed precipitin bands with samples of normal rabbit serum and human saliva, respectively; extracts from four of the foods also reacted with antigen extracts of strains of streptococcus mutans. when added to rabbit antiserum, extracts from 18 of 21 foods tested inhibited reactivity with antigen extracts derived from s. mutans mt3. extracts from 16 foods agglutinated whole s. mutans cells, whereas those from 10 foods agglutinated human erythrocytes of blood types a and b. the lectin-like activities of extracts which reacted with human saliva were studied further. pretreatment of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) beads with extracts of bananas, coconuts, carrots, alfalfa, and sunflower seeds markedly reduced the subsequent adsorption of s. mutans mt3. pretreatment of s-ha with banana extract also strongly inhibited adsorption of s. mutans h12 and s. sanguis c1, but it had little effect on attachment of actinomyces naeslundii l13  or a. viscosus ly7. absorption experiments indicated that the component(s) in banana extract responsible for inhibiting streptococcal adsorption to s-ha was identical to that which bound to human erythrocytes. the banana hemagglutinin exhibited highest activity between ph 7 and 8, and it was inhibited by high concentrations of glucosamine, galactosamine, and, to a lesser extent, mannosamine. other sugars tested had no effect. the selective bacterial adsorption-inhibiting effect noted for banana extract was also observed in studies with purified lectins. thus, pretreating s-ha with wheat germ agglutinin  and concanavalin a inhibited adsorption of s. mutans mt3 cells, whereas peanut agglutinin, ulex agglutinin, dolichos agglutinin, and soybean agglutinin had little effect; none of these lectins affected attachment of a. viscosus ly7. collectively, the observations suggest that many foods contain lectins which can  interact with components of human saliva and s. mutans cells. because of their potential to influence host-parasite interactions in the mouth and elsewhere in the gastrointestinal canal, these reactions warrant further study.

TI  == adherence of streptococcus sanguis clinical isolates to smooth surfaces and interactions of the isolates with streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis isolated from human dental plaque were grown in todd-hewitt broth. cells were collected by centrifugation and lyophilized after extensive washing with water. the cell-associated glucosyltransferase (gtase) activities of s. sanguis strains were assayed with [14c]sucrose. strain differences in gtase activity were significant within the same serotype or biotype or both. the ability of s. sanguis cells to adhere to smooth glass surfaces was generally weak, irrespective of significant cell-associated gtase activity synthesizing water-insoluble, gel-like glucans. resting cells of most s. sanguis strains bound extracellular gtase from streptococcus mutans strain b13 (serotype d), resulting  in the strong adherence of the s. sanguis cells to smooth glass surfaces in the presence of sucrose. conversely, s. mutans b13 cells also could bind extracellular gtase from some strains of s. sanguis examined. the sucrose-dependent adherence of s. mutans cells was not altered, although s. sanguis strains from which the extracellular gtases were obtained did not produce significant adherence in the presence of sucrose. in view of these findings, it was suggested that s. mutans gtase could affect the adherence of s. sanguis to smooth tooth surfaces in the oral cavity.

TI  == effect of bacterial aggregation on the adherence of oral streptococci to hydroxyapatite.
AB  == several in vitro assay systems to measure the adherence of human dental plaque bacteria to solid surfaces such as teeth, glass, and hydroxyapatite have been published. in many studies a variety of macromolecular solutes have been used to  study the adherence process. often these solutes are able to aggregate the test bacterial and thus may alter the outcome of adherence experiments. in this study, the effects of the aggregation of streptococcus sanguis on adherence to spheroidal hydroxyapatite is described. adherence of preformed aggregates and of  bacteria which were aggregating during the adherence reaction was examined. bacteria were aggregated with whole saliva, concanavalin a, and wheat germ lectin. further effects of the coaggregation of s. mitis and actinomyces viscosus to saliva-coated spheroidal hydroxyapatite are presented. these studies suggest that formation of large aggregates resulted in a decrease in the numbers of organisms which adhered. in contrast, the formation of small aggregates actually  increased the numbers of bacteria that adhered. all increases in adherent bacteria occurred at low concentrations of aggregating substance in which visible bacterial aggregation was not evident. the data indicate that adequate dose-response experiments must be performed to ensure that solutes used as probes to study adherence mechanisms do not affect the adherence simply as a result of aggregation of the test microorganisms.

TI  == interference of secretory immunoglobulin a with sorption of oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite.
AB  == the potential of secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) to interfere with the initial phase of dental plaque formation was studied by using an in vitro method which permits the quantitative determination of the sorption of radiolabeled oral bacterial cells to hydroxyapatite (ha) beads. the importance of specific s-iga antibodies was evaluated by a comparison of the effect of pure preparations of colostral s-iga, polymeric myeloma iga, or preabsorbed s-iga. specific antibody molecules bound at the ha surface significantly enhanced the sorption of two streptococcus sanguis strains. in contrast, ha-bound s-iga antibodies inhibited the sorption of streptococcus mitior and streptococcus salivarius. the same was true for streptococcus mutans cells, but only when they were propagated in the absence of sucrose. suspended in saliva, cells of all streptococcal species adhered in significantly lower numbers to ha. comparative experiments with bacteria suspended in solutions of various preparations of iga or immunoglobulin-deficient salivas with s-iga or myeloma iga added indicated that the adherence inhibition seen with s. sanguis, s. mitior, s. salivarius, and glucose-grown s. mutans was partly attributable to functions of s-iga antibodies. under the in vitro conditions of the study, s-iga antibodies had no effect on the sorption of sucrose-grown s. mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii to ha. the results indicated that s-iga can interfere with the sorption of some oral bacteria to ha by several different functions.

TI  == ecology and nature of immunoglobulin a1 protease-producing streptococci in the human oral cavity and pharynx.
AB  == the identity and proportional distribution of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease-producing streptococci in the oral and pharyngeal microflora were studied. a collection of 459 streptococcal strains, including reference strains of streptococcus species, and fresh isolates from human dental plaque and buccal  and pharyngeal mucosa were identified by biochemical means and were examined for  iga1 protease production. iga1 protease production was demonstrated in some, but  not all, strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitior and in a group of strains of uncertain taxonomic affiliation. the property was not associated with particular biotypes within the two species. strains of s. sanguis and s. mitior isolated from macaca fascicularis also cleaved human iga1. a significantly different proportion of streptococcal populations in different ecosystems produced iga1 protease. the enzyme was released by 62.7% of streptococcal isolates from buccal mucosa in contrast to only 7.8% from pharyngeal mucosa. in samples from initial and mature dental plaque 38 to 40% of streptococcal isolates produced iga1 protease. this difference was largely a result of the frequency by  which iga1 protease activity was present in s. mitior, the predominant streptococcal species in all samples. among otherwise identical isolates of s. mitior, 67.8% from buccal mucosa in contrast to only 5.9% from pharyngeal mucosa  produced iga1 protease. the results indicate that iga1 protease may confer an ecological advantage to streptococci colonizing surfaces exposed to a secretory iga-mediated selection pressure.

TI  == pulmonary clearance and phagocytic cell response to normal pharyngeal flora.
AB  == because human lungs are repetitively inoculated with the normal bacterial flora of the pharynx, we determined the pulmonary clearance of representative species after aerosol inoculation of a murine model, and characterized the phagocytic cell response by bronchoalveolar lavage. viable bacteria remaining in the lungs at 1, 2, and 4 h were: streptococcus sanguis, 24%, 8%, and 1%; streptococcus salivarius, 49%, 24%, and 5%; neisseria catarrhalis, 69%, 49%, and 22%. clearance of streptococcus sanguis was associated with a twofold increase in alveolar macrophages (p less than 0.05); streptococcus salivarius evoked a doubling of alveolar macrophages and a 20-fold rise in granulocytes (p less than 0.05); the response to neisseria catarrhalis was a 400-fold increase in granulocytes (p less than 0.05). thus, normal pharyngeal organisms are cleared rapidly from the lung by a dual phagocytic cell system. it is speculated that bacteria-phagocyte interaction allows the possibility of lung injury from proteolytic enzymes released from either set of phagocytes.

TI  == effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == we examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (s. mitis, a. viscosus, s. aureus, e. coli). we observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. heat treatment (80 degrees c, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. supplementation of saliva  with h(2)o(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. s. mitis and a. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by h(2)o(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by s. mutans and s. mitis required ca. 10 mum h(2)o(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. loss of the inhibitory action of saliva  occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. supplementation of saliva dilutions with scn(-) and h(2)o(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca.  0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. we suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and scn(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. the resistance of a. viscosus, s. aureus, and e. coli to the inhibitory potential of  saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. the resistance of s. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on h(2)o(2) accumulation by this organism compared with s. mutans and s. sanguis. the basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. the role of  the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.

AB  == oral strains of fusobacterium nucleatum showed haemagglutination (ha) of sheep red blood cells and attachment of ha-active f. nucleatum fragments to other microorganisms allowed a means of studying microbial surface interactions. ha-active sonicated fragments (sf) prepared from f. nucleatum were mixed with whole cell suspensions of 48 bacterial strains and, after incubation, the whole cells were separated from the non-absorbed fragments by differential centrifugation. attachment of f. nucleatum fragments to the cells was indicated by a reduction in the ha activity of the sf in the supernatant fluid remaining after absorption with whole cells. ha activity of the microbial cells used for absorption and the detection of f. nucleatum fragments on these cells by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique provided further evidence of attachment.  of the 48 strains tested, 10 absorbed f. nucleatum ha-active fragments. they included bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides fragilis subsp. distasonis, bacteroides corrodens, streptococcus morbillorum, streptococcus sanguis (blackburn and jc 74) and streptococcus mutans aht, bht, 10449 and 6715. chelators revealed that f. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a ca2+-dependent interaction. sugar inhibition demonstrated that f. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a d-galactose-containing moiety on their surface. a reduction in the absorption of f. nucleatum ha-active fragments by strep. mutans grown in a higher concentration of sucrose was observed.

TI  == genetic study of plasmid-associated zonal resistance to lincomycin in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the phenomenon of zonal resistance to lincomycin, which is characteristic of most clinical isolates with lincomycin resistance in streptococcus pyogenes, has been  studied. these strains grow within a defined concentration range of lincomycin (approximately 60 to 200 microgram/ml), or at lincomycin concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentration for susceptible strains. it is shown that the zonal growth phenomenon is a stable phenotype and results from induction of resistance only within the zonal concentration range of lincomycin. these strains also possess inducible resistance to erythromycin which is nonzonal in character. one-step mutations to constitutive resistance have been isolated which are of two types: constitutive for lincomycin or for erythromycin, but not for both. those strains with constitutive erythromycin resistance retain their zonal resistance for lincomycin. mutants doubly constitutive for both lincomycin and erythromycin  can be obtained by a second mutational step from either of the singly constitutive mutants. satellite deoxyribonucleic acid has been shown to be present in the zonal resistant strains. a plasmid, psm10419, of 14.9 megadaltons, has been isolated from one of the doubly constitutive mutants and used to jointly transform streptococcus sanguis strain challis to constitutive resistance to both lincomycin and erythromycin. from this, a multicopy plasmid of reduced size, psm10 (5.4 megadaltons), which retains its resistance phenotype, has been isolated and mapped with restriction endonucleases hindiii (three sites), ecori (one site), kpni (one site), and hpai (one site). the staphylococcal plasmid pc221 (2.9 megadaltons; chloramphenicol resistant) has been fused to psm10 at the ecori site resulting in a chimeric plasmid, psm10221 (8.3 megadaltons), which retains resistance to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and lincomycin. psm10 is therefore suggestive as an effective cloning vehicle for the genus streptococcus.

AB  == transformation of streptococcus sanguis (challis) by antibiotic resistance plasmids has shown that (a) competence developed with identical kinetics for chromosomal and plasmid dna; (b) dependence of transformant yield on plasmid dna  concentration was second order; (c) open circular plasmid dna transformed challis, although at reduced frequency, (d) linearization of plasmid dna by restriction enzymes cutting at unique sites inactivated the transforming capacity; (e) transforming activity was restored when linear plasmid molecules generated by different restriction enzymes were mixed; (f) restoration of transforming activity depended on the distance between the linearizing cuts, i.e. on the presence of sufficiently long overlapping homologous sequences; (g) when linear deletion mutants were mixed with linear parental plasmids the smaller plasmid was restored with significantly higher frequency. based on these data, a  model for plasmid transformation of challis is proposed according to which circular plasmid is linearized during binding and uptake. one dna strand enters the cell and restoration of circular plasmids inside the cell occurs by annealing of complementary single strands from two different donor molecules. implications  of this model for recombinant dna experiments in streptococci are discussed.

AB  == streptococcal plasmid pgb301 is an in vivo rear ranged plasmid with interesting properties and potential for the molecular cloning of genes in streptococci. transformation of s. sanguis (challis) with the group b streptococcal plasmid pip501 (29.7 kb) gave rise to the deletion derivative pgb301 (9.8 kb, copy number 10) which retained the multiple resistance phenotype of its ancestor (inducible mls-resistance, chloramphenicol resistance). among the eight restriction endonucleases used to physically map pgb301 were four that cleaved the plasmid at single sites yielding either sticky (hpaii, kpni) or blunt-ends (hpai, haeiii/bspri). passenger dna derived from larger streptococcal plasmids (psf351c61, 69.5 kb; pip800, 71 kb) was successfully inserted into the hpaii site and, by blunt-end cloning into the haeiii/bspri site. the gentamicin/kanamycin resistance gene of pip800 was expressed by recombinant plasmids carrying the insert in either orientation. insertion of passenger dna into the haeiii/bspri site (but not the hpaii site) caused instability of adjacent pgb301 sequences which were frequently deleted, thereby removing the chloramphenicol resistance phenotype. the vector pgb301 has a remarkable capacity for passenger dna (inserts up to 7 kb) and the property of instability and loss of a resistance phenotype following insertion of passenger dna into the haeiii/bspri site should facilitate the identification of cloned segments of dna when using this plasmid in molecular cloning experiments.

TI  == molecular cloning in streptococci: physical mapping of the vehicle plasmid psm10  and demonstration of intergroup dna transfer.
AB  == the streptococcal resistance plasmid psm10 (8.3 kb), a deletion derivative of psm10419 (22.9 kb) determining constitutive erythromycin and lincomycin resistance, was physically mapped with the restriction endonucleases avai, avaii, ecori, hpai, kpni, pvuii (one site each), hindiii, haeii (three sites each), hincii (four sites), and hhai (five sites). using the cryptic plasmid pva318 as cloning vehicle, the largest hindiii fragment of psm10 (3.3 kb) was shown to contain the erythromycin/lincomycin resistance gene(s) of the plasmid. the avaii  site of psm10 proved to be suitable as a site for cloning avaii-generated chromosomal dna fragments from a group c streptococcal strain in the challis strain of streptococcus sanguis (group) h). a detailed physical map of the chimeric plasmid psm10221 (12.8 kb), a fusion product of psm10 and the staphylococcal chloramphenicol resistance plasmid pc221 (4.5 kb), is also presented. the plasmid chimera has properties making it potentially useful in development of a doubly selective streptococcal cloning vehicle by searching for  insertional inactivation.

TI  == identification of tetracycline-resistant r-plasmids in streptococcus agalactiae (group b).
AB  == in this report, 30 tetracycline-resistant clinical isolates of group b streptococcus were examined to assess the extent to which tetracycline resistance is plasmid mediated. of these, 27 showed no physical or genetic evidence of plasmid-mediated resistance; however, one conjugative and two small (3.5 x 10(6)-dalton) multicopy non-self-transmissible tetracycline resistance plasmids were identified. the conjugative plasmid was transmissible to streptococcus faecalis as well as to streptococcus agalactiae (group b). the two nonconjugative plasmids were readily mobilized by a number of sex factors into these same two backgrounds and, in addition, readily transformed streptococcus sanguis challis to tetracycline resistance. due to readily available sites for several site-specific endonuycleases, these small, multicopy plasmids should prove useful as cloning vehicles in this host system.

AB  == measurements were made of the rates at which continuously cultured streptococcus  sanguis nctc 7868 cells accumulated on the inside surfaces of narrow glass capillaries from suspensions of the bacteria flowing down the capillaries at different velocities. initially, the rate of accumulation of bacteria on the clean walls of the capillary was rapid. the deposition rate decreased with time,  however, resulting in a saturation coverage of the glass surface which was considerably less than a monolayer. multilayer coverage of the tube surface by bacteria was only achieved when fresh nutrient was pumped over deposited cells. this was attributed to cell growth. although theoretical considerations of the deposition of small particles on to the walls of a tube suggest that the initial  deposition rate should increase with flow rate, this was not the case with cells  grown at dilution rates of 0.2 and 0.5 h-1. it is suggested that this can be explained by a polymer bridging mechanism of attachment.

TI  == switches in macromolecular synthesis during induction of competence for transformation of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the induction of synchronous development of competence for genetic transformation in streptococcus sanguis, by either endogenous or exogenous competence factor (cf), is manifested in the transient synthesis of a new set of at least 10 polypeptides, ranging from 14,000 to 51,000 in molecular weight. eight polypeptides (e14, e16, e24, e28, e32, e37, e44, e51) appear early, and two polypeptides (l34, l42) appear 5-10 min later. one of the newly synthesized early polypeptides, e16, is shown to be a component of the presynaptic complex containing single-stranded dna that is produced in vivo upon uptake of native donor dna. concomitant with this induced synthesis of competence-specific polypeptides there is a net decrease in rna and protein synthesis but no change in dna synthesis; donor dna-binding ability and transformability reach maxima during the phase of diminishing macromolecular synthesis. subsequently, donor dna-binding ability and transformability decay at disproportionate rates as cells return to the normal state of macromolecular synthesis within one generation. coincident with the induction of competence, the synthesis of a new rna transcript of high molecular weight appears to be induced which continues during  the restricted phase of total cellular rna synthesis.

TI  == interaction of parotid saliva basic glycoprotein with streptococcus sanguis atcc  10557.
AB  == it is postulated that an initial step in dental plaque formation is the adherence of oral bacteria to the salivary pellicle. recently, we have found that a proline-rich and basic glycoprotein (mgp) from human parotid saliva, which is successfully purified by concanavalin a-sepharose affinity chromatography, binds  to some oral streptococci such as s. mitis and s. sanguis. this paper deals with  some inhibitors which affect the binding of the mgp to s. sanguis atcc 10557. the assay for the binding ability of the radioactive mgp to the bacterial cells was performed by incubation of the reaction mixture containing 10 microgram of [3h]mgp (6000 dpm) and about 4.5 mg of bacterial cells (dry weight) in 0.5 ml of  0.05 m tris-hcl buffer containing 0.05 m nacl, ph 8.0 with a final volume of 0.51 ml. after 1 hour standing at 4 degrees c, the cells were washed five times with the same buffer. the resulting sediment was solubilized in 0.5 ml of ncs tissue solubilizer and the radioactivity was measured. the binding of the radioactive mgp to bacterial cells was specifically inhibited by galactose, lactose and n-acetyllactosamine. applications of heat and trypsin on the cell surface, strikingly reduced the binding ability. these findings strongly suggested that a  lectin-like substance may be present on the bacterial cell surface.

TI  == quantitative in vitro assay for "corncob" formation.
AB  == the interaction of bacterionema matruchotii with strains of streptococcus sanguis produces a structure which morphologically resembles a corncob. to determine the  specific bacterial surface receptors involved in the interaction, we developed a  quantitative assay. the assay consisted of mixing saline suspensions of [ch(3)-(3)h]thymidine-labeled streptococci and b. matruchotii, incubating at 37 degrees c for 2 h, and filtering the mixture through a 5-mum polycarbonate membrane filter. the free cocci and filaments passed through the filter, but the  corncobs were retained. estimates of the number of corncobs formed were obtained  by quantitating the radioactivity retained on the membranes relative to that of controls of streptococci alone. although saturation of the bacterionema occurred  at a ratio of streptococci to bacterionema of 10:1 (klett units), a 2:1 ratio was chosen because of the increased sensitivity of the assay at this ratio. the percentage of streptococci binding at this ratio was 18.6 +/- 8.1 (standard deviation). all five bacterionema strains tested formed corncobs; in contrast, only three strains of s. sanguis were positive. these were serotype 1 strains which had localized surface "fuzz." although scanning electron microscopic observations revealed an almost random distribution of cocci along the filament surface, transmission electron microscopy revealed that the streptococci were attached to the bacterionema by the surface fuzz. no differences in corncob formation were observed in sodium phosphate buffer, ph 6 to 8, at phosphate concentrations ranging from 0.005 to 0.05 m. concentrations of nacl or kcl up to  0.25 m did not affect corncob formation, and low concentrations of cacl(2) increased corncob formation slightly, whereas mgcl(2), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and citrate buffers reduced the number of streptococci binding to the filaments. these results suggest that divalent cations may play a role in this process.

AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

(j. bacteriol. 124:225-231, 1975), we have been able to introduce phenotypically cryptic plasmids from streptococcus ferus (formerly streptococcus mutans subsp. ferus) into streptococcus sanguis by genetic transformation. in this system, the  entry of the cryptic plasmids is selected indirectly. this is effected with transforming deoxyribonucleic acid mixtures in which the cryptic plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid is present in an approximate 10-fold molar excess with respect to a plasmid (pva1) known to confer erythromycin resistance. under such conditions, 5 to 10% of the pva1-containing erythromycin-resistant transformants  were cotransformed with cryptic plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid. pva1 may be selectively eliminated by growth of its s. sanguis host strain at 42 degrees c, enabling the construction of isogenic strains with and without s. ferus cryptic plasmids. comparative physiological studies of such strains have failed to reveal any plasmid-conferred phenotypes in s. sanguis. with this procedure, we have been able to physically separate two small cryptic plasmids (2.4 x 10(6) and 2.8 x 10(6) daltons) of s. ferus. although these plasmids were found naturally to exist in a single s. ferus host, they were able to replicate independently of one another in s. sanguis. restriction enzyme fingerprinting indicated that these plasmids did not share a common ancestry.

TI  == in vitro development of chlorhexidine resistance in streptococcus sanguis and its transmissibility by genetic transformation.
AB  == three chlorhexidine-sensitive strains of streptococcus sanguis developed resistance to chlorhexidine when grown as continuous cultures in a fermenter containing medium with increasing concentrations of the drug. the mic of the test strains increased by between two and three dilution steps and these high values were maintained after daily transfer in drug-free medium for at least 15 d. in addition, the resistance of one of the strains persisted for more than 1 month of continuous growth in drug-competent sensitive s. sanguis to increased chlorhexidine resistance, thus proving that resistance to this drug is an inheritable trait. immunoelectrophoretic experiments showed that certain changes  in the antigenic pattern of the chxr variants had occurred as compared with their sensitive wild-type strains. antigenic extracts of the chxr variants and all chxr recombinants tested contained consistently less protein than those of the sensitive wild-types.

TI  == iga1 proteases from haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, and streptococcus sanguis: comparative immunochemical studies.
AB  == iga1 proteases from h. influenzae, n. meningitidis, s. pneumoniae, and s. sanguis were compared with respect to site of cleavage in the iga1 molecule and edta sensitivity. proteases from s. sanguis and s. pneumoniae cleaved the pro (227)-thr (228) bond within the hinge region of the alpha 1 chain and were inhibited by edta. h. influenzae iga1 protease cleaved the pro (231)-ser (232) peptide bond. the activity of iga1 proteases from h. influenzae and n. meningitidis was unaffected by edta. purified and denatured alpha 1 chain was cleaved only in the hinge region. other component chains of secretory iga (secretory component, light and j chains) were not susceptible. in addition to iga1 protease, s. pneumoniae released exo- and endoglycosidases that removed a considerable portion of carbohydrate side chains of iga1; this activity was absent from crude iga1 protease preparations of the other three bacterial species. association in vitro of polymeric iga1 with sc did not inhibit the degradation of iga1 proteases. the considerable resistance of secretory iga to cleavage by iga1 proteases may be explained in part by the presence of iga1 protease-neutralizing antibodies in secretory iga.

TI  == interactions of competent streptococcus sanguis (wicky) cells with native or denatured, homologous or heterologous deoxyribonucleic acids.
AB  == competent cell-deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) interactions were examined using tritium-labeled homologous or heterologous native or denatured dnas and competent streptococcus sanguis wicky cells (strain we4). the dnas used were extracted from we4 cells, escherichia coli b cells, and e. coli bacteriophages t2, t4, t6, and t7. the reactions examined were: (i) total dna binding, (ii) deoxyribonuclease-resistant dna binding, and (iii) the production of acid-soluble products from the dna. optimal temperatures for the reactions were as follows: reaction (i), between 30 and 40 degrees c; reaction (ii), 30 degrees c; and reaction (iii), greater than 40 degrees c. the rates for the reactions (expressed as molecules of dna that reacted per minute per colony-forming unit) did not vary greatly from one dna source to another. with a constant competent cell concentration and differing dna concentrations below a saturation level (from a given source), a different but constant fraction of the added dna was cell bound, deoxyribonuclease resistant, and degraded to acid-soluble products. in experiments where the number of competent cells was varied and the dna concentration was held constant, again essentially the same result was obtained.  the extent of reactions (i), (ii), and (iii) depended upon the numbers as well as the source of dna molecules applied to competent cells. calcium ion essential for native dna-cell reactions was also found essential for denatured dna-cell reactions. data obtained from competition experiments lead to the conclusion that competent we4 cells contain specific sites for native as well as denatured dnas.

TI  == purification and properties of deoxyribonucleic acid binding factor isolated from the surface of streptococcus sanguis cells.
AB  == deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) binding factor (bf) was found in surface fluids from  competent and noncompetent cells of streptococcus sanguis strains challis, wicky, and blackburn. fluids from noncompetent cells exhibited about 10% bf activity compared with extracts from competent cells. bf from competent wicky cells was purified to homogeneity by electrophoresis and immunodiffusion. purified bf preparations exhibited slight endonucleolytic activity, directed mainly against single-stranded dna. nucleolytic and dna binding activities present in purified bf could be separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. purified bf was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and to phospholipase d, and its activity was stimulated in the presence of low triton x-100 concentrations. the protein component of bf is a single, monomeric polypeptide with a molecular weight of 56,000 and an isoelectric point of ph 5.8. binding of purified bf to dna was a very rapid process at the optimum temperature, ph, and ionic strength and led to  the formation of fast-sedimenting complexes. purified bf was tested for several properties. it exhibited higher affinity to single- than to double-stranded dna.  it bound poorly to glucosylated phage t4 and single-stranded, synthetic polydeoxyribonucleotides and did not bind to rna. it protected single-stranded dna against nuclease s(1) action but did not protect native dna against deoxyribonuclease i action. no evidence was found for unwinding activity, using double-stranded dna as a substrate.

TI  == effects of monocytopenia and anticoagulation in experimental streptococcus sanguis endocarditis.
AB  == the role of blood monocytes in the attachment of streptococci to endocardial vegetations was investigated in an experimental streptococcus sanguis endocarditis by depletion of blood monocytes with the cytostatic drug vp 16-213 alone and combined with anticoagulant treatment with warfarin sodium. the numbers of streptococci in the vegetations of control, monocytopenic, and monocytopenic/anticoagulated rabbits were comparable. in the vegetations streptococci were found mainly in areas free of phagocytic cells. it is concluded that streptococci do not have to be phagocytosed by monocytes in the circulation  before being deposited on the surface of endocardial vegetations. even the vegetations of intensively anticoagulated/monocytopenic rabbits showed colonies of streptococci embedded in polymerized fibrin and cellular material, this matrix possibly being held together by streptococcal dextran.

TI  == lethal effect of a heterologous murein hydrolase on penicillin-treated streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == nine strains of streptococcus sanguis exhibited tolerance to benzylpenicillin: the growth of each strain was susceptible to penicillin with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.1 mug/ml or lower, but the bacteriolytic and bactericidal effects were limited in each case. the tolerance of these bacteria was also reflected in the large discrepancies between the minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations for benzylpenicillin. the hypothesis that a natural deficiency of endogenous murein hydrolase (autolysin) in this species accounts for the penicillin tolerance was tested by using a heterologous murein hydrolase, the c-phage-associated lysin. in seven of the strains, addition of the lysin to the culture together with penicillin or other cell wall inhibitors resulted in lysis and rapid loss of viability. the enzyme alone did not appreciably affect normally growing cultures. the irreversible effects of penicillin plus lysin were drastically reduced in the presence of the bacteriostatic agents chloramphenicol  and cerulenin. speculations based on experiments are presented for the mechanisms by which penicillin treatment sensitizes these bacteria to an exogenous lytic enzyme. similar phenomena requiring cooperation of host factors and penicillin may occur during infection, since somewhat similar although less pronounced results were obtained by addition of human lysozyme to penicillin-treated s. sanguis.

AB  == fourteen freshly isolated strains of streptococcus sanguis were obtained from the dental plaque of five healthy adults. whole saliva was collected concomitant with the plaque isolates from the five subjects, and a second whole saliva sample was  collected 10 weeks later. all possible combinations of the first five saliva samples, the second five saliva samples, and 14 strains of bacteria were tested for aggregation. of the 140 combinations examined, 108 of 140 (77%) of the strains aggregated with the first saliva samples and 95 of 140 (68%) aggregated with the second saliva samples. overall, 72% of the strains aggregated with both  the first and second saliva samples. removal of immunoglobulin a (iga) from these same salivas resulted in 38 of 108 (35%) of the aggregates decreasing in intensity with the first saliva samples and 27 of 95 (29%) of the aggregates decreasing in intensity with the second saliva samples. no aggregates increased in intensity with saliva samples when iga had been removed. removal of iga from saliva also resulted in a mean decrease of 46% in adherence of s. sanguis to hydroxyapatite coated with the iga-deficient saliva. several strains of s. sanguis were shown to aggregate strongly with human salivary and colostral iga. in addition, s. sanguis strain s7 showed a 31% stimulation of adherence to hydroxyapatite precoated with human salivary iga over the uncoated controls. stepwise removal of iga from saliva resulted in a decrease in aggregation intensity from strong (4+) to weak (1+ to 2+). similarly, the adherence of s. sanguis to hydroxyapatite coated with these saliva samples decreased linearly as  the salivary iga was depleted. alternatively, the addition of a small quantity of salivary iga (20 mug/ml) to progressively diluted saliva maintained a high level  of adherence and strong aggregation until the saliva dilutions reached between 1:8 in the adherence experiments and 1:32 for the aggregations. these data indicate that salivary iga may play an important role in the microbial ecology of human dental plaque formation.

[3h]nabh4 reduction of acid hydrolysates of the polymers revealed that all of the polymers contained glucose as the major sugar componenta nd xylose as the minor sugar component. the second type of polymer was fractionated into three polymers, p-1, p-2, and p-3. all contained [3h]-glycerol, [14c]glucose, and fatty acids. p-1 appeared to be pure, whereas p-2 and p-3 contained two polymers each, as judged from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

TI  == superhelical dna in streptococcus sanguis: role in recombination in vivo.
AB  == competent streptococcus sanguis treated with non-lethal doses of coumermycin a1 immediately before or after uptake of radioactive transforming dna were reduced in their capacity to yield transformants. this treatment did not alter bacterial  ability to bind dna in dnase i-resistant form, nor did it prevent the single-stranded donor dna-recipient protein complexes formed upon uptake at the surface of the bacteria from translocating to chromosomal sites. inhibition of transformation by heterospecific dna was greater than that by homospecific dna. the reduction in transformant yield was not accompanied by any loss of donor counts incorporated into the recipient chromosome, but rather by a loss of genetic activity of incorporated donor material indicating a failure of genetic integration and degradation of donor dna as a consequence of coumermycin treatment. the inhibitory effect of coumermycin on transformation was associated  with in vivo loss of chromosomal dna superhelicity, the chromosomal dna remained  intact, however, indicative of inhibition of a gyrase-like enzyme responsible for the maintenance of negative supercoiling of the s. sanguis chromosome. upon treatment with the drug, a coumermycin-resistant mutant strain showed neither loss of chromosomal superhelicity nor any inhibitory effect on genetic integration of donor dna. the evidence supports the idea that chromosomal superhelicity promotes genetic recombination in vivo.

TI  == influence of preformed antibody on experimental streptococcus sanguis endocarditis.
AB  == the influence of preformed, anti-whole organism antibody on the development of streptococcus sanguis endocarditis was examined in both in vivo and in vitro systems. antibody prevented, rather than potentiated, endocarditis in rabbits. the infectious dose in 30 control animals was 10(6.5) +/- 0.33 (mean +/- standard deviation); this increased to 10(7.71 +/- 0.05 in 36 immunized animals (p less than 0.01). no differences in bacterial clearance mechanisms were apparent between groups. antibody also prevented the adherence of s. sanguis to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (fibrin and platelets) in vitro. when preincubated in high-titer antisera, adherence of s. sanguis was reduced compared with controls (adherence ratio mean +/- standard error of the mean, x 10(4): 174 +/- 5 versus 427 +/- 10, p less than 0.001). preadsorption of  immune sera with intact s. sanguis restored adherence to normal values, whereas preadsorption with dextran was partially effective. these studies demonstrate that preformed antibody had a protective role in vivo and suggest that a possible mechanism is blockade of adherence, a crucial early step in the pathogenesis of endocarditis.

TI  == in vitro studies of dental plaque formation: adsorption of oral streptococci to hydroxyaptite.
AB  == a mixture of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and radioactively labeled bacteria has been employed as an in vitro model for the initial phase of dental plaque formation. adsorption in this model can be expressed by the langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adherence of oral streptococci can be expressed as the product of the affinity constant (ka) and the number of binding sites (n), kan. with this approach, streptococcus sanguis serotype 1 strains adhered better  (kan = [187 +/- 72] x 10(-2)) than serotype 2 strains (kan = [97 +/- 84] x 10(-2)); a t test showed this difference to be statistically significant to the 99.99% confidence level. strains of s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius did not appear to adhere as well. to analyze the bacterial receptors involved in adherence, competition studies in which increasing quantities of unlabeled bacteria were added to a fixed quantity (4 x 10(9) cells per ml) of 3h-labeled serotype 1, reference strain s. sanguis g9b, were performed. these studies indicated that the type 1 strains competed for the same, or closely related, binding sites. competition studies using serotype 2 s. sanguis strains resulted in an increased binding of reference strain g9b to hydroxyapatite. scanning electron microscopy indicated this effect was due to the formation of localized aggregations of bacteria, presumably representing the two bacterial types. the results of competition studies with s. mitis were variable, and several strains of other oral bacteria showed little or no competition.

TI  == effects of bactericidal treatments on bacterial adherence and dental plaque formation.
AB  == in vivo plaque formation was significantly reduced when tooth surfaces were subjected to topical applications of iodine (0.2% i2 in 2.0% ki) twice daily for  3 d. similarly, in vivo plaque formation was significantly reduced on enamel surfaces that were subjected to ultraviolet irradiation. control experiments indicated that neither ultraviolet irradiation nor iodine treatment interfered with mechanisms for bacterial apposition to dental plaque. the results are interpreted to suggest that plaque grows in mass primarily by the division and multiplication in situ by plaque bacteria, not by a continued apposition of salivary microbes.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine on the relative proportions of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis in hamster plaque.
AB  == the effect of chlorhexidine on the proportions of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis in plaque was studied in hamsters fed a diet containing 28% sucrose. in animals given chlorhexidine in their drinking water for 10 d a decrease in the population of s. mutans and an increase of s. sanguis occurred in the plaque. following the removal of chlorhexidine the population of s. mutans increased again in the presence of sucrose and the number of s. sanguis returned  to initial values. when animals were given a sucrose-free diet the low proportion of s. mutans observed following the short-term chlorhexidine period persisted. these data indicate that there is an inverse relationship between the number of s. sanguis and s. mutans in plaque and that the sensitivity in vivo of s. mutans  to chlorheximide can be used to suppress the population of s. mutans with a concomitant rise in the proportion of s. sanguis.

TI  == enhancement of generation of monocyte tissue thromboplastin by bacterial phagocytosis: possible pathway for fibrin formation on infected vegetations in bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == the deposition of fibrin on infected vegetations and the presence of mononuclear  phagocytes that have phagocytized bacteria are remarkabe features in experimental bacterial endocarditis. in a study in vitro, we show that phagocytosis of bacteria by human monocytes enhances thromboplastin generation by these cells. maximal enhancement of the generation of thromboplastin by monocytes was about six times compared with that in the control experiment without bacteria, and it was obtained by preincubation of the monocytes with 5 to 10 bacteria per monocyte. no quantitative difference was observed between staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus sanguis as to the enhancement of the monocyte thromboplastin generation. an enhancement of the procoagulant activity generation was also observed after addition of bacteria to human or rabbit whole blood. probably, this generation was also due to synthesis of thromboplastin by monocytes. it is conceivable that fibrin deposition on infected vegetations during bacterial endocarditis is mediated by thromboplastin synthesis by monocytes.

TI  == specificity of coaggregation reactions between human oral streptococci and strains of actinomyces viscosus or actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == coaggregation reactions between actinomycete and streptococcal cells occurred frequently when human strains of actinomyces viscosus or a. naeslundii were mixed with human isolates of streptococcus sanguis or s. mitis, but were infrequent with other oral actinomycetes and streptococci. two groups of actinomycetes and four groups of streptococci were defined by the patterns of their coaggregation reactions and by the ability of beta-linked galactosides (i.e., lactose) to reverse these reactions. coaggregations occurred by one of the following three kinds to cell-cell interactions: (i) coaggregation that was blocked by heating the streptococcus but not the actinomycete and was not reversed by lactose; (ii)  coaggregation that was blocked by heating the actinomycete but not the streptococcus and was reversed by lactose; and (iii) coaggregation that was blocked only by heating both cell types. the latter reaction was a combination of the first two since lactose reversed coaggregation between heated streptococci and unheated actinomycetes but did not reverse coaggregations between unheated streptococci and heated actinomycetes. cells that could be heat inactivated also  were inactivated by amino group acetylation or protease digestion, whereas cells  that were unaffected by heat were not inactivated by these treatments. coaggregation reactions of each kind were ca2+ dependent and insensitive to dextranase treatment. these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that human strains of a. viscosus and a. naeslundii coaggregate with strains of s. sanguis and s. mitis by a system of specific cell surface interactions between protein or glycoprotein receptors on one cell type and carbohydrates on the other type.

TI  == enhanced transformability with heterospecific deoxyribonucleic acid upon removal  of nascent ribonucleic acid from the streptococcus sanguis genome.
AB  == treatment of streptococcus sanguis recipient cells with rifampin (rif) at the time of deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) addition was an effective means of reducing discrimination, that is, of causing an increase in the number of transformants induced by irreversibly bound heterospecific dna without significantly changing the number induced by bound homospecific dna. rif was unable to reduce discrimination when the recipient cells were rif resistant due to an altered ribonucleic acid (rna) polymerase. when recipient cells were treated at the time  of dna addition with concentrations of streptolydigin (stg) as inhibitory of rna  synthesis as rif, discrimination was not reduced. the kinetics of rna synthesis inhibition with these inhibitors indicated that, as reported for other bacterial  species, rif inhibited the initiation of transcription by rna polymerase, whereas stg inhibited the progression of rna polymerase at any point. pulse-labeling of rna immediately before stg addition showed that, if cells were incubated under stg inhibition for 10 to 15 min, their nascent rna was degraded. genome-bound rna polymerase was not released under these conditions. when recipient cells were incubated with stg until nascent rna was degraded and then exposed to transforming dna, stg was as effective as rif in reducing discrimination. the presence of nascent rna was thereby implicated in the transforming inefficiency of incompletely homologous dna.

AB  == forty-one strains of streptococcus sanguis (37 of serogroup h and four of the newly-described serogroup w) were examined semiquantitatively for genetic transformation with streptomycin as marker. the material comprised eight reference laboratory strains and 33 recent isolates. eighteen strains (16 of serogroup h and two of w) showed spontaneous competence in genetic transformation (without added competence factor, i.e. culture filtrate.). individual culture filtrates from 19 spontaneously competent and ten incompetent strains were tested for competence-inducing effect on 23 spontaneously incompetent strains. competence was induced in 16 of the strains, and 20 of the culture filtrates were active. there was considerable variation with respect to the number of recipient  strains which were induced to competence by individual filtrates. furthermore the recipients varied as regards the number of filtrates that were able to induce that particular strain. there was some relationship, but no complete association, between competence, competence-inducing ability and the occurrence of spreading zones around the colonies assumed to correspond generally to fimbriation. thus, three incompetent strains had an active culture filtrate and one spontaneously competent strain had an inactive filtrate. most, but not all, strains with spontaneous or inducible competence showed spreading, as did most of the strains  from which broadly inducing filtrates could be produced.

TI  == stability of the resident microflora and the bacteriocinogeny of streptococcus mutans as factors affecting its establishment in specific pathogen-free rats.
AB  == the outcome of the experimental implantation of streptococcus mutans strains in humans and animals is unpredictable, and neither success nor failure can be explained. it seems logical to assume that, apart from dietary and host factors,  the characteristics of the s. mutans strain involved and those of the resident plaque microflora are important in colonization. for example, previous work in this laboratory suggested that bacteriocin production accounts at least in part for the establishment of an invading bacterium in a microbial ecosystem. in the present study, a complex specific pathogen-free ny plaque ecosystem was obtained  by the inoculation of specific pathogen-free rats with actinomyces viscosus ny1 and s. sanguis ny101, and the establishment of s. mutans in such rats was then examined. it was found that bacteriocinogenic (bac(+)) strains generally colonized in much higher proportions than non-bacteriocinogenic (bac(-)) strains. moreover, the longer the delay in introducing s. mutans, the poorer was its establishment. shortly after inoculation of strains ny1 and ny101, there is probably a transient state in which microbial equilibrium has not been reached, but later the specific pathogen-free ny system attains a stable climax community  which more strongly resists invaders. the ability of a number of s. mutans strains to establish in such a climax community was then examined, and it was found that bac(+) strains generally established at a higher level than did bac(-) strains. in summary, it was concluded that, although the bac(+) state is an important property in the successful invasion of a plaque by s. mutans, the stability of the resident microflora is also an important factor.

AB  == the initial adhesion of oral bacteria to a tooth in vitro was examined. the organisms were grown in broth with and without sucrose, and suspensions made either in broth or a modified ringer's solution. the tooth used was either dry or coated with natural or synthetic saliva. adhesion was determined by counting organisms removed from the tooth surface by simple washing or by sonication. it was found that the firmest bonding occurred when a dry tooth was immersed in a suspension of bacteria in ringer's solution; the prior growth of the organisms in the presence of sucrose did not affect adhesion. it was concluded that instantaneous irreversible adhesion of bacteria to a tooth occurs without the need for active metabolism, and that this process is inhibited by the presence of competing organic substances which probably produce a surface-conditioning film.

TI  == modification of human parotid saliva proteins by oral streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the effect of streptococcus sanguis on the anionic proteins in human parotid gland saliva. cell-free culture supernatants and washed-cell preparations from 23 strains of s. sanguis caused marked modification of various salivary proteins. control studies  showed that the alterations in protein profiles by the bacteria were not due to attachment of protein to the cells. protease inhibitors were used to confirm that proteolysis by distinct enzymatic activities was responsible for most of the modifications. there was no discernible relationship between the degradation patterns and the various immunologic or genetic groups of s. sanguis. proteins which contained high concentrations of proline were extensively degraded by s. sanguis. this effect could be blocked with the protease inhibitor phenylmethyl-sulphonyl fluoride.

TI  == bacterial and strain specificities in opsonization, phagocytosis and killing of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == opsonization of streptococcus mutans, followed by phagocytosis and killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes has been postulated as an effector mechanism in protection against dental caries. opsonization was studied by using sera from monkeys immunized with killed strep. mutans (sero-type c) and compared with sera  from sham-immunized monkeys. antibodies to strep. mutans (sero-type c) induced maximal phagocytosis and killing of serotypes c and e, and this was significantly greater than with serotypes a and d; there was no significant phagocytosis or killing of serotype b. there was little or no opsonization with actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus casei, strep, sanguis and strep. salivarius. the exception was strep. cht which showed significant phagocytosis and killing. the results suggest that immunization with the serotype c strain of strep. mutans might offer protection against four of the five common serotypes of this organism.

AB  == strains of streptococcus mutans of four genetic groups and five serotypes, and strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and a. viscosus, were found to bind blood group-reactive (bgr) mucin isolated from whole human saliva. the bacteria studied bound mucins with blood type a or b reactivity to a similar extent, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties responsible for the a and b antigenic determinants were not involved. the organisms studied appeared to bind different fractions of bgr mucin molecules because preparations  absorbed with cells of a given oral species no longer contained bgr molecules which bound to homologous organisms but still possessed bgr components which bound to varying degrees to other bacteria. differences were even noted among s.  mutans strains belonging to different genetic groups and serological types. immunoglobulins could not be detected in the mucin preparations, and addition of  anti-human immunoglobulin a (iga), igg, or igm serum to reaction mixtures did not affect binding. mucin pretreated with periodate or iodoacetate no longer bound to s. mutans h12 cells, suggesting that carbohydrate moieties and sulfhydryl groups  played an essential role. active cell metabolism was not required for bgr mucin binding; however, pretreatment of h12 cells with periodate or heat (100 degrees c for 15 min) reduced binding. mucin labeled with [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate appeared to bind to s. mutans h12 cells comparably to untreated mucin; the binding also appeared to be specific because less than 15% of the labeled material became bound when incubated with an excess of streptococci. binding of [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate-labeled mucin was not affected by neutral sugars tested or by preparations of c antigen, glycerol teichoic acid, dextran, or crude glucosyltransferase. however, binding was inhibited by several amines. bgr salivary mucins are present in the acquired pellicle covering teeth; the ability  of bacteria to selectively bind such components suggest that they may serve as receptor molecules involved in the attachment of bacteria to teeth.

TI  == co-induction of beta-galactosidase and the lactose-p-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system in streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the addition of lactose, galactose, or isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside (iptg) to glucose-grown cells of streptococcus salivarius 25975 resulted in the co-induction of both the lactose-p-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (lactose-pts) and beta-galactosidase, with the latter the predominant metabolic system. with various strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis 10556, on the other hand, the lactose-pts was the major metabolic pathway with beta-galactosidase induced either to low or negligible levels. in all cases, induction of the lactose-pts resulted in the concomitant induction of 6-p-beta-galactosidase. the induction by lactose of both the lactose-pts and beta-galactosidase in all strains was repressed by glucose and other catabolites, notably, fructose. induction of beta-galactosidase in s. salivarius 25975 by iptg was, however, relatively resistant to glucose repression. induction experiments with iptg and lactose suggested that a cellular metabolite of lactose metabolism  was a repressor of enzyme activity. exogenous camp was shown to reverse the transient repression by glucose of beta-galactosidase induction in cells of s. salivarius 25975 receiving lactose, provided the cells were grown with small amounts of toluene to overcome the permeability barrier to this nucleotide, camp, was however, unable to overcome the permanent repression of beta-galactosidase activity to a significant extent under these conditions.

AB  == extracellular caseinolytic activity was found in the culture fluid of streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 grown in a dialyzed culture medium. this activity was due to multiple proteases that differed in their elution from hydroxyapatite, sensitivity to enzyme inhibitors, specificity and optimum ph. iga protease, which splits human immunoglobulin a1 into intact fc and fab could be effectively separated from these relatively non-specific proteases and purified to apparent homogeneity in 20% yield by a five-step procedure. although the bulk  of the dextran sucrase activity was separated from the iga protease, a small amount of sucrase activity remained with the final iga protease preparation. in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at ph 9.5 both activities were located in the  single protein band detected in this preparation. a quantitative method for the assay of iga protease was developed, based on radial immunodiffusion to quantitate the fab produced. this was used to follow the specific activity and yield during purification, and to characterize some of the catalytic properties of the enzyme. at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1: 400 (w/w) the protease could effect 50% proteolysis of iga in overnight incubation at 37 degrees c. the optimum activity was at ph 8.0, and 50% inhibition was achieved at 4 . 10(-4) m o-phenanthroline or 8 . 10(-4) m ethylene diamine tetraacetate. concentrations of diisopropyl phosphofluoridate, phenylmethyl-sulfonyl fluoride, iodoacetate and p-chloromercuribenzoate up to 10(-2) m were without effect on the iga protease activity. full reactivation of the chelator inhibited enzyme could be achieved by the addition of mg2+, mn2+ or ca2+.

TI  == effect of immunization on susceptibility to experimental streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis endocarditis.
AB  == it has been asserted that humoral immunity is an important potentiating factor in pathogenesis of infective endocarditis, in that prior immunization to certain bacteria may predispose the host to endocarditis caused by those organisms. if so, possible future vaccination of humans with streptococcal antigens for the prevention of dental caries might increase the susceptibility of the population to streptococcal endocarditis. to examine this hypothesis further, we immunized rabbits with killed streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus mutans. after complement-fixing antibody had developed, the rabbits were tested for susceptibility to experimental infective endocarditis. rabbits with high titers of complement-fixing antibody to the infecting organism developed streptococcal endocarditis less often (13%) than animals with lower titers (69%; p less than 0.0002). these findings do not support the hypothesis that pre-immunization predisposes to infective endocarditis and lend no credence to the concept that vaccination of human subjects against dental caries might increase their susceptibility to streptococcal endocarditis. on the contrary, the results of these experiments indicate that specific antibody can confer relative immunity to infective endocarditis.

TI  == adherence of glucan-positive and glucan-negative streptococcal strains to normal  and damaged heart valves.
AB  == the adherence of 18 strains of streptococci to sections of normal canine and human aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves and to canine interatrial septum was compared in an in vitro system. quantitative measurements of adherence ratios were performed by two independent methods. adherence ratios for streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. bovis, and group d streptococci were higher (0.0058-0.0101) than for the other streptococcal strains studied (0.0025-0.0041). with the exception of group d streptococci, adherence ratios for each bacterial strain were similar with the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valve sections. adherence ratios with normal human and canine valve leaflets were similar, but adherence ratios with interatrial septum were lower than with normal valve sections. adherence ratios for glucan-positive and glucan-negative strains of streptococci with normal and with damaged aortic valve leaflets were also compared. the adherence ratios of the glucan-positive streptococci (s. mutans, s. sanguis, and s. bovis) and one glucan-negative enterococcal strain (kg-3) were approximately five times higher with damaged aortic valves (0.039-0.051) than with normal aortic valves (0.009-0.010). for glucan-positive strains, adherence ratios with normal aortic leaflets were similar when bacteria were grown in media which contains or lacks sucrose. in striking contrast, growth of the glucan-positive strains in medium which lacks sucrose, with resultant deficiency  of glucan production, decreased the adherence ratios with damaged aortic valve leaflets to those found with normal aortic leaflets. treatment of glucan-positive strains with dextranase resulted in a decrease in their adherence ratios to levels seen with bacteria grown in medium lacking sucrose, but the higher adherence ratios could be restored in the presence of exogenous dextran.it is concluded that glucan production is one quantitatively important factor that contributes to the greater adherence of glucan-positive streptococci to damaged rather than to normal aortic heart valve leaflets. however, glucan production is  not the only factor that determines preferential adherence of streptococci to damaged heart valves, because glucan-negative strains may also show some degree of increased adherence to damaged valves. thus, bacterial glucan production is one of the factors that could contribute to the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == enchancement of streptococcal transformation yield by proteolytic enzymes.
AB  == trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes, added together with transforming dna or during cell-dna contact to competent cultures of several streptococcal strains, enchanced (10 to 600%) the yield of genetic transformation (stimulation). with few exceptions, the level of stimulation was high (over 100%) when competence was low (below 2%). stimulation was caused by the action of an enzyme on competent cells and not on any other component of transformation mixture. the phenomenon occurred when the enzyme was added to the culture not earlier than 7 min before and not later than 5 min after the period of cell-dna contact. the presence of trypsin during cell-dna contact caused: (i) the alterations at cell surface, demonstrated by electron microscopy, increased release of 3h-amino acid-labeled material, and higher cell susceptibility to autolysis; (ii) the increase of both  total and irreversible binding of dna by the cells; and (iii) the decrease of early nucleolytic degradation of dna by cells. these and other data point to the  importance of a delicate balance of recipient cell's surface nuclease activities  in the effectiveness of transformation process. it is also possible that trypsin  eliminates an unknown cellular factor which obstructs dna-cell receptors interaction.

TI  == antigens of streptococcus sanguis: purification and characterization of the b antigen.
AB  == the antigen defining streptococcus sanguis serotype 2 has been designated the b antigen. this antigen can be detected in extracts, obtained from whole cells by autoclaving (rantz and randall extraction), as a single precipitin band using a reference antiserum (m-5). however, the extract can also be shown to contain a teichoic acid using anti-polyglycerol phosphate serum. this teichoic acid does not contain the antigenic determinant for group h specificity. studies of the b antigen have been hampered because of the difficulty in separating the b antigen  from the teichoic acid using ion-exchange and molecular sieve chromatography. however, a relatively pure preparation has been obtained by affinity chromatography using anti-polyglycerol phosphate serum coupled to sepharose. the  isolated b antigen is a typical streptococcal cell wall polysaccharide composed of glucose, rhamnose, and n-acetylglucosamine in a molar ratio of 2.5:1.0:0.1. the antigen appears to have a single antigenic determinant closely related to isomaltose (glucose alpha-1,6-glucoside) based upon hapten inhibition studies.

TI  == bacteriology of human experimental gingivitis: effect of plaque and gingivitis score.
AB  == the plaque flora isolated from discrete dentogingival sites during a human gingivitis experiment was analyzed as a function of the plaque score and of the gingivitis score. when the gingivitis score was plotted as a function of the plaque score, a nonbleeding gingivitis was associated with a proportional increase in the actinomyces sp. at the expense of the streptococcus sp. in particular, the percentage of actinomyces israelii increased significantly, while the percent streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly. a. israelii also increased significantly when a bleeding gingivitis developed. when the plaque score was plotted as a function of the gingivitis score, a. israelii increased significantly as the nonbleeding gingivitis developed, but a. viscosus and bacteroides melaninogenicus increased significantly when the bleeding gingivitis  developed. the availability of a sufficient number of plaques with a plaque score of 2.0 permitted the examination of the interrelationship of gingivitis and flora minus the effect of plaque biomass. the bacteriological profile showed that when  bleeding occurred, the levels and proportions of a. viscosus and b. melaninogenicus increased significantly. these findings raise the possibility that proportional changes in the gingival plaque flora may uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in this experimental model.

AB  == actinomyces viscosus t14v and streptococcus sanguis 34 coaggregate by a mechanism which is not inhibited by 1 m nacl, is dextran independent, requires calcium, is  ph dependent with an optimum at ph 8.0 to 8.5, and appears to require the interaction of a protein or glycoprotein on a. viscosus with a carbohydrate on s. sanguis. the coaggregation is inhibited more than 80% by 0.01 m lactose, 0.02 m beta-methyl-d-galactoside, or 0.05 m d-galactose; inhibition of coaggregation was less than 10% in 0.1 m alpha-methyl-d-galactoside, melibiose, maltose, cellobiose, sucrose, and a number of monosaccharides. at very high concentrations of enzyme, protease from s. griseus destroyed the reactive site on a. viscosus but not on s. sanguis. both were totally resistant to dextranase. periodate (0.01 m; ph 4) inactivated both bacteria. the ability of s. sanguis to coaggregate with a. viscosus was not destroyed by phenol-water extraction at 65 degrees c for 15 min. when the bacteria were cultured under specified conditions, the coaggregation was highly reproducible. under the same conditions, t14av, the avirulent mutant of a. viscosus t14v, did not coaggregate with s. sanguis 34. electron microscopic studies of coaggregates, labeled immunochemically with antibody to a. viscosus, indicated that fibrils on a. viscosus may be involved in the coaggregation.

TI  == factors affecting the aggregation of actinomyces naeslundii during growth and in  washed cell suspensions.
AB  == various factors affecting the aggregation of actinomyces naeslundii strain 12104  were studied. when the ph of glucose-supplemented growth medium fell below 5.5, the cells aggregated and formed microbial masses which tenaciously adhered to the culture vessels. when the organism was cultured in the same medium in the absence of glucose, maximum growth was reduced and the final culture ph values remained above 6.5, but the cells were more dispersed and nonadherent. adjusting the final ph of these cultures to below 5.5 with hcl caused the cells to aggregate. cells from unsupplemented cultures with final ph values of 6.7 were washed by centrifugation, dispersed by vigorous shaking, and suspended in buffer at ph values ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. aggregation (expressed as the percent reduction of optical density at 520 nm after incubation at 37 degrees c) occurred rapidly at ph values below 6.0 but did not readily occur at higher ph values. aggregation of strain 12104 in washed cell suspensions was induced by low ph and influenced by cell concentration and ionic strength of the environment. low ph values also induced aggregation in washed cell suspensions of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus.

TI  == binding of glucosyltransferase and glucan synthesis by streptococcus mutans and other bacteria.
AB  == lyophilized and heat-treated cells from the seven serotypes of streptococcus mutans were examined for their ability to bind added insoluble-product glucosyl-transferase (gtase) and to synthesize cell-associated glucan from [(14)c]sucrose. lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g did not synthesize any more additional glucan than did the controls after exposure to gtase. these cells, however, synthesized four- to eightfold-greater quantities of glucan than  did the cells of the remaining serotypes. lyophilized cells of serotypes b, c, d, e, and f synthesized two- to threefold-greater quantities of glucan after exposure to gtase than did the controls without added enzyme. lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g synthesized 6- to 10-fold-greater quantities of glucan than  did heat-treated cells of the same strain after binding of gtase. lyophilized cells of the remaining serotypes synthesized only 1.6- to 3.3-fold-greater quantities of glucan than did the heat-treated cells. these results demonstrate that heat treatment to inactivate cell-associated gtase does not create additional gtase binding sites in s. mutans and that serotypes a and g are considerably more active in cell-associated glucan synthesis than cells of the other five serotypes. ten species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from five genera which do not produce in vitro plaque synthesized 10- to 100-fold-less glucan than did the s. mutans strains after exposure to gtase. of these species, s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii synthesized the largest quantities of glucan. three mutant strains of s. mutans which possess a reduced ability for in vitro adherence but do agglutinate with glucan or dextran synthesized only one-third as much glucan after binding of gtase as the control. these results are discussed in relation to in vitro and in vivo plaque development and the agglutination of s. mutans. the results support earlier findings which indicate that the presence of bacterial species other than s. mutans in smooth-surface dental plaque is due in part to contact of the cells with glucan in the developing plaque and not to the binding of cell-free gtase and the in situ synthesis of glucan. the results obtained with these representative strains of the seven serotypes of s. mutans may not apply to the same extent to other strains within the serotypes.

TI  == bacterial adherence in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. interaction of bacterial dextran, platelets, and fibrin.
AB  == the role of dextran in the pathogenesis of bacterial endocarditis was investigated by studying the adherence of dextran producing oral streptococci to  the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (nbte) in vitro and in vivo. the adherence of streptococcus sanguis to fibrin and platelets was determined in an in vitro assay system simulating nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. adherence was increased when the organisms were grown in sucrose-supplemented media (adherence ratio x 10(4), 177 +/- 6 in 5% sucrose vs.  140 +/- 7 in 0.5% sucrose, p less than 0.001), and decreased by incubating the organisms in dextranase (adherence ratio x 10(4), 117 +/- 16, p less than 0.001), an effect which was nullified by heat inactivating this enzyme (adherence ratio x 10(4), 192 +/- 7, p less than 0.001). the amount of dextran produced in broth by  three different oral streptococci correlated directly with the adherence observed to fibrin and a fibrin-platelet matrix in vitro (p less than 0.001). these organisms adhered more readily to a fibrin-platelet matrix than to fibrin alone (adherence ratio x 10(4), 455 +/- 30 vs. 177 +/- 6, respectively, p less than 0.001). the role of dextran formation was also examined in vivo in rabbits with preexisting nbte. after injection of 10(7) s. sanguis, 12 of 17 animals developed endocarditis. in contrast, when the organisms were pretreated with dextranase (an enzyme that removes dextran from the bacterial cell surface), the same inoculum resulted in endocarditis in only 5 of 19 animals (p less than 0.05). in addition, a fresh strain of s. sanguis that produced high levels of dextran (1,220 +/- 50 microgram/ml) and adhered avidly to fibrin (adherence ratio x 10(4), 220 +/- 11)  produced endocarditis in 12 of 18 rabbits after injection of 10(7) organisms. another isolate of the same strain that had been passed repeatedly in the laboratory produced less dextran (400 +/- 30 microgram/ml), adhered poorly to fibrin (adherence ratio x 10(4), 140 +/- 7), and produced endocarditis in only 3  of 14 rabbits under identical conditions (p less than 0.05). this study demonstrates that dextran production is important in the adherence of oral streptococci to the constituents of nbte and may play a role in the pathogenesis  of bacterial endocarditis by oral streptococci.

AB  == when the challis strain of streptococcus sanguis was transformed by the 17 megadalton beta plasmid from streptococcus faecalis strain ds5, the plasmid underwent a 1.5 megadalton deletion (leblanc & hassell, 1976). furthermore, the covalently closed circular (ccc) plasmid dna isolated from challis transformants  was rapidly converted to a linear form which did not possess any detectable transforming activity. to obtain stable ccc plasmid dna a competent culture of a  lancefield group f streptococcus, strain dl8 (atcc 12393), was used as a recipient of beta plasmid dna. the plasmid dna isolated from group f transformants exhibited the same configuration and size characteristics as the ds5 beta plasmid, and the ccc configuration was stable upon storage. ccc plasmid  dna from a group f transformant was biologically active and, when added to competent cultures of strain dl8, transformed them at frequencies about 100-fold  greater than did beta plasmid dna from ds5. this suggests the existence of a restriction--modification system in strain dl8.

TI  == microbiota of gingivitis in man.
AB  == a study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms inhabiting gingival crevices affected with a chronic gingivitis was carried out using the roll tube culture technique. samples were obtained from nine individuals 25--42 years of age. gram-positive rods make up 29.1% of the isolates and included mainly actinomyces  naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces viscosus. streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis together made up 26.8% of the cultivable organisms. peptostreptococcus averaged 3.0% of the organisms recovered. gram-negative anaerobic rods constituted 25.0% of the total isolates with fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. intermedius. bacteriodes ochraceus, other bacteroides species, selenomonas sputigena, and campylobacter sputorum as the most predominant isolates. haemophilus parainfluenzae averaged about 14% and  veillonella species 4.3% of the cultivable microflora. the data presented indicate that the subgingival microflora of a chronic gingivitis differs from those of healthy periodontium and advanced adult and juvenile periodontis. this might suggest that different infectious processes may be operative in various clinical entities of periodontal disease.

TI  == specific inactivation of heterospecific transforming dna by a factor derived from streptococcus sanguis lysates.
AB  == a heat-sensitive factor obtained from lysates of competent streptococcus sanguis  cells reacts specifically with native dna of heterospecific (s. pneumoniae or calf thymus) origin. in vitro it does not alter the double or single strand length of the dna, nor does it affect uptake of the dna by compentent s. pneumoniae cells in dnase i-resistant form. following uptake, however, dna previously exposed to the factor loses over 90% of its biological activity. reaction of heterospecific dna with the factor is competitive, suggesting a competition for binding to the factor. heating treated dna prior to its reaction  with recipient cells, apparently by irreversibly dissociating the factor, restores to the dna its original potential transforming activity. specific activity of the factor can be increased in cells grown under certain conditions;  this increase is blocked by erythromycin.

TI  == fate of homospecific transforming dna bound to streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the fate of [3h]dna from streptococcus sanguis str-r43 fus-s donors in [14c]s. sanguis str-s fus-r1 recipients was studied by examining the lysates prepared from such recipients at various times after 1 min of exposure to dna. the lysates were analyzed in cscl and 10 to 30% sucrose gradients; fractions from the gradients were tested for biological activity and sensitivity to nucleases, subjected to various treatments and retested for nuclease sensitivity, and run on 5 to 20% neutral and alkaline sucrose gradients. the results demonstrate that donor dna bound to s. sanguis cells in a form resistant to exogenous deoxyribonuclease is initially single stranded and complexed to recipient material. donor dna can be removed from the complex upon treatment of the complex with pronase, phenol, or isoamyl alcohol-chloroform. within the complex, donor dna is relatively insensitive to s1 endonuclease but can regain its sensitivity by treatment with phenol. with time the complex moves as a whole to associate physically with the recipient chromosome. after a noncovalent stage of synapsis,  donor material is covalently bonded to and acquires the nuclease sensitivity of recipient dna, while donor markers regain transforming activity and become linked to resident markers.

TI  == comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (ha) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated ha surfaces for strain of streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii. the experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. adsorption to untreated ha was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to ha. more complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated ha since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. this indicates that adsorbed salivary components on ha surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. fewer cells of strains of s. mutans, s. salivarius, and a.  naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated ha than to untreated ha because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, and a. viscosus adsorbed to  saliva-treated ha because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the  number of adsorption sites for these strains. the affinity constants for all but  one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated ha than on untreated ha. the number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated ha more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of s. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated ha did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered ha surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.

TI  == fate of heterospecific transforming dna bound to streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the fate of 3h-labeled str-r fus-s dna from streptococcus pneumoniae, bound after a 1-min uptake to 14c-labeled str-s fus-r s. sanguis recipients, was followed by  techniques previously developed for analyzing the fate of homospecific dna. heterospecific s. pneumoniae dna was bound and formed complexes with recipient protein in a manner similar to that of homospecific dna but transformed relatively poorly. the rate at which complexed heterospecific dna becomes physically associated with recipient dna, and at which donor markers are integrated into the chromosome, was slower than in the case of homospecific dna.  in addition, about half of the heterospecific donor counts initially bound in trichloracetic acid-insoluble form were gradually solubilized and released from the cell. the association of heterospecific dna with the recipient chromosome was more unstable than that involving homospecific dna, since only associations of the former type were largely dissociated by isolation and resedimentation. the donor dna-containing material so dissociated had the same sedimentation properties as complexed heterospecific dna before association, indicating that the complex of single-stranded donor dna and recipient protein formed on uptake moves as a whole from its site of formation to synapse with the chromosome.

AB  == this investigation examined the ability of cells of bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 to adhere to surfaces that might be important for its initial colonization of the mouth and its subsequent colonization in periodontal  pockets. of 48 asaccharolytic strains of b. melaninogenicus, 47 agglutinated human erythrocytes, whereas none of 20 fermentative strains, which included reference cultures of the subspecies intermedius and melaninogenicus, were active. electron microscopy indicated that both asaccharolytic and fermentative strains possessed pili; hence, the presence of pili did not correlate with the hemagglutinating activities of b. melaninogenicus strains. both asaccharolytic and fermentative b. melaninogenicus strains suspended in phosphate-buffered saline adhered in high numbers to buccal epithelial cells and to the surfaces of  several gram-positive bacteria tested, including actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. israelii, streptococcus sanguis, and s. mitis. b. melaninogenicus  subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 also attached, but in comparatively low numbers, to untreated and to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. addition of clarified whole saliva to suspensions of strain 381 almost completely eliminated adherence to buccal epithelial cells and to hydroxyapatite surfaces, but saliva had no detectable effect on attachment to gram-positive plaque bacteria. both fermentative and nonfermentative strains of b. melaninogenicus also attached in high numbers to crevicular epithelial cells derived from human periodontal pockets, but normal human serum strongly inhibited attachment. serum also inhibited attachment of strain 381 to saliva- and serum-treated hydroxyapatite, but it had little effect upon attachment to gram-positive bacteria. these observations suggested that salivary and serum components would strongly inhibit  the attachment of b. melaninogenicus cells to several oral surfaces, but not to the surfaces of certain gram-positive bacteria commonly present in human dental plaque. this was confirmed by an in vivo experiment in which streptomycin-labeled cells of b. melaninogenicus 381-r were introduced into the mouths of two volunteers. after 10 min, several hundred-fold higher numbers of the organism were recovered from preformed bacterial plaque present on teeth than from clean tooth surfaces or from the buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum. high numbers of b. melaninogenicus cells were also recovered from preformed plaque after 150 min, but virtually no cells of the organism were recovered from the other surfaces studied. these data suggest that the presence of dental plaque containing actinomyces and other gram-positive bacteria may be essential for the attachment  and colonization of b. melaninogenicus cells after their initial introduction into the mouth. similarly, the presence of subgingival plaque containing gram-positive bacteria may be necessary for its secondary colonization in periodontal pockets.

TI  == secretion of lipids induced by inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in streptococci.
AB  == inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis causes an immediate and massive secretion of both newly synthesized and "old" lipids from several species of bacteria, including streptococci, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus subtilis. lipid  secretion occurs in the absence of detectable bacterial lysis. this novel phenomenon was examined in more detail in three strains of streptococci: s. sanguis (group h), s. pyogenes (group a), and s. pneumoniae. the secretion of lipids is specifically induced by inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis; it is not caused by inhibitors of protein, ribonucleic acid, or deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. the occurrence appears to be reversible since penicillin-induced secretion comes to a halt upon the timely addition of penicillinase, correlating  with resumption of culture growth. all cellular lipids are secreted in essentially the same proportions as those found in the drug treated bacteria. it  is suggested that continued peptidoglycan synthesis may be essential for the integration and retention of lipid material in the plasma membrane.

AB  == bacillus subtilis, neisseria subflava, and lyt coccus were found to undergo massive lysis after growth in media containing 0.01 to 10 mm naf. when cells of these organisms were transferred from late-exponential-phase cultures to 0.02 m sodium phosphate buffer plus 0.1 m kcl, they underwent spontaneous autolysis. cells grown in media with fluoride were more liable to autolysis, and walls isolated from them also showed enhanced autolytic sensitivity, even though added  fluoride did not directly stimulate autolysins. sporadic or partial lysis occurred in populations of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans bht or  lm-7 after growth in fluoridated media. most bacteria that were tested did not undergo fluoride-induced lysis. however, cells of all test bacteria were found to have reduced amounts of peptidoglycan per unit of cell weight when grown in the presence of fluoride. incorporation of labeled lysine or glucosamine into peptidoglycan (park-hancock residue) was stimulated, instead of inhibited, by fluoride. however, fluoride also stimulated the loss of radioactivity from park-hancock residues of cells that had previously incorporated labeled lysine or glucosamine. thus, fluoride appeared to enhance peptidoglycan turnover, and this  turnover reduced the peptidoglycan contents of all bacteria tested, but induced lysis in only those bacteria that normally have highly active autolytic systems.

TI  == survival of bacteria from human dental plaque under various transport conditions.
AB  == the effects of transport media, temperature, and anaerobiosis on the survival of  bacteria from human supragingival dental plaque were studied. individual samples  were obtained by passing sterile, unwaxed dental floss through the interproximal  spaces. the plaque-bearing portion of floss was immediately placed in vials containing reduced transport fluid, viability-preserving microbistatic medium, or reduced salt solution transport fluid. plaque samples were dispersed by ultrasonic oscillation, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate on mm10-sucrose-blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar, and rogosa tomato juice agar. initial viable counts (time 0) were compared with viable count determinations after 48- and 72-h storage. quantitative recovery (>30%) of various groups of oral bacteria was accomplished from both reduced transport fluid and viability-preserving microbistatic medium after 48- and 72-h storage. storage of dental plaque in reduced salt solution proved unsatisfactory for most  bacteria (less than 10% survival). since growth of some bacteria may occur in viability-preserving microbistatic medium and the charcoal present interferes with colonly enumeration on low-dilution plates, we found reduced transport fluid to be the most suitable medium for transport and recovery of bacteria from supragingival dental plaque. subzero storage (-196 and -40 degrees c) did not enhance the survival of bacteria from dental plaque; storage at moderate (5 and 20 degrees c) temperatures gave better recovery of viable bacteria. survival after anaerobic or aerobic storage was comparable for total colony-forming units; however, anaerobic storage enhanced survival of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus. since these organisms are specifically associated with dental caries, anaerobic techniques are preferred for caries activity testing of plaque.

AB  == washed cells of streptococcus sanguis were used to form artificial plaque on the  surface of bovine enamel and incubated underneath buffer solutions, initial ph 6, for 36 h at 37 degrees c. the decrease in the microhardness of the enamel surface under fermenting "plaque" could be prevented with fluoride. enamel under a fermenting "plaque" took up significantly more (p less than 0.0u) fluoride than enamel under a non-fermenting "plaque" (initial f- in buffer: 10 parts/10(6)). the artificial plaque did not accumulate fluoride. within fermenting "plaques/, the ph decreased significantly more without flouride (p less than 0.01) than with fluoride. fluoride combined with sucrose more than negated the softening of the enamel caused by sucrose fermentation, i.e. it increased the hardness above the original values. the diffusion of fluoride through the fermenting artificial plaque was more rapid than through a non-fermenting plaque. these findings suggest that caries-conducive circumstances may promote fluoride uptake by enamel compared with non-caries-conducive circumstances.

TI  == molecular basis for the different sucrose-dependent adherence properties of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the enzymatic and adherence properties of streptococcus mutans gs5 and s. sanguis st3, both isolated from human carious lesions, have been compared. during growth  in sucrose media, s. mutans gs5 adheres to smooth surfaces approximately three times more effectively than dose s. sanguis st3. however, strain st3 does not display sucrose-dependent adherence under nongrowth conditions, whereas strain gs5 displays significant adherence. although both organisms synthesize both water-soluble and -insoluble glucans, the glucosyltransferases from s. mutans gs5 synthesize much more adherent glucan molecules than do the comparable enzymes from s. sanguis st3. both cell types bind exogenous glucosyltransferases synthesized by strain st3 equally well, whereas cells of strain gs5 bind the comparable enzyme fraction that it synthesizes to a greater degree than do cell of s. sanguis st3. however, in contrast to the results with cells of s. mutans gs5, the absorption of the glucosyltransferase activity synthesized by s. mutans  gs5 to the surface of s. sanguis st3 results in low levels of subsequent sucrose-dependent adherence. these results are discussed in terms of the molecular basis for the sucrose-dependent adherence of the oral streptococci to smooth surfaces.

TI  == production of extracellular material by streptococci associated with subacute bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == six strains of viridans streptococci isolated from confirmed cases of subacute bacterial endocarditis were studied for production of extracellular material. all six strains, when grown to the exponential phase, produced exoproducts that had similar elution profiles on a g-100 sephadex column. since essential nutrients, such as amino acids, may be periodically growth limiting to streptococci in the fibrin-covered lesions on heart valves, the potential to elaborate extracellular  protein and other material by streptococci that were deprived of essential amino  acids was studied. examination of supernatant fluids from cultures of streptococcus mg intermedius deprived of glutamate and cystine revealed the presence of a complex mixture of extracellular materials in amounts comparable to those produced by normallly growing cells, although only a slight (21 to 24%) increase in total protein occurred during amino acid deprivation of 12 h, the extracellular material contained numerous protein components, several of which demonstrated proteolytic activity. on a cell dry weight basis, the amino acid-deprived cells produced four-to eightfold more protease(s) than did exponential cells grown in complete medium. these results demonstrate that viridans streptococci are capable of elaborating potentially damaging compounds even when their multiplication has been arrested by nutritional deprivation.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of three iodine-containing compounds as antiplaque agents.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of three iodine-containing compounds was determined for strains of four dental plaque-forming microorganisms, using an in vitro preclinical plaque model system. solutions of inorganic iodine, povidone-iodine,  and wescodyne were tested for antiplaque activity against preformed plaques of a  number of strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii. solutions of inorganic iodine were more effective as antiplaque agents, with respect to minimal bactericidal concentration and time and frequency of treatments, than solutions of wescodyne and povidone-iodine. inorganic iodine appeared to be particularly effective against the most cariogenic (s. mutans) and periodontopathic (a. viscosus) organisms while allowing survival of the least orally pathogenic plaque-forming microorganism (s. sanguis). it is suggested that topical application of solutions of inorganic iodine may be useful in controlling dental caries and actinomyces-associated periodontal disease.

AB  == sucrose metabolism by resting-cell suspensions of pure cultures of representative members of the predominant cultivable flora isolated from cariogenic and non-cariogenic dental plaque was investigated by means of radiochemical techniques. streptocococcus mutans utilized sucrose at a considerably faster rate than s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, or lactobacillus  casei, forming lactic acid, intracellular polysaccharide, insoluble extracellular glucan, and lactic acid from intracellular polysaccharide catabolism at faster rates than the other bacteria. the actinomyces formed more volatile acids than the streptococci, mostly acetic, and s. sanguis formed more soluble extracellular polysaccharide than the other bacteria. the metabolic activity of s. mutans resembled the pattern of sucrose metabolism of cariogenic plaque, whereas the metabolic activity of the actinomyces species, the predominant members of non-cariogenic plaque flora, resembled the sucrose metabolism of non-cariogenic plaques.

TI  == loss of antibody activity in human immunoglobulin a exposed extracellular immunoglobulin a proteases of neisseria gonorrhoeae and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == immunoglobulin a (iga) proteases are extracellular enzymes elaborated by neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, and streptococcus sanguis. these enzymes  each cleave human iga1 at a critically situated prolyl-threonyl peptide bond to yield fab alpha and fc alpha fragments. to study their effect on the antibody activity of human iga, we enzymatically digested a group of five human iga monoclonal immunoglobulins with high-titer rheumatoid factor or cold agglutinin activity and human serum macroamylase, an amylase-iga complex. in contrast to four control igm rheumatoid factor monoclonal proteins, whose activity was unaffected by enzyme, gonococcal and streptococcal iga proteases caused prompt, major reductions of iga antibody activity to negligible levels and converted macroamylase activity to amylase of normal size, as determined by molecular sieve chromatography. in addition, both enzymes promptly deagglutinated sensitized cells that had been aggregated by iga rheumatoid factors, indicating that iga bound to antigen is also susceptible to enzyme cleavage. fab fragments of iga protein chr, a rheumatoid factor, showed essentially no antigen-binding activity  despite the high titers observed with the parent protein. these studies emphasize the high degree of specificity of the microbial proteases for iga and their potential for interfering with antibody activity in the iga1 subclass.

TI  == bacteriocins as factors in the in vitro interaction between oral streptococci in  plaque.
AB  == the effect of bacteriocins on the composition of dental plaque flora was studied  in vitro with bacterial plaque formed by oral streptococci on glass rods suspended in broth medium. cell-free preparations containing mutacin sw31, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus mutans, killed sensitive cells present in the plaque selectively, but did not affect resistant cells. similar preparations  from a non-bacteriocinogenic mutant exerted only a slight effect. mixed growth of bacteriocin-producing s. mutans sw31 with the sensitive s. sanguis ny101 resulted in a nearly single-strain plaque of the former. mutacin could be detected in the  plaque substance as well as in the surrounding medium. a non-bacteriocinogenic mutant, which was shown not to be altered in functions affecting growth in plaque, allowed substantial growth of s. sanguis ny101. sequential inoculation of the bacteriocinogenic plaque former s. sanguis p3a3 and the sensitive s. mutans omz61 showed that the cells of the latter are killed rapidly in established plaques when inoculated with the bacteriocinogenic strain. a trypsin-sensitive antagonistic substance could be detected in the plaque, but not in the surrounding medium. the results indicate that bacteriocins can be active in plaque in vitro and suggest that bacteriocins could play a role in determining the composition of plaque in vivo.

TI  == new method for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and its differentiation from other oral streptococci.
AB  == a new, improved agar medium for the isolation of streptococcus mutans, the etiological agent of dental caries, was developed. in contrast to mitis-salivarius agar, this medium not only recovers a greater number of s. mutans strains from most oral specimens but, because of its mannitol and sorbitol content, it also facilitates the differentiation of s. mutans from other oral streptococci, e.g., s. salivarius, s. mitis, and s. sanguis, which do not grow or produce scanty growth only after 10 days of incubation. the medium is easy to prepare because of its simple and unique composition, is characterized by the presence of an acid indicator, and can be utilized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well. the medium cannot be used to distinguish among the eight serotypes, a to g and sl-1, of s. mutans. mannitol-utilizing bacteria such as streptococci (e.g., s. faecalis) and other microorganisms (e.g., staphylococcus aureus) are able to grow on this medium and can be distinguished from s. mutans by their unique colony morphology.

AB  == phi 227, a temperate phage from a group h streptococcus (streptococcus sanguis),  was propagated vegetatively in group h strain wicky 4-eryr, and its characteristics were determined. a procedure dependent on multiplicity of infection, incubation time, and treatment of crude lysates with diatomaceous earth was found to optimize phage yield, resulting in titers of 1 x 10(10) to 2 x 10(10) pfu/ml. without prior treatment with diatomaceous earth, subsequent purification procedures (methanol, ammonium sulfate, polyethylene glycol) gave recoveries of less than 1% of crude lysate titers. adsorption of phi227 to host cells was relatively unaffected by the medium, but calcium (not substituted by magnesium) was required for formation of infectious centers. the phage receptor was present on purified cell walls, resisted trypsin and heat, and was removed ty hydrochloric acid, trichloracetic acid, and hot formamide: however, formamide-extracted material failed to inactivate phage, and the nature of the receptor is unknown. single-step growth experiments showed a latent period of 39  min and a burst size of 100 pfu/infectious center; results were unaffected by omission of supplemental ca2+, by supplementation with mg2, addition of glucose,  or changes of ph between 6.35 and 8.0; but increased temperature (40 to 43 degrees c) shortened the latent period and decreased the burst size. the latent period was prolonged in genetically competent host cells and in chemically defined medium; and in the latter, the burst size was smaller. phage replication  was sensitive to those metabolic inhibitors which inhibited the host streptococcus: these included rifampin, fluorodeoxyuridine, hydroxyurea, dihydrostreptomycin, and 6-p-hydroxyphenylazouracil. the data suggest that phi227 does not code for a rifampin-resistant rna polymerase. however, in a rifampin-resistant host strain, phage replication and lysogen formation were both decreased suggesting that altered host core polymerase had less affinity for (some) promotors on the phi227 template. in transfection, a ca2+-dependent stabilization step that was inhibited by mg2+ was demonstrated; transformation was not affected by either ca2+ or mg2+, and the site and nature of the stabilization are unknown. more than one molecule of dna was required for plaque  formation. biophysical characterization showed a type b phage of buoyant density  (cscl) 1.50, containing five proteins and 54.8% dna. the duplex linear dna had a  molecular weight (calculated from contour length) of 23.2 x 10(6) and a guanine plus cytosine content (calculated from melting point) of 42.3 mol%. similar characterizations of streptococcal phages, including biophysical data, have not been previously available.

AB  == the acid production from maltitol was compared with the acid production from hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (lycasin), sorbitol and xylitol by a number of oral strains and reference strains of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mitior, s. milleri, s. faecalis, s. faecium, s. avium, lactobacillus casei and l. salivarius. the polyols were added to a final concentration of 1.0% to two different basal media. incubation was performed at 37 degrees c for 7 days after which the ph was recorded. maltitol was fermented only by the lactobacilli (about two thirds of the strains). lycasin was fermented by all strains of s. faecalis, more than 90% of the lactobacilli, about half of the s. sanguis strains, about one third of the s. mutans strains, and by a few other streptococcal strains. acid production from sorbitol was observed among more than 80% of the s. mutans strains and the s. faecalis strains and most of the lactobacilli strains. sorbitol-fermenting strains of s. sanguis and of s. mitior, all isolated from sorbitol-consumers, were observed. no other sorbitol-fermenting streptococci were found. only the reference strains l. salivarius subsp. salivarius atcc 11741 and s. avium atcc 14025 fermented xylitol.

TI  == glucosyltransferase production by streptococcus sanguis 804 (nctc 10904).
AB  == streptococcus sanguis 804 (nctc 10904) was grown ih batch culture at constant ph. and the glucosyltransferase activity of the supernatant was assayed over a 40-h growth period. the optimum ph for enzyme production was 7.0 to 7.2. during growth of the culture, three reproducible phases of enzyme activity were observed. the polysaccharides synthesized during each of these phases were characterized as dextran-like glucans by analysis of acid hydrolysates, gas-liquid chromatography, and a specific aggregation technique. the glucans were studied further by infrared spectroscopy, enzymic degradation, and periodate oxidation. differences  in the proportions of alpha-(1 leads to 3)- and alpha-(1 leads to 6)-linkages were observed. the results suggest that glucan synthesis by s. sanguis involves a multienzyme system.

TI  == interaction of inflammatory cells and oral microorganisms. ii. modulation of rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocyte hydrolase release by polysaccharides in response to streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the release of lysosomal hydrolases from polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) has  been postulated in the pathogenesis of tissue injury in periodontal disease. in the present study, lysosomal enzyme release was monitored from rabbit peritoneal  exudate pmns exposed to streptocccus mutans or streptococcus sanguis. s. mutans grown in brain heart infusion (bhi) broth failed to promote significant pmn enzyme release. s. sanguis grown in bhi broth, although more effective than s. mutants, was a weak stimulus for promotion of pmn hydrolase release. preincubation of washed, viable s. mutans in sucrose or in different-molecular-weight dextrans resulted in the ability of the organisms to provoke pmn release reactions. this effect could bot be demonstrated with boiled  or trypsinized s. mutans or with viable s. sanguis. however, when grown in bhi broth supplemented with sucrose, but not with glucose, both s. mutans and s. sanguis triggered discharge of pmn enzymes. the mechanism(s) whereby dextran or sucrose modulates pmn-bacterial interaction may in some manner be related to promotion of microbial adhesiveness or aggregation by dextran and by bacterial synthesis of glucans from sucrose.

TI  == further studies of twitching streptococcus sanguis isolated from the human throat. isolation of strains with a new antigen.
AB  == alpha-haemolytic streptococci, classified as streptococcus sanguis, with spreading growth due to twitching mobility were isolated from 41% of 121 swab cultures from the human pharynx. sixty-five out of 70 isolates with spreading growth belonged to lancefield's group h, while 5 isolates constituted a new serological entity. none of 159 non-spreading alpha-haemolytic streptococci isolated from the same cultures possessed either of these antigens. an examination of strains of types i, ii and i/ii described by washburn et al., in the group h antisera employed in the present study indicated that type i and type i/ii differ from one another in the degree of cross-reactivity with anti-type ii  serum. (the type ii antigen was not demonstrated in any of the isolated strains). we support the opinion that type ii should not be considered as s. sanguis.

TI  == purification and some properties of free and cell-associated dextransucrase from  streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == dextransucrase of streptococcus sanguis occurred in cell-free and cell-associated forms. cell-free dextransucrase was purified by four successive chromatographies  on bio-gel p 60, deae-cellulose, and bio-gel p 200 from the culture supernatant.  the purification of cell-associated dextransucrase was made from the pellet of streptococcus sanguis culture. bacterial pellet was extracted with 1 m phosphate  buffer (ph 6.0) and chromatographied by using an immunosorbent column. the two enzymes gave single bands in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the molecular weight determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel was about 100 000  daltons for the two forms of dextransucrases. the optimum ph of the cell-free and cell-associated enzymes was around 6 and the temperature optimum was broad for the two enzymes. the km values for sucrose were respectively 2 mm and 3 mm for cell-free and cell-associated enzymes. when primer dextran was added, the reaction velocity increased but the km for sucrose remained the same, and the ka  for dextran was 200 mum for the two dextransucrases. trehalose and maltose acted  also as glucosyl residue acceptors. purified enzymes had dextran synthesising activity and invertase-like activity. the same properties of the two forms of enzymes and the positive cross reaction against anti free and anti cell-associated globulins stongly suggest the identity of the two enzymes.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibilities of streptococci from the mouth and blood of patients  treated with penicillin or lincomycin and clindamycin.
AB  == patients undergoing dental extractions were non-randomly allocated to three groups, one of which received no antibiotic, one benzylpenicillin followed by oral penicillin for 5 days, and the third intramuscular lincomycin followed by oral clindamycin. dental extraction was performed at the beginning of the course  of chemotherapy. streptococci were isolated from the extracted teeth, from blood  cultures collected before and immediately after dental extraction, and from sutures removed from the gums 5-7 days after the operation. the species of these  organisms was determined, and their susceptibilities to penicillin, clindamycin,  cephaloridine, erythromycin and tetracycline were assessed. the majority of streptococci isolated from teeth belonged to the species streptococcus sanguis, s. mitior, s. mutans and s. milleri. occasional isolates of each of these organisms collected before the antibiotic could take effect were resistant to penicillin. three of these species, but not s. mutans, were the commonest streptococci to be isolated from the blood after dental extraction. penicillin completely suppressed dental bacteriaemia under the conditions of our investigation, and lincomycin reduced the incidence by about 60 per cent. the commonest streptococci from sutures were also s. sanguis, s. mitior, s. mutans and s. milleri. s. faecalis was also isolated, but only in patients who had received antibiotics. among the non-faecalis organisms, penicillin resistance was significantly more frequent among isolates from patients given penicillin than from patients not given this antibiotic, and clindamycin resistance was significantly more frequent among isolates from patients given lincomycin and clindamycin than from patients not given these antibiotics.

TI  == initial colonization of teeth in monkeys as related to diet.
AB  == the initial phases of plaque development on nonretentive tooth surfaces were studied bacteriologically in macaca irus monkeys fed by stomach tube and provided with various oral supplements. except for the oral implantation of streptococcus  mutans in some of the animals, the oral flora was not changed prior to the studies. dental plaque was allowed to develop on initially cleaned tooth surfaces for 3 to 5 h. plaque samples were collected and cultured on a number of selective and nonselective agar media, and several hundred isolates from each sample were isolated and identified. the numerically predominant organisms in initial plaque  were s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and actinomyces viscosus. additional organisms regularly found, but usually in smaller numbers, were streptococcus mitior and a group of fastidious gram-negative rods including haemophilus species, eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetem-comitans. the colonization of s. mutans was dependent on sucrose and occurred at the expense of s. sanguis. in these experiments s. mutans accounted for 25 to 65% of the primary plaque formers. all other species encountered colonized the teeth irrespective of the diet. it is postulated that the early sucrose-dependent establishment of s. mutans directly on the enamel pellicle plays a key role in the development of a cariogenic plaque.

AB  == seven strains of viridans streptococci of the species streptococcus sanguis, s. mutans and s. mitis were investigated for autolysis. the effect of ph, salt concentration and temperature on the autolytic process was studied in na2hpo4/nah2po4 buffer. whole cells and walls of all strains autolysed most rapidly at ph values above 7. autolysis of whole cells of s. sanguis and one strain of s. mitis (atcc15909) was maximal in 0-05 to 0-2 m buffer, while the two s. mutans strains and s. mitis atcc15912 showed maximal autolysis in 0-5 and 1-0  m buffers. cultures harvested in the stationary phase of growth possessed only slightly decreased autolytic activity compared with those from the exponential phase. whole cells autolysed more rapidly at 37 degrees c than at 45 degrees c and 10 degrees c. autolysis of isolated walls of three strains of s. mitis (atcc903, atcc15909 and atcc15912) was maximal at ph 7-0 and 7-5 and in 1-0 m buffers. streptococcus mitis atcc15909 also showed maximal lysis in 0-01 m and 0-5 m buffers. an endopeptidase action of the autolytic system of s. mitis atcc15912 was indicated by the progressive release of soluble amino groups during autolysis of the walls. no release of reducing groups was observed. several free  amino acids were released during autolysis of these walls, alanine, lysine and glutamic acid being in greatest quanitity.

TI  == occurrence and distribution of sucrose-metabolizing enzymes in oral streptococci.
AB  == specific growth rates, growth yields, and the level and cellular distribution of  three sucrose-metabolizing enzyme activities were determined for seven oral streptococci (streptococcus mutans strains e49, bht, 10449, sl-1, and lm-7, s. sanguis 10558, and s. salivarius 25975). cultures were grown in a fermentor at ph 6 with either 20 mm glucose or 10 mm sucrose. generation times varied between 21  and 70 min. whereas some strains grew 10 to 50% more slowly with sucrose than with glucose, others did not. growth was always logarithmic, and the growth yields were similar. glcosyl transferase (ec 2.4.1.5) was largely extracellular;  in sucrose cultures it was appreciably lower, but no major shift to a cell-associated form was found. in glucose cultures, the activity varied between  4 and 140 iu per 6-liter culture. the glucan formed was mostly or exclusively water insoluble. glcosyl transferase was stimulated weakly (60% or less) by various dextrans. fructosyl transferase (ec 2.4.1.10) was primarily extracellular (except in glucose cultures of s. salivarius) and varied between 0 and 337 iu/culture. in s. salivarius, the extracellular fructosyl transferase was induced by sucrose. in all s. mutans cultures, the total fructosyl transferase activity was lower after growth with sucrose. all strains had extra- and intracellular invertase (ec 3.2.1.26) activity. total levels varied between 210 and 3,500 iu/culture. less extracellular activity was present in sucrose cultures. only s.  salivarius had appreciable activity in the cellular particulate fraction. invertase activity was significantly higher than the combined glucosyl and fructosyl transferase activities in all cultures.

AB  == cell-mediated immunity (cmi) and humoral mediated immunity (hmi) against streptococcal and adult human oral mucosa (ahom) antigens were investigated in patients with inactive and active recurrent aphthous stomatitis (ras). the cmi and hmi were examined by means of the leucocyte migration test (lmt) and a double layer immunofluorescence (if) technique. the cmi against streptococcus sanguis strain 2a, streptococcus pyogenes strain m5, and ahom was significantly increased in inactive and active ras. significant difference between active and inactive ras was only demonstrated when strep. 2a was used as antigen in the leucocyte migration cultures. longitudinal observations in relation to exacerbation of ras  revealed significant changes in the migration indices (mi) when strep. 2a and ahom were used as antigens. extracts of strep. m5 and other tissues as kidney and uterus did not show any significant changes of mi in relation to the exacerbation of ras. the if-investigations detected significantly raised igg antibodies against washed whole cells of streptococcus sanguis strain 2a and streptococcus pyogenes strain m5 in sera from patients with ras. the autoantibodies in ras belonged to the immunoglobulin classes igg and igm. the detected antibodies were  able to blind serum complement (c3). the distribution of endpoint titres (ept) against strep. 2a, strep. m5, and ahom antigens did not differ significantly in patients with active ras in relation to those with inactive ras. furthermore, the ept against strep. 2a and ahom were not significantly changed in relation to exacerbation of ras. the present investigations show that cmi and hmi against streptococcal and ahom antigens are characteristic features of ras and indicate that the cmi against strep. 2a and ahom is significantly increased in relation to exacerbation of ras.

TI  == streptococci and aerococci associated with systemic infection in man.
AB  == a collection of 820 isolates of streptococci and aerococci from human blood or internal organs was classified by means of a set of cultural and biochemical tests. of these, 719 (712 streptococci and 7 aerococci) were from patients believed to be suffering from a systemic infection: endocarditis 317; a purulent  lesion in an internal organ ("purulent disease") 152; bacteriaemia 250. the endocarditis streptococci included members of all recognisable taxa, but only certain of these were common: streptococcus sanguis, 16-4%; dextran-positive and  usually mannitol-fermenting strains of s. bovis (s. bovis i), 15-1%; s. mutans, 14-2%; s. mitior, 13-2%. streptococci of the "alpha-haemolytic" taxa (s. sanguis, s. mitior and related strains) formed only 44-8% of the total. when the percentage frequency of streptococcal taxa among the endocarditis and "non-endocarditis" isolates was compared, the dextran-forming taxa (s. mutans, s. bovis i, s. sanguis, and dextran-positive streptococci otherwise resembling s. mitior) all had higher "endocarditis : non-endocarditis" ratios than did any of the non-dextran-producing taxa. endocarditis increased in frequency with age, and showed an excess of males over females up to the age of 65 years. in young patients (less than 35 years), "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci predominated; with increasing age, the proportion of other streptococci increased progressively but  the absolute numbers of isolations of "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci did not fall. infections with s. mutans were prominent in the age-group 35-54 years and with s. bovis i at ages greater than or equal to 55 years. a history of previous  heart disease was more often obtained in endocarditis due to "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci than in other streptococcal endocarditis. the streptococcus most often isolated from purulent lesions in internal organs was s. milleri (29-3%). it was associated with brain abscess, meningitis, pleural empyema and a variety of intra-abdominal abscesses. the only common predisposing factor in endocarditis was previous heart damage. in other systemic streptococcal diseases, other general or local predisposing causes could be observed, mainly in infections with the "pyogenic" groupable streptococci, the enterococci and s. milleri.

AB  == investigators have used chemotherapeutic agents topically for plaque control without knowing the drug concentration necessary to inhibit the growth of odontopathic microorganisms. s mutans, s sanguis, a viscosus and a naeslundii are important components of the plaque flora. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of niddamycin, vancomycin, bacitracin, and kanamycin were determined for each organism in liquid culture. these antibiotics were selected because of their low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. niddamycin, vancomycin, and bacitracin had the lowest mic, from 0.2 to 10 units/ml. kanamycin was inhibitory only at much higher concentrations (130 to 500 units/ml). the corresponding mbc was generally higher  than the mic. a viscosus was the most resistant organism tested. these data are important in designing controlled release devices for delivering a suitable antibiotic on a continuous basis intraorally.

TI  == nutritional determinants of the ecology of the oral flora.
AB  == consideration of nutritional factors as determinants of oral microbial ecology leads to the conclusion that endogenous factors play a dominant role. it is the interactions between specific microorganisms and nutritional and other factors provided by the host that selectively determine the kinds of microorganisms which willinitially reside in the oral cavity and the sites which they will colonize. the persistence of these original "colonists" in their respective ecologic niches will depend in part on the accessibility of endogenous nutrients variously provided by saliva, tissue exudates, crevicular fluids, or degenerating host cells. it will also depend on their response to and interaction with microorganisms which immigrate to that site subsequently. the microbial ecology of a given site is therefore rarely uncomplicated, the notable exception occurring at the most microscopic level where one may encounter microcolonies of  individual species within more heterogenous populations of microorganisms. the extent of this heterogeneity quantitatively and qualitatively is a reflection of  the degree to which the interactions between the resident flora and the new arrivals, plus the local environmental changes which they both generate, serve to promote or to discourage the survival and growth of the individual species. this  element of heterogeneity in a dynamic system with its inherent potential for variation makes it possible for relatively minor changes in local environmental conditions to result in significant differences in the microflora between one site and another even though they may be in close proximity to each other. once this concept is appreciated it becomes easy to understand how disease processes such as dental caries may affect specific areas of a tooth while nearby areas are unaffected. the effects of exogenous nutrients on the ecology of the oral microbiota, nevertheless cannot be ignored. the diet may modulate such endogenous factors as the salivary secretions and the local resistance of the gingival tissues to infections. although at our present state of knowledge the direct influence of dietary proteins and fats on the oral microbiota is thought to be of relatively minor consequence, dietary carbohydrates are of major ecological significance. dietary sugars provide readily available substrates for the oral microorganisms, most of which depend on carbohydrates for energy sources. the metabolism of dietary sucrose by s. sanguis and s. mutans with the productions of acids and intracellular and extracellular polysaccharides has specific influence  on the microbial composition, metabolic activities, and mass of coronal plaque. the ready availability of dietary carbohydrates undoubtedly influences the microflora of other parts of the oral cavity as well, eic species or indirectly through the interactions of other organisms with them...

TI  == enhanced transformability with heterospecific deoxyribonucleic acid in a streptococcus sanguis mutant impaired in ribonucleic acid polymerase activity.
AB  == we have induced with nitrosoguanidine in streptococcus sanguis a mutation conferring inability to grow and synthesize ribonucleic acid (rna) at 42 c, the optimal temperature for growth and rna synthesis in the parental strain. the mutation (ts) is transferable via transforming deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) and is replaceable by its wild-type allele with fairly high efficiency in transformation reactions. the ts mutation is unlinked to the sites of mutation conferring resistance of rifampin (rifr) and streptolydigin (stgr), known to affect the beta subunit of dna-dependent rna polymerase. extracts from strains carrying the ts mutation are more sensitive to elevated temperatures than are parental extracts when assayed for dna-dependent rna polymerase. the conclusion that the mutation causes a temperature-sensitive defect in some component of this enzyme (other than beta) is supported by the finding that the polymerase activity of a heat-inactivated ts stgr extract cannot be increased by addition of an unheated ts stgs extract, which is itself inactivated by streptolydigin. s. sanguis recipients carrying the ts mutation are highly transformable with heterospecific  dna, especially at the restrictive temperature.

AB  == in vitro demonstration of cell-mediated immunity (cmi) against adult human oral mucosa antigen (ahom) and streptococcal antigens was accomplished by means of the leucocyte migration test (lmt) in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (ras). if antigenic extracts of ahom, streptococcus sanguis strain 2a or streptococcus pyogenes strain m5 were used in the lmt experiments, the distribution of migration indices (mi) over patients with ras differed significantly from the distribution over the controls. in patients with other oral lesions, these mi-distributions did not differ significantly from those among the controls. extracts of other tissues such as kidney and uterus tissues or of other bacterial antigens such as brucella abortus and escherichia coli did  not reveal any significant differences between the lmt responses in ras and controls. the present findings show that cim against ahom antigen and streptococcal antigens are features characteristic of ras. furthermore, the results indicate that common antigenic determinants might be shared by ahom and streptococci.

AB  == the dynamics of infection and response to penicillin g (p) or combined p plus streptomycin (s) therapy were studied in a rabbit model of penicillin-sensitive streptococcus sanguis endocarditis. increased delay between infection and initiation of treatment required longer duration of therapy to effect a cure. irrespective of the interval between infection and onset of therapy, p combined with s regularly eliminated streptococci from endocardial vegetations more rapidly than p alone, both in the presence and absence of an intracardiac catheter--although the difference in response was more marked with the catheter present. the combination of p and s consistently showed superior in vivo bactericidal activity compared to p alone in established s. sanguis endocarditis.

TI  == dextran-mediated interbacterial aggregation between dextran-synthesizing streptococci and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans bind to the surface of actinomyces viscosus, producing large microbial aggregates. aggregates form rapidly and are not easily dissociated by vigorous mixing. the binding is mediated by dextran. glucose-grown streptococci will not aggregate unless they are first mixed with high-molecular-weight dextran. aggregation is induced with dextrans isolated from leuconostoc, s. sanguis, or s. mutans. sucrose-grown streptococci will adhere to  a. viscosus without the addition of an exogenous source of dextran. a. viscosus will bind dextran and then bind glucose-grown streptococci. aggregation occurs over a wide ph range and is dependent on cations. the aggregating activity of a.  viscosus is both protease and heat sensitive. the aggregating activity of s. sanguis is heat stable but sensitive to dextranase.

TI  == relationship of the cell wall composition of group h streptococci and streptococcus sanguis to their serological properties.
AB  == previous studies indicated the a antigen was widely distributed among strains of  streptococcus sanguis and the group h streptococci. the cell walls of strains containing this antigen had moderate to large quantities of rhamnose, small amounts of phosphorus, and little to no ribitol. the molar ratios of the peptidoglycan amino acids and hexosamines suggested a di-alanyl cross bridge. the homogeneity of the walls of these strains suggested that serological group h can  be considered synonymous with s. sanguis. in contrast those strains that did not  contain the a antigen had only small amounts of rhamnose in their cell walls, galactosamine and ribitol were always detected, and large quantitites of phosphorus were present. the molar ratios of peptidoglycan components in the latter strains suggested a direct alanyl-lysl cross bridge. although many of these strains had been classified either as s. sanguis or group h streptococci because of minor serological cross-reactions and similar biochemical properties,  the distinct differences between the composition of their cell walls and those of s. sanguis and group h streptococci indicate that they do not belong in this species or group. the cell walls of strains containing the a antigen are relatively homogeneous and therefore it is suggested that cells containing this antigen be considered lancefield serological group h.

TI  == in vitro attachment of streptococcus sanguis to dental crown and bridge cements.
AB  == the ability of a common dental plaque bacterium, streptococcus sanguis, to adhere to dental crown and bridge cements in vitro was investigated. cylindrical blocks  of five different commercial brands of cement, with and without acquired pellicles, were indubated with buffer suspensions of s. sanguis for 1 h. attached bacteria were counted under the microscope. s. sanguis had particularly high affinity for uncoated resin cement. in contrast, the carboxylate cement tested was a poor substrate for the adherence of this bacterium. the other cement types  (zinc phosphate, zinc oxide and silico-phosphate) had intermediary qualities as adhering surfaces. the presence of an acquired pellicle, obtained by pretreatment with saliva, influenced the initial adherence of bacteria to cement in vitro. on  the resin cement a salivary pellicle strongly suppressed the bacterial adhesion.  for the zinc phosphate, zinc oxide and silico-phosphate cements a pellicle slightly enhanced the attachment of s. sanguis. on the carboxylate cement only few organisms attached also after pretreatment with saliva.

TI  == streptoccus mutans dextransucrase: purification, properties, and requirement for  primer dextran.
AB  == we attempted to purify dextransucrase from s mutans strain 6715 to investigate its properties and determine if multiple species of the enzyme existed. it was concluded that the properties of this enzyme such as the ph (5.5), temperature (37 c) optimum, and km for sucrose (3 mm) are very similar to those reported for  s sanguis, s bovis, s mutans strain omz-176 isozymes, s mutans strain gs-5, and the single dextransucrase purified from s mutans strain hs-6. the ief enzyme preparation consisted of two enzyme species, possibly differing in their ability  to synthesize different dextran linkages. the minor enzyme activity demonstrated  a strict primer dependency. similarly, primer dependency has been reported for dextransucrases from s mutans, s sanguis, and l mesenteroides. s mutans strain 6715 dextransucrase also showed both the insertion and stepwise mechanisms for dextran synthesis. sucrose was the sole glucose donor, whereas dextran was a specific, highly efficient glucose acceptor. the complex primer kinetics are not  fully understood at this time and require further investigation. without linkage  analysis of the products of our enzymes, we can only postulate that each enzyme has a different function in the synthesis of interresidue and interchain alpha1-3 and alpha1-6 bonds. insoluble dextran synthesis may involve a special enzyme mechanism characteristic of s mutans. this synthesis would require both enzymes,  possibly in some aggregated form, with one enzyme synthesizing endogenous primer  dextran. this endogeneous primer or some cell wall polysaccharide could stimulate both enzymes to rapidly synthesize heterogeneously linked insoluble dextran.

TI  == some serological cross-reactions between streptococcus mutans, s sanguis, and other dental plaque streptococci.
AB  == from the preliminary observations described in this report, the following conclusions may be drawn. when attempting to produce diagnostic antiserums specific for s mutans, s mitior, or s sanguis, care must be taken to eliminate cross-reactions as a result of antibodies against extracellular glucans or dextrans. other antigenic components, associated with the cell wall, may be common to different species. one soluble protein or polypeptide antigen normally  present in s sanguis and s mitior may also be demonstrated in certain strains of  s mutans. antiserums prepared against s sanguis, s mitior, or s mutans should be  carefully checked for interspecies cross-reactions before being used for identification purposes.

TI  == immunologic basis for vaccination against dental caries in rhesus monkeys.
AB  == the effects of immunization with streptococcus mutans on the development of caries and the immune responses were investigated in 37 young rhesus monkeys (macaca mulatta) during a period of up to 33 months. the monkeys were supplied a  human type of carbohydrate-rich diet that contained about 15% sucrose. the monkeys were separated into seven groups, and the effects of two whole cell vaccines and an extracellular culture extract of s mutans in freund's incomplete  adjuvant were compared with a vaccine of a noncariogenic streptococcus cht, the adjuvant alone, and a sham immunized group. sequential analysis of complement fixing, hemagglutinating and precipitating antibodies to the cell wall, and extracellular culture extract have shown that a significant reduction in smooth surface and fissure caries resulted from immunization with the s mutans vaccines, if antibodies reached an optimum level before caries development started. protection was not elicited by the culture extract of s mutans or the noncariogenic streptococcus cht vaccines. a recently developed bacteriological sampling technique of crevicular fluid, plaque, and saliva showed that caries reduction in immunized animals was associated with a significantly decreased percentage of s mutans in crevicular fluid. immunochemical studies showed igg and igm classes of antibodies in serum and secretory iga antibodies in saliva, but it appears that reduction in caries was best associated with serum igg antibodies to the culture extract of s mutans. the humoral and cellular mechanisms involved in  the immunologic control of caries are discussed in terms of a central afferent mechanism required for antigen processing and cellular proliferation, and two peripheral effector mechanisms that function in the crevicular and salivary domains.

TI  == effect of ph on competence development and deoxyribonucleic acid uptake in streptococcus sanguis (wicky).
AB  == streptococcus sanguis (wicky) cells, strain we4, developed little or no competence and failed to autolyze in permissive conditions when treated with competence factor (cf) below ph 7.0. this lack of activity was directly correlated with the inability of the cells to bind or take up cf at ph values of  5.5, 6.0, and 6.5. on the other hand, competent cells bound deoxyribonucleic acid molecules maximally below ph 7.0 and transformed maximally at ph 6.5. deoxyribonucleic acid was optimally bound to cells in a deoxyribonuclease-resistant form at ph values between 7.0 and 8.5. concomitant with this binding, undefined acid-soluble dna fragments appeared in the culture menstrua. cf binding and uptake by cells was not only influenced by low ph but also by low temperature. at 0 c, we4 cells bound only 4% of the input cf and took up less than 1% into a trypsin-insensitive state compared to cells treated at 37  c. cells treated with cf at 0 c did not autolyze when transferred to permissive conditions. the results presented in this report extend earlier findings that showed that competence development and autolysis are related to the uptake of cf.

AB  == bacteriocin-like activities were detected in 78% of 120 alpha-hemolytic streptococcal isolates. inhibitory substances from three such isolates (one streptococcus sanguis strain and two s. mitis strains) were investigated further  and termed viridins (a, b, and c). the viridins were unique among bacteriocins of gram-positive bacteria in that they inhibited many gram-negative bacteria in addition to inhibition of a variety of gram-positive organisms. viridins were obtained in a cell-free state only after mechanical disruption of bacteriocinogenic cells but could not be isolated from supernatant fluids of cultures of such bacteria or from freeze-thaw liquor of agar on which the bacteria had been grown. viridin b could be partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and by gel filtration on a sephadex g-100 column. this bacteriocin had some unusual properties including heat lability, a narrow ph range of activity, and lack of adsorptive capacity to susceptible bacteria. although viridin b was bactericidal to a neisseria sicca strain, it was only bacteriostatic against a coagulase-negative staphylococcus.

TI  == strain typing of oral streptococci by the use of bacterial antagonism.
AB  == strain-typing methods utilizing microbial antagonism have been developed for s sanguis and for s mutans. the inhibition observed resembled that of bacteriocins. inhibition within the species s sanguis was obtained with group d streptococci and facultative members of the genus bacillus. thirty-three inhibitors were paired (not in all possible combinations) with 37 isolates of s sanguis. depending on the inhibitor, growth of between 15 and 85% of the sensitive indicators was halted. three of the inhibitors manifested identical patterns of inhibition. of the 37 s sanguis isolates, 34 exhibited individual patterns of inhibition. the three exceptions could be differentiated by their antagonism against sensitive indicators of s mutans. variations in susceptibility to antagonism produced by group d streptococci allowed each of ten strains of s mutans to be typed. present work for typing the oral streptococci is focused on computer-assisted searches for minimal typing sets. s mutans is sensitive to inhibition by some members of the species s sanguis. from a group of 58 challengers, 44 inhibited at least one of ten strains of s mutans, and 11 strains of s sanguis were able to halt the growth of half or more of the sensitive indicators. these results are useful not only for strain typing but form the basis for in vivo competition studies.

TI  == selective adherence as a determinant of the host tropisms of certain indigenous and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the relationship between the selective abilities of bacteria to adhere and their  predilections for colonizing different mammalian hosts was investigated by using  bacteria indigenous to the tongue dorsum of humans and rats as models. streptococcus salivarius and s. sanguis averaged 22.6 and 2.8%, respectively, of  the cultivable bacteria recovered from swab samples of the tonges of five humans, but these organisms were not indigenous on the tongues of rats (charles river strain). s. faecalis and serum-requiring diphtheroids were consistently prominant on the tongues of rats, but they were not detected on the tongues of the humans examined. the ability of these organisms to adhere to the tongue surface of the hosts was compared by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of human volunteers and rats. s. salivarius adhered in higher proportions to the dorsal tongue surface of humans than did strains of s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid. s. sanguis also adhered to human tongues better than the serum-requiring diphtheroid. however, s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid sorbed in higher proportions to the tongues of rats.  in an in vivo assay, human strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius attached in higher numbers to buccal epithelial cells derived from humans than to those obtained from rats, whereas the reverse was observed with a serum-requiring diphtheroid derived from rats. collectively, these studies show that bacteria sorb with a high degree of specificity to the tissues of different mammalian hosts, and the relative adherence of the organisms studied correlated with their  natural host tropisms. the selective adherence of s. salvarius and s. faecalis was similar to the tongues of conventional and germ-free rats, suggesting that the presence of an indigenous bacterial flora did not significantly influence their attachment selectivity. moreover, the ability of these organisms to colonize the tongues of gnotobiotic rats lacking an indigenous flora paralleled their adherence selectivity. direct scanning microscopic observations indicated that the tongue dorsum of conventional rats is highly papillated but contains relatively sparse bacterial populations. indigenous organisms colonized the bases of papillae on the anterior tip and lateral edges of the tongue as discrete microcolonies, but bacteria were rarely observed on other papillae. this localized and restricted pattern of colonization and the spatial distribution of  the microcolonies of indigenous bacteria present also suggest that antagonistic interactions are unlikely to account for the bacterial tropisms observed for colonization of the tongues of rats.

TI  == optimum immunization of rabbits for streptococcus mutans antiserum and conjugate  production and studies of batch immunoabsorption methods.
AB  == by far, the most significant rises in titers were seen with the immunization protocol used in series 6. conjugates prepared from bleedings on the 33rd day produced exceptionally high titers for type b s mutans, and reasonably high titers for type a were obtained in a short time. a concentrated antigen with formalin (13.4 ml) was given during a ten-day period followed by a two-week rest  period, after which booster doses of either antigen with formalin or live antigen were given (fig 1). based on evaluation of the immunization protocol just described, series 6 resulted in the highest titered reagents, but the data are insufficient to permit recommending that particular schedule without limitations. our experience in the use of live antigens of s mutans for immunization is limited in that only types b, c, and e have been used in this way. the rabbits survived these injections, but the pathogenicity of other strains and other serotypes has not been determined. in addition, protocols including combined injections of killed and living organisms should be tested further for possible improvement in antibody production. in view of these considerations, our recommendations for production of high titered antiserums for s mutans in rabbits are as follows: -take a preimmunization bleeding from each rabbit and screen by indirect fa tests with the antigens to be used. -inject heavy concentrations (40  iu/ml) of formalin-killed cells, intravenously. -inject for eight to ten consecutive days, giving increasing doses of antigen ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 ml for a total of 12 to 15 ml. -rest the rabbits for one week. if you are monitoring the progress of immunization, bleed the rabbits before giving booster injections. -give booster injections on four consecutive days, giving 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 ml of live antigen that has been washed one time to remove traces of media and adjusted to a concentration of 40 iu/ml. if live antigen is not used, continue to give booster injections with killed antigen, injecting 2.0 ml on each of three consecutive days. -rest the rabbits for one week and take sufficient blood to produce the trial reagents needed, or exsaguinate the rabbits. absorption of type a conjugates resulted in the total loss of titer for type a cells. the cross-reactions with type b conjugate were easily eliminated by dilution, with the exception of the cross-reaction with s sanguis jc-43. bratthall's absorption  method eliminated all cross-reactions of the type b conjugate. absorption of type c conjugate successfully removed the cross-reaction with type e cells; however, the loss of homologous type c titer was so great that this absorption is of limited value. high-titered conjugates for types d and e have been obtained by using batch absorption procedures.

TI  == turku sugar studies xx. microbiological findings and plaque index values in relation to 1-year use of xylitol chewing gum.
AB  == the aim was to study possible alterations in the microbial flora of plaque and saliva in relation to partial substitution of dietary sucrose with xylitol. the development of plaque index values was observed simultaneously. these observations were carried out during a 1-year clinical trial, the effects of sucrose (s) and xylitol (x) chewing gum on the incidence of dental caries being observed in 100 young adults. paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were diluted stepwise and cultivated on rogosa s.l. agar and sabouraud agar aerobically. lyophilized dental plaque samples were cultivated on phenol red agar under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. the ph-values were measured after incubating the mixed plaque flora for 1 and 7 days in the presence of various sugars. both the arithmetic and geometric means of the total cfu values on rogosa s.l. agar decreased in the s-group at the 6-month phase but returned to the starting level  after one year, whereas in the x-group they decreased or remained on the starting level. at the 6-month phase the difference between the groups was significant (u-test, p = 0.0013) and almost significant (u-test, p = 0.0569) at the end of the study. no significant differences or changes could be seen between or within  the groups on sabouraud agar. the geometric mean values of s. sanguis and s. mutans as well as the total cfu values on phenol red agar decreased considerably  in both the s- and x-groups, but no significant differences could be detected in  any of the streptococcal counts between the groups. the ph of the carbohydrate-containing culture media infected with mixed dental plaque significantly decreased, with the exception of the xylitol containing ones in which the ph values were not lowered even after 7 days' incubation. a significant decrease in plaque formation in relation of chewing per se was demonstrable. the  difference in the plaque index values equalling or exceeding 2 was significant between the s- and x-groups. no bacterial adaptation to utilize xylitol occurred  during the trial.

AB  == reactions between selected strains of oral streptococci and saliva were studied spectrophotometrically. the curves of absorbance (700 nm) versus those of time were sigmoidal for aggregating saliva-bacteria mixtures. whtn the logarithm of the ratio of the change in absorbance to the remaining absorbance was plotted against the reaction time, straight lines were obtained. at a fixed concentration of bacteria, the slope of these lines for a series of dilutions of a selected saliva sample was a parabolic function of the volume of saliva in the reaction mixtures. a model for the aggregation reaction was developed which explained the  shape of these parabolic curves. the parameters of the model can be calculated from the experimental data and can be used to estimate the concentration of aggregation-inducing substances in undiluted saliva. a method for calculating the specific rate constant for the binding of free cells to aggregates was developed. this rate constant is a characteristic feature of a given aggregation reaction and can, in principle, be used to distinguish between aggregation-inducing substances of different molecular structures.

TI  == isolation and purification of flavobacterium alpha-1,3-glucanase-hydrolyzing, insoluble, sticky glucan of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == studies were made on the physical and chemical properties of polysaccharides synthesized by cell-free extracts of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus sp. and their susceptibilities to dextranases. among the polysaccharides examined, insoluble glucans were rather resistant to available dextranase preparations, and the insoluble, sticky glucan produced by s. mutans omz 176, which could be important in formation of dental plaques, was the most resistant. by enrichment culture of soil specimens, using omz 176 glucans as the  sole carbon source, an organism was isolated that produced colonies surrounded by a clear lytic zone on opaque agar plates containing the omz 176 glucan. the organism was identified as a strain of flavobacterium and named the ek-14 bacterium. ek-14 bacterium was grown in trypticase soy broth, and an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the omz 176 glucan was concentrated from the culture supernatant and purified by negative adsorption on a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose  (de-32) column and gradient elution chromatography with a carboxymethyl-cellulose (cm-32) column. the enzyme was a basic protein with an isoelectric point of ph 8.5 and molecular weight of 65,000. its optimum ph was 6.3 and its optimal temperature was 42 c. the purified enzyme released 11% of the total glucose residues of the omz 176 glucan as reducing sugars and solubilized about half of the substrate glucan. the products were found to be isomaltose, nigerose, and nigerotriose, with some oligosaccharides. the purified enzyme split the alpha-1,3-glucan endolytically and was inactive toward glucans containing alpha-1,6, alpha-1,4, beta-1,3, beta-1,4, and/or beta-1,6 bonds as the main linkages.

AB  == a study was made of the species composition of symbiotic microbial flora of the nasopharynx in healthy persons and meningococcus carriers, inhibiting in vitro the growth of the test strains of miningococci. saprophytic streptococci and particularly str. salivarius served as the principal and the most active antagonists of meningococci in both groups of the persons examined. comparison of the inhibitory activity of antagonists in the groups examined revealed no significant differences. however, there were seen differences in the quantitative composition of the isolated antagonists: saprophytic streptococci, particularly str. salivarius were isolated in great amounts, and more frequently from healthy  individuals, and nondifferentiated gram positive cocci of conditionally distinguished group--from carriers. taking into consideration the high inhibitory activity of str. salivarius it is supposed that it can be used as an indicator of the state of insensitiveness of the human organism to the meningococcus infection.

AB  == cell wall and membrane teichoic acids from several bacteria formed soluble complexes with polysaccharides and bovine plasma in alkyl alcohol solutions. polysaccharides which contain different monomeric units and anomeric configurations complexed with the teichoic acids, suggesting that the interaction is relatively nonspecific. teichoic acids complexed glycogen or bovine plasma albumin in 50 to 97% ethanol solutions. the macromolecular association between teichoic acids and polysaccharides or proteins was independent of teichoic acid size over a threefold molecular weight range. glycerol phosphates or an acid hydrolysate of teichoic acid would not complex to either glycogen or bovine plasma albumin in ethanol. the optimal interaction between glycogen and the bacillus subtilis lipoteichoic acid occurred between ph 4.5 and 8.2. the ability  of teichoic acids to bind polysaccharides and proteins in moderate dielectric constant solvents suggests that these polymers may serve as complexing agents for hydrophilic molecules found in membranes.

TI  == genetic hybridization at the unlinked thy and str loci of streptococcus.
AB  == the sanguis and pneumoniae species of streptococcus were used as recipients in transformations from str+ to str-r and from thy- to thy+. the str-r mutations in  the two species had been previously shown to be allelic. homology of the thy- mutations in the two species was demonstrated in the similar phenotypic properties they conferred (death in the absence of thymidine, lack of thymidylate synthetase). the str and thy loci are unlinked in each species.--- when the two species are transformed by both homospecific and heterospecific dna, the efficiency is always lower in the heterospecific cross. the efficiency of heterospecific transformation is considerably lower at the thy than at the str locus. dna was extracted from recipients that had integrated markers of heterospecific origin. when such hybrid dna is tested on the original recipient species, the heterospecific markers are usually as efficient as homospecific markers. when tested on the original donor species, however, the hybrid dna is usually more efficient than heterospecific dna. this is true for both thy and str transformation. -- -- forty independent thy+ hybrids were obtained in the cross of sanguis thy- recipients with pneumoniae thy+ dna. these hybrids fall into a number of classes based upon the relative efficiency with which their extracted dna's are able to transfer the thy+ marker into pneumoniae thy- cells. the most efficient of these dna's exhibits about 20% of the efficiency of homospecific pneumoniae thy+ dna and three orders of magnitude greater efficiency than heterospecific sanguis thy+ dna. thus, very little of the inefficiency of heterospecific transformation of the thy locus is ascribable to a classic restriction mechanism. rather, the wild-type thy+ loci in the two species appear  to differ at multiple sites, and independent heterospecific transfers result in differential extents of integration of these sites. on this basis, the thy+ loci  of the two species differ at a greater number of sites than do the respective str+ loci.

TI  == amino acid requirements and proteolytic activity of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the growth response of streptococcus sanguis groups 1:a and 1:b in a complete chemically defined medium was not influenced by the oxygen concentration of the growth atmosphere. all of the cultures required cysteine and arginine; tyrosine and branched-chain amino acids were frequently required. proteolysis of casein, mucin, and the anionic proteins of germfree rat saliva by s. sanguis was demonstrated. hydrolytic activity toward casein was found in the soluble contents of the cells and in the cellular debris after disruption of the cells, with the soluble fractions exhibiting greater proteolytic activity toward casein. the soluble fractions from s. sanguis did not hydrolyze mucin, but this substrate was hydrolyzed by the cell debris fraction. when the amino acid requirements and proteolytic activity of s. sanguis and s. mutans were compared, these two oral streptococcal species exhibited distinct and characteristic differences.

TI  == characterization of an antibody directed against a surface component of normal and pleomorphic cells of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == whole cells of streptococcus sanguis were utilized as an immunoadsorbent to purify large quantities of an antibody (s1) directed against a cell surface component. the s-1 antibody was isolated from antisera to normal (n) and pleomorphic (o) cells by a similar adsorption-elution procedure. the s-1 antibody isolated from antisera to n cells reacted in gel diffusion in identify with the s-1 antibody to o cells, indicating that the antigen which binds s-1 antibody (ag-1) may not be radically altered when cells become pleomorphic. the s-1 antibodies directed against both n and o cells had restricted heterogeneity, indicating that for both types of cell ag-1 may have a simple repeating structure. however, n cells were agglutinated to a greater extent by s-1 antibody than o cells. in addition the distribution of the bound s-1 antibody became altered as the cells became pleomorphic. utilizing the technique of indirect immunofluorescence we observed that the s-1 antibody was distributed evenly on the surface of n cells. as the cells became pleomorphic, the antibody appeared to bind preferentially at the cell poles (capping). later, as the cells became more  grossly deformed, additional bands of immunofluorescence appeared to bisect the cells. electron microscopic analysis indicated that the bound antibody was not associated with septal notches. the results suggest that the arrangement rather than the immunological properties of ag-1 became altered as cells became pleomorphic.

TI  == a transforming marker that produces merodiploids with high efficiency and stable  transformants with low efficiency in streptococcus.
AB  == a mutation (ery-r8) conferring a high level of resistance to erythromycin in the  challis strain of streptoccus sanguis can be transferred to wild-type erythromycin-sensitive recipients via single molecules of donor dna. the transformants thus produced are of two types: (1) cells slightly more resistant to erythromycin than wild-type and capable of segregating (at a frequency of 2 x  10(-4)/bacterium/generation) either wild-type or highly-resistant cells like the  original donor type; (2) cells phenotypically and genotypically identical to the  original donor type. the unstable diploids (ery-r8/+) occur with a frequency equivalent to that obtained with high-efficiency (he) markers, whereas the stable donor-type (ery-r8) transformants occur with about five hundred times lower frequency. penetration of the wild-type recipient by more than one molecule of dna bearing the ery-r8 marker increases by as much as seven times the incidence of stable transformants. uv-irradiation of molecules bearing the ery-r8 marker diminishes their ability to cooperate in producing a stable transformant, although the uv sensitivity of stable transformant production by a single dna molecule is not different from that of diploid production. hence, stable transformants do not appear to be produced by a process typical of low efficiency (le) markers, which are generally highly sensitive to ultraviolet irradiation. moreover, stable ery-r8 transformants are produced with equally low frequencies in strains of s. pneumoniae that discriminate (hex+) and fail to discriminate (hex--) between he and le markers. we postulate that all transformations by the ery-r8 marker result in ery-r8/+ diploids, and that segregation results in the infrequent stable transformants of the original donor type. this hypothesis is supported by the observations that rifampin treatment of ery-r8/+ populations increases the frequency of segregation and similar treatment of wild-type recipients under-going transformation by the ery-r8 marker increases the frequency of stable transformants.--in producing the ery-r8/+ transformant the r8 allele is integrated close to the site of its wild-type homolog, since single molecules of dna from this transformant can be shown to carry both alleles. segregation of either the ery-r8 or + allele is not detectably enhanced by acridine orange or thymidine deprivation.--the ery-r8 marker occurs close to a site of mutation (ery-r2) which confers erythromycin resistance upon ribosomes. when the r2 and r8 markers are jointly transferred, ery-r2-r8/+ genomes are produced in which the r2 marker is stably integrated but the r8 marker is unstably adjoined to its wild-type homolog. thus, the duplicated region can be quite short. when the ery-r8 marker is stably integrated, the region of the marker is refractory to subsequent transformation. markers with properties like ery-r8 are not particularly rare, being found with a frequency of about 4% among  spontaneous mutations to erythromycin resistance.

TI  == evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic streptococcus for production of iga protease.
AB  == iga protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma iga of human origin to yield intact fabalpha and fcalpha fragments. to determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known lancefield group serotype. streptococci of groups a, b, c, d, f, g, h, m, and n, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, veillonella, lactobacillus, actinomyces, propionibacterium, bacteroides, and fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for iga protease activity. only s. sanguis and clinically isolated group h streptococci elaborated iga protease under the culture conditions used. negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the  enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory iga. among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce iga protease is restricted to certain species of streptococcus, notably those of the group h serotype. since secretory immunity is mediated by the iga class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.

TI  == inhibition of streptococcal attachment to receptors on human buccal epithelial cells by antigenically similar salivary glycoproteins.
AB  == preparations of salivary glycoproteins inhibited the attachment of certain indigenous oral streptococci to human buccal epithelial cells and fostered the desorption of previously attached bacteria. the adherence-inhibiting and desorptive activities of the glycoproteins correlated with their ability to aggregate these organisms. pretreatment of glycoprotein preparations with certain blood group antisera impaired their adherence-inhibiting effect, suggesting that  components with blood group substance reactivity were involved. pretreatment of buccal epithelial cells with certain blood group antisera or concanavalin a masked the receptors associated with the attachment of streptococcus sanguis sg1. the association of blood-group-reactive substances with the receptors involved in bacterial attachment may provide a basis for understanding the distinct specificities that bacteria exhibit for attaching to different tissues, organs, and hosts. antiserum raised in rabbits to human epithelial cells also exhibited receptor-masking activity, and absorption of this serum with homologous salivary  glycoproteins removed the antibodies responsible. these observations indicate that some salivary glycoproteins are antigenically similar to components on the epithelial cell surfaces they bathe. it is suggested that by mimicking the receptors present on epithelial cells, the mucinous glycoproteins of secretions may competitively inhibit the sorption of infectious agents and facilitate their  removal after they are attached. these activities help to explain how mucinous glycoproteins augment the cleansing action of secretions.

TI  == immunoelectron microscopic identification and localization of streptococcus sanguis with peroxidase-labeled antibody: localization of streptococcus sanguis in intact dental plaque.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis has been localized ultrastructurally within intact dental plaque by means of an indirect technique which utilizes horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody. the technique allows for complete diffusion of the reagents to all portions of the plaque specimens. control procedures can be carried out on serial sections of plaque with a bacterial composition similar to  that of the experimental specimen. the 30-mum-thick sections can be examined in the light microscope to localize areas specifically labeled with peroxidase prior to cutting ultra-thin sections for electron microscopy. this study demonstrated that specific bacteria can be localized within intact dental plaque. the results  also indicated that s. sanguis grows in dental plaque as columnar shaped microcolonies perpendicular to the tooth surfaces. growth appears to be by cell division rather than deposition of new cells at the surfaces. despite their relatively good structural preservation, the cells in the deeper (older) layers of plaque appear to have lost some of their antigenic activity in comparison to the cells near the surface.

"mitis" after subculture on ms-agar as soon as visible growth had appeared in the broth media and again after a further 2 days. the following observations were made: 1. strep. salivarius was almost regularly found in either or both of tas- and blh-medium at primary culture of the samples contaminated with saliva. the result was the same whether these broth media were inoculated directly or via vmg iii. 2. strep. salivarius was always found in mixed cultures  and was nearly always accompanied by strep. sanguis and/or strep. "mitis". 3. strep. salivarius as well as strep. sanguis survived two days after visible growth significantly more oftern in blh-medium than in tas-medium. the findings lend support to the hypothesis based on clinical studies that when present in root canal cultures strep. salivarius is ascribable to contamination with saliva.

TI  == differential susceptibility of human iga immunoglobulins to streptococcal iga protease.
AB  == iga protease, a proteolytic enzyme found in human saliva and colonic fluid, hydrolyzes human serum iga immunoglobulins to yield fab(alpha) and fc(alpha) fragments. the enzyme is produced by organisms in the normal human microflora and can be purified from culture filtrates of the common human oral organism streptococcus sanguis (american type culture collection no. 10556). iga protease  is inactive against all other protein substrates examined including the other classes of human immunoglobulins. the role of this enzyme in affecting the function of the secretory iga immune system is unknown. to further characterize and explain this unusual substrate specificity, the susceptibility of 31 human iga myeloma proteins of both subclasses was investigated. 16 iga1 and 15 iga2 myeloma paraproteins were treated with enzyme and the extent of proteolysis was determined by cellulose actate electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and column chromatography. all iga1 proteins  were enzymatically cleaved to fab(alpha) and fc(alpha) fragments, but all iga2 proteins were resistant, yielding no fragments after prolonged enzymatic treatment. n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the purified fc(alpha) fragment of a single iga1 paraprotein was as follows: thr-pro-ser-pro-?-thr-pro-pro-thr-pro-ser-pro-ser. comparison of this sequence to that reported for the iga1 heavy chain shows that the enzyme-susceptible peptide  bond is a pro-thr in the iga1 hinge region. the most likely explanation of the resistance of the iga2 subclass to iga protease is a deletion in the heavy chain  which commences with the critical threonine of the susceptible pro-thr bond.

AB  == mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near ph 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 c in the  ph range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 c in the acid range. n-bromosuccinimide  caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mm, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against s. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. the lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. digestion of the cell walls of s. mutans bht by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.

AB  == reagents that interact with sulfhydryl groups are shown to inhibit competence factor (cf)-induced competence development in streptococcus sanguis (wicky) strain we4 (wicky 4 ery(r)). inhibition is correlated with specific inhibition of either the function or biosynthesis of three competent cell-related proteins and  is reversed by either 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. mercuric chloride (5 mum) or n-ethylmaleimide (nem; 50 mum) inhibited (i) the function but not the biosynthesis or activation of the competent cell-associated autolysin; (ii) the biosynthesis of a competent cell-associated protein of unknown function, demonstrated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of acidified phenol extracts;  and (iii) the biosynthesis or activation of distinct deoxyribonucleic acid (dna)-binding sites. neither reagent at the indicated concentration interfered with the uptake of cf by cells or with the uptake and expression of dna by competent cells. neither reagent inactivated cf or genetic markers coded by the transforming dna, nor did they inhibit cell growth or viability appreciably. the  data reveal that either mercuric chloride or nem can differentially inhibit induced protein synthesis and, in addition, conclusively show that some autolytic activity is essential for the onset of the competent state.

TI  == in vitro attachment of streptococci to the tooth surface.
AB  == the ability of streptococcus strains to adhere to the tooth surface in vitro was  investigated. polished enamel slabs, with and without acquired pellicles, were incubated with buffer suspensions of oral streptococci, and attached bacteria were counted under a microscope using incident light. low numbers of bacteria adhered to uncoated enamel; the presence of an acquired pellicle significantly enhanced the attachment of all strains tested. the adherence of streptococcus sanguis was significantly greater than that of streptococcus salivarius, and both of these strains adhered in greater numbers than did streptococcus mutans. when bacteria were suspended in whole saliva, the adherence of s. salivarius and s. mutans was inhibited, whereas the adherence of s. sanguis was enhanced in some experiments and inhibited in others. the adherence of s. sanguis and s. salivarius was consistently inhibited by parotid fluid; this inhibitory effect persisted after thorough washing and resonication of the bacterial cells. incubation in oral fluids was associated with the attachment of bacterial clumps  to the pellicle, and parallel investigation revealed agglutination of s. sanguis  and s. salivarius by whole saliva and, in particular, parotid fluid. the results  are discussed in terms of surface microecology, and are related to the development of dental plaque.

AB  == two lipoteichoic acids, membrane (mlta) and wall (wlta), have been purified from  streptococcus sanguis by sepharose and ecteola-cellulose column chromatographies  and concanavalin a-conjugated sepharose affinity column chromatography. the teichoic acids were homogenous as judged by disc gel electrophoresis, column chromatography, and double diffusion tests. both mlta and wlta consisted of glycerol, phosphate, glucose, and fatty acids in the ratios of 0.95:1:0.71:0.046  and 0.99:1:0.79:0.023, respectively. alpha-glycerol-phosphate was obtained by the partial acid hydrolysis of the lipoteichoic acids suggesting that their backbone  structure consists of the glycerol moieties linked by 1, 3-phosphodiester bonds.  both wlta and mlta form aggregates, perhaps due to micelle formation, in concentrated solution. the aggregate form of mlta dissociates to a much greater extent than that of wlta under similar conditions.

TI  == relationship between the concentration of bacteria in saliva and the colonization of teeth in humans.
AB  == the relationship between the salivary concentration of bacteria and their number  that can be recovered from tooth surfaces has been studied in 12 human subjects.  the mean salivary concentration of naturally occurring steptococcus mutans and lactobacilli, determined on selective media, was 3.7 x 10(5) and 3.8 x 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu) per ml, respectively. in subjects with salivary concentrations of s. mutans of about 10(4) cfu/ml or less or about 10(5) cfu/ml or less of lactobacilli, these organisms could not be isolated from cleaned teeth after 2 to 3 h of oral exposure. in experiments with streptomycin-labeled s. sanguis cells held in the mouth for 15 min, the minimal salivary concentration required for their recovery from the teeth was about 10(3) cfu/ml. both s. mutans and lactobacilli were found to be highly localized on teeth. this evidence suggests that the concentrations of s. mutans and lactobacilli generally present  in saliva are insufficient for the initiation of their firm attachment to relatively nonretentive tooth surfaces. the low efficiency of their intraoral spread, as suggested by their highly localized distribution on teeth, or of their transmission between subjects may be essentially due to the interrelated factors  bacterial affinity and number of colony-forming units available for attachment.

TI  == relation of macromolecular synthesis in streptococci to efficiency of transformation by markers of homospecific and heterospecific origin.
AB  == in previous studies with streptococcus sanguis and s. pneumoniae as recipients and donors of transforming deoxyribonucleic acid (dna), it was found that heating recipients just prior to exposure to dna caused an increase in the number of transformants induced by heterospecific dna relative to that induced by homospecific dna. in the present studies, s. sanguis recipients were found to recover from this effect of heat (48 c, 15 min) when incubated at 37 c before exposure to dna. inhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis, such as rifampin, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, actinomycin, and p-hydroxyphenylazo-uracil, but not inhibitors of protein synthesis, such as chloramphenicol and erythromycin, prevented recovery from the effect of heat. inhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis  caused changes in unheated cells similar to those observed with heat treatment; these changes included increased transformability by genetically hybrid dna and by low-efficiency markers in homospecific dna. the effect of a combination of heat and inhibitors on transformation by heterospecific dna was greater than when single treatments were used. the most effective inhibitor used alone was rifampin: in treated recipient cells, the yield of transformants produced by a given amount of irreversibly bound heterospecific dna was increased without a significant change in the yield of transformants produced by bound homospecific dna. a cell being doubly transformed by homospecific and heterospecific dna was enhanced specifically in its transformability with the latter as a consequence of rifampin treatment. treatment with rifampin also increased co-transformation by linked heterospecific markers. the period during which recipient cells were sensitive to the effects induced by rifampin and fluorodeoxyuridine lasted from 10 to 20 min after dna uptake.

TI  == carbon dioxide control of lag period and growth of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == a carbon dioxide requirement for growth of streptococcus sanguis was readily demonstrated in a fermentor where the gas atmosphere could be controlled. growth  at a maximum rate occurred immediately in response to the appropriate co(2) concentration; growth stopped when co(2) was deleted. washed inocula consisting of exponentially growing cells required a minimum of 2.4% co(2), postexponential  phase cells needed 1.2 to 1.8% co(2) immediately and 2.4% co(2) shortly thereafter, whereas stationary phase cells required three sequential increases in co(2) from 0.3 to 1.8 to 2.4% within the first 90 min of growth. these co(2) concentrations permitted each inoculum to initiate growth immediately at the same maximum rate. these results also showed that physiologically "old" cells had the  same capacity for growth as "young" cells when the co(2) concentrations were appropriate for the type of inoculum. continued exponential growth of the culture at the same optimum rate required 2.4% co(2). lower concentrations of co(2) were  rate limiting and the resulting exponential rate was proportional to the co(2) concentration. the "normal" lag period of s. sanguis appears to be an artifact induced by a co(2) deficiency.

AB  == mm10 sucrose blood agar (mm10 sb agar), n(2)c agar, schaedler agar (sh agar), and mitis salivarius agar (ms agar) were tested for their ability to recover human dental plaque flora by a continuous anaerobic procedure and by a conventional anaerobic method. mm10 sb agar yielded higher recovery of bacteria from plaque samples as determined by the enumeration of colony-forming units (cfu). the cfu on n(2)c agar, sh agar, and ms agar were lower than mm10 sb agar when the continuous anaerobic procedure was used. the superior performance of mm10 sb agar was much more apparent when used for the cultivation of dental plaque by the conventional anaerobic method. under these conditions the counts were consistently higher on mm10 sb agar as compared to the other media tested. however, the differential counts of streptococcus sanguis and s. mutans from carious plaque samples were in general comparable on all culture media. deletion  of blood from mm10 sb agar did not lower counts. the elimination of dithiothreitol from this medium resulted in a significantly lower recovery of bacteria from the plaque samples when cultured by the conventional anaerobic method. the storage of mm10 sb agar for varying periods of time aerobic conditions did not seem to affect its performance. these findings suggest that mm10 sb agar is an ideal culture medium for the isolation, nonselective enumeration, and differential counts of bacteria present in normal and disease-associated plaques.

TI  == induction of unbalanced growth and death of streptococcus sanguis by oxygen.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis has normal streptococcal morphology when grown in a nitrogen atmosphere but undergoes gross morphological alterations when grown in the presence of oxygen (o cells). studies were made of the relationship between the development of pleomorphism and the loss of viability which accompanied it in o cultures of s. sanguis. the development of pleomorphism appears to involve two  events. the first step, or triggering event, occurs in log-phase cultures in the  presence of oxygen. the second step, or manifestation of pleomorphism, occurs at  stationary phase in the presence or absence of oxygen. the loss of viability appears to be related both to the length of time the culture is exposed to oxygen as well as to a specific event which occurs at the transition from log to stationary phase. oxygen also induced a state of unbalanced growth in s. sanguis  in which the proportions of deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, and protein  synthesized were altered. the relationship of these alterations to the development of pleomorphism is discussed.

TI  == properties of a streptococcus sanguis (group h) bacteriocin and its separation from the competence factor of transformation.
AB  == sth(1), a streptocin elaborated by group h streptococcus strain challis, is lethal for group h streptococcus strain wicky and is produced maximally during the exponential growth phase of liquid medium cultures. crude streptocin preparations are resistant to oxidation and display a biphasic ph stability (stability being maximal at ph 5.0 and 10.0). survivor studies indicate that streptocin-mediated killing is a "one-hit" phenomenon and proceeds rapidly. the streptocin has been purified 50-fold with (nh(4))(2)so(4) fractionation and sephadex g100 chromatography and appears to exist in equilibrium between two molecular weight forms. low ionic strength and neutral ph buffers favor the isolation of the 110,000 molecular weight form, whereas high ionic strength and alkaline ph conditions facilitate isolation of the 28,000 to 30,000 molecular weight form. these findings suggest an association-dissociation relationship between macromolecules of 28,000 to 30,000 molecular weight. purified sth(1) has  no "competence factor" (cf) activity. in addition, cf has no sth(1) activity and  displays no inhibitory effect on exponential-phase wicky cultures as determined by absorbancy measurements. it appears, therefore, that initiation of the competent state for transformation in strain wicky is not necessarily accompanied by gross alterations in cell growth.

TI  == saliva-induced aggregation of oral streptococci.
AB  == cells of several species of oral microorganisms have been shown, in earlier studies, to be aggregated by saliva. in the present study some of the basic properties of the aggregation system are examined. the observation is made that the saliva-induced aggregates of streptococcus sanguis and s. mitis can be dissociated to stable particles which consist of about 100 cells and have a median diameter of about 4.5 mum. it is proposed that these are subunits, or core aggregates, of the large primary aggregates. counts of the core aggregates can be taken as a precise and accurate measure of aggregation. experiments based on this procedure show that the aggregation of s. sanguis is maximal at 10 c and at 1 meq of ca(2+) ions per liter and is not affected by a change in ph between 3.9 and 8.7 or by a change in the phase of growth of the microorganisms. core aggregates  diminish in number with prolonged incubation, suggesting that the aggregating factors break down with time. formalinized cells yield stable aggregates. however, with formalinized cell aggregation is maximal between 20 and 30 c and proceeds in the absence of calcium ions. evidence is presented that whole saliva  contains separate aggregating factors for s. sanguis and s. mitis. the factors differ in their affinity for intact cells and for hydroxyapatite and differ in their stability to dialysis. these findings suggest that many different aggregating factors exist in saliva, each of which may be capable of interacting  with cells of one or several bacterial species.

AB  == the present study describes the distribution of veillonella and neisseria species in the human oral cavity and indicates that their ability to attach to oral surfaces correlates with their proportions found in various sites of the mouth. the mean percentages of veillonella and neisseria of the total flora cultivable on anaerobic blood-agar plates was found to be: plaque, 0.75 and <0.13, respectively; lip, 0.38 and <0.05; cheek, 0.66 and <0.14; tongue dorsum, 9.4 and  <0.12; saliva, 5.0 and <0.9. the ability of veillonella and neisseria species to  attach to tooth surfaces was studied by cleaning the labial surfaces of incisors  to render them relatively free of viable bacteria. samples taken 1 hr later contained <0.27% veillonella and <0.4% neisseria, whereas saliva to which these teeth were exposed contained 20-fold higher proportions of veillonella. these data indicate that veillonella and neisseria species possess a feeble ability to  attach to cleaned teeth. the ability of these organisms to adhere to other oral surfaces was determined by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of volunteers for 5 min. labeled strains of streptococcus sanguis and s. salivarius were included for comparative purposes. analysis of samples obtained from oral surfaces after 45 min indicated that veillonella and neisseria adhere very poorly to preformed dental plaque as compared to s. sanguis. in contrast, veillonella adhered to the tongue dorsum markedly better than neisseria, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius. the greater ability of veillonella to adhere to the tongue in relation to the other organisms studied correlates with the high proportions of veillonella found on this site. the feeble ability of neisseria to attach to surfaces in the oral cavity is reflected by their low proportions found on these surfaces.

TI  == selective bacterial adherence to oral epithelial surfaces and its role as an ecological determinant.
AB  == the possible relationship between the ability of streptococcus species to adhere  to oral epithelial cells and their natural distribution on epithelial surfaces within the mouth was studied. strains of s. salivarius and s. sanguis, which are  present in significant proportions on oral epithelial surfaces, were found to possess a definite capacity to adhere to epithelial cells obtained from cheek scrapings of humans, hamsters, and germ-free rats. in contrast, strains of s. mutans, which are found in only minor proportions, if at all, on oral epithelial  surfaces exhibited feeble or no adherence to oral epithelial cells. s. salivarius cells attached well to human cheek cells over the range of ph 5 to 8. its adherence was not found to be markedly influenced by saliva or by growth in sucrose broth. several other types of bacteria were examined which also exhibited widely different abilities to attach to human cheek cells. mixtures of streptomycin-labeled strains were introduced into the mouths of volunteers for study of the adherence of streptococcus species to oral epithelial surfaces in vivo. labeled s. salivarius and s. sanguis were recovered in high proportions from cheek and tongue surfaces, whereas the proportions of labeled s. mutans recovered from these surfaces were low in comparison to the original mixture. these data indicate that a correlation exists between the relative adherence of various streptococcus species and their proportional distribution found naturally on oral epithelial surfaces. the ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is proposed as a critical ecological determinant affecting their colonization in environments with open surfaces exposed to bathing fluids.

TI  == distribution and serological specificity of sialidase produced by various groups  of streptococci.
AB  == the occurrence of a streptococcal sialidase (designated st-sialidase) in culture  fluids of various streptococci was investigated. st-sialidase was found to occur  in strains belonging to groups a, b, c, e, g, h, and l, and the unclassified strains, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus uberis. st-sialidase of group a  was confined predominantly to types 4 and 22. st-sialidases, extracted from the culture fluids of some selected strains, were antigenic, eliciting the formation  of antibody which effectively neutralized the enzymatic activity of the enzyme. antisera to the st-sialidases of groups a, b, c, e, g, and l, and streptococcus sanguis were produced in rabbits. the st-sialidases of groups a, b, and e streptococci were serologically distinct and group-specific. the st-sialidases from groups c, g, and l were serologically homologous, but distinct from st-sialidases of the other groups. antiserum to the enzyme of strain 10557 (s. sanguis) cross-reacted with the st-sialidase of strain 9927 (s. uberis).

TI  == sialidase-like enzymes produced by group a, b, c, g, and l streptococci and by streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == a group of enzymes were prepared from the culture fluids of streptococci belonging to groups a, b, c, g, and l, and from a strain of streptococcus sanguis. these streptococcal enzymes (designated st-sialidases) released a substance shown to belong to the sialic acid group from the specific substrate bsm-st, a sialomucoid prepared from bovine submaxillary gland. they were inactive on n-acetylneuramin lactose prepared from bovine colustrum and on a sialomucoid prepared from bovine submaxillary mucin, whereas these substances are susceptible to sialidases produced by group k streptococci and by vibrio cholerae. some of the st-sialidases were markedly activated by divalent cations, but others showed  little response. the heat stability of the enzymes produced by the different strains varied. the optimal ph was between 5.5 and 6.5 with acetate buffer and was about 7 with phosphate buffer. k(m) values were determined for the st-sialidases with bsm-st as substrate.

TI  == predominant catalase-negative soil bacteria. i. streptococcal population indigenous to soil.
AB  == streptococci related to streptococcus sanguis were shown to represent a major segment of the bacterial flora of certain soils. upon initial isolation, these streptococci were quite pleomorphic and displayed morphological characteristics common to several other genera of bacteria, but after prolonged cultivation on laboratory media the isolates demonstrated a typical streptococcal morphology. it was proposed that a requirement for correction of the control mechanisms affecting growth rate and cell wall synthesis in part might explain the difficulty encountered in isolation of these organisms from soil and their initial pleomorphism and cultural instability. the possible role of these soil organisms as etiological agents of disease and the occurrence of other groups of  streptococci in soil were discussed.

(american meat institute foundation, chicago, ill.). hydrolysis of  proteins and nucleic acids by lancefield group a and other streptococci. j. bacteriol. 86:1270-1274. 1963.-classically, group a streptococci have been considered to be nonproteolytic in spite of the observation that a proteinase is  produced in broth cultures. when tested by the plate method, it was observed that 78% of 47 strains were proteolytic when the cultures were incubated anaerobically. some strains hydrolyzed gelatin aerobically; however, the hydrolysis of casein and pepsin required anaerobic conditions of growth. other proteins hydrolyzed included wheat gluten and a beef-muscle preparation. the hydrolysis of bovine serum albumin, lactalbumin, sheep plasma, and lysozyme was not detected in plate cultures. the hydrolysis of deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid was characteristic of the majority of the strains. unlike the proteolytic activity, the nucleolytic activity was independent of oxygen tension. other streptococci were screened for hydrolytic activity; among these strains, only the single strain of streptococcus sanguis tested possessed proteolytic activity. deoxyribonuclease activity was observed in "animal" but not "human" group c strains, and in some strains of groups g and l.
