TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid and eperezolid, two novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid (formerly u-100766) and eperezolid (formerly u-100592) are novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents that are active against multi-drug-resistant staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, corynebacteria, and mycobacteria. preliminary studies also demonstrated that the compounds inhibited some test strains of anaerobic bacteria. therefore, we extended the in vitro evaluation of  these agents to include a total of 54 different anaerobic species. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values were determined using a standard agar dilution method for 143 anaerobic bacterial isolates. eperezolid and linezolid demonstrated potent activity against the anaerobic gram-positive organisms with most mic values in the range of 0.25-4 microg/ml. viridans streptococci demonstrated mics of 1-2 microg/ml; peptostreptococcus species and propionibacterium species were inhibited by </=0.25-1 microg/ml. clostridial species were generally susceptible to the oxazolidinones (mics of </=0.25-8 microg/ml); however, seven strains of clostridium difficile with linezolid mics of 16 microg/ml or greater were detected. against the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, linezolid was more potent than eperezolid, especially for bacteroides  species. linezolid inhibited most bacteroides in the range of 2-8 microg/ml, while eperezolid was generally two- to eight-fold less active. linezolid and eperezolid both demonstrated potent activity against fusobacterium species,mobiluncus species,prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas asaccharolytica (mics of </=0.25-0.5 microg/ml). overall, the oxazolidinones demonstrated a significant level of activity against a number of clinically-important anaerobic bacterial species. linezolid may potentially provide a broader spectrum of anaerobic coverage than eperezolid due to its greater activity against bacteroides species.

TI  == comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of am-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of am-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin  and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. although  am-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the bacteroides fragilis group  and prevotella bivia (mic90s > or =3.13 mg/ml), 76% of the b. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at am-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/l. am-1155 was highly  active against prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and mobiluncus spp. (mic90s < or =0.39 mg/l). an in-vivo study using a mixed infection with am-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible  b. fragilis and escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. am-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against e. coli. these results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of am-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in am-1155-treated mice. these results suggest that the clinical efficacy of am-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the b. fragilis group and p. bivia should be evaluated further.

TI  == in-vitro comparison of roxithromycin and erythromycin against 900 anaerobic bacterial strains.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of roxithromycin was assessed by an agar dilution method against 900 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by five laboratories in england, france, germany and japan. roxithromycin had similar activity to erythromycin against most anaerobic bacteria, the latter being slightly more active against gram-negative bacilli. roxithromycin inhibited 53% of the bacteroides fragilis group strains; the noticeable exception was bact. thetaiotaomicron, only 17% of strains of which were inhibited by 4 mg/l roxithromycin. in contrast, all isolates of bacteroides, other than the bact. fragilis group, and all mobiluncus isolates were inhibited by 2 mg/l of roxithromycin or less. this compound was inactive against half the fusobacterium  strains. roxithromycin and erythromycin inhibited 65 and 72%, respectively, of 436 strains of gram-negative anaerobes (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l). roxithromycin suppressed 97% of non-sporulating gram-positive to bacilli, 86% of  peptococcoaceae and 95% of clostridia. two-thirds of clostridium difficile strains were susceptible to roxithromycin (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l). the activity of roxithromycin against gram-positive bacilli was identical to that of  erythromycin. overall a concentration of 4 mg/l roxithromycin and erythromycin inhibited 79 and 83%, respectively, of the strains investigated.
