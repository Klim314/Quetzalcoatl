TI  - Liquid based microbiological transport systems: conformity assessment of two commercial devices.
AB  - We compared two types of liquid-based microbiology devices for microorganism viability according to standardized quantitative elution method CLSI M40-A2. The eSwab(R) met CLSI acceptance criteria of viability maintenance for all microorganisms tested. The Sigma-Transwab(R) failed to meet CLSI acceptance criteria for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Natural antimicrobials subtilosin and lauramide arginine ethyl ester synergize with conventional antibiotics clindamycin and metronidazole against biofilms of Gardnerella vaginalis but not against biofilms of healthy vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of clindamycin and metronidazole to synergize with natural antimicrobials against biofilms of bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated Gardnerella vaginalis. Minimum bactericidal concentrations for biofilm cells (MBCs-B) were determined for each antimicrobial. The MBCs-B of lauramide arginine ethyl ester (LAE), subtilosin, clindamycin and metronidazole were 50, 69.5, 20 and 500 mug mL(-1), respectively. A checkerboard assay and isobologram were used to analyze the type of interactions between these antimicrobials. The combination of metronidazole with natural antimicrobials did not inhibit planktonic lactobacilli. Clindamycin with either LAE or with subtilosin was inhibitory for planktonic but not for biofilm-associated lactobacilli. All tested antimicrobial combinations were inhibitory for BV-associated Mobiluncus curtisii and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. LAE and subtilosin synergized with clindamycin and metronidazole against biofilms of G. vaginalis but not biofilm-associated vaginal lactobacilli. The biofilms of BV-associated pathogens can be controlled by synergistically acting combinations of conventional antibiotics and natural antimicrobials which will help better management of current antibiotics, especially considering robust bacterial resistance. Our findings create a foundation for a new strategy in the effective control of vaginal infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of preparation Bioaron C.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of sirupus Bioaron C, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of Aloe arborescens, was tested against different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. The experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus Candida and on 18 reference strains (ATCC). The antimicrobial activity of Bioaron C (MBC and MFC) was determined at undiluted concentration. Bioaron C proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. At the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (MBC, MFC) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Parvimonas micra, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, already after 15 min. The MIC of Bioaron C against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. The great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Bioaron C may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.
TI  - An in Vitro Experimental Study on the Antimicrobial Activity of Silicone Oil against Anaerobic Bacteria.
AB  - Abstract Purpose: To investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of silicone  oil against anaerobic agents, specifically Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Fuobacterium spp., and Clostridium tertium. Method: A 0.5 McFarland turbidity of Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus spp., Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Fuobacterium spp., and Clostridium tertium was prepared, and 0.1 mL was inoculated into 0.9 mL of silicone oil. Control inoculations were performed in anaerobic blood agar and fluid thioglycollate medium without silicone oil. Results: Propionibacterium acnes retained their viability on the 3rd day in the presence of silicone oil. In total, 9.7 x 106 colonies were enumerated from 1 mL of silicone oil. After a prolonged incubation of 7 days, the number of colonies observed was 9.2 x 106. The other bacteria disappeared after the 3rd day of incubation in silicone oil. Conclusions: Propionibacterium acnes, which is the most common chronic postoperative endophthalmitis agent, is thought to be resistant to silicone oil.
TI  - A comparative antimicrobial analysis of various root canal irrigating solutions on endodontic pathogens: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evolution in understanding the poly-microbial environment of both endodontic infections and that of failed root canal treatments has been debatable over the years. The present study was designed to compare and analyze the effect of various root canal irrigation solutions on certain endodontic pathogens in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To analyze in vitro the zone of inhibition of the micro-organisms the following irrigating solutions were employed: a. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) 5% b. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) 3% c. Chlorhexidine 2% d. Chlorhexidine (CHX) 0.12% e. Doxycycline 0.01% f. Doxycycline 0.005% g. MTAD. An agar culture plate inoculated with four endodontic pathogens was used namely 1. Enterococcus faecalis (MTCC-439) 2. Candida albicans (MTCC-183) 3. Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC-25586) 4. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (ATCC-27337) The inoculums were streaked out on the trypticase soy agar plate for discrete colonies with a wire loop using standard method. The inoculated plates carrying the antibiotic disks were incubated in an anaerobic jar in the following way-Anaerobic incubation-the following procedure was used to provide anaerobiosis with an increased concentration of carbon dioxide. By this method the zone of inhibition obtained by different irrigating solutions against different pathogens could be compared. RESULTS: MTAD showed maximum antibacterial activity. In case of C. albicans MTAD was less effective than 5% NaOCl, 3% NaOCl and 2% CHX, 0.12% CHX. However, it was more effective against E. faecalis, F. nuleatum and P. anaerobicus. In any case, antimicrobial activity is not the only prerequisite for an endodontic irrigant. E. faecalis strain used in this study showed resistance to doxycycline; also doxycycline was ineffective against C. albicans at 0.01% and 0.005% concentrations. CONCLUSION: It was found that MTAD was more antimicrobial than 5% NaOCl for some of the test micro-organisms; however the ability of MTAD to dissolve pulp tissue is not comparable to 5% NaOCl. In addition, 5 and 3% NaOCl showed signifcant antimicrobial activity against all test micro-organisms. The best option for a primary endodontic irrigant therefore is 5% NaOCl.
TI  - Essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of Angelica archangelica L.  (Apiaceae) roots.
AB  - In this paper, the chemical composition and the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Angelica archangelica L. (Apiaceae) roots from central Italy were analyzed. The major constituents of the oil were alpha-pinene (21.3%), delta-3-carene (16.5%), limonene (16.4%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.7%). The oil shows a good antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Eubacterium limosum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 0.25, 0.25, 0.13, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50% v/v, respectively. A weaker antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli-very useful in the intestinal microflora-has also been shown with MIC values >4.0% v/v.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of intravenous azithromycin followed by oral azithromycin for the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and perihepatitis in Japanese women.
AB  - Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is mainly caused by ascending infection from the vaginal flora including the sexually transmitted organisms, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, and lower genital tract endogenous anaerobes, leading to serious consequences including infertility and ectopic pregnancy. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in the treatment of PID that requires initial intravenous therapy, we conducted a multicenter, unblinded, non-comparative phase 3 trial. Intravenous azithromycin (500 mg, once daily) for 1 or 2 days followed by oral azithromycin (250 mg once daily) to complete a total of 7 days treatment was administered to 60 Japanese women with acute PID. The clinical and bacteriological responses were assessed at the end of treatment, and on Days 15 and 29. The most commonly detected baseline causative pathogens were C. trachomatis (12 strains), Prevotella bivia (10 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (7 strains), N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6 strains each). The clinical success rate on Day 15 was 94.1% (48/51 subjects including perihepatitis). The clinical efficacy and bacterial eradication rates against C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae (including 2 quinolone-resistant strains) were both 100%. Common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea, injection site pain, and nausea. All adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Azithromycin intravenous-to-oral switch therapy demonstrated excellent clinical and bacteriological effects for PID caused by various etiologic agents including quinolone-resistant strains and strains with low susceptibility to azithromycin at in vitro testing. The therapy was well tolerated in the treatment of PID in Japanese women. REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00871494.
TI  - Preservation of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius DNA after loss of cell viability.
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether DNA from two obligate anaerobes, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, is recoverable after loss of cell viability induced by air exposure. METHODOLOGY: Harvested cultures of F. nucleatum and P. anaerobius were killed by exposure to air and stored in phosphate-buffered saline. Dead cells were incubated aerobically for up to 6 months. Every month, the presence of detectable DNA in the cell pellet and supernatant was assessed by conventional and quantitative PCR. Cell staining techniques were used to characterize the cell wall permeability of air-killed cells. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine viable, freshly killed and stored cells. RESULTS: With conventional PCR, amplifiable DNA was detectable over 6 months in all samples. Quantitative PCR showed a progressive fall in DNA concentration in nonviable cell pellets and a concomitant rise in DNA concentration in the supernatant. DNA staining showed that some air-killed cells retained an intact cell wall. After storage, SEM of both air-killed species revealed shrivelling of the cells, but some cells of P. anaerobius retained their initial form. CONCLUSION: Amplifiable DNA from F. nucleatum and P. anaerobius was detectable 6 months after loss of viability. Air-killed anaerobes initially retained their cell form, but cells gradually shriveled over time. The morphological changes were more pronounced with the gram-negative F. nucleatum than the gram-positive P. anaerobius. Over 6 months, there was a gradual increase in cell wall permeability with progressive leakage of DNA. Bacterial DNA was recoverable long after loss of cell viability.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of tonsillar microbial flora according to age and tonsillar size in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Although numerous studies based on the bacteriology of the tonsil have been carried out, none of them analyzed the variation of tonsillar flora with respect to both age and tonsillar size. The purpose of this study was to isolate the facultative and obligate anaerobes both from the surface and the core of tonsils in recurrent tonsillitis as well as to analyze the variation of isolated bacterial strains according to age and tonsillar size. A prospective study was performed on 111 patients who underwent tonsillectomy. We analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and semi-growth estimates with regard to age and tonsillar grade. Among 111 cases, 604 bacterial strains of 21 different from the tonsil superficial and core were isolated. The most common facultative anaerobic species isolated from the surface and core were Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Alpha-hemolytic streptococci and Diphtheroid bacilli in all subgroups except patients below 8 years old. The most commonly obligate anaerobic species isolated from the core were Propionibacterium acnes, Prevotella melaninogenica and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. We found no significant difference in the cultured bacteria with respect to age and tonsillar size. The study subgroups did not differ in the occurrence of semiquantitative growth estimates of 3-4+. Our study demonstrates that there is polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora in tonsils with regardless of patient's age and tonsillar size. This polymicrobial spectrum of bacteria may contribute to recurrence and to the failure of conservative treatment of these cases and therefore leads to surgical therapy.
TI  - Characterization of Romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat, and proposal for the reclassification of five closely related members of the genus Clostridium into the genera Romboutsia gen. nov., Intestinibacter gen. nov., Terrisporobacter gen. nov. and Asaccharospora gen. nov.
AB  - A Gram-positive staining, rod-shaped, non-motile, spore-forming obligately anaerobic bacterium, designated CRIBT, was isolated from the gastro-intestinal tract of a rat and characterized. The major cellular fatty acids of strain CRIBT were saturated and unsaturated straight-chain C12-C19 fatty acids, with C16:0 being the predominant fatty acid. The polar lipid profile comprised six glycolipids, four phospholipids and one lipid that did not stain with any of the specific spray reagents used. The only quinone was MK-6. The predominating cell-wall sugars were glucose and galactose. The peptidoglycan type of strain CRIBT was A1sigma lanthionine-direct. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain CRIBT was 28.1 mol%. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain CRIBT was most closely related to a number of species of the genus Clostridium, including Clostridium lituseburense (97.2%), Clostridium glycolicum (96.2%), Clostridium mayombei (96.2%), Clostridium bartlettii (96.0%) and Clostridium irregulare (95.5%). All these species show very low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (<85%) to the type strain of Clostridium butyricum, the type species of the genus Clostridium. DNA-DNA hybridization with closely related reference strains indicated reassociation values below 32%. On the basis of phenotypic and genetic studies, a novel genus, Romboutsia gen. nov., is proposed. The novel isolate CRIBT (=DSM 25109T=NIZO 4048T) is proposed as the type strain of the type species, Romboutsia ilealis gen. nov., sp. nov., of the proposed novel genus. It is proposed that C. lituseburense is transferred to this genus as Romboutsia lituseburensis comb. nov. Furthermore, the reclassification into novel genera is proposed for C. bartlettii, as Intestinibacter bartlettii gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), C. glycolicum, as Terrisporobacter glycolicus gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), C. mayombei, as Terrisporobacter mayombei gen. nov., comb. nov., and C. irregulare, as Asaccharospora irregularis gen. nov., comb. nov. (type species of the genus), on the basis of additional data collected in this study. In addition, an emendation of the species Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and the order Eubacteriales is provided.
TI  - The effects of a mineral trioxide aggregate-based sealer on the production of reactive oxygen species, nitrogen species and cytokines by two macrophage subtypes.
AB  - AIM: To test the effects of a mineral trioxide aggregate-based sealer (MTA Fillapex((R))) and MTA (MTA-Angelus((R))) on viability and on the production of cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (NO) by M1 and M2 inflammatory macrophages. METHODOLOGY: M1 (from C57BL/6 mice) and M2 (from BALB/c mice) peritoneal inflammatory macrophages were obtained and cultured in vitro in the presence of original and diluted extracts of MTA and MTA Fillapex (FLPX). The cell viability, ROS release and the release of tumour necrosis factor-a, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-10 and NO in response to stimulation with interferon-gamma and Fusobacterium nucleatum or Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were evaluated. The data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test and Student's t-test. RESULTS: Fillapex was cytotoxic at the highest concentrations (1:1;1:2) and decreased the viability (P < 0.05) of both macrophage types (<20%). MTA did not interfere with cellular viability. FLPX inhibited the release of ROS and decreased NO release in F. nucleatum and P. anaerobius -stimulated M1 and M2 macrophages (</=25 mu mol L(-1)). F. nucleatum-stimulated M2 macrophage cultures released lower levels of TNF-alpha when FLPX was added (</=1 ng mL(-1)). M2 macrophages released higher (>5 ng mL(-1)) levels of IL-10 than M1 macrophages. Only M1 macrophage cultures produced IL-12p70. CONCLUSIONS: Fillapex impaired effector immune responses during inflammation (M1 macrophages), as well as during healing (M2 macrophages) responses.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of SMT19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against Clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SMT19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined Clostridium difficile strains, 174 Gram-positive and 136 Gram-negative intestinal anaerobes, and 40 Gram-positive aerobes. SMT19969 was one dilution more active against C. difficile isolates (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. SMT19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes, especially the Bacteroides fragilis group species, than vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that SMT19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. SMT19969 showed limited activity against other Gram-positive anaerobes, including Bifidobacteria species, Eggerthella lenta, Finegoldia magna, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with MIC90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. Clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with C. innocuum being susceptible (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) and C. ramosum and C. perfringens being nonsusceptible (MIC90, >512 mug/ml). Activity against Lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; MIC90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and streptococci) showed high SMT19969 MIC90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
TI  - Essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts and ripe fruits of Echinophora spinosa (Apiaceae) from Italy.
AB  - The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from the flowering aerial parts and ripe fruits of Echinophora spinosa L. (Apiaceae) from central Italy were analyzed by GC/MS. The major constituents of the oil from the aerial parts were beta-phellandrene (34.7%), myristicin (16.5%), delta3-carene (12.6%), alpha-pinene (6.7%) and alpha-phellandrene (6.2%), and of the oil from the ripe fruits p-cymene (50.2%), myristicin (15.3%), alpha-pinene (15.1%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.1%). The two oils showed good antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Eubacterium limosum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Candida albicans with MIC values respectively of 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50%, v/v, and 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 2.25, 0.50%, v/v, for aerial parts and ripe fruits respectively. A less significant antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, very important in the intestinal microflora, was also detected, with MIC values higher than 4.0%, v/v.
TI  - Subgingival microflora in inflammatory bowel disease patients with untreated periodontitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the subgingival microflora composition of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with untreated chronic periodontitis and compare them with systemically healthy controls also having untreated chronic periodontitis. METHOD: Thirty IBD patients [15 with Crohn's disease (CD) and 15 with ulcerative colitis (UC)] and 15 control individuals participated in the study. All patients had been diagnosed with untreated chronic periodontitis. From every patient, subgingival plaque was collected from four gingivitis and four periodontitis sites with paper points. Samples from the same category (gingivitis or periodontitis) in each patient were pooled together and stored at -70 degrees C until analysis using a checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique for 74 bacterial species. RESULTS: Multiple-comparison analysis showed that the groups differed in bacterial counts for Bacteroides ureolyticus, Campylobacter gracilis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, and Treponema denticola (P<0.001). CD patients had significantly higher levels of these bacteria than UC patients either in gingivitis or in periodontitis sites (P<0.05). CD patients harbored higher levels of P. melaninogenica, S. aureus, S. anginosus, and S. mutans compared with controls both at gingivitis and at periodontitis sites (P<0.05). UC patients harbored higher levels of S. aureus (P=0.01) and P. anaerobius (P=0.05) than controls only in gingivitis sites. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that even with similar clinical periodontal parameters, IBD patients harbor higher levels of bacteria that are related to opportunistic infections in inflamed subgingival sites that might be harmful for the crucial microbe-host interaction.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens related to chronic suppurative otitis media in individuals with cleft palate: bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the microbial etiology of chronic suppurative otitis media comparing the methods of classical bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: Bacteriological analysis by classical culture and by molecular polymerase chain reaction of 35 effusion otitis samples from patients with cleft lip and palate attending the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies of the University of Sao Paulo, Bauru, Brazil. INTERVENTIONS: Collection of clinical samples of otitis by effusion through the external auditory tube. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Otolaryngologic diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media. RESULTS: Positive cultures were obtained from 83% of patients. Among the 31 bacterial lineages the following were isolated. In order of decreasing frequency: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (25.9%), and Enterococcus faecalis (19.2%). No anaerobes were isolated by culture. The polymerase chain reaction was positive for one or more bacteria investigated in 97.1% of samples. Anaerobe lineages were detected by the polymerase chain reaction method, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum , Bacteroides fragilis , and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius . CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cleft lip and palate with chronic suppurative otitis media presented high frequency of bacterial infection in the middle ear. The classical bacteriological culture did not detect strict anaerobes, whose presence was identified by the polymerase chain reaction method.
TI  - Cervical necrotizing fasciitis and a descending mediastinal abscess caused by acute epiglottitis with diabetes mellitus: a life-threatening complication.
AB  - Cervical necrotizing fasciitis and a descending mediastinal abscess of the neck following acute epiglottitis, life-threatening complications, is reported in a 43-year-old man with DM. The bacterial culture showed Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. The patient recovered after surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics therapy.
TI  - Primary sternal osteomyelitis due to Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Primary sternal osteomyelitis (PSO) is a rare syndrome. In adults, it usually occurs with underlying predisposing factors, such as immunodeficiency, or intravenous (IV) drug abuse. The infecting organism in these patients is usually Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Peptostreptococcus species are Gram-positive anaerobic cocci and are part of the normal flora of human mucocutaneous surfaces. Peptostreptococcus infection can occur in all body sites, including the central nervous system, head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, skin, bone, joint, and soft tissue. Here, we report on a 32-year-old previously healthy Chinese man who was diagnosed with PSO and P. anaerobius was yielded in the bacterial culture. He was treated empirically with antibiotics, but these failed. After additional limited surgical intervention with debridement, the PSO was cured.
TI  - Peptostreptococcus anaerobius infective endocarditis complicated by spleen infarction.
AB  - Peptostreptococcus sp., which are normal flora of human mucocutaneous surfaces, can be recovered in mixed infections involving the skin, soft tissue, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract. Peptostreptococci are rarely reported to be the cause of infective endocarditis. Because of their fastidiousness, peptostreptococci are difficult to isolate and are often overlooked. The authors report a case of Peptostreptococcus infective endocarditis of a native mitral valve complicated by splenic infarction. The authors also review the literature to identify features of infective endocarditis caused by Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
TI  - Effects of adding polyclonal antibody preparations on ruminal fermentation patterns and digestibility of cows fed different energy sources.
AB  - Nine ruminally cannulated cows fed different energy sources were used to evaluate an avian-derived polyclonal antibody preparation (PAP-MV) against the specific ruminal bacteria Streptococcus bovis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Clostridium aminophilum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sticklandii and monensin (MON) on ruminal fermentation patterns and in vivo digestibility. The experimental design was three 3 x 3 Latin squares distinguished by the main energy source in the diet [dry-ground corn grain (CG), high-moisture corn silage (HMCS), or citrus pulp (CiPu)]. Inside each Latin square, animals received one of the feed additives per period [none (CON), MON, or PAP-MV]. Dry matter intake and ruminal fermentation variables such as pH, total short-chain fatty acids (tSCFA), which included acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as well as lactic acid and NH(3)-N concentration were analyzed in this trial. Total tract DM apparent digestibility and its fractions were estimated using chromic oxide as an external marker. Each experimental period lasted 21 d. Ruminal fluid sampling was carried out on the last day of the period at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after the morning meal. Ruminal pH was higher (P = 0.006) 4 h postfeeding in MON and PAP-MV groups when compared with CON. Acetate:propionate ratio was greater in PAP-MV compared with MON across sampling times. Polyclonal antibodies did not alter (P > 0.05) tSCFA, molar proportion of acetate and butyrate, or lactic acid and NH(3)-N concentration. Ruminal pH was higher (P = 0.01), 4 h postfeeding in CiPu diets compared with CG and HMCS. There was no interaction between feed additive and energy source (P > 0.05) for any of the digestibility coefficients analyzed. Starch digestibility was less (P = 0.008) in PAP-MV when compared with CON and MON. In relation to energy sources, NDF digestibility was greater (P = 0.007) in CG and CiPu vs. the HMCS diet. The digestibility of ADF was greater (P = 0.002) in CiPu diets followed by CG and HMCS. Feeding PAP-MV or monensin altered ruminal fermentation patterns and digestive function in cows; however, those changes were independent of the main energy source of the diet.
TI  - Impact of systemic antimicrobials combined with anti-infective mechanical debridement on the microbiota of generalized aggressive periodontitis: a 6-month RCT.
AB  - AIM: To compare the effects of systemic amoxicillin (AMX) plus metronidazole (MET) or placebos combined with anti-infective mechanical debridement on the sub-gingival microbiota of generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was a 6-month randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Thirty-one subjects received full-mouth ultrasonic debridement followed by scaling and root planing with chlorhexidine rinsing, brushing and irrigation. During mechanical therapy, subjects received systemic AMX (500mg)+MET (250mg) or placebo, t.i.d. for 10 days. Sub-gingival samples were obtained from each patient and analysed for their composition by checkerboard at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-therapy. Significant differences between groups over time were examined by General Linear Model of Repeated Measures. RESULTS: High levels of periodontal pathogens, as well as some "non-periodontal" species were observed. Most of the periodontal pathogens decreased significantly over time (p<0.05), whereas "non-periodontal" bacteria tended to increase in both groups. Sites that showed attachment loss and probing depth increase harboured higher levels of Dialister pneumosintes, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Prevotella tannerea and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius than sites that improved after both therapies (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic AMX+MET or placebos adjunctive to anti-infective mechanical debridement were comparable in lowering periodontal pathogens up to 6 months after treatment. Species not commonly associated with GAP were less affected by both therapies.
TI  - Efficacy of an anaerobic swab transport system to maintain aerobic and anaerobic  microorganism viability after storage at -80 degrees C.
AB  - An Amies agar gel swab transport system was evaluated for its ability to maintain bacterial viability and relative quantity after freezing at -80 degrees C. Nine American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) bacterial strains were used: 3 anaerobic strains (Propionibacterium acnes, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sporogenes) and 6 facultative or strict aerobic bacterial strains (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Escherichia coli ([ATCC 25922 and ATCC 11775], Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Lactobacillus casei). The bacterial species were chosen because they corresponded to bacteria identified in psittacine feces and cloacal samples. There were no significant differences between growth scores at baseline and after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days for any of the bacteria examined after 48 and 72 hr of incubation, with the exception of P. anaerobius. For P. anaerobius, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in the growth score after storage at -80 degrees C for 40 days from that of the baseline; however, the bacteria were still viable. The tested swab transport system may be useful when lengthy storage and transport times necessitate freezing samples prior to culture.
TI  - Peptostreptococcus russellii sp. nov., isolated from a swine-manure storage pit.
AB  - Using a polyphasic approach, a taxonomic study was performed on seven strains of  an unknown Gram-reaction-positive, non-spore-forming, obligately anaerobic coccus-shaped bacterium, isolated from a swine-manure storage pit. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed that all seven isolates were highly related to each other and formed a hitherto unknown lineage within the clostridial rRNA XI cluster of organisms. Pairwise analysis demonstrated that the novel organism was most closely related to Peptostreptococcus anaerobius CCUG 7835(T) and Peptostreptococcus stomatis CCUG 51858(T) with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 95.5 and 93.0 %, respectively. The peptidoglycan type of the cell wall was determined to be A4alpha l-Lys-d-Asp and glucose, xylose and traces of mannose were detected as the cell-wall sugars. Based on biochemical, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic evidence the unknown bacterium represents a new species of the genus Peptostreptococcus, for which the name Peptostreptococcus russellii sp. nov, is proposed. The type strain is RT-10B(T) ( = CCUG 58235(T) = NRRL B-59380(T) = DSM 23041(T)).
TI  - Competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains. Four probiotic bacterial species (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium) were isolated from yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. RESULTS: Fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. In addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', Streptococcus sanguinis. The competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. When probiotics were inoculated first, Bifidobacterium inhibited Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas circumdentaria, and Prevotella nigrescens; L. acidophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. circumdentaria, P. nigrescens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; L. bulgaricus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. nigrescens; and S. thermophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and P. nigrescens. However, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens) were inoculated simultaneously. When periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, Prevotella intermedia inhibited Bifidobacterium and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.
TI  - Antagonism and synergism in Gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Antagonistic and synergistic substances are important for interactions between micro-organisms associated with human body surfaces, either in healthy or in diseased conditions. In the present study, such compounds produced by Gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) were detected in vitro and the antagonistic ones were partially characterized. Among 11 G. vaginalis strains tested, all showed antagonistic activity against at least one of the 22 indicator bacteria assayed. Interestingly, for some of these strains, antagonism reverted to synergism, favouring one of the indicator strains (Peptostreptococcus anaerobius) when the growth medium was changed. Partial characterization of antagonistic substances suggested a bacteriocin-like chemical nature. Depending on growth conditions, G. vaginalis isolated from women with BV produced antagonistic or synergistic compounds for other bacterial components of the vaginal ecosystem. This is the first report to our knowledge of the production of antagonistic and/or synergistic substances by G. vaginalis. This ability may be a pivotal factor in understanding BV and the ecological role of this bacterium in the vaginal environment.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of aloe vera tooth gel and two popular commercial toothpastes: an in vitro study.
AB  - Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) has been suggested for a wide variety of ailments but its use in dentistry is limited. This article reviews the uses of the plant and describes an in vitro investigation that compared the antimicrobial effectiveness of aloe vera tooth gel with two popular, commercially available dentifrices. The preliminary results showed that aloe vera tooth gel and the toothpastes were equally effective against Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Aloe vera tooth gel demonstrated enhanced antibacterial effect against S. mitis.
TI  - Starvation response and growth in serum of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella intermedia, and Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus.
AB  - The microbiota inhabiting the untreated root canal differ markedly from those found in post-treatment disease, yet there is limited information on the microbial characteristics distinguishing the different infections. We hypothesized that starvation survival is a key microbial property in species selection. This study analyzed starvation-survival behavior over 60 days of species representative of the untreated root canal infection: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella intermedia and Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. All species did not survive 1 day in water. In 1% serum, the 4 species could not survive beyond 2-3 weeks. They required a high initial cell density and >or=10% serum to survive the observation period. The results highlight a poor starvation-survival capacity of these 4 species compared with species prevalent in post-treatment infection, which are well equipped to endure starvation and survive in low numbers on minimal serum. These findings point to starvation-survival capacity as a selection factor for microbial participation in post-treatment disease.
TI  - The antimicrobial effects of hops (Humulus lupulus L.) on ruminal hyper ammonia-producing bacteria.
AB  - AIM: To assess the antimicrobial effects of hops (Humulus lupulus L.) on hyper ammonia producing-bacteria (HAB), which catabolize amino acids and peptides in the bovine rumen. METHODS AND RESULTS: When media were amended with dried hops or hops extract (30.7% lupulone), ammonia production by mixed rumen bacteria was inhibited. The growth and ammonia production of pure cultures (Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Clostridium aminophilum, or Clostridium sticklandii) was inhibited by 30 ppm lupulone at pH 6.7, and bactericidal activity was observed at pH 5.6. When hops extract was added to energized cell suspensions, the intracellular pH rapidly decreased and intracellular potassium was lost. CONCLUSIONS: The three HAB species were sensitive to the antimicrobial components in hops, and the inhibition of ammonia production by mixed rumen bacteria indicates that similar effects could be expected in the rumen. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: As much as half of the amino acids consumed by ruminants can be lost due to microbial degradation in the rumen. This study supports the idea that biologically active plant metabolites can be used to mitigate this wasteful process.
TI  - The ability of non-bacteriocin producing Streptococcus bovis strains to bind and  transfer bovicin HC5 to other sensitive bacteria.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis HC5 produces a broad spectrum lantibiotic (bovicin HC5), but  S. bovis JB1 does not have antimicrobial activity. Preliminary experiments revealed an anomaly. When S. bovis JB1 cells were washed in stationary phase S. bovis HC5 cell-free culture supernatant, the S. bovis JB1 cells were subsequently able to inhibit hyper-ammonia producing ruminal bacteria (Clostridium sticklandii, Clostridium aminophilum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius). Other non-bacteriocin producing S. bovis strains also had the ability to bind and transfer semi-purified bovicin HC5. Bovicin HC5 that was bound to S. bovis JB1 was much more resistant to Pronase E than cell-free bovicin HC5, but it could be inactivated if the incubation period was 24 h. Acidic NaCl treatment (100 mM, pH 2.0) liberates half of the bovicin HC5 from S. bovis HC5, but it did not prevent bovicin HC5 from binding to S. bovis JB1. Acidic NaCl liberated some bovicin HC5 from S. bovis JB1, but the decrease in activity was only 2-fold. Bovicin HC5 is a positively charged peptide, and the ability of S. bovis JB1 to bind bovicin HC5 could be inhibited by either calcium or magnesium (100 mM). Acidic NaCl-treated S. bovis JB1 cells were unable to accumulate potassium, but they were still able to bind bovicin HC5 and prevent potassium accumulation by untreated S. bovis JB1 cells. Based on these results, bovicin HC5 bound to S. bovis JB1 cells still acts as a pore-forming lantibiotic.
TI  - Difficult intubation provokes bacteremia.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence of bacteremia after mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, and endotracheal intubation before induction of general anesthesia and to discover any correlation between traumatic manipulations and bacteremia. The specific bacteria responsible, knowledge of which may guide the prophylactic use of antibiotics, also were investigated. METHODS: Fifty patients were enrolled. Three 10-mL blood samples were collected from a peripheral vein 10 min before induction of anesthesia, 10 min after mask ventilation, and 10 min after intubation. All samples were placed in aerobic and anaerobic bottles for culture and bacterial identification. RESULTS: Cultures received 10 min after intubation were positive in 12% of patients. The following strains were isolated: Escherichia coli in two cases, Staphylococcus aureus in three cases, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in one case. A strong positive correlation was found between difficult intubation and bacteremia. No correlation between bacteremia and easy intubation or between bacteremia and face mask ventilation was identified. CONCLUSION: Traumatic manipulations during difficult laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation could cause bacteremia. This finding may justify and guide prophylactic use of antibiotics.
TI  - The role of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 on reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production by macrophage cells stimulated with root canal pathogens.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periapical lesions arise as a result of the activation and interaction of the host immune responses against root canal infection. Recently identified Toll-like receptors (TLR) seem to be involved in the recognition and development of immune responses against a myriad of microorganisms. However, very little information is available on the role of TLR in the induction of periapical lesions. METHOD: The role of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in the activation of murine macrophages stimulated using Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was investigated. The production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that TLR-2 and TLR-4 are involved in the production of ROS by activated macrophages. The microorganisms induced similar levels of NO production by TLR-2-competent and TLR-2-deficient macrophages, regardless of the addition of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), ruling out a role for TLR-2 in the NO production induced by these bacteria. Only P. anaerobius induced NO production by TLR-4-competent macrophages without the addition of IFN-gamma. However, after IFN-gamma addition, F. nucleatum induced macrophage NO production. Therefore, NO production stimulated by IFN-gamma and these microorganisms seems to be TLR-4-independent. CONCLUSION: TLR-2 seems to be involved in the induction of ROS production by macrophages in response to prevalent root canal bacteria, while only F. nucleatum induced ROS production by TLR-4-competent macrophages. Both microorganisms significantly induced large amounts of NO independent of TLR-2 and TLR-4. We conclude that microorganisms may participate in the induction and progression of periapical lesions through NO and ROS production by activated macrophages.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - Root canal microbiota of teeth with chronic apical periodontitis.
AB  - Samples from infected root canals of 43 teeth with chronic apical periodontitis were analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 83 oral bacterial species and/or phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. Associations between the most frequently detected taxa were also recorded. The most prevalent taxa were Olsenella uli (74%), Eikenella corrodens (63%), Porphyromonas endodontalis (56%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (54%), and Bacteroidetes oral clone X083 (51%). When prevalence was considered only for bacteria present at levels >10(5), Bacteroidetes clone X083 was the most frequently isolated bacterium (37%), followed by Parvimonas micra (28%), E. corrodens (23%), and Tannerella forsythia (19%). The number of target taxa per canal was directly proportional to the size of the apical periodontitis lesion, with lesions >10 mm in diameter harboring a mean number of approximately 20 taxa. Several positive associations for the most prevalent taxa were disclosed for the first time and may have important ecological and pathogenic implications. In addition to strengthening the association of several cultivable named species with chronic apical periodontitis, the present findings using a large-scale analysis allowed the inclusion of some newly named species and as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.
TI  - The influence of mineral trioxide aggregate on adaptive immune responses to endodontic pathogens in mice.
AB  - This study assessed the influence of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) on adaptive immune responses. BALB/c mice were immunized with heat-killed Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) in MTA or other control adjuvants, and serum IgG responses to Fn were measured. Either Fn- or Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (Pa)-reactive memory T cells (Tm) were preincubated in vitro with/without MTA and restimulated with Fn or Pa. Tm proliferation and cytokine production were assessed. Compared with control groups, immunoglobulin G-antibody responses were upregulated in mice immunized with Fn in MTA in a similar manner to animals immunized with Fn in Freund's adjuvant or aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. Although MTA did not affect the upregulated expression of interleukin 10, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or RANKL by Tm, it suppressed the proliferation of Pa- or Fn-Tm and inhibited their production of Th1- or Th2-signature cytokines. MTA upregulated the adaptive humoral immune responses but had little or no effect on pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine production by Tm.
TI  - Quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in Port-A-Cul and Copan transport systems.
AB  - Transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. In this study, the Port-A-Cul transport system and the Copan transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. Dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. Combination I contained Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., group B streptococci, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Combination II contained Lactobacillus iners, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Mobiluncus curtisii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees C. Both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. Prevotella bivia and Prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. However, at 24 degrees C, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, and Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in Copan transport medium than when they were stored in Port-A-Cul transport medium for 96 h (P < 0.002). Some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees C for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group B streptococci and Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. organisms in Copan medium than in Port-A-Cul medium was observed (P < 0.002). At room temperature, the Port-A-Cul system is superior to the Copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.
TI  - Changes in abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus suis in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of piglets after weaning.
AB  - This present study investigated the changes in bacterial community composition, with an emphasis on Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus suis populations as potentially beneficial and harmful groups, in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of piglets after weaning (21 days postpartum) by 16S rRNA gene-based methods. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that, after weaning, predominant bands related to Lactobacillus spp. disappeared and were replaced by potential pathogenic species, such as Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Moraxella cuniculi, S. suis and Porphyromonas catoniae. Real-time PCR revealed that the abundances of lactobacilli and Lactobacillus sobrius as a proportion of total bacterial abundance were significantly lower in the stomach, jejunum and ileum of weaned piglets than in 21-day-old piglets. A specific and sensitive real-time PCR assay was developed for quantification of the important pathogen S. suis within gastrointestinal microbiota. The assay showed that S. suis predominated in the stomach samples of weaned piglets with population levels up to 10(7) copies g(-1) digesta, while it was not detected in the stomach before weaning. Streptococcus suis was not dominant in the jejunum and ileum digesta before weaning, but became dominant after weaning, with population levels up to 10(7) copies g(-1) digesta. The results demonstrated for the first time the postweaning dominance of the potentially harmful S. suis in piglet intestine. The results also suggest that the defensive barrier of the stomach can be impaired as S. suis became dominant while the proportion of Lactobacillus populations decreased after weaning, which may further result in an increase of S. suis abundance in the intestine.
TI  - Anaerobic liver abscesses as initial presentation of silent colonic cancer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rarely, multiple liver abscesses caused by anaerobic organisms are the presenting form of unsuspected colonic cancer in the absence of liver metastases. CASE OUTLINE: A 68-year-old man was admitted with abdominal pain, fever and chills. Imaging scans and repeated cytology yielded a diagnosis of multiple liver abscesses. Pus cultures grew Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Peptostreptococcus spp. A search for the underlying cause led to the discovery of an adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. After a 12-month postoperative follow-up, the patient is free of hepatic metastases. DISCUSSION: Anaerobic liver abscesses should always alert the clinician to possible silent colonic carcinoma.
TI  - [Co-occurence of indol-producing bacterial strains in the vagina of women infected with Chlamydia trachomatis].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine if cervicitis, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis), has an influence on the frequency of occurrence of selected aerobic and anaerobic bacterial strains, connected with etiology of aerobic vaginitis (AV) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). Indole-producing bacteria have received particular attention due to their possibly inductive role in chronic cervicitis caused by C. trachomatis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The swabs from vagina and cervical canal have been obtained from 122 women (aged 18-40). The presence of C. trachomatis antigen had been detected and diagnosed with the help of direct immunofluorescence, BV with Amesl and Nugent criteria, whereas the AV with Donders criteria. The identification of the bacterial strains isolated from vagina has been performed according to classical microbiological diagnostics. RESULTS: Disruption of vaginal microflora (4-10 in Nugent score) was determined in 11,5% of observed women. AV was diagnosed in 4.5% women with chlamydial cervicitis, BV was diagnosed in 10.9% and 5.45% of these women, on the basis of Amsel and Nugent criteria respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Indole-producing bacterial strains connected with BV and AV (Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli) have been isolated significantly more often from vagina of women infected with C trachomatis (p = 0.0405, chi2 = 4.20) and these findings confirm co-importance of indole-producing bacterial strains in cervicitis caused by C trachomatis .
TI  - [The development and in vitro experiment study of a bio-type root canal filling sealer using calcium phosphate cement].
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to develop a novel root canal filling sealers based on calcium phosphate cement (CPC), and to evaluate its physical-chemical properties and in vitro antibacterial activity on the predominant bacteria infecting root canal. METHODS: The fluidity and the setting time of the sealer were tested according to ISO 6876:2001(E) standards. The crystal size of the final product was determined. Its opacification with different composition were measured. The in vitro antibacterial property of the sealer was tested according to the Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of Anaerobes recommended by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLs). The involved bacteria included Actinomyces naeslundii(A. naeslundii), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (P. anaerobius), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Porphyromonas endodpntalis (P. endodpntalis) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum). Twenty single-rooted human extracted teeth were selected to evaluate the sealing ability using dye microleakage technology. Dye penetration was measured and the results were statistically analyzed using SPSS12.0 software package. RESULTS: The new root canal filling sealer was primarily composed of hydroxyapatite in 279 nm after setting. Its liquidity was suitable, the operating time was over 30 minutes, and the controlled setting time was (1.0+/-0.5) hours. The opacification was acceptable. MIC<or=0.156-0.312. The dye penetration was significant different between two filling types (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The new root canal filling sealer is an ideal root canal filling sealer.

TI  - Actinomycetemcomitin: a new bacteriocin produced by Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans P(7-20) strain isolated from a periodontally diseased patient has produced a bacteriocin (named as actinomycetemcomitin) that is active against Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC 27337. Actinomycetemcomitin was produced during exponential and stationary growth phases, and its amount decreased until it disappeared during the decline growth phase. It was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation (30-60% saturation), and further by FPLC (mono-Q ionic exchange and Phenyl Superose hydrophobic interaction) and HPLC (C-18 reversed-phase). This bacteriocin loses its activity after incubation at a pH below 7.0 or above 8.0, following heating for 30 min at 45 degrees C, and after treatment with proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and papain. Actinomycetemcomitin has a molecular mass of 20.3 KDa and it represents a new bacteriocin from A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Purification and partial characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Eikenella  corrodens.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to purify and characterize a bacteriocin produced by Eikenella corrodens A32E2. METHODS AND RESULTS: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC27337 was used as indicator strain in antagonistic assays for bacteriocin-producing E. corrodens A32E2. Protein extraction was influenced by pH and buffer composition. The protein was active in the pH range 6-8. Inhibitory activity was lost by both heating and treatment with proteolytic enzymes and decreased with organic solvents. The substance is rather unstable but maintains 100% of its activity after being exposed to acetone and when stored at -70 degrees C. The antagonistic substance was first precipitated by ammonium sulfate and further partially purified by Mono-Q FPLC and C-18 HPLC. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that the molecular mass was 23 625 Da, and the sequence obtained for the N-terminus was: Met-Asn-Phe-Asp-Glu-Lys-Val-Gly-Lys-Val-X-Phe-Lys-Val-Gly-Asp. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence presented in this study supports the idea that an antagonistic substance produced by E. corrodens A32E2 isolated from a periodontal diseased site is a novel bacteriocin, which we designate corrodecin. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We anticipated that corrodecin might play an important role at the periodontal site. This compound could also be attractive in biotechnological applications as an interesting tool for oral ecosystem control.
TI  - Breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections have also affected the microbial profile of breast abscesses. OBJECTIVE: To update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: County hospital emergency department. PATIENTS: Forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range, 20-63 years) with breast abscesses. METHODS: All cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. RESULTS: Of 46 specimens only 28 showed bacterial yield (61%). Of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. The most common organism was S aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with MRSA in 7 (58%). The remaining organisms included coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), Proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). All MRSA was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. Only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. Two anaerobic cultures were positive for Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. Many breast abscesses have community-acquired MRSA, with more than 50% of all S aureus and 19% of all cultures being MRSA. This finding parallels the local and national increases in MRSA reported in other soft-tissue infections. With increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.
TI  - Development of 16S rRNA-based probes for the identification of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  - Fluorescent probes targeted at 16S rRNA were designed for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus stomatis (Pana134), Parvimonas micra (Pamic1435), Finegoldia magna (Fmag1250), Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (Pnasa1254), Peptoniphilus ivorii (Pnivo731), Peptoniphilus harei (Pnhar1466), Anaerococcus vaginalis (Avag1280) and Anaerococcus lactolyticus (Alac1438), based on the 16S rRNA sequences of reference strains and 88 randomly chosen clinical isolates. These strains were also used for validation of the probes. Application of the probes to an additional group of 100 clinical isolates revealed that 87% of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) could be identified with this set of probes. The 16S rRNAs of 13 clinical isolates that could not be identified were sequenced. Most of these isolates were GPAC that were not targeted by the probes. No clinical isolates of Pn. asaccharolyticus were encountered. Near full-length sequences were obtained from 71 of 101 (n = 88 + 13) sequenced clinical isolates. Of these, 25 showed <98% similarity with the homologues of the closest established species. The Fmag1250, Pamic1435, Pnhar1466, Pana134, Pnasa1254 and Pnivo731 probes allowed reliable identification and hybridised with all corresponding isolates. The Avag1280 and Alac1438 probes failed to hybridise with two isolates and one isolate, respectively, because of intra-species variation. However, overall, the set of probes yielded fast and reliable identification for the majority of clinical isolates.
TI  - The effect of mineral trioxide aggregate on phagocytic activity and production of reactive oxygen, nitrogen species and arginase activity by M1 and M2 macrophages.
AB  - AIM: To assess the influence of co-culture with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)  on phagocytosis and the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and nitrogen (NO) species and the arginase activity by M1 and M2 peritoneal macrophages. METHODOLOGY: Cellular viability, adherence and phagocytosis of Saccharomyces boulardii were assayed in the presence of MTA. Macrophages were stimulated with zymosan for ROI assays and with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and IFN-gamma for NO production and arginase activity, when in contact with capillaries containing MTA. Data were analysed by T, anova, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: M2 macrophages displayed greater cellular viability in polypropylene tubes, greater ability to ingest yeast and smaller production of ROI and higher arginase activity when compared with M1 macrophages. Both macrophages, M1 and M2, presented similar cell adherence and NO production. The addition of bacterial preparations to macrophages interfered with NO and arginase productions. MTA did not interfere with any of the parameters measured. CONCLUSIONS: Phagocytosis and the ability of the two macrophage subtypes to eliminate microbes were not affected by MTA.
TI  - Production of antagonistic substance by Eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  - AIMS: Antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. However, reports regarding this phenomenon in Eikenella corrodens are not available. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen E. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (E. corrodens ATCC23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. The following indicators were used: Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC381, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611, Actinomyces israelii ATCC12102, Eubacterium lentum ATCC25559, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC27337, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDCY4, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC10953, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10557, Streptococcus uberis ATCC9927, Streptococcus mutans IM/UFRJ, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC33591 and Candida albicans ATCC18804. All the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains. This phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by E. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first description of antagonistic compound production by E. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.
TI  - [Microbiocenosis of stomach in children with chronic gastritis].
AB  - Qualitative and quantitative composition of gastric microflora has been studied in 30 children with chronic gastritis. Bacteriological study of gastric biopsies and parietal mucus in 10 children with chronic gastritis not associated with Helicobacter pylori more frequently revealed conditionally pathogenic bacteria--Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, S. pyogenes (group A), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, P. prevotii and their associations. In 20 studied patients with H.pylori-associated chronic gastritis composition of local microflora was less diverse--conditionally pathogenic, lacto- and bifidobacteria often were absent. Study showed that eradication of H. pylori led to appearance of conditionally pathogenic bacteria in stomach microflora, which were frequently isolated in associations. Not effective treatment was associated with disappearance of lacto- and bifidobacteria and frequent isolation of Candida albicans.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  - Propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in Turkey and from Brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of EEP on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. All strains were susceptible and MIC values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. Propolis from Kazan-Ankara showed most effective MIC values to the studied microorganisms. MBC values of Kazan-Ankara EEP samples were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. Death was observed within 4 h of incubation for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for Prevotella oralis and Prevotella melaninogenica and Porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for Veillonella parvula. It was shown that propolis samples were more effective against Gram positive anaerobic bacteria than Gram negative ones. The organic chemical compositions of EEPs were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main compounds of EEPs were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. Because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and the newly described Peptostreptococcus stomatis isolated from various human sources.
AB  - Peptostreptococcus anaerobius sensu lato, currently including two closely related species, P. anaerobius and P. stomatis, is known to be more resistant than other gram-positive anaerobic cocci. We reidentified potential Peptostreptococcus isolates and tested their susceptibilities to eight antimicrobials. Notably, P. anaerobius had constantly higher values for the MIC at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC(50)) and the MIC(90) than P. stomatis.
TI  - Antianaerobe activity of ceftobiprole, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - Agar dilution testing of 463 anaerobes showed most Gram-positive beta-lactamase-negative strains (other than some Clostridium difficile and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), as well as both beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum, to have ceftobiprole MIC values of < or =0.016 to 4 microg/mL. Ceftobiprole was less active against beta-lactamase-positive Gram-negative bacilli, especially the members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Like ceftobiprole, piperacillin was active mainly against beta-lactamase-negative strains, though MIC values for piperacillin were often 1 to 2 dilutions higher than for ceftobiprole. Carbapenems had MIC values < or =4 microg/L against all except some C. difficile and 2 strains of B. fragilis. All strains were susceptible to metronidazole, and all bacteria, except C. difficile and a single Bacteroides distasonis strain, were susceptible to chloramphenicol. Clindamycin resistance was seen in most anaerobe groups, whereas high moxifloxacin MICs were found mainly among the B. fragilis and Prevotella groups, and a few C. difficile and F. nucleatum strains.
TI  - Activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1DRa, temporin-1Va and the melittin-related peptides AR-23 and RV-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1DRa from Rana draytonii and temporin-1Va from Rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (AR-23 from Rana tagoi and RV-23 from R. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. These peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. All peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) </=25 microM) against the Gram-positive bacilli Propionibacterium acnes and Clostridium tertium and the Gram-positive cocci Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Activity was lower and more variable against Clostridium septicum, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. Growth of the Gram-negative bacilli Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (MIC</=25 microM) against Prevotella melaninogenica. The clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1DRa and temporin-1Va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated  from diabetic foot infections.
AB  - Against 443 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from diabetic foot infections, ceftobiprole MICs (microg/ml) at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited were as follows: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 1; methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, 0.5; Anaerococcus prevotii, 0.125; Finegoldia magna, 0.5; Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, 1; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 4; Escherichia coli and Enterobacter species, 0.125; Klebsiella species, 2; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 8.
TI  - Coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic Enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  - Interactions between Enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus anginosus. Intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. All E. faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with F. nucleatum; E. faecalis did not coaggregate with P. anaerobius or S. anginosus. One strain, E. faecalis E1, coaggregated with P. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. Coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis and F. nucleatum observed in this study suggest a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria cultured from the tongue dorsum of subjects with oral malodor.
AB  - The bacteria on the dorsum of the tongue are the most frequent cause of oral malodor; however, the bacterial flora of the tongue has not been well defined. Although recent studies have used DNA probes to detect the presence of certain periodontal pathogens, cultural studies have been limited because of the complexity of the flora of the tongue dorsum. The purpose of this study was to grow and to identify maximum numbers of capnophylic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic micro-organisms by culturing tongue samples on to several selective and non-selective media. The most frequently isolated species included Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Collinsella aerofaciens, Eubacterium group, Actinomyces spp., Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented Prevotella spp. and Selenomonas spp. Reported for the first time are Actinomyces turicensis, Collinsella aerofaciens, Eubacterium saburreum, E. timidum, Prevotella tannerae, Campylobacter concisus, Campylobacter mucosalis, Leptotrichia buccalis, Selenomonas flueggei, and Centipeda periodontii. Species not previously reported in studies that used only molecular techniques were identified in the present study.
TI  - An in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. The agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. In this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic Gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. The time-kill experiment was performed using Anaerobe Broth medium. The drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/L for linezolid, 2mg/L for clindamycin, and 8mg/L for metronidazole. Samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the Bioscience International Autospiral DW. Exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. Plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees C). The species tested included Bacteroides fragilis (2), B. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. varium, Prevotella melaninogenica, Clostridium perfringens, Eubacterium lentum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). The activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. As expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. Metronidazole yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three strains. Linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. The profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.
TI  - Taxonomy--General comments and update on taxonomy of Clostridia and Anaerobic cocci.
AB  - Since such things as sites of normal carriage, type and severity of infections produced, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns may vary according to the particular species involved, accurate taxonomy for differentiation of species is important. For example, reclassification of the 'Bacteroides gracilis group' revealed that Sutterella wadsworthensis is actually responsible for the antimicrobial resistance seen in that group. With clostridia and anaerobic cocci, as with other taxa, there have been a number of recent changes in classification of existing taxa as well as description of novel taxa. It is important that both clinicians and microbiologists adapt quickly to new classification schemes and new taxa as soon as they are validated. For example, Peptostreptococcus is now restricted to the species P. anaerobius and five new genera have been created. There has also been significant reclassification of clostridia and new species of clostridia have also been described.
TI  - Evaluation of 4 swab transport systems for the recovery of ATCC and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Despite limitations of swab transport systems (STS), many clinical samples and bacterial isolates are sent on these devices. We evaluated the performance of 4 commercial STS: M40 Transystem (S1, Copan Italia, Bovezzo, Italy), UNI-TER (S2, MEUS, Piove di Sacco, Italy), Euromed (S3, LAB SERVICE, Surbo, Italy), and Eurotubo (S4, Deltalab, Rubi, Spain). Survival of ATCC and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms, stored at room temperature and using the roll-plate method (NCCLS M40-A) after holding times of 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, was assessed. After 24 h, only S1 was able to maintain Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6305), Haemophilus influenzae (10211), and Neisseria meningitidis (13090) viability with a percentage range of recovery with respect to the baseline count at zero time of 104-184%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (43069) was uncultivable after 6 h with all STS except S1 (46% recovery). Eighteen percent recovery after 24 h and 7% after 6 h was observed for Fusobacterium nucleatum (25586) and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (27337), respectively, but only with S1. Resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates do not affect survival with any of the STS.
TI  - In vitro activity of oritavancin (LY333328), vancomycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against Clostridium perfringens, Propionibacterium acnes, and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Using an agar dilution method, we determined the in vitro activity of oritavancin, vancomycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 114 unique clinical isolates of Gram-positive anaerobes. MIC(90)s (microg/mL) for oritavancin were as follows: Clostridium perfringens 1.0, Propionibacterium acnes 0.25, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius 0.25, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus 0.5, Finegoldia magna 0.25, Micromonas. micros 0.25, and Anaerococcus prevotii 0.25. On a weight basis, oritavancin is slightly more active than vancomycin against the strains tested. The oritavancin MICs are comparable to those previously reported against staphylococci and enterococci. Oritavancin shows excellent potential for treatment of infections containing Gram-positive anaerobes such as these.
TI  - Anaerobic microbiology in 198 cases of pleural empyema: a Bulgarian study.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of anaerobic bacteria in 198 patients with pleural empyema and the susceptibility of isolates to eight antibacterial agents. Isolates were identified by the Crystal anaerobes identification system, API System rapid ID 32 A and/or routine methods. Susceptibility was tested by Sceptor MIC system for anaerobic bacteria and limited agar dilution method. Anaerobic bacteria were found in 74.2% of the patients and included 247 strains within 21 genera. The predominant anaerobes were Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (52 isolates), Fusobacterium (51), microaerophilic streptococci (24), Prevotella (19) and Bacteroides species (11). Common species/groups were Fusobacterium nucleatum (in 27.2% of specimens yielding anaerobes), Micromonas micros (8.2%), Finegoldia magna (7.5%), Bacteroides fragilis group (6.8%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6.1%) and F. necrophorum (5.4%). No resistance to chloramphenicol and ampicillin/sulbactam was detected. The susceptibility rates of Gram-negative anaerobic isolates to penicillin, cefoxitin, clindamycin, clarithromycin, metronidazole and tetracycline were 63.8%, 90.2%, 87.8%, 58.6%, 98.8% and 71%, and those of Gram-positive anaerobes were 79.2%, 100%, 84.3%, 68.4%, 41.9% and 75%, respectively. The wide diversity of isolated anaerobic genera and species and the susceptibility patterns of the isolates emphasize the role of the anaerobic microbiology in cases of pleural empyema.
TI  - Peptostreptococcus stomatis sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  - Seven strains of anaerobic Gram-positive cocci isolated from human oral sites were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the strains constituted a homogeneous group that was distinct from species with validly published names, but related to Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. All oral strains tested belonged to this group, whereas all non-oral strains studied were confirmed as P. anaerobius. A novel species, Peptostreptococcus stomatis sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these oral strains. P. stomatis is weakly saccharolytic and produces acetic, butyric, isobutyric, isovaleric and isocaproic acids as end products of fermentation. The type strain of P. stomatis is W2278T (=DSM 17678T = CCUG 51858T); the G+C content of the DNA of this strain is 36 mol%.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in New Zealand: 1999-2003.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Routine susceptibility testing of all anaerobic organisms is not advocated, but it is useful for laboratories to test periodically for anaerobic organisms and provide local susceptibility data to guide therapy. This study reports the national trend of antibiotic susceptibility of clinically significant anaerobes in New Zealand. METHODS: Clinical isolates were tested using standardized methods against a range of antibiotics commonly used to treat anaerobic infections. Susceptibility was determined using NCCLS criteria. The change in susceptibility trends between this study and earlier studies was measured by comparing the geometric mean of the MIC. RESULTS: A total of 364 anaerobes were tested. Penicillin had poor activity against Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Eubacterium spp., Clostridium tertium and Veillonella spp. In general, Fusobacterium spp., Bacteroides ureolyticus, Propionibacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens and anaerobic streptococci isolates, with the exception of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, were penicillin susceptible. Amoxicillin/clavulanate showed good activity against most anaerobes, but resistance was seen with Bacteroides fragilis group and P. anaerobius isolates. Cefoxitin was more active than cefotetan, particularly against non-B. fragilis species, Eubacterium spp. and P. anaerobius. Meropenem and imipenem showed good activity against all anaerobes, with only 2 and 4% of Bacteroides spp., respectively, showing resistance. With the exception of Propionibacterium acnes isolates, which are predictably resistant, metronidazole was active against all anaerobes tested. There has been little change in susceptibility since 1997. CONCLUSIONS: Metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate remain good empirical choices when anaerobes are expected in our setting. No clinically relevant changes in susceptibility over time were found.
TI  - Effect of mineral trioxide aggregate on cytokine production by peritoneal macrophages.
AB  - AIM: To test the effect of two commercial brands of grey mineral trioxide aggregate (ProRoot and MTA-Angelus) on cytokine production by M1 and M2 inflammatory macrophages. METHODOLOGY: M1 (from C57BL/6 mice) and M2 peritoneal inflammatory macrophages (from C57BL/6 IL12p40-/- mice) were obtained and cultured in vitro in the presence of MTA. The cellular viability and the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-10 in response to stimulation with interferon-gamma and Fusobacterium nucleatum or Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were evaluated. Data were analysed by Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and anova tests. RESULTS: The cements did not interfere with cellular viability or with cytokine production by either type of macrophage. However, M2 macrophages produced higher levels of IL-10 when stimulated with F. nucleatum than M1 macrophages (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The brands of MTA evaluated did not interfere in the cytokine response by M1 or M2 macrophages to the two bacteria tested. However, a difference in cytokine production between the two types of macrophages was found.
TI  - [Two cases of Bartholin's gland abscesses caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and  Haemophilus influenzae].
AB  - Most of Bartholin's gland abscesses have been thought to be caused by microorganisms found in opportunistic infections. However, we have encountered two very interesting cases of Bartholin's gland abscesses caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, two major pathogens of respiratory tract infections. In the first case, since abscess formation was not observed due to disintegration, cefdinir (CFDN), 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days was administered. The treatment improved clinical symptoms, but relapse occurred 3 days after the administration was discontinued. Microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Finegoldia magna, and it also showed that the isolated S. pneumoniae was penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP). After an incision and drainage of abscess, cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI), 300 mg/day t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. In the second case, after an incision and drainage of Bartholin's gland abscess, amoxicillin (AMPC), 750 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days, was administered. The treatment improved clinical symptoms temporarily. However, the symptoms deteriorated 7 days after the operation, and the patient was diagnosed with relapse. Microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of Haemophilus influenzae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and it also showed that the isolated H. influenzae was beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR). After performing additional incision and drainage of abscess again, CFTM-PI, 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. In addition, the analysis of these two cases using PK/PD theory revealed that the time above MIC reached 100% with administration of CFTM-PI 300mg, t.i.d. suggesting that the dosage is sufficient for treating these infections. There are other cases of external genitalia infections caused by microorganisms usually associated with respiratory tract infections like cases that we are reporting here. Therefore, it is necessary to consider a possible infection by drug-resistant bacteria even for a case of external genitalia infection. In addition, it was thought that adjusting dosage and method for administration of antibacterial agents based on PK/PD theory would help to rovide efficient treatment.
TI  - [Comparison of the detection of anaerobic bacteria in haemoculture systems BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F, BacT/Alert FAN Anaerobic and BacT/Alert FN Anaerobic].
AB  - The purpose of this study is to deal with the problem of anaerobic cultivation of clinical specimens and consider the possibility of using semi-automated blood culture instruments. The Bactec Lytic, BacT/Alert FAN Anaerobic and BacT/Alert FN Anaerobic bottles were inoculated with Bacteriodes fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Feingoldia magna strains. The times to detection (TTD) for positive bottles were evaluated with reference to the number of inoculated bacteria. Inoculation with the same suspension of equal bacterial strain resulted in shorter TTD values for all the Bactec Lytic bottles as compared with the BacT/Alert FAN Anaerobic or BacT/Alert FN Anaerobic bottles, respectively. Statistically significant differences were recorded (p=0,05) by Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens species. Feingoldia magna was submitted to culture in the Bactec Lytic alone. The anaerobic blood culture bottles are deemed acceptable for application in the culture of anaerobc isolates drawn from other samples except for blood (namely when prompt delivery of the sample to the laboratory is impossible and the sample can suffer damage), however, only a limited range of microorganisms can be taken into account for the detection purposes. The Bactec Lytic bottles are more appropriately designed for the detection of anaerobic bacterial species compared to the BacT/Alert FAN Anaerobic and BacT/Alert FN Anaerobic bottles. They achieve faster growth parametres and provide more successful readings of anaerobic bacteria culture and detection.
TI  - Variation in antimicrobial action of proanthocyanidins from Dorycnium rectum against rumen bacteria.
AB  - The proanthocyanidin polymer fractions of the leaves of the forage legume Dorycnium rectum were analysed by acid catalysis with benzyl mercaptan, NMR and ES-MS. The results showed that D. rectum differs from other temperate proanthocyanidin-containing forage legumes in that the range of polymers extends up to very high degrees of polymerisation. Three fractions were characterised as low, medium, and high molecular weight proanthocyanidin fractions with mean degree of polymerisations of 10.3, 41 and 127, respectively. Epigallocatechin was the most abundant extension unit and the terminating flavan-3-ols comprised largely catechin and gallocatechin units in equal proportions. Formation of thiolyated dimer products showed the interflavan-linkages of the lower molecular weight proanthocyanidins to be predominantly C4-->C8 with a small amount of C4-->C6. ES-MS spectra distinguished lower from higher polymeric proanthocyanidins from M2- to M8(2)-. The antibacterial activity of proanthocyanidin fractions against pure cultures of microbes selected from the ruminal population to represent fibre degrading, proteolytic and hyper ammonia producing bacteria in broth culture was evaluated. The activity of proanthocyanidin fractions against Clostridium aminophilum, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Clostridium proteoclasticum was significantly dependent on their structure but not so against Ruminococcus albus and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. The latter observation was unique in that they were sensitive to all proanthocyanidin fractions evaluated, even at the lowest concentration (100 microg/ml). The results suggest the effects of the extractable proanthocyanidins on rumen microbes should be considered when evaluating an alternative proanthocyanidin-containing forage source for ruminants, such as D. rectum.
TI  - Apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  Experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  - In six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species Streptococcus milleri, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of Enterococcus faecalis. All strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. After 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. From 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. The two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. Apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. Endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. The chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. The facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. The five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.
TI  - Surveillance of susceptibility patterns in 1297 European and US anaerobic and capnophilic isolates to co-amoxiclav and five other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility data were collected for co-amoxiclav and other antimicrobial agents against 1297 recent anaerobe isolates collected in Europe and the USA. The co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) MIC(50/90)s (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid concentration in a ratio of 2:1, expressed in terms of amoxicillin concentration in mg/L) were 0.5/4 for Bacteroides fragilis, </=0.125/1 for Prevotella species, </=0.125/0.25 for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5/1 for Eikenella corrodens, 0.25/8 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, </=0.125/0.5 for Micromonas (Peptostreptococcus) micros, </=0.25/0.5 for Fingoldia (Peptostreptococcus) magna, and </=0.125/0.125 for Porphyromonas species. The co-amoxiclav susceptibility rate for B. fragilis was 94.6%, for P. anaerobius 84.3% and for all other species tested 100%. These data indicate that co-amoxiclav remains an effective drug for the antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis of many anaerobic infections. Among the comparator drugs, metronidazole was very active against all bacterial species (>96% susceptible) except E. corrodens (MIC(50/90) of >32/>64 mg/L), which is a capnophilic organism. Imipenem was also highly active against all species (>98% susceptible). Levofloxacin and clindamycin were the least potent agents tested, particularly against Bacteroides, Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus (levofloxacin susceptibility rates: Bacteroides 72.7%, Prevotella 71.5%, F. magna 72.4%; clindamycin susceptibility rates: Bacteroides 79.5%, Prevotella 92.1%, F. magna 84.7%).
TI  - The use of PCR for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
AB  - PCR primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from Streptococcus gallolyticus LRC0255 and the bacteriocin genes from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains AR10 and OR79A (bviD and bvi79A) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal B. fibrisolvens and Streptococcus bovis-like isolates from New Zealand and North American ruminants. None of the B. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from New Zealand or North America had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins AR10 (bviD) or OR79 (bvi79A). However, seven S. bovis isolates from New Zealand ruminants and three from North American animals had the bovicin 255 gene. Sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 PCR products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of S. gallolyticus. Four of the New Zealand bovicin 255 positive S. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical PFGE profiles. Two other S. bovis isolates sharing the same PFGE profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. PFGE analysis of the North American strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical PFGE profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to S. bovis. All 10 S. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius D1 in a deferred antagonism plating (DAP) assay. Certain S. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe B. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in New Zealand.
TI  - Phospholipid analogue profiles of Peptostreptococcus, Micromonas, and Finegoldia  species analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.
AB  - Species of Peptostreptococcus cause a variety of infections, primarily abscesses  of soft tissues, joints, and mucous membranes. The aim of this study was to compare the phospholipid analogue profiles of Peptostreptococcus species, represented by P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. indolicus, P. lacrimalis, and P. prevotii; Micromonas micros (P. micros) and Finegoldia magna (P. magnus). After anaerobic growth on blood-FAA, lipids extracted by chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v) were purified, then analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) in negative ion mode. The major peaks with mass to charge (m/z) 719, 721, and 749, corresponded to phosphatidylglycerol analogues, namely PG (32:1), PG (32:0), and PG (34:0), which have been found previously in Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Staphylococcus spp. Other major peaks observed, with m/z 619, 647, 665, 675, 677, 687, 691, 693, 701, 703, 707, 733, and 746 have also been reported in one or more of these three species. However, other major peaks found here in Peptostreptococcus, Micromonas, and Finegoldia have not been described elsewhere; these are 501, 514, 515, 618, 659, 673, 676, 688, 690, 692, 694, 700, 706, 715, 718, 722, and 750. We conclude that Peptostreptococcus, Micromonas, and Finegoldia isolates are chemically unique.
TI  - Inflammatory polyp in the middle ear with secondary suppurative meningoencephalitis in a cat.
AB  - A 15-month-old male Maine Coon Cat presented with persistent auricular discharge  and progressive head tilt, ataxia, and loss of blink on the right side. Using computed tomography a hyperattenuating, contrast-enhancing material within a thickened right tympanic bulla and contrast enhancement of the adjacent cerebellum were identified. Marked suppurative inflammation was identified on cerebrospinal fluid analysis with no growth on bacterial culture. Ventral bulla osteotomy was performed to remove a soft tissue mass, and an inflammatory polyp with chronic severe suppurative inflammation was confirmed using histology. Staphylococcus auricularis was grown on aerobic culture and Fusobacterium necrophorum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were grown on anaerobic culture. The cat was treated for 10 weeks with amoxicillin/clavulinic acid and metronidazole. Dramatic improvement in body weight, appetite, energy level, balance, and resolution of right-sided facial paralysis were noted, but the cat retained a head tilt.
TI  - [Effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (PO) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Propionibacterium propionicum, Clostridium difficile) and fungi (Candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. The study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of PO decreased antilysozyme activity (ALA) and the anticomplement activity in Klebsiella, Shigella, Propionibacterium, Clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus Candida, but increased ALA in nonhemolytic Escherichia. Under the action of PO an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. The data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of PO on the microbiocenosis of the intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.
TI  - [Modifying action of oxytocin on the biological properties of the causative agents of anaerobic non-clostridial infection].
AB  - In a number of in vitro experiments the effect of oxytocin on the antilysozyme and anticomplemental activity of Propiobacterium propionicum, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica and Peptostreprtococcus anaerobius, isolated from patients with acute pyoinflammatory pleuropulmonary diseases, was studied. Antibiotic resistance dynamics of the infective agents under study to lincomycin, clindamycin, thienam, vancomycin was also detected. The inhibiting activity of oxytocin on the persistence properties of B. fragilis, P. melanogenica and P. anaerobius was noted. Under the influence of the preparations used changes in the sensitivity of the strains to a number of antibiotics of the lincosamide, carbapenem and glycopeptide groups were found to occur. The data thus obtained were indicative of the possible mechanisms of action of oxytocin in the treatment of acute pyoinflammatory pleuropulmonary diseases of anaerobic nonclostridial etiology.
TI  - [Outbreak of tropical phagedenic ulcers after the rainy season in Dijibouti].
AB  - The incidence of cutaneous ulcers was observed after the rainy season in Djibouti in 1997. Based on the study of epidemiologic, clinical, biological, and therapeutic features these lesion were classified as phagedenic ulcers. While direct examination showed numerous fusiform bacilli, cultures performed in one patient, led to isolation of numerous colonies of Prevotella loescheii. Though less common, two other anaerobic bacterial species were detected, i.e., Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus sp.
TI  - Rapid identification of Gram-positive anaerobic coccal species originally classified in the genus Peptostreptococcus by multiplex PCR assays using genus- and species-specific primers.
AB  - Here, a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex PCR assay for identifying 14 Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) species originally classified in the genus Peptostreptococcus (Anaerococcus hydrogenalis, Anaerococcus lactolyticus, Anaerococcus octavius, Anaerococcus prevotii, Anaerococcus tetradius, Anaerococcus vaginalis, Finegoldia magna, Micromonas micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Peptoniphilus harei, Peptoniphilus indolicus, Peptoniphilus ivorii and Peptoniphilus lacrimalis) is reported. Fourteen type strains representing 14 GPAC species were first identified to the genus level by multiplex PCR (multiplex PCR-G). Since three of these genera (Finegoldia, Micromonas and Peptostreptococcus) contain only a single species, F. magna, M. micros and P. anaerobius, respectively, these organisms were identified to the species level directly by using the multiplex PCR-G. Then six species of the genus Anaerococcus (A. hydrogenalis, A. lactolyticus, A. octavius, A. prevotii, A. vaginalis and A. tetradius) were further identified to the species level using multiplex PCR assays (multiplex PCR-Ia and multiplex PCR-Ib). Similarly, five species of the genus Peptoniphilus (Pn. asaccharolyticus, Pn. harei, Pn. indolicus, Pn. ivorii and Pn. lacrimalis) were identified to the species level using multiplex PCR-IIa and multiplex PCR-IIb. The established two-step multiplex PCR identification scheme was applied to the identification of 190 clinical isolates of GPAC species that had been identified previously to the species level by 16S rRNA sequencing and phenotypic tests. The identification obtained from multiplex PCR assays showed 100 % agreement with 16S rDNA sequencing identification, but only 65 % (123/190) agreement with the identification obtained by phenotypic tests. The multiplex PCR scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of GPAC species. It will permit a more accurate assessment of the role of various GPAC species in infection and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.
TI  - Endocarditis due to Peptostreptococcus anaerobius: case report and literature review of peptostreptococcal endocarditis.
AB  - Infective endocarditis caused by anaerobic streptococci occurs rarely, and only five cases have been described in detail, with two additional cases mentioned in a review of anaerobic infective arthritis. All have resulted from infection caused by peptostreptococci. Another case of anaerobic gram-positive endocarditis caused by Peptostreptococcus anaerobius has recently been encountered. The patient was successfully treated with a beta-lactam for six weeks, plus gentamicin (to which the organism was resistant in vitro) for two weeks. In reviewing these six cases, all but one involved a prosthetic valve, and in three instances the organism was isolated only from the infected valve. In four of six patients the aortic valve was involved, and five of the six survived with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Embolic phenomena were confirmed in only one patient, who also manifested the only non-diagnostic echocardiogram.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of L-cladinose and a C(11)-C(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. We evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. METHODS: In the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against 180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), Finegoldia magna (n = 20), Bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and Prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin A, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. In the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by B. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). RESULTS: In the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of S. agalactiae, E. faecalis, N. gonorrhoeae, P. anaerobius, F. magna, B. fragilis and P. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. Telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. In the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  - Self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. The antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond, Imperva FL Bond, One-Up BondF and Prompt L-Pop were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC25175, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus catenaforme, Lactobacillus jensenii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Clostridium ramosum, Prevotella oris, Prevotella denticola and Fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. A single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (Excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. One-Up BondF, Prompt L-Pop and Excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. The bonding agents of Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond and Imperva FL Bond were unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus jensenii and Actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
TI  - Activities of garenoxacin (BMS-284756) and other agents against anaerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - A total of 590 clinical isolates consisting of 33 species of both gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes were collected from nine centers in the Chicago area in 1998-1999. The largest number of isolates (330 isolates, 56%) belonged to the Bacteroides group. Isolates were tested by agar dilution against garenoxacin (BMS-284756, T-3811 ME), trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, clindamycin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and cefoxitin. All but one species (2% of Bacteroides vulgatus isolates) were fully susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem. A number of species were resistant to clindamycin. Among the fluoroquinolones, garenoxacin and trovafloxacin had an MIC at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited of <4 micro g/ml for all but two species (Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius).
TI  - Development of a PCR assay specific for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Peptostreptococcus anaerobius is a gram-positive anaerobic coccus that is widely  distributed in the normal human flora. The organism has also been implicated as a causative agent of several systemic infections, including endocarditis and infections of the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Its role in oral disease is less well defined, although it has been implicated in periodontal disease, gingivitis and root canal infections. Identification of P. anaerobius in clinical samples is currently reliant upon traditional culture and biochemical methods. The aim of this study was to develop a novel PCR assay for the detection of P. anaerobius and to attempt detection of this organism in oral samples. PCR primers specific for P. anaerobius DNA were developed by alignment of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences and selection of sequences specific at their 3' ends for P. anaerobius. When used in a PCR assay, positivity for P. anaerobius DNA was indicated by the amplification of a 943-bp product. The primers were shown to be specific for P. anaerobius DNA, as no PCR products were obtained when genomic DNA from a wide range of other Peptostreptococcus species and other oral bacteria were used as templates. The PCR assay was then applied to the detection of P. anaerobius DNA in subgingival plaque samples from adult periodontitis patients and pus aspirates from subjects with acute dento-alveolar abscesses. All of 60 subgingival plaque samples from 16 patients were negative for P. anaerobius DNA. None of the 43 pus samples analysed contained P. anaerobius DNA. These results suggest that P. anaerobius is not a major pathogen in adult periodontitis and dento-alveolar abscesses. The PCR assay is a more rapid, sensitive and specific alternative to culture-based methods for identification of P. anaerobius in clinical samples.
TI  - Heterogeneity within the gram-positive anaerobic cocci demonstrated by analysis of 16S-23S intergenic ribosomal RNA polymorphisms.
AB  - Peptostreptococci are gram-positive, strictly anaerobic bacteria which, although  regarded as members of the commensal human microflora, are also frequently isolated from sites of clinical infection. The study of this diverse group of opportunist pathogens has been hindered by an inadequate taxonomy and the lack of a valid identification scheme. Recent re-classification of the Peptostreptococcus family into five distinct genus groups has helped to clarify the situation. However, this has been on the basis of 16S rRNA sequence determinations, which are both time-consuming and expensive. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of PCR-amplified ribosomal DNA spacer polymorphisms for the rapid differentiation of the currently recognised taxa within the group of anaerobic gram-positive cocci. A collection comprising 19 reference strains with representatives of each of the 15 species, two close relatives and two of the well-characterised groups, together with 38 test strains was studied. All strains were identified to species group level by phenotypic means. Amplification of the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region (ISR) with universal primers produced distinct banding patterns for all the 19 reference strains and the patterns could be differentiated easily visually. However, of the 38 test strains, less than half could be speciated from ISR analysis alone. Only five groups produced correlating banding patterns for all members tested (Peptoniphilus lacrimalis, P. ivorii, Anaerococcus octavius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Micromonas micros). For other species, either the type strain differed significantly from other species members (e.g., A. hydrogenalis) or there appeared to be considerable intra-species variation (e.g., A. vaginalis). Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences for the 'trisimilis' and 'betaGAL' groups showed that both are most closely related to the Anaerococcus group. This work highlights the heterogeneous nature of a number of Peptostreptococcus species and hence the need for still further revision of the taxonomy of this important group of pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the NCCLS-approved reference method. Drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. Of the 176 strains of Bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem MICs of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem MICs of >32 micro g/ml. Faropenem had an MIC of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of B. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (MIC of 1 micro g/ml). Both faropenem and imipenem had MICs of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of Bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), Bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), Bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), Bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), Porphyromonas species (42 isolates), Prevotella species (78 isolates), Campylobacter species (25 isolates), Sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), Fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other Fusobacterium species (9 isolates). Faropenem and imipenem had MICs of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of Clostridium difficile; the MICs for all other strains of Clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. Faropenem had MICs of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (MICs of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). MICs were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). Other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. No metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than S. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. Some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - Physical and genetic map of the Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus) ATCC 29328 genome.
AB  - A physical and genetic map of Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus) ATCC 29328 chromosome was constructed. The order of rare cleavage restriction fragments was determined by double digestion with the restriction enzymes I-CeuI, SgrAI, ApaI and PmeI, cross-hybridization and ApaI-linking clones. The size of the circular chromosome of F. magna was estimated to be 1.9 Mb. This strain also had a 200-kb megaplasmid. The chromosome contained four rrn operons, and the orientation of two rrn operons was opposite to the others. Fragment analysis of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC 27337(T) chromosome suggested that its size was much smaller than that of F. magna ATCC 29328.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - Proposal of the genera Anaerococcus gen. nov., Peptoniphilus gen. nov. and Gallicola gen. nov. for members of the genus Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - Members of genus Peptostreptococcus have previously been found to be distantly related to the type species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, on the basis of 16S rDNA sequence similarities. They were divided into three major phylogenetic groups, and their peptidoglycan structure and biochemical traits differed between groups. The reclassification of the species of these three groups into three new genera, Peptoniphilus gen. nov., Anaerococcus gen. nov. and Gallicola gen. nov., is proposed. The genus Peptoniphilus gen. nov. includes the following butyrate-producing, non-saccharolytic species that use peptone and amino acids as major energy sources: Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus comb. nov. (type species), Peptoniphilus lacrimaris comb. nov., Peptoniphilus harei comb. nov., Peptoniphilus indolicus comb. nov. and Peptoniphilus ivorii comb. nov. The genus Anaerococcus gen. nov. contains the saccharolytic, butyrate-producing species Anaerococcus prevotii comb. nov. (type species), Anaerococcus tetradius comb. nov., Anaerococcus lactolyticus comb. nov., Anaerococcus hydrogenalis comb. nov., Anaerococcus vaginalis comb. nov. and Anaerococcus octavius sp. nov. The genus Gallicola gen. nov. contains a single species, Gallicola barnesae comb. nov.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from 3 patients with infection at a pierced body site.
AB  - We describe 3 adolescents who developed infections due to anaerobes at pierced body sites: the nipple, the umbilicus, and the nasal septum. Anaerobes (Prevotella intermedia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius) were recovered from pure culture of specimens obtained from 1 patient with nipple infection and were mixed with aerobic bacteria in cultures of specimens obtained from 2 patients (Streptococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Prevotella melaninogenica were recovered from a patient with nasal septum infection, and Bacteroides fragilis and Enterococcus faecalis were recovered from a patient with umbilical infection). The infection resolved in all patients after removal of the ornaments and use of antimicrobial drug treatment.
TI  - Apparent culture-negative prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by Peptostreptococcus magnus.
AB  - In two patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis due to Peptostreptococcus magnus, blood cultures in the BacT/Alert and BACTEC 9240 systems were signal negative. The capability of the BacT/Alert system to detect various Peptostreptococcus species was assessed. P. magnus and P. anaerobius could not be detected, and subcultures remained negative. The growth in conventional media of these two species and other Peptostreptococcus species was similar.
TI  - Features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chediak-Higashi syndrome (C-HS) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. The complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. METHODS: A 14-year-old male C-HS patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. Clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of C-HS. RESULTS: Laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. Peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. Bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. These granules and inclusions were characteristic of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. Bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque samples, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sp. Biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. Ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. Viable dividing bacteria were found in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of C-HS granulocyte deficiency. Periodontal treatment of these patients is often unsuccessful. This case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Induction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression by anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common disorder characterized by increased levels of anaerobic bacteria in the genital tract. BV has been associated with an increased rate of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The effects of BV-associated anaerobic bacteria on HIV expression in monocytoid cells and T cells were examined. Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and Prevotella bivia stimulated HIV expression in monocytoid cells, whereas Bacteroides ureolyticus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Lactobacillus acidophilus did not enhance HIV expression. P. asaccharolyticus also enhanced HIV expression in T cells and activated HIV long-terminal-repeat transcription in U38 cells. This report suggests a mechanism by which disturbances in vaginal flora could lead to a higher rate of sexual transmission of HIV. Furthermore, this study supports the idea that treatment of BV might serve as a preventive measure to reduce the risk of HIV transmission.
TI  - Postantibiotic effects and bactericidal activities of clarithromycin-14-hydroxy-clarithromycin, versus those of amoxicillin-clavulanate, against anaerobes.
AB  - The bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects (PAE) of clarithromycin-14-hydroxy-clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate against Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were determined. A concentration of twice the MIC resulted in bactericidal activity against four of four and three of four organisms at 24 h with clarithromycin-14-hydroxy-clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, respectively. The PAE of clarithromycin-14-hydroxy-clarithromycin was 1.44 to 3.20 h, compared to the less than 1 h of amoxicillin-clavulanate. Clarithromycin-14-hydroxy-clarithromycin possesses good activity against susceptible anaerobes.
TI  - Acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.
AB  - Perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. During these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (pH approximately 4). This study was designed to test whether the characteristics of acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. Eight vaginal Lactobacillus isolates from four species-L. gasseri, L. vaginalis, L. crispatus, and L. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic pH (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the Lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (pH 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (B. Andersch, L. Forssman, K. Lincoln, and P. Torstensson, Gynecol. Obstet. Investig. 21:19-25, 1986; L. Cohen, Br. J. Vener. Dis. 45:241-246, 1969; J. Paavonen, Scand. J. Infect. Dis. Suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; C. Tevi-Benissan, L. Belec, M. Levy, V. Schneider-Fauveau, A. Si Mohamed, M.-C. Hallouin, M. Matta, and G. Gresenguet, Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). During exponential growth, all of these Lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. Such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (W. H. Masters and V. E. Johnson, Human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). During bacterial vaginosis (BV), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal pH rises to >4.5. This correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. Three BV-associated bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic pH (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal pH associated with BV. Together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - Coaggregation of Candida dubliniensis with Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The binding of microorganisms to each other and oral surfaces contributes to the  progression of microbial infections in the oral cavity. Candida dubliniensis, a newly characterized species, has been identified in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients and other immunocompromised individuals. C. dubliniensis phenotypically resembles Candida albicans in many respects yet can be identified and differentiated as a unique Candida species by phenotypic and genetic profiles. The purpose of this study was to determine oral coaggregation (CoAg) partners of C. dubliniensis and to compare these findings with CoAg of C. albicans under the same environmental conditions. Fifteen isolates of C. dubliniensis and 40 isolates of C. albicans were tested for their ability to coaggregate with strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia. When C. dubliniensis and C. albicans strains were grown at 37 degrees C on Sabouraud dextrose agar, only C. dubliniensis strains coaggregated with F. nucleatum ATCC 49256 and no C. albicans strains showed CoAg. However, when the C. dubliniensis and C. albicans strains were grown at 25 or 45 degrees C, both C. dubliniensis and C. albicans strains demonstrated CoAg with F. nucleatum. Heating the C. albicans strains (grown at 37 degrees C) at 85 degrees C for 30 min or treating them with dithiothreitol allowed the C. albicans strains grown at 37 degrees C to coaggregate with F. nucleatum. CoAg at all growth temperatures was inhibited by mannose and alpha-methyl mannoside but not by EDTA or arginine. The CoAg reaction between F. nucleatum and the Candida species involved a heat-labile component on F. nucleatum and a mannan-containing heat-stable receptor on the Candida species. The CoAg reactions between F. nucleatum and the Candida species may be important in the colonization of the yeast in the oral cavity, and the CoAg of C. dubliniensis by F. nucleatum when grown at 37 degrees C provides a rapid, specific, and inexpensive means to differentiate C. dubliniensis from C. albicans isolates in the clinical laboratory.
TI  - Comparative activity of eighteen antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria  isolated in South Africa.
AB  - The in vitro activity of 18 antimicrobial agents was determined against 378 anaerobic bacteria isolated in Bloemfontein, South Africa, during 1996/97. Against the gram-positive isolates, MICs of penicillin and cefoxitin were >0.5 microg/ml and >16 microg/ml, respectively, for five and three strains of non-perfringens Clostridium spp. Seventeen Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains were resistant to penicillin (MIC > or = 2 microg/ml). All gram-positive anaerobes tested except one Peptostreptococcus sp. and one Clostridium sp. were susceptible to dalfopristin-quinupristin (MICs < or = 1 microg/ml). The carbapenems exhibited excellent activity against the gram-positive isolates and were effective against most gram-negative anaerobes, with the exception of the fusobacteria. Only seven strains exhibited decreased susceptibility to trovafloxacin (MICs > 2 microg/ml). In mixed anaerobic/aerobic infections, carbapenems and the fourth-generation quinolone trovafloxacin were the agents most suitable for us as broad-spectrum monotherapy.
TI  - Comparative anti-anaerobic activity of Men 10700, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Men 10700, a new penem, has been compared with that of metronidazole, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav, imipenem and three third generation cephalosporins against 120 strains of anaerobes. The organisms tested comprised Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Bacteroides fragilis and speciated members of the genera Fusobacterium, Veillonella and Peptostreptococcus. Men 10700 showed activity similar to that of imipenem, and was more potent than metronidazole against all species except C. difficile and P. anaerobius. The spectrum of activity of Men 10700 suggests this agent may be useful for treating infections caused by anaerobes.
TI  - A commensal symbiosis between Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius  involves amino acids: potential significance to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - In both batch and continuous culture, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was able to grow in vaginal defined medium with Prevotella bivia, but not in pure culture. Growth of P. anaerobius was increased by 238% (P < 0.001) in peptone-supplemented vaginal defined medium conditioned by prior growth of P. bivia. Analysis of P. bivia culture supernatants showed a net accumulation of amino acids and subsequent growth of P. anaerobius in the conditioned supernatants resulted generally in amino acid utilization. Supplementation of peptone-supplemented vaginal defined medium with amino acids in concentrations similar to those available after prior growth with P. bivia were growth-stimulatory (246%, P=0.006) for P. anaerobius. Increased availability of amino acids by P. bivia is proposed as a mechanism to support the observed in vitro commensal symbiosis between P. bivia and P. anaerobius.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from a post-traumatic nasal septal abscess. A report of two cases.
AB  - This report presents 2 children (boys, 11 and 9 years old) who had post-traumatic nasal septal abscesses. Cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria revealed Peptostreptococcuus magnus and a beta-lactamase-producing Prevotella intermedia in the first patient, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus intermedius, and Prevotella melaninogenica in the second patient. Anaerobic bacteria may play a role in nasal septal abscesses.
TI  - In-vitro antibiotic susceptibility and molecular analysis of anaerobic bacteria isolated in Cape Town, South Africa.
AB  - One hundred and twenty-three anaerobic isolates from Cape Town, South Africa, were tested in vitro against cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, co-amoxiclav, benzylpenicillin and clindamycin. Forty-five Gram-positive organisms were tested against RP59500 (a streptogramin). Resistance in the Gram-positive isolates was as follows: of the Clostridium perfringens isolates, 4% were resistant to benzylpenicillin and 4% to clindamycin; of the Peptostreptococcus anaerobius isolates, 10% were resistant to benzylpenicillin, 10% to cefoxitin and 10% to metronidazole; of the isolates of Peptostreptococcus spp., 12% were resistant to benzylpenicillin, 6% to metronidazole, 6% to chloramphenicol and 12% to RP59500. Of the Gram-negative organisms, those in the Bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to benzylpenicillin (83%), cefoxitin (5%), clindamycin (5%) and co-amoxiclav (2%). One clindamycin-resistant B. fragilis isolate carried a plasmid homologous to the ermF erythromycin resistance determinant.
TI  - Experimental root canal infections in conventional and germ-free mice.
AB  - A small animal model was evaluated to study the interrelationships between microorganisms after their implantation in root canals (inferior central incisors) using germ-free (GF) and conventional (CV) mice. The selected microorganisms were: Porphyromonas endodontalis (ATCC 35406), Eubacterium lentum (ATCC 25559), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (ATCC 27337), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 10953), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 4083). Only P. anaerobius, E. coli, and E. faecalis, respectively, were able to colonize when inoculated alone into the root canal of both CV and GF mice. E. lentum, when inoculated alone colonized only in CV animals. P. endodontalis and F. nucleatum were unable to colonize in CV and GF animals after single inoculation. It is concluded that the experimental animal model presented herein is valuable for ecological studies of root canal infections and that only some strict anaerobic bacteria are able to colonize mice root canals when inoculated by themselves alone in pure culture.
TI  - Endodontic pathogens stimulate monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin-8 in mononuclear cells.
AB  - Microbial infection of the dental pulp leads to the recruitment of leukocytes and the formation of lesions of endodontic origin. The chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) are relatively specific chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. In the present studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated by Streptococcus mutants, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which are associated with lesions of endodontic origin. Each of these bacteria induced a dose-dependent increase in IL-8 and MCP-1, determined by ELISA. The levels induced are physiologically relevant. However, low doses of P. endodontalis were less effective in inducing IL-8 or MCP-1 expression, compared with S. mutants or P. anaerobius. Thus, these bacteria can induce significant levels of the chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1, which could contribute to the recruitment of neutrophils or monocytes in vivo. The expression of these mediators may contribute to the development of endodontic infections, particularly with regard to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment.
TI  - Development of an anaerobic bacterial leakage model.
AB  - The majority of bacteria associated with infections of endodontic origin are strict anaerobes. The purpose of this study was to develop an endodontic microleakage model using strict anaerobic bacteria in a two-chamber system. Nine species of anaerobic bacteria were tested for viability and detection by either turbidity or color change of the broth. A survey of pH chromogenic substrates revealed that bromcresol purple (pH 5.2 = yellow, pH 6.8 = purple) could be used as a chromogenic indicator to detect the growth of anaerobic bacteria. Peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth (PYG) and brain heart infusion broth (BHI) were each used alone and with bromcresol purple (bpPYG, bpBHI) in this study. Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. necrophorum were viable in all four media for > 2 wk and produced both turbidity and a color change after only 1 day of incubation. Veillonella parvula in either bpBHI or BHI and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in either bpPYG or BHI were viable for > 2 wk and showed a color change or turbidity after 1 or 2 days. The results indicate that leakage of strict anaerobes may be evaluated in a two-chamber system.
TI  - Aminopeptidase activities in Peptostreptococcus spp. are statistically correlated to gelatin hydrolysis.
AB  - One hundred Peptostreptococcus isolates from five species were assessed for their ability to hydrolyze gelatin. Most Peptostreptococcus magnus (95.8%) and Peptostreptococcus micros isolates (79.0%) hydrolyzed gelatin in contrast to Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (8.0%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (10.0%), and Peptostreptococcus prevotii isolates (16.7%). Gelatin hydrolysis in Peptostreptococcus magnus and Peptostreptococcus micros isolates correlated (r = 0.80; P = 0.0019) with more aminopeptidases produced than Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, or Peptostreptococcus prevotii. The five species were further classified into three groups using the extended Tukey test (P < 0.0001) based on the mean percentage of aminopeptidases produced by each species with Peptostreptococcus magnus and Peptostreptococcus micros belonging to group I, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and Peptostreptococcus prevotii belonging to group II, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius forming group III. An analysis of possible proteolytic activity of four selected Peptostreptococcus magnus isolates indicated that only 5 of 11 substrates were hydrolyzed as compared to a control isolate of Porphyromonas gingivalis W83, which had a strong proteolytic profile. Therefore, gelatin hydrolysis by Peptostreptococcus spp., in particular Peptostreptococcus magnus and Peptostreptococcus micros, is probably due to a variety of aminopeptidases rather than proteinases.
TI  - Bacterial interference in the nasopharynx following antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media.
AB  - The effect on the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of therapy for 10 days with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil was studied in 50 children with acute otitis media. Before therapy, potential pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis) were isolated in 14 (56%) of those treated with co-amoxiclav and 15 (60%) of those treated with cefprozil. Following therapy, the reduction in the number of these pathogens was the same in the two groups. However, differences between the groups were noted in the recovery of organisms with interfering capability, namely alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella melaninogenica. Fifty interfering organisms were recovered from each group before therapy. After therapy with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil their number declined to 11 and 42, respectively (P< 0.001).
TI  - Ammonia-hyperproducing bacteria from New Zealand ruminants.
AB  - Pasture-grazed dairy cows, deer, and sheep were tested for the presence of ammonia-hyperproducing (HAP) bacteria in roll tubes containing a medium in which tryptone and Casamino Acids were the sole nitrogen and energy sources. Colonies able to grow on this medium represented 5.2, 1.3, and 11.6% of the total bacterial counts of dairy cows, deer, and sheep, respectively. A total of 14 morphologically distinct colonies were purified and studied further. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms of 16S rRNA genes indicated that all isolates differed from the previously described HAP bacteria, Clostridium aminophilum, Clostridium sticklandii, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Carbon source utilization experiments showed that five isolates (C2, D1, D4, D5, and S1) were unable to use any, or very few, of the carbon sources tested. Biochemical tests and phylogenetic analyses of 16S ribosomal DNA sequences indicated that all isolates were monensin sensitive; that D1 and S1 belonged to the genus Peptostreptococcus, that D4 and D5 belonged to the family Bacteroidaceae, where D4 was similar to Fusobacterium necrophorum; and that C2 was most similar to an unidentified species from the genus Eubacterium. Growth on liquid medium containing tryptone and Casamino Acids as the sole nitrogen and energy source showed that D1, D4, and S1 grew rapidly (specific growth rates of 0.40, 0.35, and 0.29 h-1, respectively), while C2 and D5 were slow growers (0.25 and 0.10 h-1, respectively). Ammonia production rates were highest in D1 and D4, which produced 945.5 and 748.3 nmol/min per mg of protein, respectively. Tests of individual nitrogen sources indicated that D1 and D4 grew best on tryptone, S1 grew equally well on Casamino Acids or tryptone, and C2 and D5 grew poorly on all nitrogen sources. The intact proteins casein and gelatin did not support significant growth of any of the isolates. These isolates extend the diversity of known HAP rumen bacteria and indicate the presence of significant HAP bacterial populations in pasture-grazed New Zealand ruminants.
TI  - Gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  - Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) are a heterogeneous group of organisms defined by their morphological appearance and their inability to grow in the presence of oxygen; most clinical isolates are identified to species in the genus Peptostreptococcus. GPAC are part of the normal flora of all mucocutaneous surfaces and are often isolated from infections such as deep organ abscesses, obstetric and gynecological sepsis, and intraoral infections. They have been little studied for several reasons, which include an inadequate classification, difficulties with laboratory identification, and the mixed nature of the infections from which they are usually isolated. Nucleic acid studies indicate that the classification is in need of radical revision at the genus level. Several species of Peptostreptococcus have recently been described, but others still await formal recognition. Identification has been based on carbohydrate fermentation tests, but most GPAC are asaccharolytic and use the products of protein degradation for their metabolism; the introduction of commercially available preformed enzyme kits affords a physiologically more appropriate method of identification, which is simple and relatively rapid and can be used in routine diagnostic laboratories. Recent reports have documented the isolation in pure culture of several species, notably Peptostreptococcus magnus, from serious infections. Studies of P. magnus have elucidated several virulence factors which correlate with the site of infection, and reveal some similarities to Staphylococcus aureus. P. micros is a strongly proteolytic species; it is increasingly recognized as an important pathogen in intraoral infections, particularly periodontitis, and mixed anaerobic deep-organ abscesses. Comparison of antibiotic susceptibility patterns reveals major differences between species. Penicillins are the antibiotics of choice, although some strains of P. anaerobius show broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance.
TI  - Bilophila wadsworthiain brain abscess: case report.
AB  - A case of a patient with a 20-year history of chronic otitis media complicated by cholesteatoma and brain abscess is described. A CT scan with contrast material showed three abscess cavities in the right cerebellar hemisphere. A culture from a specimen of the cholesteatoma yielded a significant amount of growth of Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella oris and a moderate growth of alpha-streptococci and Staphylococcus simulans. From the pus of the brain abscess we also isolated numerous Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella oris and some Prevotella buccae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. No aerobes were present. The patient underwent a craniotomy and the biggest abscess was removed together with the capsule. The antimicrobial therapy included penicillin plus metronidazole and later augmentin. The result of the treatment was a complete cure and total recovery of the patient. This is the first documentation of isolation of B. wadsworthia in chronic otitis media and in brain abscess.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of metronidazole on anaerobic metabolism of phenylalanine and  leucine by Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - The metabolism of phenylalanine and leucine by Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and  the effects of metronidazole on this metabolism were studied. The cells metabolized both phenylalanine and leucine under strict anaerobic conditions and produced hydroxylated products (i.e. phenyllactate from phenylalanine and hydroxyisocaproate from leucine). Other products were phenylpropionate, cinnamate and phenylacetate from phenylalanine; isocaproate, alpha-ketoisocaproate and isovalerate from leucine. Metronidazole inhibited the production of all end-products, with the exception of phenyllactate and hydroxyisocaproate which were increased. Similarly, when the reaction was carried out aerobically, the cells also metabolized both phenylalanine and leucine and all end-products were inhibited again with the exception of phenyllactate and hydroxyisocaproate. Our results suggest that the inhibitory mode of metronidazole is similar to that of oxygen.
TI  - Emerging resistance of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents in South Korea.
AB  - In previous studies, Bacteroides fragilis group organisms isolated from Korean patients were more frequently resistant to various antimicrobial agents, including clindamycin, than were isolates in other countries. A recent report of increased resistance of Peptostreptococcus species prompted us to include such isolates in a study of antimicrobial susceptibility. anaerobes isolated in 1994 at a tertiary care hospital in Seoul were tested by agar dilution method. None of the B. fragilis group organisms were resistant to imipenem, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, or metronidazole. However, 6.7% were resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam, 20.2% to cefotetan, 30.3% to piperacillin, 48.3% to cefotaxime, and 42.7% to clindamycin. Almost all of the Clostridium perfringens isolates were susceptible to all of the agents tested, except tetracycline. Peptostreptococcus isolates were susceptible to piperacillin, cefotaxime, and imipenem, while 7.4% were resistant to penicillin G, cefotetan, and metronidazole, and 25.9% were resistant to clindamycin. The isolates resistant to penicillin G, cefotetan, and metronidazole were identified as Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. In conclusion, besides the well-known high rate of resistance of B. fragilis group organisms to clindamycin, the emergence of resistance of Peptostreptococcus species isolates to beta-lactam drugs has become obvious in Korea.
TI  - [Role of 67 Gallium citrate and 99mTc-HMPAO-labelled neutrophils in the integrated diagnostic imaging in a case of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius hepatic abscess].
AB  
TI  - Bacteriologic findings in tonsillitis and pericoronitis.
AB  - Bacteriologic samples from 31 young men were cultured quantitatively for aerobes  and anaerobes; these samples included 31 specimens of tonsils (16 infected and 15 healthy), 16 specimens from pericoronal pockets of lower third molars (11 infected and 5 symptom-free), and 6 postoperative specimens from lower-third-molar extraction sockets. Anaerobes were isolated more often from infected third molars than from infected tonsils (14.5 isolates vs. 8.4 isolates, respectively; P < .001). Infected tonsil samples contained significantly more anaerobic species if an adjacent partly erupted lower third molar was present rather than absent (10.3 isolates vs. 6.9 isolates, respectively; P < .05). Eubacterium aerofaciens, Clostridium species, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Prevotella oris were frequently isolated. Streptococcus salivarius was found more frequently in tonsillar specimens, whereas Corynebacterium species, Prevotella denticola, Capnocytophaga species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Lactobacillus species were more common in pericoronal pocket samples. Thus, partial eruption of lower third molars increases the number of anaerobic bacterial species on tonsils and many species can be isolated simultaneously from both tonsils and lower third molars.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of anaerobic bacteria isolated during one year (1993)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobian susceptibility of the anaerobe bacteria isolated from clinical samples in the authors' department in 1993. METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 10 antimicrobians were determined in microgram/ml for 129 anaerobe bacterias by the microdilution in broth method recommended by the NCCLS. RESULTS: All The strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol. Metronidazole inhibited all the isolates except A. meyeri and 50% of other non spored gram-positive bacilli. Imipenen and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active beta lactamics, with only 1 B. fragilis being resistant to both. Clavulanic amoxycillin presented good activity with only 5% from the B. fragilis group, 1 F. mortiferum and 2 P. anaerobius being resistant. In the B. fragilis group 10% were resistant to cefoxitin and 15% to piperacillin. The remaining isolates were sensitive to both antimicrobians. Resistance to clindamycin in the B. fragilis group was 16.7%. There were also strains resistant to Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella and aerotolerant non spored gram-positive bacilli. Penicillin and amoxycillin were the least active antimicrobians. CONCLUSIONS: Chloramphenicol, metronidazole, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and clavulanic amoxycillin were very effective and showed a wide spectrum of activity versus the strains studied. Cefoxitin, piperacillin and clindamycin maintain good antianaerobe activity.
TI  - An rRNA approach for assessing the role of obligate amino acid-fermenting bacteria in ruminal amino acid deamination.
AB  - Ruminal amino acid degradation is a nutritionally wasteful process that produces  excess ruminal ammonia. Monensin inhibited the growth of monensin-sensitive, obligate amino acid-fermenting bacteria and decreased the ruminal ammonia concentrations of cattle. 16S rRNA probes indicated that monensin inhibited the growth of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Clostridium sticklandii in the rumen. Clostridium aminophilum was monensin sensitive in vitro, but C. aminophilum persisted in the rumen after monensin was added to the diet. An in vitro culture system was developed to assess the competition of C. aminophilum, P. anaerobius, and C. sticklandii with predominant ruminal bacteria (PRB). PRB were isolated from a 10(8) dilution of ruminal fluid and maintained as a mixed population with a mixture of carbohydrates. PRB did not hybridize with the probes to C. aminophilum, P. anaerobius, or C. sticklandii. PRB deaminated Trypticase in continuous culture, but the addition of C. aminophilum, P. anaerobius, and C. sticklandii caused a more-than-twofold increase in the steady-state concentration of ammonia. C. aminophilum, P. anaerobius, and C. sticklandii accounted for less than 5% of the total 16S rRNA and microbial protein. Monensin eliminated P. anaerobius and C. sticklandii from continuous cultures, but it could not inhibit C. aminophilum. The monensin resistance of C. aminophilum was a growth rate-dependent, inoculum size-independent phenomenon that could not be maintained in batch culture. On the basis of these results, we concluded that the feed additive monensin cannot entirely counteract the wasteful amino acid deamination of obligate amino acid-fermenting ruminal bacteria.
TI  - The in vitro activity of trospectomycin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The authors evaluated the activity of trospectomycin, a new aminocyclitol which is characterized by good antibacterial and broad spectrum activity, in comparison with clindamycin and ampicillin on a sample of recent isolates: Bacteroides fragilis (15 strains), Bacteroides urealyticus (5 strains), Bacteroides vulgatus (5 strains), Bacteroides spp. (15 strains), Prevotella melaninogenica (6 strains), Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (7 strains), Mobiluncus spp. (3 strains), Peptococcus niger (3 strains), Peptococcus variabilis (9 strains), Peptococcus spp (30 strains), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (5 strains), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (3 strains), Peptostreptococcus spp. (25 strains) and Propionibacterium spp. (7 strains). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined for all strains by microtiter serial dilutions in Wilkins-Chalgren broth in an anaerobic chamber in an atmosphere of 10% H2, 10% CO2, 80% N2. All the drugs tested exert their activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic isolates. In particular, trospectomycin is quite active against Gram-positive cocci (MIC 90 = 4 - 8 mg/l), Gram-negative rods (MIC 90 = 8 - 16 mg/l), Gram-positive rods (MIC 90 = 4 mg/l) and Mobiluncus spp. (MIC 90 = 0.5 mg/l).
TI  - Non-sporing anaerobes in certain surgical group of patients.
AB  - The magnitude of non-sparing anaerobic (NSA) infections has been defined in the postoperative wounds on colorectum in children (57.1%), general surgery (0%), abdominoperineal and uterocervical operations (11-45%) in gynaecologic and obstetrical cases and perforative peritonitis (25.8-32.3%). Children below the 6 months age group bear less risk of acquiring NSA infection. Under certain situations, metronidazole combats NSA infections in a better way than other antibacterials. The bacteriology of NSA infections has been probed at the species level in the gynaecologic and obstetrical patients. The species of normal cervix (44.6%) are represented in wounds involving abdominal wall (11%), perineum (22.8%) and uterocervix (45.6%) to suggest endogenous infection. Out of the 22 species of NSA isolated, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Acidaminococcus fermentans and Peptococcus prevotii are the commonest. Others were Peptococcus niger, Gaffkya anaerobia, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Actinomyces bovis, Bacteroides oralis, Fusobacterium gonidiaformans and the different species of peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium and fusobacterium. The weight of evidence indicated a pathogenic role of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Ruminococcus flavefaciens, in view of their heavy growth. The umbrella of antibacterials reduced Gram-positive anaerobic cocci from 40% to 16%. The facultative anaerobes Staph aureus, Staph epidermidis, Kl pneumoniae and proteus appeared as the exogenous agents of nosocomial infections.
TI  - A numerical taxonomic study of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  - Clinical (101) and collection (26) strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci were  examined in conventional tests and pyrolysis mass spectrometry (PMS). Numerical classifications based upon conventional test reaction patterns (CTRPs) and PMS showed 27 and 22 clusters, respectively. Cross-tabulation of cluster membership in the two classifications showed excellent correlation, with the combined classifications showing clear groups corresponding to the currently recognised species Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, P. heliotrinreducens, P. hydrogenalis, P. indolicus, P. lactolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros and Peptococcus niger. Strains of P. prevotii and P. tetradius clustered together in a heterogeneous group of saccharolytic organisms. However, strains previously identified as P. asaccharolyticus were divided into three distinct groups in PMS, two of which differed only in indole-associated pyrolysis products. A further four groups and several single-member clusters were distinct from these species. PMS data supported the validity of identification by pre-formed enzyme profiles and confirmed that Hare group III is synonymous with P. hydrogenalis, Hare group IV with P. magnus, and the "ADH group" with P. vaginalis. There is clearly a need for a taxonomic revision of the genus Peptostreptococcus, which probably encompasses several generic groups.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Budgerigar breeders' hypersensitivity pneumonitis presenting as chronic bronchitis with purulent sputum.
AB  - A 49-year-old woman complained of cough and a purulent sputum (about 40 ml/day).  She kept budgerigars for a period of 30 years, she first noticed a productive cough 10 years previously. Her chest roentgenogram revealed a diffuse reticulonodular pattern. She was diagnosed as having a chronic type of budgerigar breeder's lung associated with chronic bronchitis. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was cultured from her sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as from droppings of her budgerigar. This is the second case of hypersensitivity pneumonitis presenting as chronic bronchitis with much sputum in Japan.
TI  - Crystalline surface protein of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - The surface ultrastructure of three anaerobic Gram-positive cocci frequently encountered in oral infections, Peptostreptococcus micros, P. magnus and P. anaerobius, was studied. The type strains of P. micros (DSM 20468) and P. anaerobius (ATCC 27337), several clinical isolates of both species and the type strain of P. magnus (DSM 20470) were included. Thin-sectioned cells studied by electron microscopy revealed a homogeneous layer outside the peptidoglycan layer in P. anaerobius. In P. micros and P. magnus a more amorphous layer was present. No periodic structures were seen in negatively stained whole cells of these three species. However, in freeze-etched cells of P. anaerobius a crystalline surface protein layer (S-layer) was detected. No periodicity was seen in any of the P. micros strains or the P. magnus type strain by the methods used, but a periodic pattern was observed in negatively stained specimens of cell wall fragments of sonicated P. anaerobius cells. No capsular material was visible outside the S-layer in P. anaerobius. The cells of the Peptostreptococcus spp. were extracted for 30 min with detergents and urea. One per cent SDS and M urea both extracted a major 78 kDa protein from all strains of P anaerobius. Extraction of P. micros and P. magnus cells did not reveal any major protein bands comparable to that of P. anaerobius. Surface biotinylation of cells followed by Western blotting and detection by alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated extravidin showed strong staining of the 78 kDa band in P. anaerobius, further indicating that this molecule is located on the surface of the cell and is the S-protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Prosthetic-valve endocarditis caused by Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  
TI  - Sinusitis and bronchial asthma in children.
AB  - Sinus disease has been assumed to exist in children with respiratory tract allergies. We consecutively evaluated 375 patients (245 male, 130 female) with childhood onset asthma, between 5 and 15 years of age (mean 7.8 years of age). Abnormal Waters radiographs were found in 205 patients (54.7%) which included mucosal wall thickening greater than 6 mm (67.3%), complete opacification (22.9%) and air-fluid levels (9.8%). The level of immunoglobulin (Ig) E was found to be much higher in non-sinusitis asthmatic children than in asthmatic children with sinusitis (1207 IU/mL vs. 644 IU/mL). The IgG, IgA, IgM and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) values were not significantly different in the two groups. All patients were treated with antibiotics for 3 to 6 weeks. Five patients required surgical intervention after antibiotic treatment had little success. Streptococcus viridans was isolated from 4 patients following surgical aspirates and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was isolated in only one patient. In conclusion, sinusitis in children may be an aggravating factor for chronic reactive lower airway disease. Optimal treatment may decrease the need of asthmatic medication.
TI  - The gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  - A gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. Gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eubacterium nodatum and Fusobacterium nucleatum and one nonoral microorganism, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica. Of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were E. nodatum (72%) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). More juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to P. intermedia, C. ochracea, E. nodatum and P. micros. No significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. Cluster analysis revealed the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of P. micros and C. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. The data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of anaerobic gram-positive cocci by salt tolerance.
AB  - The maximum salt tolerance was 2.5% in cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptococcus prevotii, 3% in Ruminococcus albus, 4% in Acidaminococcus fermentans, Peptococcus niger and Megasphaera elsdenii and 5% in Peptococcus magnus. The biochemical tests being largely inactive and time consuming the findings of salt tolerance if combined with those of morphological data provide clue to the rapid identification of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
TI  - The clinical importance of gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, in 1987.
AB  - The clinical importance of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) isolated in 1987 at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, is assessed. Of about 800 anaerobic isolates, 209 (27%) were GPAC, of which 67 (32%) were from abscesses and 22 (11%) were in pure growth. Four species comprised 77% of the 168 isolates available for study: Peptostreptococcus magnus (55 isolates, 33%), P. micros (23, 14%), P. asaccharolyticus (24, 14%) P. asaccharolyticus (24, 14%) and P. anaerobius (27, 16%). Different species were associated with different sites, from P. magnus (usually skin-associated sites; normally cultured with aerobes, infrequently with other anaerobes), P. asaccharolyticus (distributed widely) and P. anaerobius (usually genitourinary and gastrointestinal; always below the diaphragm) to P. micros (always deep sites with other anaerobes). P. magnus was isolated from 15 abscesses and was obtained in pure culture from 11 specimens, six of them abscesses developing from infected sebaceous cysts. P. micros was usually isolated from soft tissue abscesses, never from the skin, and with a characteristic mixed flora consisting of "Streptococcus milleri" and anaerobic gram-negative rods. P. heliotrinreducens was a rare isolate from similar specimens. P. asaccharolyticus was cultured from a wide variety of sites, typically mixed with both aerobes and anaerobes, and frequently from abscesses. Most isolates of P. anaerobius came from gastrointestinal or female genitourinary specimens, never from above the diaphragm and rarely from the skin; cultures were usually heavily mixed. Isolates of P. vaginalis and the "bGAL" group made up 11% of str ains and were usally cultured from superficial sites, P. vaginalis often from post-operative wound infections with Staphylococcus aureus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Identification of five Peptostreptococcus species isolated predominantly from the female genital tract by using the rapid ID32A system.
AB  - The rapid ID32A kit (bioMerieux Vitek, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) was evaluated for its ability to identify Peptostreptococcus species compared with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography (Virginia Polytechnic Institute), the current "gold standard" method. A total of 5 Peptostreptococcus American Type Culture Collection strains and 95 clinical isolates comprising Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, and P. prevotii isolates were included for analysis. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid ID32A kit in the identification for five Peptostreptococcus species compared with the Virginia Polytechnic Institute method were 93 and 80%, respectively. All P. anaerobius (n = 20) and P. asaccharolyticus (n = 25) isolates were identified with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. For the identification of P. magnus (n = 24) and P. micros (n = 19), the rapid ID32A kit was 100% sensitive for both species; the specificity for P. magnus was 95.8% and that for P. micros was 57.9%. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid ID32A kit for identification of P. prevotii (n = 12) were poor (41.7 and 8.3%, respectively). The rapid ID32A kit is a useful method for the rapid differentiation of P. anaerobius and P. asaccharolyticus from other Peptostreptococcus spp. Conventional methods should be used to identify to the species level isolates of P. magnus, P. micros, and P. prevotii.
TI  - Electrogenic glutamine uptake by Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and generation of  a transmembrane potential.
AB  - Peptostreptococcus anaerobius converted glutamine stoichiometrically to ammonia and pyroglutamic acid, and the Eadie-Hofstee plot of glutamine transport was biphasic. High-affinity, sodium-dependent glutamine transport (affinity constant [Kt] of 1.5 microM) could be driven by the chemical gradient of sodium, and more than 20 mM sodium was required for half-maximal velocity. High-affinity glutamine transport was not stimulated or inhibited by a membrane potential (delta psi). Low-affinity glutamine transport had a rate which was directly proportional to the external glutamine concentration, required less than 100 microM sodium, and was inhibited strongly by a delta psi. Cells which were treated with N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to inhibit the F1F0 ATPase still generated a delta psi but did so only if the external glutamine concentration was greater than 15 mM. Low-affinity glutamine uptake could not be saturated by as much as 200 mM glutamine, but glutamine-1 accounts for only a small fraction of the total glutamine at physiological pH values (pH 6 to 7). On the basis of these results, it appeared that the low-affinity glutamine transport was an electrogenic mechanism which was converting a chemical gradient of glutamine-1 into a delta psi. Other mechanisms of delta psi generation (electrogenic glutamine-pyroglutamate or -ammonium exchange) could not be demonstrated.
TI  - 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of anaerobic cocci and proposal of Ruminococcus hansenii comb. nov. and Ruminococcus productus comb. nov.
AB  - The 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of representative members of the family Peptococcaceae were determined. The members of the family examined were divided into the following four phylogenetic groups: Peptococcus niger ATCC 27731T (T = type strain), the Sarcina-Peptostreptococcus anaerobius group, the ruminococcus-coprococcus group, and the peptostreptococcus group. Peptococcus niger, the type species of the family, was not related to other members of the family. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC 27337T, the type strain of the type species of the genus Peptostreptococcus, was closely related to Clostridium sordellii NCIB 10717T (level of sequence similarity, 85%). Sarcina ventriculi GIFU 7886, a spore-forming anaerobic gram-positive coccus, clustered with Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124T at a similarity value of 91%. Members of the Sarcina-Peptostreptococcus anaerobius group clustered with clostridia at similarity values ranging from 85 to 91%. The type strains of Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus magnus clustered at levels of sequence homology of 84 to 93%. This cluster was not included in the Peptococcus niger group or the Peptostreptococcus anaerobius group. Thus, these members of the genus Peptostreptococcus should be separated from the other members of the genus and also from members of the family Peptococcaceae. The sequence of Peptostreptococcus productus ATCC 27340T was different from the sequences of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptococcus niger. The sequence of Streptococcus hansenii ATCC 27752T, a strictly anaerobic strain, was different from the sequences of other streptococci; this strain clustered with Peptostreptococcus productus, coprococci, and ruminococci. Several phenotypic characteristics of Streptococcus hansenii ATCC 27752T were similar to characteristics of ruminococci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  - 680 Peptostreptococcus sp. (Ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. They included 103 Ps asaccharolyticus, 74 Ps magnus, 56 Ps prevotii, 51 Ps micros, 46 Ps anaerobius, 11 Ps morbilorum, and 10 Ps saccharolyticus. Most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), Ps were recovered in pure culture. Most Ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). Predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. These were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). The organisms most commonly isolated with Ps were Bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 B. fragilis group), Prevotella sp. (159), Fusobacterium sp. (122), Escherichia coli (114), and Staphylococcus aureus (97). Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. Surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. These data illustrate the importance of Ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.
TI  - Peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, and nonclostridial anaerobic myonecrosis: a case report.
AB  - Peritonsillar abscess is a potentially life-threatening complication of acute tonsillitis. On occasion, peritonsillar abscess can extend to neck spaces and/or to the mediastinum. We describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal abscesses and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. Culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Lactobacillus catenaforme, another Lactobacillus species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. Culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded P. intermedia and P. buccae plus P. anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Bifidobacterium dentium, viridans and group F streptococci, and Citrobacter diversus. Culture of the retropharyngeal abscess yielded Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms. The patient underwent repeated drainage and debridement procedures and was treated with various antimicrobial agents and ultimately recovered. This case highlights the polymicrobial nature of peritonsillar abscess and the serious complications that this infection may lead to.
TI  - The normal vaginal flora, H2O2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  - In this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (Lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (BV) on the basis of a vaginal smear. BV was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. H2O2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with BV, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and 61% of those with a normal flora. H2O2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. The microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with BV included Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia/disiens, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Prevotella corporis/Bacteroides levii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mobiluncus species, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus tetradius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Mycoplasma hominis (P < .05 for each). The presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by H2O2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were B. ureolyticus, F. nucleatum, and P. prevotii. Other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without BV. We conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with BV in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with BV and those inhibited by H2O2-producing lactobacilli.
TI  - An in-vitro study of the comparative viability on different swab types of simulated specimens of bacteria commonly present in oro-facial infections.
AB  - An in-vitro study was undertaken to investigate the survival on bacteriological swabs of three potentially pathogenic organisms found in oro-facial infections, by using simulated clinical specimens incubated in the presence or absence of Amies transport medium. Standard inocula of pure cultures of Streptococcus milleri, Prevotella melaninogenica and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were soaked on to swabs and plated out on to solid media at various intervals up to 3 days, enabling an estimate of their viability to be made following further incubation. Differential survival of the three test organisms was observed, with Streptococcus milleri being generally the hardiest and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius the least hardy, whilst survival was consistently enhanced by the presence of a transport medium. Recovery of Prevotella melaninogenica was improved by incubation for 5 days. We conclude that transport swabs should be used in preference to plain swabs whenever immediate laboratory culture cannot be assured, to avoid loss of anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. A fastidious facultative anaerobe, Gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. FK037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Clostridium perfringens, Mobiluncus spp., G. vaginalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. The MICs of FK037 for 50 and 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of FK037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. The activity of FK037 against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, and Bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml. Little influence of inoculum size on the activity of FK037 was observed for other isolates tested. Medium pH affected the activity of FK037 against F. varium (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and Bacteroides gracilis (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. FK037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from B. fragilis GAI 0558 and GAI 10150.
TI  - Intrapleural streptokinase in experimental empyema.
AB  - Intrapleural streptokinase has been used in multiloculated empyemas to enhance pleural space drainage, presumably by causing fibrinolysis of the interlocular septae. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of daily administration of 10,000 U intrapleural streptokinase or equal volumes of saline to enhance resolution of experimental empyema in the rabbit pleural space. Seventy-two hours after intrapleural turpentine, 10(8) colony-forming units each of Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides fragilis were injected into the sterile pleural effusion of all animals. Immediately after bacterial inoculation, and daily for 3 days, animals received 10,000 U streptokinase or saline intrapleurally. Animals that achieved a pleural fluid pH < 7.30 and either glucose < 50 mg/dl or LDH > 500 IU/L were included for data analysis. At Day 4 after bacterial inoculation, the streptokinase-treated empyemic rabbits had more pleural fluid (18.8 +/- 5.1 ml) (mean +/- SEM) than did saline-treated control animals (4.8 +/- 1.7 ml) (p = 0.015), fewer interpleural adhesions (8.2 +/- 2.7) than did saline-treated control animals (25.1 +/- 3.6) (p = 0.002), and comparable amounts of visceral and parietal pleural plaque than did saline-treated control animals (p = NS). No evidence of systemic fibrinolysis was observed at 1 h after intrapleural streptokinase administration. We conclude that intrapleural streptokinase decreases interpleural adhesion numbers but fails to reduce the amount of pleural plaque observed in experimental empyema in rabbits. The increases in pleural fluid volume observed after streptokinase administration may be due to mechanisms other than fibrinolytic activity.
TI  - The influence of race and gender on periodontal microflora.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that demographic characteristics of subject populations influence both the incidence of periodontal diseases and various aspects of host responses to periodontal bacteria. In this study we analyzed the components of the subgingival microflora from individuals with adult periodontitis, early onset periodontitis, gingivitis, and periodontal health as a function of gender and race (black and white). Clinical categories were analyzed individually so that there were no differences in the clinical characteristics of the sampled sites. No significant differences were noted in the subgingival microflora between males and females. When either the first two bacterial samples from each subject or all bacterial samples taken from each subject were included in the analysis, it was found that Porphyromonas gingivalis was more significantly associated with black subjects in the adult periodontitis group. When all samples were considered in the analysis, it was found that Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was associated with black subjects in the adult periodontitis group, while Fusobacterium nucleatum was associated with white subjects in both the adult periodontitis and early onset periodontitis groups. Thus a limited number of important bacterial components of the subgingival microflora are influenced by the race and diagnosis of the subject group.
TI  - Cytotoxicity versus antibacterial activity of some antiseptics in vitro.
AB  - Through the development of new techniques for bacterial growth and isolation, obligate anaerobes have been shown to be more prevalent than previously thought in the pathogenesis of periapical and pulpal diseases. A follow-up study was conducted to examine the germicidal effect of 0.05% NaOCl, 10 mg/ml metronidazole and supernatant of Ca (OH)2 (0.025 ml) on four anaerobic microorganisms commonly found in root canals, and to compare the toxicity of these substances on cell cultures. In vitro testing revealed that 0.05% NaOCl and Ca (OH)2 were both equally effective on these anaerobes. Also, metronidazole was found to be germicidally effective against Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides oralis and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, but ineffective against Veillonella alcalescens. Furthermore, it was found that NaOCl and Ca (OH)2 had a very destructive effect on cell cultures compared with their antimicrobial effect, whereas metronidazole was less toxic among the agents tested.
TI  - Phylogeny of the ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Clostridium sticklandii, and Clostridium aminophilum sp. nov.
AB  - In previous studies, gram-positive bacteria which grew rapidly with peptides or an amino acid as the sole energy source were isolated from bovine rumina. Three isolates, strains C, FT (T = type strain), and SR, were considered to be ecologically important since they produced up to 20-fold more ammonia than other ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria. On the basis of phenotypic criteria, the taxonomic position of these new isolates was uncertain. In this study, the 16S rRNA sequences of these isolates and related bacteria were determined to establish the phylogenetic positions of the organisms. The sequences of strains C, FT, and SR and reference strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Clostridium sticklandii, Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium aminovalericum, Acetomaculum ruminis, Clostridium leptum, Clostridium lituseburense, Clostridium acidiurici, and Clostridium barkeri were determined by using a modified Sanger dideoxy chain termination method. Strain C, a large coccus purported to belong to the genus Peptostreptococcus, was closely related to P. anaerobius, with a level of sequence similarity of 99.6%. Strain SR, a heat-resistant, short, rod-shaped organism, was closely related to C. sticklandii, with a level of sequence similarity of 99.9%. However, strain FT, a heat-resistant, pleomorphic, rod-shaped organism, was only distantly related to some clostridial species and P. anaerobius. On the basis of the sequence data, it was clear that strain FT warranted designation as a separate species. The closest known relative of strain FT was C. coccoides (level of similarity, only 90.6%). Additional strains that are phenotypically similar to strain FT were isolated in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Actinomycosis infection of the cerebellum].
AB  - The case is presented of a 37-year-old male with a cerebellar abscess due to Actinomyces israelii. The patient was admitted after dental surgery because of fever and symptoms indicative of raised, intracranial pressure. No abnormalities were detected in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid. CT scan revealed a space-occupying lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere with perifocal oedema and occlusive hydrocephalus. After emergency external ventriculostomy complete removal of the mass was achieved in a two-stage surgical procedure. Culture of the pus under anaerobic conditions resulted in a growth of Actinomyces israelii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Bifidobacterium adolescentis. A 20-day regimen of antibiotics including penicillin G 10 million U x 3/d and clindamycin 900 mg x 3/d was administered. The patient made a full recovery. Pathogenesis and therapeutic principles of CNS infections due to Actinomyces israellii are discussed.
TI  - [The role anaerobes in dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis in cattle].
AB  - Altogether 52 tissue samples and swabs from the corium of the claw of diseased cattle were investigated. Microbiological examinations revealed the presence of 11 strictly anaerobic bacterial strains that belonged to the species Peptococcus asacharolyticus, Pc. sacharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides asacharolyticus and B. melaninogenicus. The remaining isolates were classified as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus and Clostridium. In the above-mentioned strains observations of their biochemical, morphological and enzymatic properties (Tab. I) were carried out. Their resistance to antibiotics was evaluated from the qualitative viewpoint (Tab. II). Capillary isotachophoresis was used to determine the amounts of volatile fatty acids that developed during glucose fermentation (Tab. III). In the single clinical samples the above-mentioned strains occurred as association of microorganism. The anaerobic genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium were found in 52% of the samples (Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium sp. were recorded in 25% and 12% of the samples, respectively, whereas in 15% of the samples both species occurred). According to our results the etiology of dermatitis digitalis et interdigitalis is closely connected with the incidence of anaerobes. Of the latter, those belonging to the genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium are of major importance.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of root canal medicaments.
AB  - The antibacterial efficacy of four endodontic medicaments was studied in vitro. Calcium hydroxide (CALACEPT), camphorated parachlorophenol (CPCP), Cresophene, and 2% iodine-potassium iodide (IKI) were tested against four anaerobic microorganisms, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Porphyromonus gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, for 10 or 15 min. IKI was effective only against F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis, and the others were effective against all four microorganisms.
TI  - Experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C in two different transport systems.
AB  - The survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C was evaluated. The transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified Stuart transport medium (MST), and a viscose swab in modified SIFF transport medium (BTM) (Bionor). The following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides intermedius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, and Actinomyces israelii. Additionally, a mixture of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was tested together with Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum and Clostridium perfringens. Both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the BTM medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the MST in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%) of the experiments (p < 0.05). There was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different B. fragilis strains. There was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees C compared to 22 degrees C, except for Fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees C in the Bionor transport system.
TI  - Associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  - The existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. Samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. The most frequent species were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Eubacterium alactolyticum, Eubacterium lentum and Wolinella recta. An odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. Strong positive associations were found between F. nucleatum and P. micros, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Selenomonas sputigena and W. recta. There was also a positive association between P. intermedia and P. micros, P. anaerobius and the eubacteria. In general, species of streptococci, Propionibacterium propionica, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. The results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.
TI  - Experimentally induced infection by oral anaerobic microorganisms in a mouse model.
AB  - A mouse model was developed to study the abscessogenic potential of pure and mixed cultures of oral anaerobes associated with infections of endodontic origin. Maximum subcutaneous lesions were seen on their backs between 3 and 14 d after inoculation. Strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Veillonella parvula were pathogenic in pure culture. A mixed culture of F. nucleatum with either Porphyromonas gingivalis or Prevotella intermedia was significantly more pathogenic than F. nucleatum in pure culture. Histopathological examination of tissue sections from control mice injected with India ink in the medium demonstrated a pathway of particulate migration from the backs of the mice to their abdomen.
TI  - The relative lethality of intestinal bacteria for gnotobiotic rats with experimental intestinal strangulation.
AB  - In eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. The results showed that: a) in pure culture, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) Fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and/or Streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. It is concluded that Fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or known to be present in clinical specimens. This gnotobiotic animal model will be useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Periodontal bone loss in mice induced by different periodontopathic organisms.
AB  - Periodontal bone loss in mice orally inoculated with Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Pept. magnus and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was compared to that in sham-inoculated mice. Six-to-8-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated with 1 x 10(5), 1 x 10(7) or 1 x 10(9) colony-forming units (c.f.u.) of bacteria in 50 microliters of medium. Ten mice received each concentration of bacteria and 10 sham-inoculated mice acted as controls. Five mice from each of the groups were killed 6 weeks after inoculation and the remaining five mice at 12 weeks. Right hemimandibles were defleshed, stained and bone loss was measured using an image analyser. All the organisms tested were associated with bone loss. Animals that had received Pept. anaerobius and Pept. magnus had up to 18% more bone loss than those sham inoculated. In contrast, mice inoculated with A. actinomycetemcomitans had up to 38% more bone loss than the sham-inoculated animals, this amount of loss occurring at the lowest inoculation of 1 x 10(5) c.f.u. These data demonstrate a differential ability of micro-organisms to cause periodontal bone loss in mice.
TI  - Formation of nitrogen-containing metabolites from geniposide and gardenoside by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - During the course of our studies on the metabolism of iridoid glycosides by human intestinal bacteria, we found that geniposide (1) and gardenoside (4) were transformed to new nitrogen-containing compounds, genipinine (3) and gardenine (6), respectively, along with the known aglycones. Although the amounts of new metabolites were somewhat lower than those of the aglycones, they were quantitatively analyzed by means of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Of 25 strains of human intestinal bacteria, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaotus produced appreciable amounts of 3, while a bacterial mixture of human feces produced 10 times or more higher amounts of 3, as compared to the individual strains.
TI  - [Empyema due to an anaerobic Streptococcus in childhood].
AB  - Anaerobic infections are quite rare in pediatric age, being that, they affect only neonates and immunodepressed patients. We think to be somewhat interesting to describe the case of our patient, a 9 year old boy, unaffected by any predisposing factor, came under our observation because of a severe respiratory distress. He showed evident clinical and radiological signs of pleural effusion in the right lung, together with a gas coil in the upper field and a left mediastinal shifting. A thoracentesis was then performed, giving rise to 600 ml of foul smelling purulent material; this procedure promptly improved his respiratory function. A permanent drainage trough the chest wall was set and an antibiotic therapy, based on the clinical picture and the character of the exudate, begun. In effect, the typical smell of the purulent material led us to suspect an anaerobic infection, and for this reason we employed the teicoplanin iv, a rarely used in the pediatric age drug. While blood cultures were negative for any organism, exudate cultures yielded Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; the last one resulted highly sensible following antibiogram to the previously chosen drug. The x-ray pattern and the rapid disappearing of the gas coil induced us to exclude further either congenital or acquired lung diseases. We conclude that, in absence of other proved sources of entry, the air presence in the pleural space was secondary to gas formation by the anaerobic micro-organism. The clinical course was very satisfactory allowing the patient to be dismissed on the 28th hospital day, with no need of further surgical therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Normal vaginal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta).
AB  - The most common bacterial species isolated from the vaginas of 37 healthy rhesus  macaques were Streptococcus viridans, coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Mobiluncus curtisii ss. curtisii, Corynebacterium renale-like organisms, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Gardnerella-like organisms, and other Corynebacterium species. The vaginal flora of the rhesus macaque differs from that previously reported for five other primate species. A two-year retrospective review of clinical cases of vaginitis and metritis found Escherichia coli and coagulase positive Staphylococci to be the most common pathogens isolated.
TI  - Protein-kinase-C-independent activation of arachidonate release and prostaglandin E2 formation in macrophages interacting with certain bacteria.
AB  - Certain bacterial species, of which we selected Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes, were found to induce release of arachidonic acid in a dose- and time-dependent manner in mouse macrophages. The release of arachidonic acid showed a characteristic lag period of approximately 10 min and was accompanied by selective transformation into prostaglandin E2. Bacteria killed by various methods caused a similar response, indicating that bacterial surface structures rather than secreted products were involved. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by treatment of macrophages with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate hardly affected the response to bacteria at all, except for a partial inhibition in the case of P. acnes. Furthermore, the generation of prostaglandin E2 was synergistically enhanced when macrophages were exposed to both bacteria and phorbol ester. It is also unlikely that bacterial activation was mediated exclusively via a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+], since bacteria stimulated the release of arachidonic acid also when [Ca2+] was clamped at various levels and since the response to bacteria was enhanced in an additive to synergistic manner when combined with calcium ionophore. Changes in protein phosphorylation in macrophages exposed to F. nucleatum (Gram-negative) were virtually identical to those seen with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, while P. anaerobius (Gram-positive) induced enhanced labeling of a single detectable phosphoprotein. In both cases, the changes in protein phosphorylation showed a time lag of 4-8 min and occurred independently of protein kinase C, consistent with a possible role in signal transduction. These results demonstrate that certain bacteria cause activation of arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin E2 formation in mouse macrophages; that the response is independent of protein kinase C and that it is not wholly mediated via a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+].
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance in Peptostreptococcus species.
AB  - Of 15 Peptostreptococcus sp. strains isolated between 1975 and 1984, 13 hybridized with the Tet K, Tet M, or Tet O determinant. A donor Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strain carrying the three determinants could transfer Tet M to P. anaerobius and Fusobacterium nucleatum recipients but not to an Enterococcus faecalis recipient, while neither Tet K nor Tet O was transferred.
TI  - The differentiation of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive cocci by protein electrophoresis.
AB  - Conventional biochemical and antibiotic sensitivity tests were used to allocate 87 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive cocci to currently recognised species, in comparison with type and other authentic reference strains. Whole-cell protein electrophoresis was then performed with extracts of each strain. Allowing for difficulties of standardisation, it was possible to allocate most of the organisms to species-related groups on the basis of protein patterns. Organisms identified conventionally as Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and P. micros formed homogeneous groups by protein electrophoresis. There was evidence for heterogeneity amongst strains identified as P. asaccharolyticus (two groups, including P. indolicus), P. prevotii and P. magnus. However, aberrant P. prevotii strains were allocated to the P. asaccharolyticus groups, leaving a homogeneous P. prevotii group, and if P. variabilis were re-instated as a species, the remaining P. magnus strains could be divided into two groups. Of the anaerobic gram-positive cocci in the National Collection of Type Cultures deposited by Hare, Group IV is P. magnus, Group IX is P. micros and Groups I, III and VIII appear to be related to the butyrate-producing species P. asaccharolyticus and P. prevotii, but are strongly saccharolytic.
TI  - Molecular fingerprinting of isolates of the genus Peptostreptococcus using rRNA genes from Escherichia coli and P. anaerobius.
AB  - Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of rRNA genes were evaluated as a tool for intra- and interspecies differentiation of Peptostreptococcus isolates. RFLPs from a collection of 20 clinical isolates and five ATCC strains representing five Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros and P. prevotii) were obtained by hybridization of Southern blots of HindIII- or EcoRI-digested genomic DNA with three probes: probe A, a 0.98 kb HindIII fragment with a partial 16S rRNA gene sequence from P. anaerobius ATCC 27337; probe B, cloned Escherichia coli rrnB operon in plasmid pKK3535; and probe C, E. coli 16S and 23S rRNA. The hybridization patterns varied, but all yielded RFLPs useful for both intra- and inter-species differentiation. RFLPs of P. asaccharolyticus clinical isolates were closely related to each other and differed significantly from those of the ATCC type strains. The profiles of P. prevotii differed from those of the other four species studied, and based on the HindIII- and EcoRI-generated RFLPs, the strains in this species are more heterogeneous than the other four species studied.
TI  - Reactivity of IgG from explant cultures of periapical lesions with implicated microorganisms.
AB  - The presence of IgG in periapical inflammatory lesions suggests that immune responses participate in the disease process. The purpose of this investigation was to study the reactivity of IgG from the supernatant fluids of explant cultures of periapical lesions with microorganisms implicated in infections of endodontic origin. Ninety periapical lesions that had been contiguous with the apex of a root were removed and maintained in explant cultures. A dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA) was used to demonstrate the presence of IgG in the supernatant fluids of the explant cultures reactive with a panel of microorganisms associated with infections of endodontic origin. The percentages of reactivity by dot-ELISA follow: Bacteroides intermedius (84%), B. buccae (12%), Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis (50%), P. endodontalis (58%), P. asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus micros (44%), P. anaerobius (26%), Eubacterium alactolyticum (34%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (14%), and Actinomyces israelii (6%). At least one of the three species of B. intermedius, P. gingivalis, or P. endodontalis tested gave a positive dot-ELISA with 89% of the supernatant fluids from explant cultures of periapical lesions. A lack of cross reactivity of IgG in supernatant fluids from explants of periapical lesions was demonstrated for the four strains of black-pigmented Bacteroides/Porphyromonas by dot-ELISA.
TI  - The laboratory identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  - A collection of 256 clinical strains and 40 reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) was studied, to characterise the recognised species more fully and to define groups of strains which might correspond to previously undescribed species. The methods used were: gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) for the detection of volatile fatty acids (VFAs); determination of the pre-formed enzyme profile with a commercially available kit, ATB 32A; microscopic appearance; colonial morphology; and antibiotic sensitivity tests. Strains were placed in one of five VFA groups according to their GLC profile; 96% of strains were further assigned to 12 groups by their enzyme profile. There was less than 99% agreement between the two methods. Of 111 clinical strains in the VFA-negative group, 110 gave one of three distinct enzyme profiles corresponding to Peptostreptococcus magnus, P. micros and P. heliotrinreducens. The assignment of strains to groups based on their microscopic appearance and colonial morphology agreed well with groupings according to enzyme profile. Identification of butyrate-producing GPAC was unsatisfactory because it relied heavily on the enzyme profile; testing for indole production was of limited discriminative value. Most strains of P. asaccharolyticus and P. indolicus were very similar in enzyme profile, microscopic appearance and colonial morphology, but a sub-group of P. asaccharolyticus could be distinguished. A further indole-positive group corresponding to Hare group III was also noted. Strains of P. prevotii and P. tetradius were very similar, but easily distinguished from other butyrate-producing GPAC. However, 45% of the butyrate-producing cocci could not be assigned to recognised species; most of these were assigned to one of two new groups, the ADH group and the bGAL group, by their enzyme profile, microscopic appearance and smell. Four strains that produced a terminal VFA peak of isovaleric acid formed a new group designated 'ivoricus'. Reliable features for the identification of P. anaerobius were GLC (all GPAC that produced isocaproic acid were identified as P. anaerobius), enzyme profile and sensitivity to SPS. Two clinical strains that produced caproci acid were identified as Hare group VIII; they were distinguished from Peptococcus niger by their enzyme profile and colonial morphology. A phenotypic classification based on GLC and enzyme profile is presented, with a method for the identification of most strains of GPAC within 48 h of primary isolation.
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - Obligately anaerobic bacterial species isolated from foot-rot lesions in goats.
AB  - Lesions showing clinical signs of foot-rot from 120 goats were cultured on six selective media during October 1987 to November 1988. A total of 582 strictly anaerobic microorganisms belonging to 50 different species was isolated and identified. The anaerobes most frequently isolated belonged to the following genera: Bacteroides (80%), Peptostreptococcus (63.6%), Megasphaera (40%), Fusobacterium (29.2%), Clostridium (22.5%), Propionibacterium (12.5%), Eubacterium (11.7%) and Leptotrichia (10.8%). Percentages for Acidaminococcus, Peptococcus, Tissierella, Wolinella and Veillonella were below 10%. The following species were identified in 10% or more of cases: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (61.7%), Bacteroides buccae (51.7%), Bacteroides nodosus (42.5%), Megasphaera elsdenii (40%), Bacteroides ruminicola subsp. brevis (22.5%), Fusobacterium necrophorum (19.2%), Leptotrichia buccalis (11.7%) and Clostridium perfringens (10%). Lower percentages were obtained for the remaining species. The efficiency and selectivity of the six culture media used for isolation are discussed.
TI  - Polysaccharides from Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and structure of the species-specific antigen.
AB  - The cell-envelope antigens of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were extracted from intact cells by autoclave or alkaline treatment. The purified species-specific antigen (G) was identified among several polysaccharides obtained from the extracts by successive treatments with ribonuclease and pronase followed by ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. G was investigated by 13C- and 31P-n.m.r. spectroscopy, titrimetry, elemental analysis, and gas-liquid chromatography. Oxidation of G with NaIO4 followed by reduction with NaBH4 and mild acid hydrolysis yielded the Smith degradation product of G (GS). Treatment of G and GS with 48% HF gave the respective dephosphorylated products GF and GSF. The structures of GS, GF, and GSF were investigated by 13C-n.m.r. spectroscopy, methylation analysis, and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The principal constituents of G were 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose (D-GlcNAc), D-glyceric acid, and phosphate as a diester, in the ratio 2:1:1, and a minor amount of D-glucose (beta-D-Glcp). GS contained D-GlcNAc, D-glyceric acid, glycerol, and phosphate in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. GF and GSF contained D-GlcNAc and D-glyceric acid in the ratios 2:1 and 1:1, respectively. A structure for the principal repeating unit of polymeric G compatible with the analytical data consists of alpha-D-GlcpNAc-(1----3)-alpha-D-GlcpNAc-(1----2)-D-glyceric acid units linked through C-6'-C-6" phosphate diester bridges. This structure is novel for two reasons: (a) unsubstituted glyceric acid residues occur as aglycons in the repeating structure, and (b) phosphate diester bridges link nonanomeric glycose carbons in a non-nucleic acid polymer. The structural role of the minor amount of beta-D-Glcp in G remains unknown.
TI  - Isolation and identification of anaerobic bacteria from ovine foot rot in Spain.
AB  - A microbiological study was made of 125 Merino sheep showing clinical signs of foot rot. A total of 435 strictly anaerobic strains were isolated, belonging to the following genera: Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Tissierella, Fusobacterium, Megasphaera, Eubacterium, Acidaminococcus, Clostridium, Peptococcus and Propionibacterium. Of the 35 species obtained, the following were found in more than 10 per cent of animals sampled: Bacteroides nodosus, B putredinis, B buccae, B ruminicola subspecies brevis, Tissierella praeacuta, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Megasphaera elsdenii. Six culture media were used for isolation. Agar brucella and agar brucella enriched with G-N anaerobe supplement proved to be the most efficient for isolating anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (MNT) broth by various gram-positive cocci. The MNT broth consists of 0.5% Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), 0.2% L-norleucine, and 0.1% L-tyrosine. The microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. indolicus, P. magnus, and P. prevotii), Staphylococcus spp. (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saccharolyticus), and Streptococcus spp. (S. agalactiae, S. intermedius, S. mutans, S. sanguis I, and S. sanguis II). Only Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in MNT broth cultures. All 11 P. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in MNT broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. This unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of P. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.
TI  - Transferable Tet M in Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Two tetracycline-resistant Fusobacterium nucleatum strains were able to transfer, by conjugation, tetracycline resistance and the Tet M determinant to recipient F. nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Enterococcus faecalis strains at a frequency of 10(-1) to 10(-8).
TI  - Bactericidal effects of human neutrophils and sera on selected endodontic pathogenic bacteria in an anaerobic environment.
AB  - Phagocytosis by normal human neutrophils and the bactericidal activity of normal  human pooled serum were measured under anaerobic conditions on six endodontic pathogenic bacterial species from the genera Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus and Streptococcus. The results revealed that Actinomyces viscosus was not killed either by human neutrophils or by 20 per cent serum; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was not killed by either 20 per cent or 95 per cent serum; and Bacteroides intermedius was susceptible to both 20 per cent and 95 per cent serum, but was not killed by neutrophils after exposure for 20 minutes. The other species showed intermediate susceptibility patterns. Such results suggest that oral pathogens vary with regard to the bactericidal effects of these two host defense mechanisms, and that this variation may at least in part explain the relative quantities of microbes recovered in certain oral infections.
TI  - [A clinical study on ceftazidime in the treatment of intractable respiratory infections].
AB  - Ceftazidime (CAZ) was administered to 51 patients (37 males, 14 females) with respiratory infections including severe cases, accompanied by various underlying respiratory diseases. The clinical efficacy and side effects of CAZ were investigated. The mean age and body weight of these 51 cases were 62.6 years and 48.0 kg, respectively. CAZ was administered by intravenous drip infusion (daily dose of 2-4 g) for a mean of 14.7 days to a mean total dose of 56.7 g. Clinical efficacy rates were 64% (18 of 28 cases), 80% (16 of 20 cases) and 67% (2 of 3 cases) for airway and intermediary regional infections, pneumonia (including lung abscess) and pyothorax, respectively. In the bacteriological study, efficacy rates and bacterial eradication rates were 69% and 67%, 33% and 20%, 100% and 100%, and 100% and 100% for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (6 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 cases), respectively, and bacterial eradication was achieved in both of 2 cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 2 cases of Haemophilus influenzae, and 1 case each of Peptococcus sp., Fusobacterium necrophorum and Serratia marcescens. Side effects observed were eruption in 1 case (2%) and elevated GOT, GPT and Al-P values in 1 case (2%), but these cases tended to recover after CAZ treatment was discontinued.
TI  - Formation of amphetamine from its nitro analogue by anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  - 1. Microbial reduction of 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane 1 was carried out using 40 strains of intestinal anaerobic bacteria. Among them, 12 strains (Mitsuokella multiacidus, Clostridium perfringens, C. innocuum, C. clostiriiforme, C. difficile, C. butyricum, C. sp., Eubacterium limosum, E. aerofaciens, E. multiforme, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and P. productus) had the ability to reduce 1 to amphetamine 2 (0.1-1% yield). 2. Clostridium species were more active than another intestinal anaerobic bacteria. 3. When Clostridium perfringens was used in preparative fermentation, the yield of 2 was increased, and its absolute structure had an (S)-configuration with an optical purity of 68% in enantiomeric excess.
TI  - A rapid diagnosis of anaerobic infection in the oro-maxillary region by gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The relationship between volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in pus and infecting bacterial species was examined in order to establish a rapid identification system for anaerobic microorganisms in purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. VFAs were detected by the direct injection of pus into gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). Bacterial examination was carried out by anaerobic culture using blood agar plates. The bacterial identification was carried out mainly according to the VPI manual. Analysis of the direct VFA patterns of each sample resulted in 5 groups. The following bacterial species were the main isolates in each group: Streptococcus intermedius in Group A, Peptostreptococcus micros in Group B, Fusobacterium nucleatum in Group C, Bacteroides gingivalis in Group D, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in Group E. The profile of VFAs produced in the PYG culture medium of the above isolated bacteria was compared with the direct VFA patterns. Agreement ratios between direct and PYG VFA patterns were as follows: Group A, 47.1%; Groups B and C, 45.0%; Group D, 87.5%; and Group E, 62.9%. The acetic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group B, the butyric acid concentration was more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group C, and the iso-caproic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group E. In these cases, it was found that the agreement ratios between the direct and PYG FVA pattern were high. In Group D, irrespective of the concentration of iso-valeric acid detected, the agreement ratio was very high. The antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was studied. Efficiency rates of ABPC, PIPC, CCL, CEZ, CMZ, SBT/CPZ, JM, CLDM, MINO and GM were relatively low and resistant rates were high for the gram-negative rods.
TI  - The obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacterial flora of the normal feline gingival margin.
AB  - Samples from the gingival margins of 14 cats considered normal on clinical examination were cultured for facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. All mouths were free from any gingival marginal inflammation and tartar build-up; all cats were between 6 and 12 months of age. A mixed growth was obtained from all samples. The mean number of bacterial species per sample was 10.7 with a range of 7-16 isolates. Of the 150 isolates processed, 109 (72.66%) were obligate anaerobes. Of the facultatively anaerobic species, Actinomyces (including A. viscosus, A. hordeovulneris and A. denticolens) comprised 12%, Pasteurella multocida 9.33% of isolates and Propionibacterium species 6% of all isolates. Gram-negative bacilli belonging to the genera Bacteroides and Fusobacterium were isolated from 12 of the 14 samples, and comprised 77% of the obligate anaerobes isolated. Clostridium villosum comprised 10.1% of obligately anaerobic isolates, Wolinella species made up 6.42%, while 4.58% were Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. The most commonly isolated obligately anaerobic species was C. villosum and the most commonly isolated facultatively anaerobic species was P. multocida. These findings show a bacterial flora of the normal feline mouth which is very similar in composition to that of cat fight abscesses and feline pyothorax.
TI  - Comparative efficacy of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and penicillin G against anaerobic bacteria in an animal model.
AB  - Treatment efficacy of various antimicrobial regimens against anaerobes was studied in semipermeable chambers simulating a closed-space, locally neutropenic infection site in rabbits. Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were inoculated (at a mean of 5.3 log10 CFU/ml in prereduced pooled rabbit serum) into the chambers (one isolate per chamber) in triplicate. Antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole (against the gram-negative anaerobes), or penicillin G (against the gram-positive anaerobes), beginning 4 hours after organism inoculation and continuing every 6 hours for 16 doses. With the use of anaerobic techniques for specimen acquisition, transport, and culture, quantitative bacterial findings were measured at the start of therapy and at various time points thereafter. Antibiotic concentrations were measured in blood and chamber fluid by liquid chromatography or bioassay methods. At the end of the study in vivo organisms were reduced by at least 3 log10 CFU/ml from drug-free growth control chambers by all the antimicrobial regimens tested except for cefoperazone against B. fragilis and ciprofloxacin against the three isolates tested. The addition of sulbactam to cefoperazone inhibited B. fragilis beta-lactamase activity and eradicated B. fragilis in vivo. In vivo results with this model confirmed in vitro susceptibilities of all tested antimicrobials except ciprofloxacin and should provide useful indications of the potential clinical efficacy of other new agents against anaerobes.
TI  - [Anaerobic bacteria and their role in recurrent tonsillitis].
AB  - The presence of anaerobic bacteria in 100 palatal tonsils obtained during the tonsillectomy, was evaluated in quality and in quantity. 17 species of anaerobic bacteria were found. The most frequent were: Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus intermedius, Propionibacterium, Veillonella parvula and Peptococcus asaccharolyticus. In most evaluations their density was 10(5)-10(6) in gram of tonsil tissue, sometimes 10(7). Its role in recurrent tonsils infections was discussed.
TI  - Serological studies of peptostreptococci using an indirect fluorescent antibody test.
AB  - Members of the genus Peptostreptococcus are frequent isolates from periodontal lesions. A study was undertaken for determination of the serological relationships of oral and non-oral strains of several species of this genus. Eighty-nine strains of peptostreptococci representing seven species were tested by means of an indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFA), with rabbit antisera to Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC 27337, Peptostreptococcus micros VPI 2618-A, and Peptostreptococcus productus ATCC 27340. Each antiserum showed positive fluorescence when reacted with homologous cells. When anti-P. micros VPI 2618-A serum was added to suspensions of P. micros ATCC 33270 and clinical isolates of P. micros in the IFA, positive fluorescence was observed to a titer of 1:64 with 26 out of 29 strains. Positive fluorescence was also seen when P. anaerobius VPI 5737 and clinical isolates of P. anaerobius were tested with anti-P. anaerobius ATCC 27337 serum; a titer of at least 1:64 was observed in 10 out of 14 strains. These results support the presence of two serological groups of P. anaerobius, rabbit anti-P. anaerobius ATCC 27337 serum reacting with Group II organisms. No interspecies cross-reactivity was observed except with four strains of Peptostreptococcus magnus, which reacted with several antisera as well as with normal rabbit serum and the saline controls. These results indicate that rabbit antisera and the use of an IFA are useful in the identification of P. anaerobius and P. micros from oral lesions.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of a case of acute parotitis.
AB  - It is generally assumed that the microorganisms responsible for acute suppurative parotitis are facultative anaerobes, primarily Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans. A quantitative microbiologic investigation of an aspirate of pus from the case we report revealed a microbial flora (5.1 X 10(6) CFU/ml) consisting entirely of strict anaerobes (Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius). The strain of F. nucleatum was sensitive to metronidazole but resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 16 micrograms/ml). P. anaerobius was sensitive to the antibiotics tested. It is concluded that a high concentration of viable anaerobic bacteria may be present in acute suppurative parotitis and thus pus obtained from cases of sialadenitis should be cultured with microbiologic methods capable of isolating strict anaerobes. Additionally, antibiotic sensitivity should be determined routinely.
TI  - Comparison of four commercial brucella agar media for growth of anaerobic organisms.
AB  - Four different commercial brucella blood agar plating media (Anaerobe Systems, BBL Microbiology Systems, Remel, and Scott Laboratories) were compared for the abilities to recover anaerobic organisms from clinical specimens and to support the growth of American Type Culture Collection anaerobic stock cultures. Following 24 h of incubation in an anaerobe chamber, Anaerobe Systems prereduced, anaerobically sterilized brucella plates yielded 63% of the total clinical anaerobe isolates, the Scott medium yielded 51%, the Remel medium yielded 42%, and the BBL medium yielded 37%. Poor growth of Peptostreptococcus magnus, P. anaerobius, Fusobacterium necrophorum, F. nucleatum, and pigmented Bacteroides spp. was observed on brucella media obtained from BBL, Remel, and Scott. Data obtained with stock anaerobic cultures showed that Anaerobe Systems plates yielded good growth and produced a larger colony size with all of the strains tested in 1 day, whereas poor growth of Peptostreptococcus spp., B. melaninogenicus, and Fusobacterium spp. was noted on brucella media from BBL, Remel, and Scott.
TI  - [Studies on anaerobic infection in oro-maxillary region--rapid diagnosis by gas-liquid chromatography and antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - Subject material for this study was pus collected from patients with purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. Direct gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis was made, bacterial isolation and identification were carried out, and comparisons were made with results from GLC analysis and anaerobic isolates in a PYG medium. In addition, antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria were examined. Results 1. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 85 of 100 cases of obstructive abscesses. Of the 85, 49 were cases of mixed infection involving both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria; and 64 cases were involved with more than 2 species of anaerobic bacteria. Of the 184 strains of anaerobic isolates, 53 were Bacteroides sp. and 51 were Peptostreptococcus sp. The 2 groups accounted for more than half of the isolates. 2. Group A, in which no VFA was detected, accounted for 17 out of 100 cases. Group B, in which acetic acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and Group C, in which butyric acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and Group D, in which iso-valeric acid was detected, accounted for 8 cases. Direct GLC analysis revealed iso-caproic and caproic acids in the 35 cases constituting Group E. 3. Whereas the percentage of anaerobic bacteria was 64.7% in Group A and 60% in Group B, significantly higher percentages were noted in Group C (95%), Group D (100%) and Group E (100%). The following species were isolated as major member in the groups; Group A--Streptococcus intermedius, Group B--Peptostreptococcus micros, Group C--Fusobacterium nucleatum, Group D--Bacteroides gingivalis, and Group E--Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. 4. In all cases, the sum of VFA produced in the PYG medium by anaerobic isolates was classified into Group A' to E'. Ratios of agreement between VFA as revealed by direct GLC and VFA as revealed by PYG.GLC were as follows: Group A-A'; 47.1%, Group B-B' and C-C'; 45%, Group D-D'; 87.5%, and Group E-E'; 62.9%. 5. In Group B, no propionic acid was detected. The 2 cases in which acetic acid occurred in a concentration greater than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml belonged to Group B'. In Group C, no isobutyric acid was detected; and the 5 cases in which butyric acid was detected in a concentration of more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml belonged to Group C'. Varelic acid was not detected in Group D; and 7 out of the 8 cases in which iso-valeric acid, irrespective of concentration, was detected belonged to Group D'.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in brain abscess, a review; observation of 18 consecutive cases.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of 18 consecutive cases of brain abscesses were studied. Two cases were sterile. In five cases there was a single bacterial isolate. In five cases there was a single bacterial isolate the organism being Staphylococcus aureus in two cases, Bacteroides fragilis in two cases and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in one case. In the remaining eleven cases, more than one organism was isolated. A combination of anaerobe with an aerobe was observed in five cases and infections with more than one anaerobe in as many as six cases. Anaerobic organisms are the important pathogens in brain abscess and occurrence of infections by more than one organism is a common factor.
TI  - Evaluation of a commercial latex test for Clostridium difficile for reactivity with C. difficile and cross-reactions with other bacteria.
AB  - Seventy-eight species of bacteria (739 isolates) were tested for reactivity with  a commercial latex test for Clostridium difficile. All noncytotoxic as well as cytotoxic strains of C. difficile reacted positively. Immuno-specific cross-reactions were found only with C. sporogenes, proteolytic C. botulinum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
TI  - Preformed enzyme profiles of reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  - The preformed (constitutive) enzyme profiles of 30 type strains and reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci were determined with two commercial systems, RapID ANA and a prototype system from API. Both systems identified Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Ps. asaccharolyticus, Ps. indolicus, Ps. magnus and Ps. micros accurately, except for one strain of Ps. magnus misidentified as Ps. micros by the RapID ANA system. The indole-negative, butyrate-producing cocci (classified at present as Ps. prevotii and Ps. tetradius) produced several different, unique patterns with the prototype API system, but the results with RapID ANA were often misleading. Eight strains of Hare group cocci produced previously described profiles. Four strains of streptococci produced profiles easily distinguished from those of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci. We conclude that most gram-positive anaerobic cocci can be identified rapidly and reliably to the species level by their preformed enzyme profiles, providing that their underlying classification is sound. Problems were encountered with the butyrate-producing cocci, which appear to be a more heterogeneous group of organisms than is currently acknowledged; further taxonomic studies on these organisms are required.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance and TetM in oral anaerobic bacteria and Neisseria perflava-N. sicca.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant organisms isolated from six patients with periodontal disease included Bacteroides spp., Eubacterium spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Neisseria perflava-N. sicca, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Veillonella parvula, and facultative streptococci. All but the Bacteroides spp. and Eubacterium spp. hybridized with the TetM determinant. An additional 417 bacterial strains were screened, and 4% of both the oral streptococci and the Fusobacterium spp. hybridized with the TetM probe.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in 12 years at two military hospitals.
AB  - Examination of 15,844 clinical specimens submitted over 12 years (1973 to 1985) to the anaerobic microbiology laboratories in two military hospitals demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 4,458 (28.1%) specimens. The specimens yielded 6,557 anaerobic isolates (1.47 isolates per specimen). Bacteroides spp. accounted for 43% of all isolates; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 26%; Clostridium spp., 7%; and Fusobacterium spp., 4%. Bacteroides spp. predominated in abscesses, obstetrical and gynecological (OBG) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 44% of all Bacteroides spp., and of them, B. fragilis was mostly isolated in abscesses, wounds, abdomen, and blood. Pigmented Bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all Bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. Bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. Bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of Bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in OBG infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in OBG infections, abscesses, and wounds. The predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were Peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and Peptostreptococcus prevotii (13%). Clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, abscesses, abdominal infections, and blood. The predominant strain was Clostridium perfringens (48%). Fusobacterium spp. were recovered in abscesses and abdominal and OBG infections. The predominant isolate was Fusobacterium nucleatum (47%). These data illustrate the relative frequency of the different anaerobic bacteria in a variety of infections and demonstrate the predominance of certain isolates at different sites.
TI  - Identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci by use of systems for detecting pre-formed enzymes.
AB  - Two systems for detecting pre-formed enzymes, RapID ANA and a prototype system from API, were compared in a blind study for their ability to identify 69 gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from clinical specimens. Both systems were able to identify Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Ps. asaccharolyticus and Ps. micros accurately without the need for further tests. The prototype API system identified all isolates of Ps. magnus correctly, but the RapId ANA system misidentified several isolates as Ps. micros. Numerous different enzyme patterns were found with the indole-negative, butyrate-producing cocci (Ps. prevotii and Ps. tetradius), suggesting that this group of organisms may be heterogeneous. We conclude that kits for detecting preformed enzymes are of considerable potential for the identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci in clinical laboratories.
TI  - Characterization of cross-reactive proteins detected by Culturette Brand Rapid Latex Test for Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Clostridium sporogenes, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides asaccharolyticus have been reported to react in the Culturette Brand Rapid Latex Test (Marion Scientific, Div. Marion Laboratories, Inc., Kansas City, Mo.) for Clostridium difficile. From the results of this study we showed that C. sporogenes and P. anaerobius produce a protein which is very similar biochemically and immunologically to the protein of C. difficile that is detected by the test. Thus, the positive latex reactions observed with C. sporogenes and P. anaerobius are due to a cross-reactive protein. We did not detect this cross-reactive protein in filtrates from B. asaccharolyticus, indicating that this bacterium reacts with the latex reagent by some other mechanism. We cloned the C. difficile gene that codes for the cross-reactive protein and showed that the protein produced by the recombinant organism is nontoxic and distinct from toxin A, thus confirming our earlier findings.
TI  - Bacteriology of periodontal disease in the cat.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 32 cats showing different stages of periodontal disease. Correlations were sought between gingival index scores and the prevalence of various microbial groups, and between microbial populations found in sites designated as most-affected and least-affected within individual cats. The tendency with higher gingival index scores, and with the most-affected sites, was toward a microbial population composed to a greater extent of anaerobic Gram-negative rods. The most common organism was an anaerobic Gram-negative rod in the black-pigmented Bacteroides group that was biochemically similar to B. gingivalis but had catalase activity. The black-pigmented Bacteroides group and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were found in increasing numbers with increasingly severe periodontal disease. Pasteurella multocida was isolated from most samples and appeared to decrease in numbers with increasing periodontal disease.
TI  - Controlled evaluation of trypticase soy broth with and without gelatin and yeast  extract in the detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  - The addition of gelatin to blood culture media has been suggested to prevent the  inhibition of Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius that is caused by sodium polyanetholsulfonate. To determine the effect of such supplementation on the overall yield of microorganisms, we compared the yield and speed of detection of clinically important microorganisms from 5422 paired 10-ml samples of blood cultured in Trypticase soy broth (TSB) containing 0.03% sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) and TSB/SPS containing 1.2% gelatin and 1.0% yeast extract (mTSB). The atmosphere of incubation (open venting unit) and ratio of blood to broth (1:5) were the same for both samples. Only cultures with adequate blood sample (greater than or equal to 80% of stated volume) were compared statistically. Addition of gelatin and yeast extract resulted in inhibited growth of Enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.01), fungi (p less than 0.05), and the overall set of microorganisms encountered (p less than 0.001). It delayed growth of Enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.001) but reduced the time to recover staphylococci (p less than 0.02). Of 12 isolates of species usually inhibited by SPS, seven grew only with the addition of gelatin and yeast extract, none grew only without supplementation, and five grew in both media. Although gelatin and yeast extract may improve the yield of some specific bacteria, the routine use of these additives cannot be recommended for all blood culture media.
TI  - Controlled evaluation of modified radiometric blood culture medium supplemented with gelatin for detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  - Although the addition of 1.2% gelatin to broth blood culture media containing sodium polyanetholesulfonate has been shown to enhance detection of certain bacteria, including Neisseria meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis, the effect of such supplementation on the detection of other microorganisms causing bacteremia and fungemia is not known. Therefore, we studied BACTEC 6B medium with and without gelatin in 6,833 paired comparisons to examine the effects of supplementation on both the yield and the speed of detection of sepsis. More aerobic and facultative bacteria grew in the 6B than in the 6B-gelatin medium (P less than 0.001), especially staphylococci (P less than 0.01), Escherichia coli (P less than 0.01), other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P less than 0.05), and Acinetobacter spp. (P less than 0.05). When microorganisms grew in both bottles, they did so earlier in 6B than in 6B-gelatin (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the 6B medium in its present formulation is superior to 6B medium supplemented with 1.2% gelatin.
TI  - Identification of anaerobic bacteria using high-performance liquid chromatography.
AB  - 20 species of the genera Clostridium, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium and the type strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, Veillonella parvula and Propionibacterium acnes were examined for the production of volatile (VFA) and nonvolatile (NVFA) short-chain fatty acids using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a column for organic acids (Aminex HPX-87H). 10 min are needed for sample preparation and the VFA and NVFA were detected simultaneously in a single chromatographic run. The total time required to run each chromatogram was approximately 60 min. With regard to the production of short-chain fatty acids in culture media it was possible to identify the species of the genera rapidly and clearly. The results illustrate the role of HPLC in determinating short-chain fatty acid products as an additional means for rapid differentiation between closely related anaerobic bacterial species. The aim of the method developed is to establish a complete automatization for the identification of anaerobic bacteria using an automatic sampling system and a microprocessor-controlled chromatography unit.
TI  - [Clinical studies on cefuzonam in obstetrics and gynecological infections].
AB  - To evaluate the usefulness and the safety of cefuzonam (CZON, L-105) against obstetric and gynecological infections, we conducted clinical trials and obtained the results summarized as follows. 1. Thirteen patients with obstetric and gynecological infections (intrauterine infection 2 cases, adnexitis 7, 1 case each of abscess of adnexa uteri, abscess of the vaginal wall, pyelonephritis, and mammitis) were treated with CZON. The CZON was administered by intravenous injection or intravenous drip infusion, 1 g twice daily for 4 to 7 days (8 g to 14 g in total). The clinical effect was good in 12 and poor in 1. 2. Four cases, on which other antimicrobial agents were ineffective, responded well to CZON. 3. The CZON displayed excellent effects on anaerobic bacteria (Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis) and Gram negative rods (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae). 4. No side effects or laboratory abnormalities were observed. 5. From the above results, CZON appeared to be an effective and useful drug for obstetric and gynecological infections.
TI  - Proline requirement for glucose utilization by Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC 27337.
AB  - Resting cells of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius maintained under anaerobic conditions were unable to metabolize either glucose or alanine. The addition of proline to the appropriate suspension, however, resulted in the immediate utilization of both compounds. Fermentation of alanine by the cells required that stoichiometric concentrations of proline be present in the medium; and during the oxidation of alanine, proline was simultaneously reduced to the ring cleavage product delta-aminovaleric acid. Although proline was required to initiate glucose transport, stoichiometric amounts of the imino acid were not necessary for glucose fermentation. Proline also stimulated the uptake and concomitant phosphorylation of the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxy-D-glucose. The proline requirement for glucose transport by P. anaerobius could be replaced by adding ferricyanide or simply by aerating the cell suspension. The initiation of sugar uptake by proline, ferricyanide, and O2 was attributed to the capacity of these compounds to function as electron acceptors, which permitted reoxidation of the (reduced) intracellular nucleotide pool and the formation (from an endogenous reserve) of the high-energy donor(s) required for the vectorial transport and phosphorylation of sugar.
TI  - Comparative activity of metronidazole and tinidazole against Clostridium difficile and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Broth dilution MICs of metronidazole against 38 strains of Clostridium difficile  (0.13 microgram/ml) and 11 strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (0.11 microgram/ml) were lower than those of tinidazole (0.16 and 0.17 microgram/ml, respectively). As molar concentrations the nitroimidazoles were equally active. The MICs of the two drugs correlated positively, and the relative activity of tinidazole increased with decreasing susceptibility of both species.
TI  - Ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin in the treatment of soft tissue pelvic infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin were evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. Forty-four patients were enrolled: 22 received the ampicillin/sulbactam regimen, and 22 received the metronidazole-gentamicin combination. There were 33 cases of severe acute pelvic inflammatory disease, two tuboovarian abscesses, five cases of endomyometritis, and two cases of posthysterectomy pelvic cellulitis. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the infection sites yielded 447 microorganisms from 44 patients (an average of 10 bacteria per infection; 6.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). The most frequent isolates were Bacteroides sp., 54; Bacteroides bivius, 17; black-pigmented Bacteroides, 12; Bacteroides disiens, 11; Fusobacterium, 13; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 24; Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, 21; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 34; Gardnerella vaginalis, 29; Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 17; alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 15; and Escherichia coli, five. Clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam and 18 of 21 patients treated with metronidazole-gentamicin. One treatment failure occurred in the ampicillin/sulbactam group in a patient who required antichlamydial therapy and had a complex left adnexal mass consistent with an abscess. The cases of metronidazole-gentamicin failure included two patients initially diagnosed as having tuboovarian abscesses who required a change in antibiotic therapy to control the infections. The third patient had postabortion endomyometritis that did not respond to metronidazole-gentamicin therapy within 48 hours, and required a change of medication. No adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted in either group of patients.
TI  - Analysis of EDTA-soluble cell surface components of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  - The protein content of EDTA extracts from 76 strains of Gram-positive anaerobic cocci was examined using SDS-PAGE. Strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius produced almost identical profiles; greater heterogeneity was observed within the species Peptococcus magnus, Peptococcus prevotii and Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, but several strains within each biotype produced similar patterns. Serological investigation of these extracts by ELISA revealed numerous cross-reactions among the different biotypes. Immunoblot transfers from polyacrylamide gels demonstrated two common antigens within strains of the species, Ps. anaerobius, but these were not species-specific.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in dentoalveolar abscesses.
AB  - The present study was initiated to determine the bacteriology of 40 orofacial abscesses of dental origin in patients who had taken antibiotics for several days. Bacteria were isolated from all but 2 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 21 cases, obligate anaerobic bacteria in 17 cases, whereas in 11 cases, polymicrobial growth was revealed. The average number of bacterial species was 2.1 per specimen. Gram positive aerobic micro-organisms predominated, namely, Staphylococcus epidermidis followed by Streptococci (group A) and Staphylococcus aureus. Among obligate anaerobes, Gram positive micro-organisms, peptostreptococci and peptococci were more often isolated, in the following decreasing order: Ps. productus, Ps. intermedius, Ps. parvulus, Ps. anaerobius, Pc. constellatus, Pc. prevotii. Gram negative anaerobic rods were detected in a small number of cases, namely B. corrodens, B. fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, B. ochraceus, B. oralis. Quantitative determination did not show any meaningful difference between aerobic and anaerobic isolates. Susceptibility tests against a series of antibiotics showed that ampicillin was the most active in aerobes and cefoxitin in anaerobes.
TI  - Immunochemical characterization of the cell surface carbohydrate antigens of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Two carbohydrate antigens were isolated from the cell surface of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. One, extracted from purified cell walls with NaOH, contained glucose and phosphorus, with traces of galactosamine and glucosamine. Serological activity was detected by a 'dot blot' procedure. The second antigen, extracted from cell membranes with phenol and purified by chromatography on Sepharose 6B and an immunoadsorbent column, contained glucose, glycerol phosphate, phosphorus and fatty acids. Antigenicity of this extract could also be demonstrated by an ELISA technique.
TI  - Sulbactam/ampicillin versus metronidazole/gentamicin in the treatment of severe pelvic infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of sulbactam/ampicillin versus metronidazole/gentamicin were compared in 39 patients with severe pelvic infections. 30 patients had severe acute pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, 3 tubo-ovarian abscesses, 4 endomyometritis, and 2 posthysterectomy pelvic cellulitis. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the sites of infection yielded 259 micro-organisms from 38 patients; an average of 6.8 bacteria per infection (3.9 anaerobes and 2.9 aerobes). The most frequent isolates were Bacteroides spp. (21), B. bivius (13), B. disiens (8), Fusobacterium spp. (9), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (15), P. asaccharolyticus (8), anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (17), Gardnerella vaginalis (24), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (14), alpha-haemolytic streptococci (6) and Escherichia coli (3). Clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 of 19 treated with metronidazole/gentamicin. The sulbactam/ampicillin failure was a patient with pelvic inflammatory disease with a positive Chlamydia trachomatis culture who required antichlamydial therapy. The metronidazole/gentamicin failures included a patient with a tubo-ovarian abscess requiring surgical drainage and 2 patients with pelvic inflammatory disease requiring antichlamydial treatment. No adverse haematological, renal, or hepatic effects were noted with either regimen.
TI  - Moxalactam versus clindamycin plus tobramycin in the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy of moxalactam versus clindamycin/tobramycin was evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. Sixty patients were treated: 30 with moxalactam and 30 with clindamycin/tobramycin. There were 15 cases of tuboovarian abscess, 36 cases of severe pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, eight cases of endomyometritis, and one wound abscess. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the sites of infection yielded 441 microorganisms from 53 patients; an average of 8.3 bacteria per infection (4.5 anaerobes and 3.8 aerobes). The infections tended to be mixed aerobic-anaerobic with anaerobes isolated in 90% of cases. The most frequently isolated possible pathogens were Bacteroides sp. (37), Bacteroides bivius (23), Bacteroides asaccharolyticus (12), Peptococcus asaccharolyticus (29), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (19), unidentified anaerobic gram-positive cocci (18), Escherichia coli (17), nonhemolytic streptococci (16), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (13), and Gardnerella vaginalis (38). Clinical cure was noted in 29 of 30 moxalactam-treated and 29 of 30 clindamycin/tobramycin-treated patients. Moxalactam was effective in five of six cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 22 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, the one case of endomyometritis and the one wound abscess. Clindamycin/tobramycin was effective in eight of nine cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 14 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, and all seven cases of endomyometritis. No adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted with either regimen.
TI  - Effect of sodium polyanetholesulfonate and gelatin on the recovery of Gardnerella vaginalis from blood culture media.
AB  - Sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) is used as a routine supplement to blood culture media to enhance recovery of microorganisms, but it inhibits the growth of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Streptobacillus moniliformis. Comparative clinical blood culture studies at the University of Colorado Hospital suggested that SPS also inhibits the growth of Gardnerella vaginalis. We inoculated 16 blood culture isolates of G. vaginalis into 11 blood culture media containing SPS or sodium amylosulfate, with and without gelatin. In the absence of gelatin, only brain heart infusion and thiol broths with SPS supported the growth of more than five strains of G. vaginalis, whereas all media except Bactec 6B and 7C and brucella broths recovered most isolates with SPS and gelatin or with sodium amylosulfate alone. We conclude that SPS inhibits the growth of G. vaginalis in blood culture media but that this inhibition is medium dependent and can be overcome by supplementation of most media with gelatin.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria isolated from female genital tract infections.
AB  - Certain species or subspecies of anaerobic bacteria are isolated with higher frequency from female genital tract infections than from other anatomic sites. To gain susceptibility data more specific to the treatment of these infections, nine antimicrobial agents were tested by an agar dilution technique against 230 anaerobic bacteria isolated solely from obstetric and gynecological infections. These genital isolates were, in general, very susceptible to imipenem (most active, inhibiting all gram-negative rods at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), clindamycin (all isolates inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), metronidazole (all gram-negative rods inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and chloramphenicol. Penicillin G had generally low activity against Bacteroides spp., not restricted to just the Bacteroides fragilis group, although it was very active against gram-positive species. Bacteroides bivius, a species uniquely common in female genital infections, was particularly resistant (90% MIC, 64 U/ml). Also, the Bacteroides melaninogenicus isolates were less susceptible than previously reported for isolates not exclusively from genital sites. Compared with moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone, cefoxitin usually demonstrated equal or greater activity against most Bacteroides spp., with the exception of greater activity of moxalactam against B. fragilis (formerly subsp. fragilis). Resistance to moxalactam was observed among strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, a common genital isolate. Overall, the activities of these four drugs were not as predictable as those observed for clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, and imipenem.
TI  - Change in the volatile fatty acids content of laboratory stored sterilized and non-sterilized swine wastes.
AB  - The influence of urine and microbial activity was studied as possible factors leading to the generation of volatile fatty acids in non-sterilized stored swine wastes. Urine was found to promote the generation of the volatile acids. The microbial origin of the volatile acids in the wastes was ascertained by the growth of an anaerobic bacterial strain (Peptostreptococcus anaerobius). Significant generation and transformation of these acids was observed in sterilized swine waste samples stored under conditions similar to the non-sterilized samples.
TI  - The classification and identification of the anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The Approved Lists of Bacterial Names (1980) includes the following Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus species pathogenic for man: Peptococcus magnus, P. prevotii, P. asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, P. micros and P. productus. A presumptive identification of these species can be made on the basis of cellular morphology, susceptibility to novobiocin, characterization of metabolic end products, fermentation of glucose and lactose, and production of indol. Capnophilic and microaerophilic streptococci are characterized by their production of lactic acid from glucose.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. This investigation assessed the effect of light-activated Hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans. Photoactivation of Hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. Combinations of light-activated Hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular S. aureus. The ability of Hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of abscesses.
TI  - Isolation of obligate anaerobic bacteria from bovine abscesses in sites other than the liver.
AB  - A survey in Japan showed that of 2036 slaughtered cattle 58(3%) had abscesses in  sites other than the liver. In 21 of the affected animals the lesions were pulmonary and in 32 abdominal (excluding hepatic); in five animals the lesions were found elsewhere (muscle 2, skin 2, bone 1). Nineteen (33%) of the 58 cattle also had abscesses in the liver. Obligate anaerobes alone were isolated from 17(29%) of the affected animals (Fusobacterium necrophorum 14, Bacteroides spp. 2, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius 1). A mixture of obligate anaerobes and aerobes or facultative anaerobes was isolated from 31 affected cattle: of these animals 21 yielded large and five small numbers of F. necrophorum; three yield fusobacteria other than F. necrophorum; and two yielded Propionibacterium acnes. The remaining 10 affected animals yielded only aerobes or facultative anaerobes. The numbers of viable obligate anaerobes in pus specimens were in the range 10(3)-10(9)/ml.
TI  - Pathogenicity of anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 20 strains of facultative or anaerobic gram-positive cocci (AGPC) was investigated by injecting them alone or mixed with other flora into mice, utilizing the subcutaneous abscess model. Abscesses induced by a mixture of two organisms were uniformly larger than those induced by single organisms. The relationships among seven AGPC strains, eight aerobes, and two Bacteroides spp. were determined by treating the infected animals with antibiotics and observing the effect of therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. A total of 70 different combinations were tested. As judged by their responses to antimicrobial therapy, facultative cocci or AGPC were relatively more important than the other species in 6 combinations, equally important in 35 combinations, and less important in 29 combinations. The AGPC most often found to be equal to or more important than the other bacteria were Peptococcus magnus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were frequently found to be of more importance than the AGPC.
TI  - Osteomyelitis in dogs and cats caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Localised osteomyelitis was diagnosed in 2 dogs and 2 cats. The disease was caused by fight wounds in 3 cases. Radiographic examination demonstrated a circumscribed zone of cortical bone lysis, sequestra and periosteal new bone. Each case was treated surgically by sequestrectomy and debridement. Infection was due mainly to anaerobic bacteria. The pathogenic bacteria isolated from the lesions of dogs were Actinomyces viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides spp, and from the lesions in cats were Clostridium villosum , Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Wolinella recta and Bacteroides gingivalis. As all the bacteria were sensitive to penicillin, each case was treated with penicillin and by irrigation of the wound. This resulted in resolution of the disease, within 4 weeks, in all cases.
TI  - Experimental otitis media in guinea pigs. Serum antibody response to Bacteroides  fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius upon challenge.
AB  - The production of antibodies in serum was studied after inoculation of Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes or Peptostreptococcus anaerobius into the middle ear of guinea pigs. Inoculation of B. fragilis resulted in IgG and IgM serum antibodies at an early stage of the infection, while IgA antibodies were seldom detected and at a later stage. In contrast, inoculation of P. acnes or P. anaerobius induced no serum antibody response. Of these three species B. fragilis induced the most intense otitis, whereas P. anaerobius failed to induce otitis.
TI  - Death of an African elephant from probable toxemia attributed to chronic pulpitis.
AB  - A 31-year-old captive male African elephant (Loxodonta africana) of 5,000-kg body weight died suddenly in ventral recumbency. Lesions seen at necropsy were bilateral purulent pulpitis and periodontitis of both tusks, serous atrophy of coronary groove fat, Grammocephalus cholangitis, myocardial and skeletal lipofuscinosis, and scattered segmental necrosis in the pectoral muscles. Nonhemolytic streptococci, Corynebacterium sp, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides sp, were recovered from the exudate around one or both tusks. We postulated that the elephant died of hypoxia from prolonged ventral recumbency because of weakness and inability to rise secondary to toxemia from bilateral pulpitis and periodontitis.
TI  - Continuous opacity monitoring of the growth of bacteria under strict anaerobic conditions.
AB  - A newly designed instrument is described which generates continuous records of the opacities of six bacterial cultures growing under strict anaerobic conditions. Additions (for example, of antibacterial agents) or withdrawal of culture (for example, for viable counting) can be made at any time without breach of anaerobiosis. Use of the instrument is illustrated by growth curves obtained from small inocula of two strict anaerobes, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and by the effects on the growth curve of Bacteroides fragilis of adding various concentrations of metronidazole at different times.
TI  - Inactivation of the polyanionic detergent sodium polyanetholsulfonate by hemoglobin.
AB  - Sodium polyanetholsulfonate (SPS) has been added to blood culture media for many  years. Its incorporation results in a higher yield of positive blood cultures due to its inactivation of antimicrobial cationic compounds. The most active of these cations include complement components, aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics, and receptors on polymorphonuclear leukocytes. There have been reports from studies conducted outside patient blood culture bottles that SPS itself may possess antibacterial activity against some isolates of Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Conversely, in patient clinical trials there has been no significant difference in pathogen isolation rates in the presence or absence of SPS. In an attempt to explain this in vitro/in vivo disparity, a search was undertaken to elucidate which variable constituent in blood, heretofore not studied quantitatively, might have a major effect on modulating the activity of SPS. It was found that hemoglobin combined stoichiometrically with SPS with a Kd of approximately 10(-7) mol/liter. Optimum SPS inactivation occurred at an SPS/hemoglobin ratio of 1:6 (wt/wt). SPS-sensitive isolates of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis were protected by the addition of hemoglobin from the antimicrobial effects of this polyanion in time-kill studies. This protection was directly related to the amount of SPS combined in solution. Therefore, the amount of free hemoglobin in solution must be measured when studying the antimicrobial activity of polyanions or when evaluating the effect of different polyanions on the recovery rates of pathogens in patient blood culture clinical trials.
TI  - [Cefotiam passage into the maxillary sinus tissues].
AB  - Clinical study was made on cefotiam (CTM) and the following results were obtained. Tissue concentrations of CTM were determined 1 hour after intravenous injection (CTM 1 g) in chronic sinusitis and maxillary cyst. Concentrations of CTM were 16.53 micrograms/g, 13.26 micrograms/g in mucosa of the maxillary sinus, maxillary cyst, respectively. Antibacterial activity of CTM was measured on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aerococcus, Acidaminococcus fermentans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; that were isolated from pus of maxillary sinus. The highest MIC on them was 3.13 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Cefamandole therapy in hand infections.
AB  - Hand lacerations, especially when inadequately treated, may result in infections  caused by aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic infections most commonly result from human bite injuries in which there is contact between hand and mouth. The search continues for an ideal antibiotic to employ when anaerobic organisms are suspected. In this study cefamandole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was employed whenever anaerobic hand infections were suspected following trauma. In each patient quantitative cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms were obtained. All organisms isolated were tested by standard susceptibility assays for both aerobes and anaerobes. In the case of anaerobes, minimum inhibitory concentration assays were also performed. After the initial culture was obtained, each patient received approximately 1.5 gm of cefamandole every 6 hours for a period of 5 days. This therapy was changed only if susceptibility studies indicated resistance to cefamandole. In our patients, 58% of the infectious organisms were aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 42% were obligate anaerobes. The predominant organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which accounted for 42% of the infections. In most of the aerobic infections a single organism was isolated, whereas multiple organisms were identified in the anaerobic infections. All but one of the infections responded to cefamandole; the one that didn't was caused by Enterobacter cloacae and required treatment with an aminoglycoside. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, which includes both aerobes and anaerobes, cefamandole is useful in treating infections, especially those resulting from human bites.
TI  - On the occurrence of enoate reductase and 2-oxo-carboxylate reductase in clostridia and some observations on the amino acid fermentation by Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Enoate reductase present in Clostridium kluyveri and Clostridium spec. La 1 could be detected in three strains of C. tyrobutyricum and ten clostridia belonging to the groups of proteolytic and saccharolytic or proteolytic species, respectively. In C. pasteurianum, C. butyricum and C. propionicum enoate reductase could not be found even after growth on (E)-2-butenoate. A 2-oxo-carboxylate reductase was present in rather low activities in the non-proteolytic clostridia which produce enoate reductase. High activities (up to 10 U/mg protein) of 2-oxo-carboxylate reductase were found in six of ten proteolytic clostridia. The substrate specificities of the enoate reductase and the 2-oxo-carboxylate reductases from the proteolytic clostridia were determined with different alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylates (enoates) and 2-oxo-carboxylates, respectively. Enoates as well as 2-oxo-carboxylates are intermediates of the pathway by which amino acids are degraded. An explanation is offered for the long known but not understood fact that in the Stickland reaction isoleucine always acts as an electron donor and leucine and phenylalanine can be electron acceptors as well as donors. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius converting some amino acids to the same products as C. sporogenes did this also with the intermediates which were found for the reductive deamination of amino acids in C. sporogenes, however, in crude extracts reduction of enoates occurred only in an activated form.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria associated with osteomyelitis in domestic animals.
AB  - Specimens of bony tissue or adjacent soft tissue from 19 animals with osteomyelitis were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Fourteen specimens (74%) yielded anaerobic bacteria in pure culture or mixed with aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria. The most predominant genus encountered was an obligate anaerobe, Bacteroides. The most frequently isolated Bacteroides species was Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, which was isolated 5 times. The most frequently isolated anaerobe was Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which was isolated 6 times. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most frequently isolated aerobic bacteria, with 7 and 6 isolates, respectively.
TI  - Effect of glucose concentration in the growth medium upon neutral and acidic fermentation end-products of Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium sporogenes and peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Clostridium bifermentans, C. sporogenes and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were grown in Fastidious Anaerobe Broth with glucose concentrations from 0-1.5% (w/v). Gas chromatographic (GLC) analysis of fermentation end-products revealed that a change in glucose concentration markedly affected fermentation patterns of each microorganism. Increased glucose concentration resulted in stimulation of ethanol production by all strains, and of butanol and butyric acid by C. sporogenes. With C. bifermentans, there was a parallel increase in ethanol and acetic acid production and decreased formation of propanol and propionic, iso-butyric and iso-valeric acids. Increased ethanol formation by P. anaerobius was accompanied by an increase in acetic acid and a decrease in butan-1-ol production. The greatest incremental change in GLC profiles occurred when glucose concentration was raised from zero to 0.1% (w/v). These data suggest that glucose concentration in a medium for GLC analysis must be rigorously controlled if reproducible results are to be obtained.
TI  - The recovery of anaerobic bacteria from swabs in three transport systems. Statistical evaluation by application of a variance component model.
AB  - The recovery of six anaerobic species from swabs in three transport systems was quantitatively evaluated. The test strains were Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Eubacterium lentum, and Clostridium ramosum. The transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified Stuart's transport medium (MS), or a plain cotton swab in either a dry aerobic tube (DA) or an aerobic agar tube (AA). Swabs were charged with a known number of organisms of the test strain and inserted in the appropriate transport systems. Immediately hereafter the swabs were transferred to glass tubes with reduced buffer. After vigorous shaking, aliquots from the buffer were seeded onto blood agar plates, and the number of colony forming units (CFU) was counted after incubation. The number of CFUs from independent replications had a variation that was too large to be accounted for by the Poisson distribution. The probability of recovery (POR) was defined as the number of CFU recovered from a swab as a percentage of the original inoculum. The logarithms of the POR values were analyzed with a variance component model. This showed that estimated values of POR were significantly higher in DA (44%) than in AA (23%), while the value for MS (33%) did not differ significantly from those for AA or DA. It is concluded that in MS, friction between swab and medium does not contribute significantly to bacterial recovery loss, as compared to AA and DA.
TI  - The survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C on swabs in three transport systems. Statistical evaluation by application of a variance component model.
AB  - The survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in three transport systems at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees C was evaluated. The transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified Stuart's transport medium (MS), a plain cotton swab in a dry aerobic tube (DA) and a plain cotton swab in an aerobic agar tube (AA). The test strains were Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Eubacterium lentum and Clostridium ramosum. Inoculated swabs were kept at the described conditions for time periods ranging from 22 1/2 min through 32 d, after which surviving organisms were recovered quantitatively. Results were described by the survival rate, defined as the percentage of organisms initially present, that had survived storage for 24 h. The survival rate was uniformly higher at 4 degrees C than at 22 degrees C. In Stuart's transport medium at 4 degrees C the survival rate was 81.9% compared to 4.3% in dry aerobic tube at 4 degrees C. At 22 degrees C the survival rate in dry aerobic tube and aerobic agar tube was 0.003% or less whereas in Stuart's transport medium growth occurred with B. fragilis, E. lentum and C. ramosum.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. The MIC (micrograms/ml) of U-57930E that inhibited 95% Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus prevotii, B. melaninogenicus and P. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, B. vulgatus, Propionibacterium and Peptococcus species. Clindamycin, on the other hand, gave MIC values of 0.5 microgram/ml for B. fragilis, P. prevotii and P. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for Propionibacterium sp. All strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of U-57930E. Both clindamycin and U-57930E showed similar MIC values for all strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes tested. The MIC values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline were within the expected range. U-57930E had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower MIC than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  - Root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with Streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, Actinomyces bovis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides oralis in various combinations. After 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. Signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. In 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with Strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. Sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (HA), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. Detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of B. oralis in all five monkeys. Agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of B. oralis in titers between 1:40 and 1:320. A marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of IgM-class. The study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.
TI  - The use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  - An anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. Seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. These included Bacteroides spp (43%), Peptococcus spp (26%), Peptostreptococcus spp (13%), Veillonella spp (7%), Fusobacterium spp (7%), Clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous Gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). Differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. Sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of the study period. Miles and Misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for F nucleatum, but no difference for B fragilis, B thetaiomicron, B uniformis, B bivius, B corrodens, F mortiferum, Ps anaerobius, P prevotii or Propionibacterium acnes. In almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. Disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. The anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. However, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.
TI  - Analysis of short-chain acids from anaerobic bacteria by high-performance liquid  chromatography.
AB  - A standard mixture of 25 short-chain fatty acids was resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography, using an Aminex HPX-87 column. The acids produced in culture media by anaerobic bacteria were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography after extraction with ether and reextraction into a small volume of 0.1 N NaOH. The presence of fumaric acid in culture extracts of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the trapped eluent fractions from the high-performance liquid chromatography column.
TI  - Leucine dissimilation to isovaleric and isocaproic acids by cell suspensions of amino acid fermenting anaerobes: the Stickland reaction revisited.
AB  - Freshly compared cell suspensions of clostridia (Clostridium bifermentans, C. botulinum proteolytic type A, C. difficile, C. sordellii, and C. sporogenes) and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius converted leucine to isovaleric (iV) and isocaproic (iC) acids in the absence of other amino acids. The optimal pH for conversion was between 8 and 9 at 37 degrees C. The stoichiometry of reaction was compatible with that expected for the Stickland reaction, as the ratio of iV to iC was 1:2, the amount of CO2 produced was equivalent to that of iV, and ammonium ion concentrations were equal to the total C5 and C6 acids formed. The presence of alanine and valine (proton donors in the Stickland reaction) in incubations effectively increased the concentration of iC at the expense of iV production, implying that leucine acted there primarily as a proton acceptor. Glycine and proline (proton acceptors) stimulated both iV and iC production from leucine, but increases in iV concentrations were proportionately greater than for iC so that leucine was primarily a proton donor in the presence of proton acceptors. Glucose stimulated the conversion of leucine to volatile fatty acids but favoured iC production. Production of iC from leucine was inhibited by surface active compounds (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and desoxycholate) as well as arsenite and iodoacetate. The redox dyes methyl viologen and phenosafranine inhibited iC production more severely than iV production, as did the nitroimidazole antimicrobial agent, metronidazole.
TI  - Biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9 fraction in the Salmonella-microsome test. It is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-NP and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. We determined the 1-NP nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. We found that the mutagenicity of 1-NP mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. The product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-AP), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. The 1-NP nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the anaerobic bacteria, i.e., Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. nucleatum, Clostridium perfringens, C. sporogenes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, Eubacterium lentum, E. limosum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-NP to 1-AP and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-NP.
TI  - Metabolic inhibition of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius decreases the bactericidal  effect of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - Peptostreptococcus anaerobius VPI 4330-1 was tested under various conditions for  examination of the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide. The cells were most rapidly killed by hydrogen peroxide when they were in the exponential-growth phase. Cooling or starving the cells decreased the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide. The ionophore nigericin and the metal ion chelating agent 2,2'-bipyridine stopped macromolecular syntheses and greatly decreased the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide. The ionophore valinomycin and the glycolytic inhibitor iodoacetate also stopped the syntheses of the macromolecules but only slightly decreased the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide. Novobiocin, an inhibitor of deoxyribonucleic acid gyrase, and chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, were not able to decrease the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide. These findings implicate metal ions and an active metabolism of the organism in the bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide.
TI  - Bacteriologic evaluation of the efficacy of mechanical root canal instrumentation in endodontic therapy.
AB  - The presence of bacteria in 17 single-rooted teeth, with periapical lesions, was  studied throughout a whole period of treatment. The root canals were irrigated with physiologic saline solution during instrumentation. No antibacterial solutions or dressings were used. Bacteria were found in all initial specimens from the teeth (median number of bacterial cells 4 x 10(5), range 10(2) - 10(7)) and the number of strains in the specimens ranged from 1 to 10.88% of the strains were anaerobic. The most commonly isolated species were: Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp intermedius and Eubacterium alactolyticum. Mechanical instrumentation reduced the number of bacteria considerably. Specimens taken at the beginning of each appointment usually contained 10(4) - 10(6) bacterial cells and at the end 10(2) - 10(3) fewer. Bacteria were eliminated from the root canals of eight teeth during the treatment. In seven root canals bacteria persisted despite treatment on five successive occasions. There was no evidence that specific microorganisms were implicated in these persistent infections. Teeth where the infection persisted despite being treated five times were those with a high number of bacteria in the initial sample.
TI  - On the formation of 3-phenylpropionate and the different stereo-chemical course of the reduction of cinnamate by Clostridium sporogenes and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  
TI  - Effect of temperature, humidity and exposure to oxygen on the survival of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The relative effect of humidity, temperature and exposure to oxygen on the survival of 11 strains of Bacteriodes spp., Fusobacterium necrophorum, Eubacterium lentum, Clostridium ramosum, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was evaluated. Suspensions of the test strains were applied to membrane filters either in empty sterile petri dishes or on plates of non-nutrient agar to provide dry or moist conditions. The filters were stored aerobically or anaerobically in an atmosphere containing 10% CO2 at either 4 degrees C or 35 degrees C. After holding periods of 0.375-384 h, the filters were transferred to nutrient plates inside an anaerobic glove box. After incubation the growth on the filters was compared with that on control filters that had not been stored. Survival was better at 4 degrees C than at 35 degrees C. For the gram-negative organisms, survival was better under moist than under dry conditions, whereas for gram-positive organisms this finding was sometimes reversed. The results indicate that, generally, anaerobic bacteria kept under aerobic conditions survive best under moist conditions at 4 degrees C.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide is prevented by the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate system under anaerobic conditions.
AB  - Streptococcus sanguis and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were exposed to various combinations of the components of the lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide system. The bactericidal effect of hydrogen peroxide was prevented under anaerobic conditions by lactoperoxidase together with thiocyanate, but not by lactoperoxidase or thiocyanate alone. Thiocyanate was effective already at a molar ratio to hydrogen peroxide of 1:100.
TI  - Production of p-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid from tyrosine by Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was found to metabolize tyrosine to p-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid [3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid]. This acid was detected in spent growth media by gas-liquid chromatography, and its identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry.
TI  - Microorganisms associated with abscesses of sheep and goats in the south of Iran.
AB  - A total of 86 abscesses (45 and 41) abscesses of sheep and goats, respectively) were examined for their causal agents; 44 of these abscesses were located subcutaneously, and the remaining 42 were in lungs, livers, intestines, and udders. A total of 23 different types of microorganisms were isolated from 78 abscesses; bacteria were not detected in the remaining eight abscesses. Microorganisms isolated were: species of the genera Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus and Pasteurella, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative rods. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Eubacterium tortuosum were isolated in pure culture from one abscess each in goats. Two to four different microorganisms were associated with 25 of the 86 abscesses. It was determined that 11 isolates of Corynebacterium pyogenes, 2 isolates of Pasteurella haemolytica, 1 of P multocida, and 1 of C pseudotuberculosis were lethal to mice. Two of the C pyogenes isolates from subcutaneous spreading abscesses of goats were pathogenic for rabbits; these two isolates produced similar suppurative inflammation in goats experimentally, but did not cause death. As determined by experimental inoculation, goats were more susceptible than sheep to the two isolates. In nature, subcutaneous abscesses of goats associated with C pyogenes were of a more diffusive type which resulted in generalization of the infection and death of the animals. Postmortem examination of ten goats dying of field infection showed the presence of larvae of the warble-fly Przhevalskiana silenus at the site of infection.
TI  - Antigenic relationships and rapid identification of Peptostreptococcus species.
AB  - Antisera against whole cells of each Peptostreptococcus species (P. anaerobius, P. micros, P. parvulus, and P. productus) were produced in rabbits. When these antisera were reacted against sonically disrupted cells and culture supernatant fluids in Ouchterlony tests, lines of identity were obtained among the antigens from all the species and uninoculated culture medium. When the antisera were subsequently absorbed with the dehydrated culture medium used to grow the peptostreptococci, all cross-reactions in heterologous antigen-antibody combinations were eliminated, leaving only species-specific precipitin arcs. These absorbed antisera, specific for each Peptostreptococcus species by Ouchterlony tests, were used for rapid identification studies. Staphylococcus aureus-bearing protein A was sensitized with each absorbed antiserum. These reagents produced specific coagglutination reactions with suspensions of each Peptostreptococcus reference strain and with 16 clinical isolates. No cross-reactions occurred with the Streptococcus intermedius, Peptococcus magnus, or Peptococcus asaccharolyticus strains tested.
TI  - Neutrophil chemotaxis induced by anaerobic bacteria isolated from necrotic dental pulps.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria belonging to the species Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Eubacterium alactolyticum, isolated from necrotic dental pulps, were tested for their capacity to induce neutrophil leukocyte chemotaxis. Generation of chemotactic factors in serum by whole bacterial cells and chemotaxis induced by bacterial extracts were studied in vitro by the Boyden technique. Subcutaneously implanted wound chambers in guinea pigs were used for testing leukocyte migration in vivo. All bacterial strains had a similar high capacity to induce neutrophil chemotaxis. The heavy accumulation of polymorhponuclear neutrophil leukocytes associated with clinical and experimental infections by B. melaninogenicus or B. asaccharolyticus cannot be ascribed to any extreme ability of these organisms to generate chemotactic factors.
TI  - The presence of antibody-coated anaerobic bacteria in asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy.
AB  - Quantitative anaerobic culture of urine samples obtained from 593 pregnant women  by suprapubic bladder aspiration was performed to establish the involvement of anaerobic bacteria in asymptomatic urinary tract infections. The fluorescent antibody (FA) test was applied to the sediments of bladder aspirates to determine the site of infection. Anaerobic bacteriuria (greater than or equal to 10(4) microorganisms/ml of urine) was found in 34 patients, of whom five were FA-positive. These anaerobes were identified as Lactobacillus minutus, Veillonella parvula (two patients). Clostridium putrefaciens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Aerobic bacteriuria (greater than 10(4) microorganisms/ml of urine) was detected in 27 patients, of whom 13 were FA-positive. In 10 women with mixed aerobic/anaerobic bacteriuria, no FA-positive bacteria were found. The finding of FA-positive anaerobes may indicate that these organisms are involved in silent renal infection.
TI  - Differentiation of Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus by gas-liquid chromatography of cellular fatty acids and metabolic products.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC) profiles of cellular fatty acids and metabolic products were useful in identifying strains of Peptococcus saccharolyticus, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Streptococcus intermedius. The GLC results supported the recent taxonomic decision to transfer aerotolerant Peptostreptococcus species to the genus Streptococcus. Because inconsistencies in the results prevented our differentiating Peptococcus prevotii. Peptococcus magnus, and Peptococcus variabilis by GLC, additional strains will have to been examined. These GLC techniques are amenable to routine use; however, for interlaboratory results to be meaningful, the classification and nomenclature of the anaerobic gram-positive cocci should be standardized.
TI  - Obligate anaerobes in clinical veterinary practice.
AB  - Clinical specimens obtained from domestic animals were examined to determine the  relative prevalence of obligate anaerobic bacteria and the species represented. Of 3,167 samples cultured anaerobically as well as aerobically, 2,234 were bacteriologically positive. Of these positive samples, 583 (26%) contained species of obligate anaerobic bacteria in a total of 641 isolates. Most positive samples contained anaerobes admixed with aerobic species, although 6% of such samples yielded pure cultures of obligate anaerobes. The most common sites from which anaerobes were isolated were abscesses (32% of abscesses cultured contained species of obligate anaerobes), peritoneal exudates (24%), and pleural effusions (20%). Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides ruminicola accounted in the aggregate for approximately 50% of all anaerobic isolates. Bacteroides fragilis accounted for 1% of all the isolates, and members of the genus Clostridium accounted for 8%.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in late infections following orthopedic surgery.
AB  - Twelve patients with late anaerobic infection following hip or knee arthroplasty  or tibia osteosynthesis are presented. Peptococci (Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. prevotii) and peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus micros, P. anaerobius, P. parvulus) were present in nine of the cases. Anaerobic gram-positive or -negative rods were found in three cases (Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces israelii, and Bacteroides fragilis). Antibodies against the isolated bacteria were detected in sera of nine patients. Anaerobic bacteria seem to be responsible for some of the late reactions that may follow arthroplasty or osteosynthesis.
TI  - Bovine superoxide dismutase and copper ions potentiate the bactericidal effect of autoxidizing cysteine.
AB  - When cysteine is oxidized by oxygen, hydrogen peroxide is formed, and hydrogen peroxide is very toxic to Peptostreptococcus anaerobius VPI 4330-1. Native and inactivated superoxide dismutase increased the rate of oxidation of cysteine and thereby potentiated the toxic effect of cysteine. A similar increase in the rate of oxidation of cysteine and in the toxicity of cysteine was obtained with Cu2+.
TI  - Description of strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius isolated from subcutaneous abscesses in cats.
AB  - Strains of Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus and of a Gram-positive coccus, which was initially isolated as an anaerobe but grew subsequently as a facultative organism, were isolated from subcutaneous abscesses in cats. The cat strains of Peptostreptococcus gave metabolic fermentation products in combinations described for P. anaerobius. The Streptococcus strains conformed to the group S. intermedius. The facultative organism described had the metabolic products of P. anaerobius but the distinctly different biochemical characteristics of S. intermedius and fits neither of the genera strictly.
TI  - Occurrence of anaerobic bacteria in diseases of the dog and cat.
AB  - A survey for anaerobic bacteria was conducted in 314 clinical specimens from dogs and cats. A total of 187 anaerobic isolates in pure and mixed culture were isolated from 111 of the specimens that contained anaerobic bacteria. Common isolated included Actinomyces (9.1%), Clostridium perfringens (19.3%), other Clostridium spp (11.2%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (7.5%), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (13.4%), other Bacteroides spp (17.6%), and Fusobacterium necrophorum (5.3%). Anaerobic bacteria were involved in serious lesions that often were life threatening to the animals. Antibiotic susceptibility data indicated that the lincomycin family, the penicillin family, chloramphenicol, and cephaloridine are preferred drugs for treatment of anaerobic infections. Data from the survey were used in formulation of a table to aid practitioners in clinical diagnosis of disease caused by anaerobes. Clostridium perfringens was isolated in large numbers from five of six dogs with a clinical diagnosis of canine hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and from one cat with hemorrhagic diarrhea. Experimental infections were induced in rats, using caine feces as inoculum. Induced lesions contained aerobic and anaerobic bacteria similar to those bacteria isolated in the clinical survey, indicating that feces may serve as a major source of these bacteria in clinical infections of the dog.
TI  - Isolation and characterisation of bacteria from abscesses in the subcutis of cats.
AB  - Thirty-six closed abcesses in the subcutis of cats were examined. Of 168 bacterial strains isolated, 121(72%) were anaerobes and 47 (28%) were facultative anaerobes. Twenty-six abscesses contained mixtures of facultative anaerobes and anaerobes, six contained anaerobes only and four contained facultative anaerobes only. Bacteriodes was the genus most commonly isolated (28.6% of all isolates) followed by Fusobacterium (19.0%) and Pasteurella (multocida) (13.1%). Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was the most commonly isolated anaerobic species (13.2% of anaerobic isolates and 9.5% of all isolates)and Past, multocida was the most commonly isolated facultative anaerobe (46.8%; 13.1%of all isolates).
TI  - Extractable antigen shared by Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains.
AB  - Extracts from several species of gram-positive cocci were prepared by a modification of the Rantz-Randall autoclave method and tested for reactions with rabbit anti-Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (ATCC 27337 and VPI 5737) sera in a capillary precipitin test. Antigen preparations from two reference strains of P. anaerobius (ATCC 27337 and VPI 5737) and six clinical isolates of P. anaerobius reacted with the P. anaerobius antisera. These extracts formed a line of identity by immunodiffusion and displayed at least one precipitin line by immunoelectrophoresis. Absorption of the antisera with either the autoclaved extract or a 10% whole-cell suspension from each of the eight P. anaerobius strains removed the precipitin line(s) observed during immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis. Extracts prepared to other species of Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Streptococcus did not react with the P. anaerobius antisera in a capillary precipitin test. In addition antisera to Lancefield groups A to G did not react with the extracts from the eight P. anaerobius strains. Preliminary chemical analysis of the extracts from the eight strains showed that they contained approximately 0.2 mg of carbohydrate per ml and 3.6 mg of protein per ml. The rabbit anti-P. anaerobius sera used in this study detected a common antigen(s) shared by strains of P. anaerobius, but did not react with autoclave extracts prepared from other species of gram-positive cocci. This extractable antigen could be used in a capillary precipitin test to rapidly identify P. anaerobius strains isolated in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of cysteine exposed to atmospheric oxygen.
AB  - Peptostreptococcus anaerobius VPI 4330-1 was exposed to atmospheric oxygen in a dilution bland (0.2% gelatin, salts, resazurin) solution. The organisms were rapidly killed when the solution contained cysteine. The organisms were effectively protected by catalase and horseradish peroxidase as well as by the metal ion-chelating agents 8-hydroxyquinoline and 2,2'-bipyridine. Superoxide dismutase increased the rate of killing of the organisms, whereas singlet oxygen quenchers and scavengers of hydroxyl free radicals did not protect the organisms from the toxic effect of cysteine. Hydrogen peroxide was formed when cysteine was exposed to oxygen in the dilution blank solution, and the reaction was inhibited by metal ion-chelating agents. The organisms were rapidly killed by 20 microM hydrogen peroxide in anaerobic dilution blank solution. The toxic effect of hydrogen peroxide in anaerobic dilution blank solution. The toxic effect of hydrogen peroxide was completely abolished by catalase and metal ion-chelating agents. These results indicated that hydrogen peroxide was formed in the dilution blank solution in a metal ion-catalyzed autoxidation of cysteine and that hydrogen peroxide was toxic to P. anaerobius VPI 4330-1 in a reaction also catalyzed by metal ions.
TI  - Tyrosine degradation in presumptive identification of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - A new tyrosine medium was developed and evaluated for the differentiation of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius from other anaerobic, gram-positive cocci. The strains included 159 originating from clinical specimens and 13 reference strains received from other workers in the field. Only one strain of each species was included in the study from multiple cultures from the same patient. This medium is simple to prepare and can be used in a small clinical laboratory. One hundred seventy-two strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci were grown and evaluated with the new tyrosine medium; 36 strains (100%) of P. anaerobius degradated the tyrosine crystals when incubated at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions in a GasPak jar (Baltimore Biological Laboratory) for approximately 72 h. On the other hand, 135 of 136 other anaerobic gram-positive cocci were negative for tyrosine degradation, but grew on the tyrosine agar plate when incubated anaerobically. The single strain that degraded tyrosine was 1 of the 13 isolates of Peptostreptococcus micros studied.
TI  - Effects of storage in an anaerobic transport system on bacteria in known polymicrobial mixtures and in clinical specimens.
AB  - An anaerobic transport system (ATS) which provides for catalytic removal of oxygen was evaluated by using in vitro-prepared polymicrobial mixtures of logphase bacteria and clinical specimens. Inoculated swabs were stored at room temperature in (i) aerobic, (ii) anaerobic glove box, and (iii) ATS environments, and bacteria were quantitated after 2, 24, 48, and 72 h. Bacteria in a three-part mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Escherichia coli and in a five-part mixture of B. fragilis, P. anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa survived 72 h of storage in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments, but the anaerobic species were inactivated in the aerobic storage except for B. fragilis in pure culture or in the three-part mixture. Changes in relative proportions among the species in a mixture were least in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments and greatest during the aerobic storage, particularly in the five-part mixture. Bacteria present in pure or mixed culture in clinical specimens generally survived 72 h of storage in the ATS. These data indicate that changes in relative proportions occur with prolonged storage even under anaerobic conditions, but that the ATS would be most effective for preserving anaerobic bacteria and preventing drastic concentration changes and overgrowth of facultative and aerobic bacteria.
TI  - Factors related to the oxygen tolerance of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The effect of atmospheric oxygen on the viability of 13 strains of anaerobic bacteria, two strains of facultative bacteria, and one aerobic organism was examined. There were great variations in oxygen tolerance among the bacteria. All facultative bacteria survived more than 72 h of exposure to atmospheric oxygen. The survival time for anaerobes ranged from less than 45 min for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius to more than 72 h for two Clostridium perfringens strains. An effort was made to relate the degree of oxygen tolerance to the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases in cell-free extracts of the bacteria. All facultative bacteria and a number of anaerobic bacteria possessed superoxide dismutase. There was a correlation between superoxide dismutase activity and oxygen tolerance, but there were notable exceptions. Polyacrylamide gel electropherograms stained for superoxide dismutase indicated that many of the anaerobic bacteria contained at least two electrophoretically distinct enzymes with superoxide dismutase activity. All facultative bacteria contained peroxidase, whereas none of the anaerobic bacteria possessed measurable amounts of this enzyme. Catalase activity was variable among the bacteria and showed no relationship to oxygen tolerance. The ability of the bacteria to reduce oxygen was also examined and related to enzyme content and oxygen tolerance. In general, organisms that survived for relatively long periods of time in the presence of oxygen but demonstrated little superoxide dismutase activity reduced little oxygen. The effects of medium composition and conditions of growth were examined for their influence on the level of the three enzymes. Bacteria grown on the surface of an enriched blood agar medium generally had more enzyme activity than bacteria grown in a liquid medium. The data indicate that superoxide dismutase activity and oxygen reduction rates are important determinants related to the tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to oxygen.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of amniotic fluid.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of amniotic fluid (AF) obtained during the first (AF1) and second (AF2) trimesters was compared with the third (AF3) against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis ss. fragilis (6 strains), Eubacterium lentum (3 strains), and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (4 strains). Escherichia coli (5 strains) served as a positive control. AF1 supported the growth of all 4 anaerobes (except B fragilis for 4 hours) for the entire 24-hour period tested. AF2 supported the growth of E coli and B fragilis for 24 hours but temporarily inhibited P anaerobius and E lentum. In contrast, AF3 inhibited all bacteria tested for 8 hours or more. It is concluded that AF1 is the least inhibitory, AF3 the most, and AF2 intermediate for the organisms tested. Lack of antimicrobial effect of AF on anaerobic bacteria may be one explanation for the higher incidence of anaerobic infections during absortion than during the prenatal period.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical formation in anaerobic broth media exposed to atmospheric oxygen.
AB  - Fourteen different broth media were autoclaved under anaerobic conditions and then exposed to atmospheric oxygen. The hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical formation as well as the bactericidal effect of the media were studied. The rate of killing of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius VPI 4330-1 was high in media that rapidly autoxidized and accumulated hydrogen peroxide. In actinomyces broth (BBL), 50% of the cells were killed within 2 min, and in Brewer thioglycolate medium (Difco), 50% were killed within 11 min, whereas more than 50% of the cells survived for more than 2 h in Clausen medium (Oxoid), fluid thioglycolate medium (BBL), and thioglycolate medium without dextrose or indicator (Difco). Only media that contained phosphate and glucose had a tendency to accumulate hydrogen peroxide. A solution of phosphate and glucose autoxidized when it had been heated to 120 degrees C for at least 5 min and when the pH of the solution was higher than 6.5. Transitional metal ions catalyzed the autoxidation, but they were not necessary for the reaction to occur. Of the other substances heated in phosphate buffer, only alpha-hydroxycarbonyl compounds autoxidized with accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. Superoxide dismutase decreased the autoxidation rate of most of the broth media. This indicated that superoxide radicals were generated in these media.
TI  - Serological reactions of the genus Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - White male New Zealand rabbits were immunized with soluble antigen preparations (SP) of the following gram-positive anaerobic cocci: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC 27337 and VPI 5737; P. micros VPI 2618; Streptococcus morbillorum ATCC 27527; P. parvulus VPI 5229; and P. productus ATCC 27340. SP were reacted with homologous and heterologous rabbit antisera in immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, indirect fluorescent-antibody, and tanned-cell passive hemagglutination tests. Even though each antiserum reacted strongly with its homologous SP, no interspecies reactivity was observed except between P. productus antisera and P. parvulus SP by the passive hemagglutination test. Antisera prepared to both strains of P. anaerobius reacted with the other strain in all serological tests.
TI  - Enhancement of experimental anaerobic infections by blood, hemoglobin, and hemostatic agents.
AB  - Certain foreign materials have been demonstrated to enhance the infectivity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Whole blood and other protein compounds encountered in surgical settings or trauma were tested for their effect on infectivity of nonsporeforming anaerobic bacteria. Infectious synergistic mixtures of Bacteroides fragilis plus Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Bacteroides melaninogenicus plus Fusobacterium necrophorum were each diluted to a barely noninfectious or minimally infectious concentration (subinfective inoculum) that was injected intraperitoneally into mice alone and in combination with test proteins. Infectivity was measured by deaths from sepsis or abscess(es) within the abdominal cavity at autopsy at 1 week. Two hemostatic agents, Gelfoam powder and Avitene (final concentrations, 10 mg/ml), and crystalline hemoglobin (4 g/100 ml) each produced a marked increase (P < 0.001) in the rate of infection when mixed with a normally subinfective inoculum of either bacterial mixture. Fresh homologous mouse blood (0.25 ml) injected intraperitoneally without anticoagulant also significantly enhanced infectivity (P < 0.01) of a subinfective inoculum of B. fragilis plus P. anaerobius. These studies demonstrated the capacity of whole blood, hemoglobin, and hemostatic agents to enhance the infectivity of certain nonsporeforming anaerobic bacteria. The high concentrations of anaerobic bacteria in the gastrointestinal, female genital, and respiratory tracts produce an increased risk of human infection after surgery or trauma in these sites; the protein agents studied here may further enhance infection.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of anaerobic broth exposed to atmospheric oxygen tested on Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strain VPI 4330-1 was used as the test organism in  an evaluation of the bactericidal effect of anaerobic broth exposed to air. The test organism, grown under anaerobic conditions in Trypticase soy broth, was diluted in buffered salt solution, and about 2 x 10(4) cells were suspended in 10 ml of an aerated broth. Ninety percent of the cells were killed within 15 min in actinomyces broth and within 50 min in Trypticase soy broth. All cells survived for 2 h in fluid thioglycolate medium. Addition of DABCO [1,4-diazabicyclo (2.2.2) octane] or mannitol to Trypticase soy broth did not influence the death rate of the organism, whereas superoxide dismutase decreased the death rate. Addition of catalase or manganese dioxide to the broth kept all the cells viable for 2 h. Of the three broth media tested, actinomyces broth reduced oxygen at the highest rate and Trypticase soy broth reduced it at the slowest rate. Hydrogen peroxide could be demonstrated in actinomyces broth and in Trypticase soy broth but not in fluid thioglycolate medium. In addition to catalase, manganese dioxide also removed all hydrogen peroxide from Trypticase soy broth, and superoxide dismutase significantly decreased the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the broth. The results suggest that hydrogen peroxide mediated the toxic effect of atmospheric oxygen in these broth media.
TI  - Gelatin neutralization of the inhibitory effect of sodium polyanethol sulfonate on Neisseria meningitidis in blood culture media.
AB  - The inhibitory effect of sodium polyanethol sulfonate (0.05%) upon growth of Neisseria meningitidis was found to be neutralized by adding gelatin (l.1%) to the growth medium. The neutralizing effect was demonstrated in solid medium, as well as in nutrient broth for blood cultures. The findings parallel those of Wilkins and West (6) regarding gelatin neutralization of the inhibitory effect of sodium polyanethol sulfonate on Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
TI  - Cellular fatty acids of Peptococcus variabilis and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Cellular fatty acids of Peptococcus variables and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were identified by gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and associated analytical techniques. Iso- and anteiso-branched-chain acids were major components in both species.
TI  - [Growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy of the commercially available Vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). The media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. Analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. From the results obtained with strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides splanchnicus, Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the Vacutainer culture tubes, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.
TI  - Differentiation of several isolates of Peptococcus magnus by counterimmunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - Uniform sonicated suspensions of three clinical isolates of Peptococcus magnus that were morphologically, chromatographically, and biochemically identical were used to produce hyperimmune antisera in rabbits. Similar hyperimmune serum was prepared to a single strain of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. When these antisera and antigens were tested by counterimmunoelectrophoresis, the three isolates of Peptococcus magnus were immunologically distinct. None of the antisera to Peptococcus magnus formed precipitin lines with Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of amniotic fluid against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Amniotic fluid samples were obtained at term and tested for their antimicrobial effect on anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus (Ps.) anaerobius, Peptococcus (Pc.) prevotii, Bacteroides (B.) fragilis, and B. coagulans with facultative Escherichia (E.) coli serving as control. Amniotic fluid had only temporary bacteriostatic effect on Pc. prevotii and B. fragilis for 8 to 16 hours. This effect lasted for only 8 hours on Ps. anaerobius. On the contrary, the bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was well sustained on E. coli and B. coagulans, lasting for the entire test periods of 20 and 32 hours, respectively. At the end of the time intervals mentioned, Ps. anaerobius, Pc. prevotii, and B. fragilis exhibited logarithmic growth, confirming the earlier reports that it is not nutritionally deficient. Amniotic fluid exhibited temporary bacteriostatic effect on Ps. anaerobius, P. prevotii, and B. fragilis, but this effect was well sustained against B. coagulans.
TI  - Susceptibility to erythromycin of anaerobes of the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Sphaerophorus, Veillonella, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin were determined by broth dilution tests for 313 anaerobic strains, most of which were clinical isolates. All the gram-positive anaerobes tested (84 Peptococcaceae, including 21 Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 15 Peptococcus variabilis; 65 Corynebacterium acnes and 29 Clostridium strains, including 13 C. perfringens) were sensitive (MIC values 0.012 through 3.12 microgram erythromycin/ml); so were 111 cultures of gram-negative anaerobes (52 Bacteroides fragilis, 12 B. thetaiotaomicron, 7 B. vulgatus, 13 B. oralis, 4 B. melaninogenicus, 10 Sphaerophorus necrophorus, 2 Veillonella sp., 11 members of other species). Erythromycin at concentrations of 6.25 through 200.0 microgram/ml was active against 24 strains (1 B. fragilis, 4 Fusobacterium fusiforme, 9 Sph. freundi, 10 Sph. varius). The present results are compared to the limited number of reports existing with regard to the susceptibility of anaerobes to erythromycin.
TI  - Long-chain fatty acids of peptococci and peptostreptococci.
AB  - The long-chain fatty acids extracted from the whole cells of 12 clinically significant species of peptococci and peptostreptococci were characterized by gas-liquid chromatography. The resulting methylated fatty acid profiles (and some unidentified compounds) of 82 strains allowed the 12 species to be separated into four groups. Fifteen strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were placed in group I because they had a unique, prominent compound that occurred in the area where a C8 to C10 fatty acid would be expected. Group II, consisting of Peptostreptococcus intermedius, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus parvulus, Peptococcus morbillorum, and Peptococcus constellatus, produced C14, C16:1, C18:1, and C18 fatty acids. Peptococcus prevotii, Peptococcus variabilus, Peptococcus magnus, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Peptostreptococcus productus were placed in group III because they contained three to six additional, unidentified compounds that strikingly differentiated them from group II. Peptococcus saccharolyticus was the single species assigned to group IV because it yielded C14, C16, C18:1, C18, and C20 fatty acids and a prominent unidentified peak that occurred between C14 and C16 fatty acids. This study indicated that cellular long-chain fatty acids may be an important tool in clarifying the taxonomy of the peptococci and peptostreptococci.
TI  - Evaluation of the sodium polyanethol sulfonate disk test for the identification of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - The previously reported sodium polyanethol sulfonate disk test for the identification of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (Graves et al., 1974) was evaluated, with modifications. Three bands of brucella agar, three inoculum sizes, and two inoculum sources were compared. Nine stock cultures of P. anaerobius (eight normal flora isolates and ATCC 27337) and 16 fresh clinical isolates were used. All cultures of P. anaerobius showed inhibition zones of 12 to 30 mm in diameter, regardless of test conditions. Out of 103 clinical isolates of other species of anaerobic gram-positive cocci tested, only two had an inhibition zone size in this range (one P. micros of 11 studied had a zone of 12 mm and one P. prevotii of 14 studied had a zone of 16). The test had an overall accuracy of 98% in the identification of P. anaerobius from clinical specimens. Since P. anaerobius accounts for one-fifth to one-third of all anaerobic gram-positive cocci encountered in clinical specimens, this simple and rapid technique can be very useful for presumptive identification.
TI  - [Brain abscess secondary to pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, case report (author's transl)].
AB  - A case of brain abscess in the right parietal lobe secondary to pulmonary arteriovenous malformation of the right lung is presented. A 27-year-old man was admitted for headache and left homonymous hemianopsia. CAG, VAG and brain scan detected brain abscess of the right parietal lobe which was successfully removed surgically. He had been noted to have generalized cyanosis and club finger which corresponded to polycytemia and hypercapnia on examination. Subsequently pulmonary arteriovenous malformation was found in the right lower lobe of the lung which was also successfully excised by thoracic surgeons. Brain abscess was caused by peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
TI  - Bacterial interference by oropharynegeal and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobic isolates were tested for bacterial inhibitory activity. Of 144 isolates, 102 were from oropharynegeal washings, and 42 were from clinical specimens. Thirteen facultative bacterial species (seven members of the Enterobacteriaceae and six species of gram-positive cocci) were used as indicators of inhibition. Eleven anaerobic species were isolated from oral secretions. All isolates of Bacteroides melaninogenicus, the most commonly recovered species, consistently inhibited several species of indicator bacteria. Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides oralis, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius had unprecictable inhibitory activity, whereas most of the other oral anaerobes were noninhibitory. The 42 clinical species were generally noninhibitory.
TI  - Anaerobic infections in hospital practice.
AB  - The role of anaerobes in the pathogenesis of infections was investigated. Anaerobes were isolated from 0,25% of blood cultures and from 15,8% of other specimens tested; in 15,1% of cases where anaerobes were isolated, no aerobes were found. The strains most commonly encountered were Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Clostridium perfringens. Sensitivity tests in vitro showed all organisms to be sensitive to clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol, while a large proportion were resistant to penicillin G and smaller numbers were resistant to tetracycline.
TI  - Medium-dependent inhibition of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius by sodium polyanetholsulfonate in blood culture media.
AB  - Of 13 species of anaerobic cocci, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was the only species tested that was sensitive to 0.1% sodium polyanetholsulfonate (SPS). However, the sensitivity of P. anaerobius to SPS varied according to the media in which the cultures were grown. In supplemented peptone (B-D) and brain heart infusion media, most strain of P. anaerobius were not inhibited by SPS. Gelatin and proteose peptone were the medium components which were protective. The minimal inhibitory concentration of SPS for P. anaerobius was approximately 60-fold higher in media. However, the concentration of SPS required to neutralize the bactericidal properties of human serum was only four fold higher in media containing geltain. In a commerical medium containing SPS (0.03%) and gelatin (1.2%), SPS-sensitive strains of P. anaerobius were not inhibited by SPS, and the bactericdal action of human blood on Escherichia coli C and Serratia marcescens SM 29 was eliminated.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with metronidazole. In addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against P. prevotii, B. fragilis ss. fragilis and F. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in GAM broth containing of 4 MIC, 2 MIC, 1 MIC and 1/2 MIC of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. All the strains of Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus including P. anaerobius, P. saccharolyticus, P. prevotii and Ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. A concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of Bacteroides including B. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). To this concentration all strains of Fusobacterium including F. varium (20 strains), F. mortiferum (2 strains) and other Fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible. On the contrary, Propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. The antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against Bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium and Fusobacterium. Tinidazole was bactericidal against F. varium in a concentration of 2 MIC till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on B. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. On the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against B. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against F. varium. Against P. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. Tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding Propionibacterium acnes and Bifidobacterium adolescentis.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic bacteria during transportation. 1. Experimental investigations on the effect of evacuation of atmospheric air by flushing with carbon dioxide and nitrogen.
AB  - The effect of evacuation of atmospheric air during transportation on recovery of  anaerobic bacteria was investigated. Evacuation of atmospheric air from glass tubes by flushing with pure carbon dioxide lowered the content of oxygen to about 0.4 per cent. Three B. fragilis strains and one strain of Fusobacterium mortiferum and of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were investigated. Bacterial recovery was determined one hour and 24 hours after evacuation of atmospheric air by pure carbon dioxide and pure nitrogen, was compared to bacterial recovery from samples transported with free access to atmospheric air. Evacuation by pure carbon dioxide significantly improved the recovery of one B. fragilis strain after 24 hours of transportation and significantly impaired the recovery of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius after one hour of transportation, while evacuation by pure nitrogen significantly improved the recovery of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius after 24 hours of transportation. In all other cases, however, no statistically significant effect on bacterial recovery was found.
TI  - Deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. The small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("Fukushima Type 1"). Bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. THE RESULTS: 1) Among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis and Lactobacillus (L.) bifidus. Species of which none of the strains split were Escherichia (E.) coli, E. communior, E. freundii, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. buchneri, L. cellobiosus, L. bulgaricus, S. aureus, Aerobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was Intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) Among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split were Bacteroides (B.) vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, Corynebacterium (C.) granulosum, C. avidum, Peptostreptococcus (Peptostrept.) putridus, Eubacterium (Eubact.) lentum, Peptococcus (Pept.) grigoroffii, Pept. anaerobius, Veillonella (V.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were Coryne. diphtheroides, Eubact. parvum, Peptostrept. intermedius. Species of which none of the strains split were Coryne, parvum, Peptostrept. micros, V. alcalescens, V. parvula, Catenabacterium (Catena.) catenaforme, and Catena. filamentosum. 3) All or none, or almost all or none, of the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  - The capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out CO2-filled tube (DGT), dry sterile aerobic tube (DAT), and a tube containing a modified Stuarts' transport medium (MST), was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in MST and DAT, respectively. The viability of P. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to MSA and DAT, was not adversely affected by the CO2 environment in the DGT. The MST maintained relatively constant numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. The DAT and the DGT were unable to maintain the viability of S. pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a DGT, DAT, or MST, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage period. Of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only B. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the DGT. Under these test conditions the DGT did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). However, the MST did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
TI  - Comparative susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to minocycline, doxycycline, and tetracycline.
AB  - The comparative susceptibility of 622 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria to minocycline, doxycycline, and tetracycline was determined by an agar-dilution technique. In addition to Bacteroides fragilis, a variety of other anaerobic bacteria was resistant to achievable blood concentrations of tetracycline (55% inhibited by 6.25 mug/ml) and doxycycline (58% inhibited by 2.5 mug/ml). In contrast, minocycline was significantly more active (P < 0.05) than both doxycycline and tetracycline, and 70% of strains were inhibited by achievable blood concentrations of this antibiotic (2.5 mug/ml). The enhanced activity of minocycline was particularly striking for Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. prevotii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus. Further evaluation of the clinical efficacy of minocycline against anaerobic infections is indicated.
TI  - Fluorescent antibody study of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  - Fluorescent antibody conjugates were prepared from five species of anaerobic cocci commonly isolated from human infections. When tested with homologous and heterologous cells these conjugates were found to be highly specific. There was no evidence of a common genus antigen. Peptococcus magnus conjugates detected a species-specific antigen; cross-reactions with Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were readily eliminated by absorption. The conjugates from Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus, anaerobius, and Peptostreptococcus intermedius displayed a high degree of strain specificity. Occasional cross-reactions were detected with homologous strains, suggesting the presence of common antigens, but no attempt was made to determine the number of different serotypes in these species.
TI  - Sodium polyanethol sulfonate sensitivity of anaerobic cocci.
AB  - Growth of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was shown to be totally inhibited by sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS). Other anaerobic cocci grew in the presence of SPS although some strains of Peptococcus prevotii and Peptococcus magnus showed delayed growth. A SPS disk assay for the presumptive identification of P. anaerobius is described.
TI  - Extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The production of extracellular deoxyribonuclease was examined with anaerobic organisms isolated from clinical specimens. Nuclease activity was extraordinarily common. All strains of Fusobacterium, including eight species, as well as Bacteroides fragilis and B. melaninogenicus, displayed enzyme activity. Whereas the gram-positive bacteria were generally less productive, all strains of Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus intermedius, and P. anaerobius specifically produced deoxyribonuclease. The test is taxonomically valuable, particularly in the characterization of gram-positive cocci, since a deoxyribonuclease-producing coccus indicates P. intermedius or P. anaerobius. Additionally, possession of the enzyme may prove to be a useful correlate of the potential pathogenicity of anaerobes.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
