TI  - Characterization of films based on chitosan lactate and its blends with oxidized  starch and gelatin.
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chitosan lactate (CHL) was tested against bacteria and phytopathogenic fungi. Then, the structural, physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of films based on CHL, oxidized potato starch (OPS), and gelatin (GEL) were investigated. With the exception of Rhizopus nigricans, CHL was effective against the target organisms. Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) were more sensitive to CHL than Gram-negative bacteria (Pectobacterium carotovorum and Escherichia coli). Cryo-SEM images showed total miscibility between the polymers in the blends and the ATR-FTIR spectra revealed that there was an interaction among the polymeric components. Pure CHL films displayed the highest moisture content (25.51%), water vapor permeability (48.78gmmm(-2)d(-1)kPa(-1)), and the lowest tensile and puncture strength (2.00 and 1.45MPa, respectively) among the studied films. CHL50/GEL50 films had lower permeability, higher mechanical strength, and lower elongation compared to CHL50/OPS50 films. Films obtained from CHL and CHL50/GEL50 were completely water-soluble and did not show sorbitol recrystallization. The incorporation of CHL into OPS and GEL films did not affect their transparency and improved UV-blocking capacity. CHL films were the only ones that exhibited antibacterial efficiency. Antifungal activities against Alternaria alternata and Monilinia fructigena were detected for CHL and CHL50/GEL50 films.
TI  - Complete genome sequence and characterization of the N-acylhomoserine lactone-degrading gene of the potato leaf-associated Solibacillus silvestris.
AB  - N-Acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) are used as quorum-sensing signal molecules by many gram-negative bacteria. We have reported that Solibacillus silvestris, which was isolated from the potato leaf, has AHL-degrading activity. To identify the AHL-degrading gene, whole genome sequencing of S. silvestris StLB046 was performed by using pyrosequencing technology. As the result of the BLAST search, one predicted ORF (ahlS) showed slight similarity to AiiA-like AHL lactonase from Bacillus cereus group. Escherichia coli harboring the ahlS-expressing plasmid showed high AHL-degrading activity. The ahlS-cording region was also amplified by PCR from the other potato leaf-associated and AHL-degrading S. silvestris strains. Purified AhlS as a maltose binding fusion protein showed high AHL-degrading activity and catalyzes AHL ring opening by hydrolyzing lactones. In addition, expression of ahlS in plant pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum attenuated maceration of the potato slices. Our results suggest that AHL-degrading activity of ahlS might perform useful functions such as useful biocontrol agents.
TI  - Expression and characterization of aiiA gene from Bacillus subtilis BS-1.
AB  - AHL-lactonase (AiiA), a metallo-beta-lactamase produced by Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis, specifically hydrolyzes N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) secreted by Gram-negative bacteria and thereby attenuates the symptoms caused by plant pathogens. In this study, an aiiA gene was cloned from Bacillus subtilis BS-1 by PCR with a pair of degenerate primers. The deduced 250 amino acid sequence contained two small conserved regions, 103SHLHFDH109 and 166TPGHTPGH173, which are characteristic of the metallo-beta-lactamase family. Homology comparison revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence had a high degree of similarity with those of the known AiiA proteins in the B. cereus group. Additionally, the aiiA gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS and the expressed AiiA protein could attenuate the soft rot symptoms caused by Erwinia carotovora var. carotovora.
TI  - The identification of antibacterial compounds for the development of enhanced media for the detection of foodborne fungi.
AB  - In an effort to identify a more suitable antibiotic for utilization in mycological media, 12 food borne fungal species from various genera including Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Eurotium chevalieri, Fusarium moniliforme, Penicillium sp., Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida tropicalis, Geotrichum candidum, Rhodotorula glutinis and Kluyveromyces thermotolerans along with 21 chloramphenicol-resistant bacterial isolates from fresh produce and ATCC cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, E. coli, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus spp. were tested for their abilities to grow on dichloran rose bengal agar containing various levels of gentamicin, chlortetracycline or chloramphenicol. Results indicated that all fungal isolates except for Rh. glutinis and R. stolonifer grew well on all media tested. Rh. glutinis did not grow on media containing gentamicin whereas R. stolonifer produced very restricted or no growth on these media. All bacterial isolates from fresh produce, P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and P. fluorescens (ATCC BAA-477) grew well at 100, 125 and 150 mg chloramphenicol/liter medium, but they did not grow on media containing chlortetracycline (100, 125, or 150 mg/L) or gentamicin (15, 25, or 35 mg/L). P. aeruginosa (ATCC 10145) grew well on media containing chloramphenicol or gentamicin, but not in the presence of chlortetracycline. P. carotovorum, E. coli, B. cereus and Staphylococcus spp. did not grow on any of the selective media tested.
