TI  == lack of correlation between in vitro antibiosis and in vivo protection against enteropathogenic bacteria by probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == increased resistance to infection is one of the beneficial effects attributed to  probiotic microorganisms. this effect may be due to several mechanisms: production of inhibitory substances, blocking of adhesion sites on the intestinal surface, competition for nutrients and stimulation of mucosal and systemic immunity. the present study aimed to investigate the correlation between in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of probiotic lactobacilli. the agar spot test  was used to show that twenty lactobacillus strains were able to inhibit the enteropathogenic bacterium yersinia enterocolitica. this inhibition was mainly attributable to a decrease in ph resulting from dextrose fermentation by lactobacilli. the inhibition of y. enterocolitica, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes by two probiotic strains, lactobacillus casei c1 and lactobacillus plantarum c4, was also associated with the ph decrease. however, both strains lacked protective effects in mouse experimental infection models, with the exception of long-lasting pre-treatment with l. plantarum c4, which exerted a partial protective effect against s. typhimurium that was attributable to an immunostimulatory mechanism. our results show that in vitro antibiosis tests do not provide useful information on the probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains.

TI  == mitogenic response and probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from indigenously pickled vegetables and fermented beverages.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria from indigenous pickled vegetables and fermented beverages (fermented rice and madhuca longifolia flowers) were isolated and investigated for their functional characteristics in vitro as potential new probiotic strains. four isolates (all lactobacillus spp.) selected on the basis of high tolerance to bile (0.2%) were identified by standard and molecular methods (16s rdna) as l. helveticus, l. casei, l. delbrueckii and l. bulgaricus from pickled vegetables and fermented beverages respectively. these selected strains had antibiotic resistance, tolerance to artificial gastric juice and phenol (0.4%), enzymatic profile, and antagonistic activity against enteric pathogens (enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri 2a, listeria monocytogenes,  yersinia enterocolitica and aeromonas hydrophila). all strains survived well in artificial gastric juice at low ph (3.0) values for 4 h, possessed bile salt hydrolase activity and were susceptible to most antibiotics including vancomycin. additionally, the isolates exhibited high tolerance to phenol, high cell surface  hydrophobicity (>60%) and induced proliferation of murine splenocytes. all the four strains of present study suppressed the con a-stimulated proliferation of the mouse spleen cells, although l. casei had the strongest suppressive effect. the results of this study suggest a potential application of the strains (following human clinical trials), for developing probiotic foods.

TI  == mononuclear cell response to enterobacteria and gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.
AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.

TI  == effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme q10, and l-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin a, aflatoxin b1, and fumonisin  b1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. the strains used in this study included escherichia coli (ft 101), streptococcus agalactiae (ft 311, ft 313, ft 315), staphylococcus aureus (ft 192), yersinia enterocolitica (ft 430), salmonella infantis (ft 431), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ft 432), lactobacillus plantarum (ft234) and lactobacillus casei (ft 232). tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. a combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. it was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. the objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the  toxic effects of the mycotoxins. the data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by t-2 toxin, aflatoxin b1 and ochratoxin a and that  this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme q10 plus l-carnitine.

TI  == [effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  == bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains,  the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, streptococcus sanguis, s. saprophyticus, s. faecalis, escherichia coli, micrococcus flavus, actinomyces viscosus, veillonella sp., enterobacter liquefaciens, yersinia enterocolitica. lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. proteus vulgaris, y. enterocolitica and chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. the yeasts endomyces lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, rhodotorula mucilaginosa and cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. the kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did  not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
