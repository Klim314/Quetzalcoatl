TI  == microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development in the absence of oral hygiene in periodontal health and disease.
AB  == aim: to monitor microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development. materials  and methods: supra- and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28  teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects at baseline and immediately after tooth cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants during 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. species counts were averaged within subjects at each time point. significant differences in the counts between healthy and periodontitis subjects were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: the total supra- and subgingival counts were significantly higher in periodontitis on entry and reached or exceeded the baseline values after day 2. supragingival counts of veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and neisseria mucosa increased from 2 to 7 days. subgingival counts were greater  for actinomyces, green and orange complex species. significant differences between groups in supragingival counts occurred for 17 of 41 species at entry, 0  at day 7; for subgingival plaque, these values were 39/41 taxa at entry, 17/41 at day 7. conclusions: supragingival plaque re-development was similar in periodontitis and health, but subgingival species recolonization was more marked  in periodontitis.

TI  == positive and negative bacterial associations involving dialister pneumosintes in  primary endodontic infections.
AB  == dialister pneumosintes is an anaerobic gram-negative rod that has been recently implicated as a candidate endodontic pathogen. in this study, samples taken from  abscessed teeth and infected root canals associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic periradicular lesions were examined for the occurrence of bacterial associations involving d. pneumosintes. dna was extracted from the samples, and the presence of d. pneumosintes and 16 other bacterial species was determined by  means of species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. positive and negative associations involving d. pneumosintes were investigated by computing the odds ratio of d. pneumosintes being found in a sample from endodontic infection in co-infection with one of the other target species. the association between the pairs containing d. pneumosintes and the occurrence of pain also was evaluated. d. pneumosintes was always detected in mixed infections with at least two of the  other target species. d. pneumosintes was positively associated with treponema denticola, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. pectinovorum, and t. vincentii. negative associations were observed with bacteroides forsythus, p. gingivalis, and actinomyces israelii. no pair containing d. pneumosintes was found to be significantly associated with symptomatic cases (p > 0.01). the findings of this study lend considerable support to the notion of d. pneumosintes being an important endodontic pathogen,  usually in a mixed infection. positive associations of this species with other highly prevalent species, such as t. denticola and p. endodontalis, suggest that  bacterial synergism can occur and thereby play an important role in the pathogenesis of different forms of periradicular lesions.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == intergeneric coaggregation of oral treponema spp. with fusobacterium spp. and intrageneric coaggregation among fusobacterium spp.
AB  == a total of 22 strains of treponema spp. including members of all four named human oral species were tested for coaggregation with 7 strains of oral fusobacteria, 2 strains of nonoral fusobacteria, and 45 strains of other oral bacteria, which included actinobacilli, actinomyces, capnocytophagae, eubacteria, porphyromonads, prevotellae, selenomonads, streptococci, and veillonellae. none of the treponemes coaggregated with any of the latter 45 oral strains or with the two nonoral fusobacteria. all treponemes, eight treponema denticola strains, eight t. socranskii strains, four oral pectinolytic treponemes, one t. pectinovorum strain, and one t. vincentii strain coaggregated with at least one strain of the  fusobacteria tested as partners. the partners consisted of one strain of fusobacterium periodonticum, five f. nucleatum strains including all four subspecies of f. nucleatum, and a strain of f. simiae obtained from the dental plaque of a monkey. in the more than 100 coaggregations observed, the fusobacterial partner was heat inactivated (85 degrees c for 30 min), while the treponemes were unaffected by the heat treatment. furthermore, the fusobacteria were usually inactivated by proteinase k treatment, and the treponemes were not affected. only the t. denticola coaggregations were inhibited by lactose and d-galactosamine. none were inhibited by any of 23 other different sugars or l-arginine. intragenic coaggregations were seen among the subspecies of f. nucleatum and with f. periodonticum, and none were inhibited by any of the sugars tested or by l-arginine. no intrageneric coaggregations were observed among the treponemes. these data indicate that the human oral treponemes show a specificity for oral fusobacteria as coaggregation partners. such cell-to cell contact may facilitate efficient metabolic communication and enhance the proliferation of each cell in the progressively more severe stages of periodontal disease.

TI  == coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == to elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including treponema denticola in vitro. coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. p. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of t. denticola and treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with t. socranskii subspecies buccale, t. socranskii subspecies paredis, treponema vincentii, or treponema pectinovorum. the extracted hemagglutinin from p. gingivalis was active agglutinating t. denticola cells. addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. heat treatment of t. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of p. gingivalis cells eliminated it. growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. strains of t. denticola atcc 35404 and 35405 and t. vincentii inhibited the growth of some p. gingivalis strains, but not others. no strain of  treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. the coaggregation observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.
