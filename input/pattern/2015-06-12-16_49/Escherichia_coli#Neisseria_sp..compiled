TI  - Diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): intra-operative findings and comparison of vaginal and intra-abdominal cultures.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is frequent in adolescents and younger women. Diagnosis is usually based on the clinical findings, and the threshold for empiric antibiotic therapy should be low. However, at least in cases of resistance toward therapy or deterioration of symptoms, laparoscopic evaluation can be helpful. METHODS: We searched the hospital charts for in-house patients who were treated for PID or tubo-ovarian abscess between 2007 and 2010. In cases with both vaginal and intra-abdominal bacterial cultures, results of those were compared. RESULTS: 73 patients with suspected PID or tubo-ovarian abscess were included. Median patients' age was 40 years (18-88), 18 of 73 (24.7 %) patients had an IUD at the time of consultation. 58 patients underwent laparoscopy or laparotomy. In 41 patients (70.7 %) tubo-ovarian abscess could be confirmed, four patients had differential gynecologic diagnoses, and two patients appendicitis. In vaginal swabs, most frequent bacteria were Streptococcus sp. (28.5 %), Escherichia coli (22.2 %), Enterococcus faecalis (15.9 %), and Staphylococcus sp. (9.5 %). In eight patients (11 %) Chlamydia trachomatis could be found, there was no case of Neisseria gonorrhea. In 33 patients both vaginal and abdominal cultures were available. In nine cases (27.3 %), identical bacteria could be found, however, 11 cases (33.3 %) showed different results. CONCLUSION: In severe cases of PID, laparoscopic evaluation and taking an intra-abdominal bacterial culture are helpful for the confirmation of diagnosis, accurate microbiologic testing and specific therapy.
TI  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae filamentous phage NgoPhi6 is capable of infecting a variety of Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We constructed a phagemid consisting of the whole genome of the Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacteriophage NgoPhi6 cloned into a pBluescript plasmid derivative lacking the f1 origin of replication (named pBS::Phi6). Escherichia coli cells harboring pBS::Phi6 were able to produce a biologically active phagemid, NgoPhi6fm, capable of infecting, integrating its DNA into the chromosome of, and producing progeny phagemids in, a variety of taxonomically distant Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria sicca, Pseudomonas sp., and Paracoccus methylutens. A derivative of pBS::Phi6 lacking the phage orf7 gene, a positional homolog of filamentous phage proteins that mediate the interaction between the phage and the bacterial pilus, was capable of producing phagemid particles that were able to infect E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, N. sicca, Pseudomonas sp., and Paracoccus methylutens, indicating that NgoPhi6 infects cells of these species using a mechanism that does not involve the Orf7 gene product and that NgoPhi6 initiates infection through a novel process in these species. We further demonstrate that the establishment of the lysogenic state does not require an active phage integrase. Since phagemid particles were capable of infecting diverse hosts, this indicates that NgoPhi6 is the first broad-host-range filamentous bacteriophage described.
TI  - The design of new adjuvants for mucosal immunity to Neisseria meningitidis B in nasally primed neonatal mice for adult immune response.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the value of detoxified Shiga toxins Stx1  and Stx2 (toxoids of Escherichia coli) as mucosal adjuvants in neonatal mice for immunogenicity against the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Neisseria meningitidis B. Mucosal immunization has been shown to be effective for the induction of antigen-specific immune responses in both the systemic and mucosal compartments. Systemic antibody levels (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgM, and IgA) and mucosal IgM and IgA were measured by ELISA using an N. meningitidis as an antigen. In addition, IFN-gamma and IL-6 production were measured after stimulated proliferation of immune cells. Intranasal administration elicited a higher anti-OMP IgA response in both saliva and vaginal fluids. Our results suggest that both Stx1 and Stx2 toxoids are effective mucosal adjuvants for the induction of Ag-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies. The toxoids significantly enhanced the IgG and IgM response against OMPs with a potency equivalent to CT, with the response being characterized by both IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes, and increased IFN-gamma production. Additionally, bactericidal activity was induced with IgG and IgM antibodies of high avidity. These results support the use of the new toxoids as potent inducing adjuvants that are particularly suitable for mucosal immunization.
TI  - Quantification of polyphenols during retting and characterization of bacteria from the Kadinamkulam Backwaters, Kerala.
AB  - The retting environment which provides a competitive niche for specialized microbes is speculated to harbour a variety of microbes with high biodegradation potential. In this context, an effort has been made to isolate and identify bacterial species having high tolerance to phenol In vitro. Maximum polyphenol (1.897 mg l(-1)) as observed during the initial period of retting, which decreased as retting proceeded. Based on biochemical characterization, the isolated bacterial strains were identified as Micrococcus sp., Moraxella sp. strain MP1, Moraxella sp. strain MP2 and Moraxella sp. strain MP3, Pseudomonas sp. strain PP1 and Pseudomonas sp. strain PP2, Amphibacillus sp., Brucella sp. strain BP1 and Brucella sp. strain BP2, Aquaspirillum sp., Escherichia coli strain EP1 and Escherichia coli strain EP2, Campylobacter sp., Aeromonas sp., Neisseria sp., Vibrio sp., Erwinia sp. and Mesophilobacter sp. These strains were found to tolerate maximum concentration of phenol viz. 200 to 1000 mg l(-1). Plasmid analysis of phenol resistant bacterial isolates showed that almost all the cultures had at least one plasmid of size > 1Kb. Studies on the protein profile of isolated bacterial cultures showed the presence of proteins with molecular sizes ranging from 10 to 85 KDa with exception of Mesophilobacter and Neisseria having still high molecular weight protein (95 KDa). Bacterial strains isolated from coir-ret-liquor showed tolerance to high phenol concentration.
TI  - Efficient synthesis of 6'-sialyllactose, 6,6'-disialyllactose, and 6'-KDO-lactose by metabolically engineered E. coli expressing a multifunctional sialyltransferase from the Photobacterium sp. JT-ISH-224.
AB  - We have previously reported the efficient conversion of lactose into 3'-sialyllactose by high cell density cultures of a genetically engineered Escherichia coli strain expressing the Neisseria meningitidis gene for alpha-(2-->3)-sialyltransferase [Fierfort, N.; Samain, E. J. Biotechnol. 2008, 134, 261-265.]. First attempts to use a similar strategy to produce 6'-sialyllactose with a strain expressing alpha-(2-->6)-sialyltransferase from the Photobacterium sp. JT-ISH-224 led to the production of a trisaccharide that was identified as KDO-lactose (2-keto-3-deoxy-manno-octonyllactose). This result showed that alpha-(2-->6)-sialyltransferase was able to use CMP-KDO as sugar donor and preferentially used CMP-KDO over CMP-Neu5Ac. By reducing the expression level of the sialyltransferase gene and increasing that of the neuABC genes, we have been able to favour the formation of 6'-sialyllactose and to prevent the formation of KDO-lactose. However, in this case, a third lactose derivative, which was identified as 6,6'-disialyllactose, was also produced. Formation of 6,6'-disialyllactose was mainly observed under conditions of lactose shortage. On the other hand, when the culture was continuously fed with an excess of lactose, 6'-sialyllactose was almost the only product detected and its final concentration was higher than 30g/L of culture medium.
TI  - Regulation of constitutive and microbial pathogen-induced human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) gene expression.
AB  - The cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an important regulator of innate immunity, inflammation and oncogenesis. However, four decades after its identification, the molecular mechanism(s) regulating the expression of the MIF gene remain largely unknown. Analyses of human monocytic (THP-1), epithelial (HeLa and A549) and keratinocytic (HaCat) cells transfected with wild-type, truncated and mutated MIF promoter reporter constructs, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and siRNA inhibition indicated that the transcription factors specificity protein (Sp)1 and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) are critical positive regulators of constitutive human MIF gene expression. Albeit located in a cytosine guanine dinucleotide island, the MIF gene was found to be hypomethylated, an observation consistent with high baseline transcriptional activity. Moreover, stimulation of THP-1 cells and of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with microbial products up-regulated phosphorylated Sp1 nuclear content, Sp1 DNA-binding activity, MIF promoter activity and MIF mRNA levels in a MEK1/2-, Sp1-dependent manner. Taken together with previous observations of an important role for MIF in pro-inflammatory macrophage responses, these present findings suggest a key role for Sp1 and CREB in transcriptional regulation of MIF gene expression and MIF-dependent host antimicrobial innate immune defense.
TI  - Aldolase-catalyzed synthesis of beta-D-galp-(1-->9)-D-KDN: a novel acceptor for sialyltransferases.
AB  - [reaction: see text] beta-D-Galp-(1-->9)-D-KDN, a disaccharide component of the cell wall of Streptomyces sp. MB-8, was synthesized from beta-D-Galp-(1-->6)-D-Manp and pyruvate using a sialic acid aldolase. The obtained KDN-containing compound was a novel acceptor for bacterial sialyltransferases. Unusual alpha2,3- and alpha2,6-linked sialyltrisaccharides and a tetrasaccharide were synthesized using a one-pot two-enzyme system containing a Neisseria meningitidis CMP-sialic acid synthetase and a Pasteurella multocida sialyltransferase or a Photobacterium damsela alpha2,6-sialyltransferase.
TI  - Bacterial profile and clinical outcome of childhood meningitis in rural Yemen: a  2-year hospital-based study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) is an important cause of death and long-term neurological disability in Yemen, the only low income-high mortality country in the Arabian Peninsula. The objective of this study was to document the microbial characteristics, the antibacterial sensitivity pattern, and the outcome for children hospitalized with ABM, prior to the introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine in Yemen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was retrospective, conducted at a rural district hospital, serving the rural population of the northern parts of Yemen. All patients aged 1 month-15 years admitted between May 1999 and June 2001, with clinical evidence of meningitis and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultured, were included in the study. Clinical information from case notes, including CSF result and the outcome on discharge, were obtained. Analysis of extracted data was performed using Epi Info software. RESULTS: During the 2-year study period, 160 study patients met the inclusion criteria, and 7 (4.4%) were negative for bacterial growth. In the 153 positive cultures there were 46 (30.1%) Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), 23 (15%) H. influenzae (HI), 81 (52.9) Neisseria meningitidis (NM), 2 (1.3%) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and 1 (0.7%) Escherichia coli. Sixteen study patients died (overall case fatality rate (CFR) 10%), 7 aged under 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 3 more than 60 months. Ten deaths were due to SP meningitis, 2 HI meningitis, 3 NM meningitis, and 1 had S. aureus. Of the 144 survivors, 28 (19.4%) developed permanent neurological complications, 17 aged less than 12 months, 6 aged 12-60 months, and 5 more than 60 months. SP meningitis accounted for 57.1% (16/28), and 6 (21.4%) had HI meningitis. Among the 89 aged 1-60 months, 13 died (CFR 14.6%), and 23 (30.3%) of the 76 survivors developed permanent complications. Of those tested 20% and 35% of the 20 HI tested isolates and 9.5% and 14.3% of the 42 SP isolates, were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin G, respectively, and the majority of the 81 NM isolates were sensitive to both. The 3 pathogens were largely resistant to gentamicin, and almost all were susceptible to chloramphenicol and cefotaxime. CONCLUSION: In contrast to the studies from the low-mortality countries of the region, our study showed that the predominant pathogens of childhood ABM were SP and NM. SP meningitis was associated with increased mortality and permanent disability.
TI  - Detection and characterization of beta-lactamase genes in subgingival bacteria from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  - Fifty-three beta-lactamase-producing strains of oral bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontitis in Norway and USA were screened for the presence of the bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(OXA), bla(ampC), bla(cfxA), and bla(cepA/cblA) genes by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were characterized by direct sequencing of the amplified DNA. Thirty-four of the 53 enzyme-producing strains (64%) were positive in one of the PCR assays. All beta-lactamase-producing Prevotella and Capnocytophaga spp. were CfxA positive. TEM-type beta-lactamases were identified in one strain each of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sp., and one strain of Citrobacter freundii possessed an AmpC-type beta-lactamase. Screening for gene cassettes and genes known to be associated with integrons did not reveal the presence of integrons in these oral bacteria. Sequence analyses showed that most CfxA positive Prevotella and Capnocytophaga isolates from patients with refractory periodontitis harboured variants of the CfxA2 and CfxA3 enzyme. The present study also showed that many different genetic determinants of beta-lactamase production are found in bacteria isolated from refractory periodontitis, many of which remain to be characterized.
TI  - [Epidemiologic surveillance for bacterial meningitis in 140 000 children under 5  years of age in Nanning district, Guangxi province].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the incidence, epidemiologic features, etiologic agents and sequelae of bacterial meningitis in children under 5 years of age in Nanning, Guangxi. METHODS: A population-based surveillance was conducted to evaluate children with signs and symptoms of meningitis. All hospitals, township health centers and village clinics in the surveillance area were structured to participate in the case referral and evaluation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood specimens were obtained and processed using standardized microbiologic methods. RESULTS: During the 26-month surveillance period, among the children under 5 years old, a total of 1272 cases who met the screening criteria of meningitis were studied. 265 of 1272 cases were identified as clinically diagnosed meningitis, with an incidence rate of 86.36 per 100 000 population. The annual incidence rate under the 38 cases of confirmed bacterial meningitis appeared to be 12.38/100 000. Staphylococcus species accounted for the largest proportion of laboratory-confirmed bacterial meningitis, followed by E. coli and S. pneumoniae. The highest attack rate occurred in neonates < 1 month, followed by children aged 1 - 12 months in the confirmed patients. Meningitis caused by Sp and Hi mainly occurred in children aged 1 - 12 months. All cases of meningitis due to Hi and Sp were children aged 1 - 24 months. 13.16% and 0.00% of the cases survived with complications and sequelae, and the case-fatality rate was 18.42%. 40 bacterial isolates were identified from 1193 blood cultures and 23 from 1211 cerebrospinal fluid samples, but no Neisseria meningitidis was found. CONCLUSION: Meningitis due to Hi was first confirmed in Guangxi with the incidence of 0.98 per 100 000 population. The annual incidence rate of confirmed bacterial meningitis was 12.38 per 100 000, which was considered an important public health problem in children. Staphylococci was the predominant pathogen in confirmed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Antibiotics GE23077, novel inhibitors of bacterial RNA polymerase. I. Taxonomy, isolation and characterization.
AB  - GE 23077 factors A1, A2, B1 and B2 are novel antibiotics isolated from fermentation broths of an Actinomadura sp. strain. GE23077 antibiotics are cyclic peptides, which inhibit Escherichia coli RNA polymerase at nM concentrations. Both rifampicin-sensitive and rifampicin-resistant polymerases are inhibited, whereas E. coli DNA polymerase and wheat germ RNA polymerase are substantially not affected. In spite of the potent activity on the enzyme, the antibiotics generally show poor activity against whole cell bacteria. The spectrum of activity is restricted to Moraxella catarrhalis, including clinical isolates, with partial activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycobacterium smegmatis.
TI  - The Haemophilus influenzae Hia autotransporter contains an unusually short trimeric translocator domain.
AB  - Gram-negative bacterial autotransporter proteins are a growing group of virulence factors that are characterized by their ability to cross the outer membrane without the help of accessory proteins. A conserved C-terminal beta-domain is critical for targeting of autotransporters to the outer membrane and for translocation of the N-terminal "passenger" domain to the bacterial surface. We have demonstrated previously that the Haemophilus influenzae Hia adhesin belongs to the autotransporter family, with translocator activity residing in the C-terminal 319 residues. To gain further insight into the mechanism of autotransporter protein translocation, we performed a structure-function analysis on Hia. In initial experiments, we generated a series of in-frame deletions and a set of chimeric proteins containing varying regions of the Hia C terminus fused to a heterologous passenger domain and discovered that the final 76 residues of Hia are both necessary and sufficient for translocation. Analysis by flow cytometry revealed that the region N-terminal to this shortened translocator domain is surface localized, further suggesting that this region is not involved in beta-barrel formation or in translocation of the passenger domain. Western analysis demonstrated that the translocation-competent regions of the C terminus migrated at masses consistent with trimers, suggesting that the Hia C terminus oligomerizes. Furthermore, fusion proteins containing a heterologous passenger domain demonstrated that similarly small C-terminal regions of Yersinia sp. YadA and Neisseria meningitidis NhhA are translocation-competent. These data provide experimental support for a unique subclass of autotransporters characterized by a short trimeric translocator domain.
TI  - [Overwhelming postsplenectomy infection].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Splenectomy performed at any age and for any reason increases the risk for death due to overwhelming infection. AIM: To evaluate definition, etiology, incidence, risk factors and prophylaxis of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, as well as the methods related to splenic tissue preservation when total splenectomy is necessary. METHOD: Bibliographic review. RESULTS: The etiological agents more frequently found are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza and type B, and Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria like Escherichia coli, Streptococcus b-hemolytic, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas sp represent a significant risk as well. In addition, a great variety of agents including other enteric Gram-negative microorganisms and non-bacteria pathogens can also be sporadically identified. The prophylaxis is based on three main aspects: patient's education, immune prophylaxis and chemical prophylaxis. However these are not enough to prevent the higher risk of developing sepsis. When total splenectomy is unavoidable, heterotopic splenic autotransplantation seems to be the only alternative for splenic tissue preservation. According to clinical and experimental studies, the splenic autotransplanted tissue present a similar structure to a normal spleen and preserve the splenic immune function. CONCLUSIONS: The high risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection, reduced the indication for total splenectomy, in trauma and several diseases. Prophylactic methods have been developed to minimize the effects of the sepsis. Several researches have been done to determine the immunocompetence of autogenous splenic grafts in response to bacteria invasion.
TI  - Etiology of persistent tubo-ovarian abscess in Nairobi, Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the microbial etiology of tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). METHODS: We recruited 11 women in Nairobi, Kenya who failed antibiotic therapy alone and required surgical drainage of a presumptive TOA. Pus from the nine abscesses and two pyosalpinges were collected and cultured for aerobic, facultative and anaerobic microorganisms. RESULTS: Eleven women suspected of having a TOA were hospitalized and treated for a median of 6 days (range 3-14 days) prior to surgical drainage of the abscess. Nine (82%) specimens were culture positive. Aerobes were present in all nine specimens. Seven of the nine positive cultures (78%) were polymicrobial and five of the polymicrobial cultures contained both anaerobes and aerobes. Anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli (Prevotella sp., Porphyromonas sp. and Bacteroides sp., Escherichia coli) and Streptococcus sp. (S. viridans and S. agalactiae) were the most common microorganisms isolated. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis were not isolated by culture or detected by polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSIONS: In Kenya, persistent TOAs are associated with endogenous flora similar to that normally found in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - The integration site of the iga gene in commensal Neisseria sp.
AB  - An IgA1 protease is produced by the human pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, Neisseria species. In this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the N. gonorrhoeae strain MS11 and compared to corresponding loci in N. meningitidis and commensal Neisseria species. In N. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpB and ksgA were found immediately downstream of iga. In addition to comL and comA, a homolog of the Escherichia coli YFII gene was identified upstream of iga. Each gene in the iga region (YFII and comL, comA and iga, and trpB and ksgA) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. The comL/ comA and iga/ trpB pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. These terminators contain the common gonococcal DNA uptake sequence (DUS). A highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in N. gonorrhoeae was also found in N. meningitidis. In Southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal DNAs of the commensal species N. mucosa, N. lactamica, N. flavescens, N. cinerea, N. subflava, N. flava, N. sicca or N. elongata. When N. gonorrhoeae comL and trpB were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. This indicated that commensal Neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between comA and trpB. The region between comA and trpB was therefore amplified by PCR. The fragment obtained from N. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal comA and trpB, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology to any known gonococcal sequence. Our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. N. lactamica, which is more closely related to N. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.
TI  - P1 Trisaccharide (Galalpha1,4Galbeta1,4GlcNAc) synthesis by enzyme glycosylation  reactions using recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - The frequency of Escherichia coli infection has lead to concerns over pathogenic  bacteria in our food supply and a demand for therapeutics. Glycolipids on gut cells serve as receptors for the Shiga-like toxin produced by E. coli. Oligosaccharide moiety analogues of these glycolipids can compete with receptors for the toxin, thus acting as antibacterials. An enzymatic synthesis of the P1 trisaccharide (Galalpha1,4Galbeta1,4GlcNAc), one of the oligosaccharide analogues, was assessed in this study. In the proposed synthetic pathway, UDP-glucose was generated from sucrose with an Anabaena sp. sucrose synthase and then converted with an E. coli UDP-glucose 4-epimerase to UDP-galactose. Two molecules of galactose were linked to N-acetylglucosamine subsequently with a Helicobacter pylori beta-l,4-galactosyltransferase and a Neisseria meningitidis alpha-1,4-galactosyltransferase to produce one molecule of P1 trisaccharide. The four enzymes were coexpressed in a single genetically engineered E. coli strain that was then permeabilized and used to catalyze the enzymatic reaction. P1 trisaccharide was accumulated up to 50 mM (5.4 g in a 200-ml reaction volume), with a 67% yield based on the consumption of N-acetylglucosamine. This study provides an efficient approach for the preparative-scale synthesis of P1 trisaccharide with recombinant bacteria.
TI  - The activity of p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus ducreyi, and other microorganisms.
AB  - p-Methoxybenzylisothiocyanate was isolated from Lepidium bonariense and found to  be responsible for the plants antimicrobial and STD activity. MIC determinations were conducted for p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate on Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrheae, Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Psuedomanas aeruginosa. An in vitro cellular toxicity assay showed that at 100 microM (17,9 microg/mL) p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate is not toxic to living cells.
TI  - Prevalent bacterial species and novel phylotypes in advanced noma lesions.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16S ribosomal DNA bacterial genes from DNA isolated from advanced noma lesions of four Nigerian children were PCR amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into Escherichia coli. Partial 16S rRNA sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. Nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. A total of 67 bacterial species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. Nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. Other known species that were detected included Achromobacter spp., Afipia spp., Brevundimonas diminuta, Capnocytophaga spp., Cardiobacterium sp., Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium spp., Gemella haemoylsans, and Neisseria spp. Phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera Eubacterium, Flavobacterium, Kocuria, Microbacterium, and Porphyromonas and the related Streptococcus salivarius and genera Sphingomonas and TREPONEMA: Since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. Several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and Fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. However, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.
TI  - Comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppGpp synthetases/hydrolases (the Rel, RelA and SpoT proteins).
AB  - In the gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppGpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, RelA and SpoT, whereas in the gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis only one enzyme named Rel is responsible for this activity. Rel and SpoT also possess (p)ppGpp hydrolase activity. BLAST searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. The construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. Four groups could be distinguished: With the exception of Neisseria and Bordetella (beta subdivision), the RelA and SpoT groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. Two Rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the Bacillus/Clostridium group were also identified. The SpoT proteins are related to the gram positive Rel proteins. RelA proteins carry substitutions in the HD domain (Aravind and Koonin, 1998, TIBS 23: 469-472) responsible for ppGpp degradation. A theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous relA and spoT genes is presented: After gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spoT and relA genes evolved from the duplicated genes. The distribution pattern of the paralogous RelA and SpoT proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (Gupta, 2000, FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 24: 367-402). This model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. However, two paralogous, closely related genes of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the RelA and SpoT proteins do not fit in this model. Completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia species, Rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont Buchnera sp. APS as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes but they are present in the Arabidopsis genome. In crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppGpp as crosslinking reagents and RNA polymerase preparations of Escherichia coli, binding of ppGpp to distinct regions at the C-terminus of the beta subunit (the RpoB gene product) and/or at the N-terminus of the beta subunit (the RpoC gene product) was observed previously. RpoB and RpoC sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppGpp binding regions.
TI  - Production and characterization of a new monoclonal antibody against Neisseria meningitidis: study of the cross-reactivity with different bacterial genera.
AB  - We have generated a hybridoma cell line which produces an 8C7Br1 clone of the IgM antibody isotype. It recognizes the 50-, 65-, and 60-kDa antigens and is reactive with strains of N. meningitidis in the 98% of local Neisseria genera by Dot-ELISA assays. Two percent of the strains of N. meningitidis B do not present reactivity with the 8C7Br1 monoclonal antibody (MAb). The antibody reacted against N. meningitidis of serogroups A, B, C, X, Y, Z, and different serotypes and subtypes of N. meningitidis B and C by means of Dot-ELISA and Immunoblot. It cross-reacted with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria lactamica, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Bordetella pertussis, and Bacillus subtilis. The 8C7Br1 MAb reacted with the 65-kDa protein present in the prototype meningococcal strains B:16:B6(B2a:P1.5.2) and 2996 (B2b:P1.5.2). In H. influenzae type b, E. coli and B. subtilis, the MAb recognized the protein of 60, 65, and 70 kDa, respectively. FACS analysis showed that 8C7Brl MAb could recognize the 50-kDa protein on the surface of N. meningitidis homologous (B:4:P1.9) strain. These results, together with the bactericidal activity of 8C7Br1, and an experiment of passive protection in mice, demonstrated the potential importance of the cross-reactive protein as a candidate antigen for N. meningitidis B vaccine composition.
TI  - Gonococcal nitric oxide reductase is encoded by a single gene, norB, which is required for anaerobic growth and is induced by nitric oxide.
AB  - The gene encoding a nitric oxide reductase has been identified in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The norB gene product shares significant identity with the nitric oxide reductases in Ralstonia eutropha and Synechocystis sp. and, like those organisms, the gonococcus lacks a norC homolog. The gonococcal norB gene was found to be required for anaerobic growth, but the absence of norB did not dramatically decrease anaerobic survival. In a wild-type background, induction of norB expression was seen anaerobically in the presence of nitrite but not anaerobically without nitrite or aerobically. norB expression is not regulated by FNR or NarP, but a functional aniA gene (which encodes an anaerobically induced outer membrane nitrite reductase) is necessary for expression. When aniA is constitutively expressed, norB expression can be induced both anaerobically and aerobically, but only in the presence of nitrite, suggesting that nitric oxide, which is likely to be produced by AniA as a product of nitrite reduction, is the inducing agent. This was confirmed with the use of the nitric oxide donor, spermine-nitric oxide complex, in an aniA null background both anaerobically and aerobically. NorB is important for gonococcal adaptation to an anaerobic environment, a physiologically relevant state during gonococcal infection. The presence of this enzyme, which is induced by nitric oxide, may also have implications in immune evasion and immunomodulation in the human host.
TI  - Gram staining with an automatic machine.
AB  - This study was undertaken to develop a new Gram-staining machine controlled by a  micro-controller and to investigate the quality of slides that were stained in the machine. The machine was designed and produced by the authors. It uses standard 220 V AC. Staining, washing, and drying periods are controlled by a timer built in the micro-controller. A software was made that contains a certain algorithm and time intervals for the staining mode. One-hundred and forty smears were prepared from Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria sp., blood culture, trypticase soy broth, direct pus and sputum smears for comparison studies. Half of the slides in each group were stained with the machine, the other half by hand and then examined by four different microbiologists. Machine-stained slides had a higher clarity and less debris than the hand-stained slides (p < 0.05). In hand-stained slides, some Gram-positive organisms showed poor Gram-positive staining features (p < 0.05). In conclusion, we suggest that Gram staining with the automatic machine increases the staining quality and helps to decrease the work load in a busy diagnostic laboratory.
TI  - Small genes/gene-products in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Forty-two protein spots of observed M(r) 6-15 kDa were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, stained by Coomassie blue and subjected to Edman microsequencing. All of the proteins could be related back to their encoding open reading frames, thereby vindicating the bioinformatic tools currently utilised in their identification. However, only 14/42 gene-products were expressed as annotated. Translation was confirmed for 14 open reading frames with no attributed function (EcoGene Y-entries), while N-terminal sequence allowed the start codon to be accurately annotated for the genes yigF, yccU, yqiC, ynfD, and yeeX. The methionine start codon was cleaved in 11 gene-products (AtpE, Hns, RpoZ, RplL, CspC, YccJ, YggX, YjgF, HimA, InfA, RpsQ) and a further five showed loss of a signal peptide (PspE, HdeB, HdeA, YnfD, YkfE). Internal (Tig, AtpA, TufA) and N-terminal fragmentation (CspD, RpsF, AtcU) of much larger proteins was also detected, which may have resulted from physiological or translational processes. M(r) and pI isoforms were detected respectively for PtsH and GatB, each being phosphoproteins, as well as RplY which manifested differences with respect to predicted M(r) and pI. In addition, YjgF was shown to belong to a small gene family of unknown function with ancient conserved regions across procaryotes and eucaryotes. YgiN was revealed to have a paralogue and orthologues in Bacillus subtilis, Synechocystis sp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria gonorrhoea, and Rhodococcus erythropolis. Orthologues are also reported for YihD, YccU and YeeX. Of the 14 Y-genes, only YkfE possessed no detectable orthologues. These results highlight the need to complement genomic analysis with detailed proteomics in order to gain a better understanding of cellular molecular biology, while the confirmation of the open reading frame start codon using Edman degradation protein microsequencing has yet to be superseded by recent advances in mass spectrometry.
TI  - Type IV pili are involved in plant-microbe and fungus-microbe interactions.
AB  - Adherence of bacteria to eukaryotic cells is essential for the initiation of infection in many animal and human pathogens, e.g. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Adhesion-mediating type IV pili, filamentous surface appendages formed by pilin subunits, are crucial virulence factors. Here, we report that type IV pilus-dependent adhesion is also involved in plant-bacteria and fungus-bacteria interactions. Nitrogen-fixing, endophytic bacteria, Azoarcus sp., can infect the roots of rice and spread systemically into the shoot without causing symptoms of plant disease. Formation of pili on solid media was dependent on the pilAB locus. PilA encodes an unusually short (6.4 kDa) putative pilin precursor showing 100% homology to the conserved N-terminus of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type IV pilin. PilB encodes for a 14.2 kDa polypeptide showing similarity to FimF, a component of type I fimbriae of Escherichia coli. It was found to be extruded beyond the cell surface by immunofluorescence studies, and it may, therefore, be part of a pilus assembly complex or the pilus itself. Both genes are involved in the establishment of bacteria on the root surface of rice seedlings, as detected by fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, both genes are necessary for bacterial adhesion to the mycelium of an ascomycete, which was isolated from the same rhizosphere as the bacteria. In co-culture with the fungus, Azoarcus sp. forms complex intracytoplasmic membranes, diazosomes, which are related to efficient nitrogen fixation. Adhesion to the mycelium appears to be crucial for this process, as diazosomes were absent and nitrogen fixation rates were decreased in pilAB mutants in co-culture.
TI  - Substrate recognition by the leucyl/phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase. Conservation within the enzyme family and localization to the trypsin-resistant domain.
AB  - The leucyl/phenylalanyl-tRNA-protein transferase (L/F-transferase) from Escherichia coli catalyzes a peptidyltransferase reaction that results in the N-terminal aminoacylation of acceptor proteins using Leu-, Phe-, and Met-tRNAs as amino acid donors. We demonstrated that L/F-transferase homologs are widely distributed throughout the eubacteria, supporting our proposal that the enzyme family is ancient and catalyzes early peptide bond synthesis. However, here we present data suggesting that the L/F-transferase is not a homolog of the peptidyltransferase enzymes involved in cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in Gram-positive species, such as Staphylococcus aureus. A sequence comparison of the known L/F-transferase homologs began to identify the essential residues required to catalyze a peptidyltransferase reaction and revealed that <20% of the residues were invariant within the L/F-transferase family. Despite this sequence variation, substrate specificity was broadly conserved, and L/F-transferase homologs from Providencia stuartii, Vibrio cholerae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. all complemented an E. coli aat mutant (lacking L/F-transferase activity) for the degradation of N-end rule substrates. In vitro comparison of the most divergent L/F-transferase homologs, from E. coli and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp., revealed near-complete conservation of both substrate specificity and secondary structure. Finally, we demonstrated that variants of the E. coli L/F-transferase, lacking either 33 or 78 N-terminal residues, retained measurable peptidyltransferase activity and wild type substrate specificity. Overall, our results identified an essential core of an L/F-transferase and revealed that a peptidyltransferase catalyst may be constructed from approximately 120 amino acids.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the gene for amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea: production of a linear alpha-1,4-glucan.
AB  - The gene for the amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea (ATCC 43768) was cloned by use of a functional expression system in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue. The deduced amino acid sequence of the protein has homology to the sequences of the alpha-amylase class of enzymes, with the highest similarities being found to the sequences of the trehalose synthase from Pimelobacter sp. strain R48 (17) and amylomaltase from Thermotoga maritima (11). However, the regions of highest homology within the alpha-amylase class of enzymes, which are essential for the catalytic activity, are only scarcely found in the sequence of amylosucrase. By using the enzyme isolated from culture supernatants of transformed E. coli cells, it is possible to synthesize linear alpha-1,4-glucans from sucrose, indicating that the enzyme is not capable of producing alpha-1,6-glycosidic linkages on its own.
TI  - Cloning and functional analysis of the pmmA gene encoding phosphomannomutase from the photosynthetic prokaryote Prochlorothrix hollandica.
AB  - The pmmA gene encoding a bifunctional phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM) from the photosynthetic prokaryote, Prochlorothrix hollandica has been cloned and sequenced. The gene encodes a 51827 Da polypeptide 48% identical to the PMM of Azospirillum brasilense, 37% identical to the PGMs of pathogenic Neisseria sp. and 37% identical to the bifunctional AlgC PGM/PMM of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The pmmA gene encodes an enzyme having both PGM and PMM activities as judged by both enzyme assays and complementation analysis in which the cloned gene partially corrected the pgm-1 mutation of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Cloning and expression of a gene encoding a bacterial enzyme for decontamination  of organophosphorus nerve agents and nucleotide sequence of the enzyme.
AB  - Organophosphorus acid (OPA) anhydrolase enzymes have been found in a wide variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Interest in these enzymes has been prompted by their ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of toxic organophosphorus cholinesterase-inhibiting compounds, including pesticides and chemical nerve agents. The natural substrates for these enzymes are unknown. The gene (opaA) which encodes an OPA anhydrolase (OPAA-2) was isolated from an Alteromonas sp. strain JD6.5 EcoRI-lambda ZAPII chromosomal library expressed in Escherichia coli and identified by immunodetection with anti-OPAA-2 serum. OPA anhydrolase activity expressed by the immunopositive recombinant clones was demonstrated by using diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) as a substrate. A comparison of the recombinant enzyme with native, purified OPAA-2 showed they had the same apparent molecular mass (60 kDa), antigenic properties, and enzyme activity against DFP and the chemical nerve agents sarin, soman, and O-cyclohexyl methylphosphonofluoridate. The gene expressing this activity was found in a 1.74-kb PstI-HindIII fragment of the original 6.1-kb EcoRI DNA insert. The nucleotide sequence of this PstI-HindIII fragment revealed an open reading frame of 1,551 nucleotides, coding for a protein of 517 amino acid residues. Amino acid sequence comparison of OPAA-2 with the protein database showed that OPAA-2 is similar to a 647-amino-acid sequence produced by an open reading frame which appears to be the E. coli pepQ gene. Further comparison of OPAA-2, the E. coli PepQ protein sequence, E. coli aminopeptidase P, and human prolidase showed regions of different degrees of similarity or functionally conserved amino acid substitutions. These findings, along with preliminary data confirming the presence of prolidase activity expressed by OPAA-2, suggest that the OPAA-2 enzyme may, in nature, be used in peptide metabolism.
TI  - [Bacteremia in 13 general hospitals of the province of Barcelona. Prospective study of 1,674 episodes. Group of Microbiologists of the County Hospitals of Catalonia].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical and microbiological description of bacteremias seen in 13 regional hospitals of Barcelona. METHODS: From January to December of 1991 a multicenter prospective study of bacteremia in regional hospitals was performed. The filiation, clinical findings and microbiological results were registered according to a common protocol. RESULTS: We studied 1674 episodes of bacteremia (13.8 per 1000 admissions). Patients were distributed into 3 groups according to age: under 14: 204 patients, between 14 to 65: 759 and over 65: 711 patients. Men account for 55% and women for 45% of episodes. The bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 24.4% of cases. The most common foci of infection were: urinary tract (32%), respiratory tract (14%), intestinal tract (8%), intravascular catheter (7%), biliary tract (7%) and unknown (10%). The most commonly isolated strains were: Escherichia coli 544 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae 212, Staphylococcus aureus 139, coagulase negative staphylococi 85, Non-typhoid Salmonella 66, Neisseria meningitidis 63, Pseudomonas sp. 59, Enterococcus sp. 59 and Bacteroides sp. 58. Polimicrobial bacteremia was detected in 83 episodes (5%). Related mortality rate was 9.6% (161 patients).
TI  - Production and immunochemical characterization of Neisseria meningitidis group B  antiserum for the diagnosis of purulent meningitis.
AB  - Unlike Neisseria meningitidis groups A, C, Y and W135, the group B capsular polysaccharide has been shown to be chemically and immunologically identical to the capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K1. Both components are sialic acid homopolymers and are poorly immunogenic. Nevertheless, due to the high incidence of Neisseria meningitidis group B meningitis in the population of the State of Sao Paulo, preparing antiserum to this serogroup for diagnostic purposes has become a matter of high priority. Of the many immunization schemes proposed, intravenous inoculation of whole bacteria previously inactivated with formaldehyde and simultaneous intradermal inoculation with a mixture of the bacterial polysaccharide fraction and whole bacteria in complete Freund;s adjuvant have produced the best results. The antiserum was treated with immunoadsorbents prepared with aluminum chloride and protein and/or polysaccharide antigens from each of the following heterologous bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli other than K1, and Staphylococcus aureus, in order to eliminate cross-reactivity. For quality control analysis, the antiserum was assessed by the immunodiffusion, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, dot-ELISA, and immuno-blot techniques against homologous antigens. Specificity was obtained after treating the antiserum with Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide immunosorbent.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the Treponema pallidum tpn50 gene, an ompA homolog.
AB  - Treponema pallidum is a pathogenic spirochete that has no known genetic exchange  mechanisms. In order to identify treponemal genes encoding surface and secreted proteins, we carried out TnphoA mutagenesis of a T. pallidum genomic DNA library in Escherichia coli. Several of the resulting clones expressed enzymatically active T. pallidum-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins. The DNA sequence of the 5' portion of a number of the treponemal genes was obtained and analyzed. A recombinant clone harboring plasmid p4A2 that encoded a treponemal protein with an approximate molecular mass of 50,000 Da was identified. Plasmid p4A2 contained an open reading frame of 1,251 nucleotides that resulted in a predicted protein of 417 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 47,582 Da. We have named this gene tpn50 in accordance with the current nomenclature for T. pallidum genes. A 1.9-kb HincII-ClaI fragment from p4A2 that contained the tpn50 gene was subcloned to produce p4A2HC2. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of TpN50 with protein sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base indicated statistically significant homology to the Pseudomonas sp. OprF, E. coli OmpA, Bordetella avium OmpA, Neisseria meningitidis RmpM, Neisseria gonorrhoeae PIII, Haemophilus influenzae P6, E. coli PAL, and Legionella pneumophila PAL proteins. These proteins are all members of a family of outer membrane proteins that are present in gram-negative bacteria. The tpn50 gene complemented E. coli ompA mutations on the basis of two separate criteria. First, morphometry and electron microscopy data showed that E. coli C386 (ompA lpp) cells harboring plasmid vector pEBH21 were rounded while cells of the same strain harboring p4A2HC2 (TpN50+), pWW2200 (OprF+), or pRD87 (OmpA+) were rod shaped. Second, E. coli BRE51 (MC4100 delta sulA-ompA) cells harboring pEBH21 grew poorly at 42 degrees C in minimal medium, while the growth of BRE51 cells harboring p4A2HC2 was similar to that of the parental MC4100 cells. These results demonstrate that the TpN50 protein is functionally equivalent to the E. coli OmpA protein. If TpN50 functions in a similar fashion in T. pallidum, then it may be localized to the treponemal outer membrane.
TI  - Piperacillin and tazobactam versus clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with pelvic infection. The Piperacillin/tazobactam Study Group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam with that of clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. METHODS: This was a randomized open-label trial in hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. Patients were recruited at 12 hospitals in the United States and two hospitals in Canada and were randomly assigned to one of two regimens in a 2:1 ratio. One group received piperacillin, 3 g every 6 hours, and tazobactam, 375 mg every 6 hours; the other group received clindamycin, 900 mg every 8 hours, and gentamicin, 2.5-5.0 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. Therapy with the assigned regimen was to be administered for a minimum of 3 days. Cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the site of infection before initiation of therapy. Cultures for Chlamydia trachomatis were also obtained from patients with endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease. Subjects were evaluated for clinical and bacteriologic response at 24-72 hours and 2-4 weeks after completing therapy. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 196 were in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 103 were in the clindamycin-gentamicin group. The most common diagnoses were endometritis (146) and pelvic inflammatory disease (115). The most common microorganisms recovered included: Peptostreptococcus sp (99), Prevotella sp (87), black pigmented Bacteroides (29), B fragilis (11), enterococci (64), group B streptococcus (26), Escherichia coli (31), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (49), and C trachomatis (19). A favorable clinical response occurred in 84.7% (166 of 196) of piperacillin-tazobactam patients and 87.3% (90 of 103) of clindamycin-gentamicin patients. Among those evaluable for bacteriologic response, 78% (67 of 86) and 82% (23 of 28), respectively, had a favorable response. Diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (9.7 versus 2.9%; P = .04), but the majority of episodes were mild to moderate. None of the adverse experiences in either treatment group were considered life-threatening and drug-related. CONCLUSION: The combination of piperacillin and tazobactam is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic regimen for the treatment of infections of the upper genital tract in women.
TI  - Bacteraemia and meningitis among hospital patients with diarrhoea.
AB  - To characterize bacteraemia and meningitis in diarrhoeal patients, the records of 3395 blood cultures and 120 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures from 6132 patients admitted with diarrhoea to the Clinical Research Centre of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh during 1989 were analysed. Microorganisms were isolated from 12% (417 of 3395) of blood cultures and 9% (11 of 120) of CSF cultures. Children below 5 years of age represented 80% of all patients who had blood cultures and 82% of those who had CSF cultures made. The nutritional status was significantly lower in patients who had positive blood cultures than in those who had negative cultures. 23% (97 of 417) of patients with positive blood cultures and 45% (5 of 11) with positive CSF cultures died. Deaths occurred twice as often among patients who had organisms isolated than among those who had no organisms isolated from blood cultures. The organisms isolated from blood cultures which predicted most deaths were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp., and they were multiresistant. We conclude that bacteraemia and meningitis remain serious complications associated with diarrhoea, especially in malnourished children; the therapeutic problem is further complicated by multiple drug resistance of the isolates.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Direct and indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in mixed infections in children.
AB  - The recent emergence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillins in the therapy of infection caused by these organisms. These include respiratory tract, skin of soft tissue, female genital tract, intra-abdominal, and other miscellaneous infections. The important aerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) include Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Legionella sp. The anaerobic BLPB are all Bacteroidiaceae and include Bacteroides fragilis group, B. melaninogenicus group, B. oralis, B. oris-buccae, and Fusobacterium sp. Laboratory, animal, and clinical studies that support the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms and the distribution of these BLPB in various infections are reviewed. BLPB may not only have a direct pathogenic role in causing the infection, but also an indirect pathogenic role. The indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy, but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. These direct and indirect virulence characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic BLPB require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.
TI  - Results of noncomparative studies of cefotetan in the treatment of obstetric and  gynecologic infections.
AB  - In a multicenter trial involving 11 centers, 160 women were enrolled to evaluate  the safety and effectiveness of 1 or 2 gm of cefotetan administered every 12 hours in the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections. The 133 evaluable patients generally were under 25 years of age, were nonwhite, and had hospital-acquired endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease caused by both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, group D streptococci, Bacteroides sp., and Peptococcus sp. were among the most frequently isolated pathogens. The patients were treated for a mean of 5.6 +/- 1.6 days and received a total dose of 19.27 gm. The signs and symptoms of infection were cleared or improved in 93% of the 133 patients evaluable for clinical response. Of the 116 evaluated bacteriologically, 95% had a satisfactory or presumed satisfactory response; only six patients (5%) were considered to be bacteriologic failures. Differences in the results of several clinical laboratory tests performed before and after treatment were statistically, but not clinically, significant (p less than 0.05). Safety was evaluated in the 158 patients who received cefotetan, and only four (3%) had adverse reactions considered related to the drug. Cefotetan was clearly effective and produced no untoward reactions in these women with obstetric and gynecologic infections caused by both aerobic and anaerobic organisms when administered at 1 or 2 gm every 12 hours.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence comparisons of plasmids pHD131, pJB1, pFA3, and pFA7 and beta-lactamase expression in Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - The sites of initiation for beta-lactamase mRNA transcription and the nucleotide  sequences of beta-lactamase plasmids derived from Haemophilus and Neisseria species were determined. In N. gonorrhoeae, transcription from plasmid pFA3 was initiated from two sites, one located about 20 base pairs (bp) and the other 210 bp upstream of the beta-lactamase initiating codon, whereas in H. influenzae, transcriptional initiation from plasmid pHD131 occurred at two different sites, approximately 150 and 170 bp upstream of the initiating codon. When these plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli, transcription was initiated at the 150- and 170-bp upstream sites in both plasmids. The nucleotide sequences of both plasmids within the noncoding region upstream of the transcriptional initiation site were identical and, except at two or three nucleotide positions, the sequences were also identical to the corresponding region of Tn3. At one of these positions there is a TA for CG substitution, which correlates in E. coli and Haemophilus sp. with the presence of two strong, overlapping beta-lactamase promoters, initiating transcription at the 150- and 170-bp upstream sites. Over a larger (875-bp) segment comprising most of the sequences of the tnpR and bla genes, the nucleotide sequences of both plasmids were also identical, and although this sequence differed from the corresponding Tn3 sequence at 18 sites, it was identical to that of Tn2, except at one site. The sequence of a second Haemophilus plasmid, pJB1, was identical to that of pHD131 in the same region, except at two nucleotides. All three plasmids were identical in nucleotide sequence in other TnA regions, as well as in regions flanking the TnA sequence, except that the Neisseria plasmid lacked a TnA segment of 3,298 bp [comprising the IR(L) and proximal sequences] together with approximately 273 bp of the non-TnA region adjacent to IR(L). The sequence of a second N. gonorrhoeae plasmid, pFA7, was identical to pFA3, except that the terminal, 3,299 TnA nucleotides were missing.
TI  - Ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin in the treatment of soft tissue pelvic infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin were evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. Forty-four patients were enrolled: 22 received the ampicillin/sulbactam regimen, and 22 received the metronidazole-gentamicin combination. There were 33 cases of severe acute pelvic inflammatory disease, two tuboovarian abscesses, five cases of endomyometritis, and two cases of posthysterectomy pelvic cellulitis. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the infection sites yielded 447 microorganisms from 44 patients (an average of 10 bacteria per infection; 6.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). The most frequent isolates were Bacteroides sp., 54; Bacteroides bivius, 17; black-pigmented Bacteroides, 12; Bacteroides disiens, 11; Fusobacterium, 13; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 24; Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, 21; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 34; Gardnerella vaginalis, 29; Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 17; alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 15; and Escherichia coli, five. Clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam and 18 of 21 patients treated with metronidazole-gentamicin. One treatment failure occurred in the ampicillin/sulbactam group in a patient who required antichlamydial therapy and had a complex left adnexal mass consistent with an abscess. The cases of metronidazole-gentamicin failure included two patients initially diagnosed as having tuboovarian abscesses who required a change in antibiotic therapy to control the infections. The third patient had postabortion endomyometritis that did not respond to metronidazole-gentamicin therapy within 48 hours, and required a change of medication. No adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted in either group of patients.
TI  - Escherichia coli K51 and K93 capsular polysaccharides are crossreactive with the  group A capsular polysaccharide of Neisseria meningitidis. Immunochemical, biological, and epidemiological studies.
AB  - Eleven Escherichia coli strains, crossreactive with the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Neisseria meningitidis group A (GrA), were detected among 645 stool isolates from healthy families in Cairo, Egypt. 10 of these strains were of the O107:K93:H27 or O107:K93:SP serotypes and may be considered descendents of a single bacterium or as a clone. The remaining crossreactive strain was of the O7:K51:H18 serotype. None of the 11 strains produced enterotoxins and none were enteroinvasive. The purified CPS of these E. coli strains, as well as a polysaccharide (PS) from B. pumilis, strain Sh17, precipitated with equine GrA (H49) antiserum. A partial identity between the E. coli K93, K51 and Sh17 PS on the one hand and the GrA CPS on the other was observed by double immunodiffusion when reacted against the H49 antiserum. Four K93 strains and one K51 strain were found among 320 E. coli strains from patients at the Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, and three K93 strains were found in 105 stool samples from children in Copenhagen. The data from these three surveys suggest that these crossreactive E. coli are common organisms and could serve as a stimulus for "natural" GrA CPS antibodies. Quantitative precipitation analysis showed that K51, K93, and Sh17 PS precipitated 25, 46.8, and 50% of H49 antibodies, respectively. Absorption of H49 antiserum with the GrA CPS removed its precipitating activity with the E. coli K93, K51, and Sh17 PS. Absorption of H49 antiserum with either K51 CPS or Sh17 PS removed the homologous crossreactivity only, whereas K93 CPS absorbed both K93 and K51 reactivities. Antibodies, raised by intravenous injection of formalinized E. coli K93 or K51 cells into rabbits, precipitated with GrA CPS and were bactericidal against GrA meningococci. The crossreaction between the E. coli K93 and the GrA CPS was unexpected since these two CPS are compositionally so dissimilar.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. Its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. Although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher MIC values, and most Bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. The overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. Ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. The activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid pH and in urine, but serum had no effect on MICs or MBCs. Increase in ofloxacin MICs for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.
TI  - Moxalactam versus clindamycin plus tobramycin in the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy of moxalactam versus clindamycin/tobramycin was evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. Sixty patients were treated: 30 with moxalactam and 30 with clindamycin/tobramycin. There were 15 cases of tuboovarian abscess, 36 cases of severe pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, eight cases of endomyometritis, and one wound abscess. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the sites of infection yielded 441 microorganisms from 53 patients; an average of 8.3 bacteria per infection (4.5 anaerobes and 3.8 aerobes). The infections tended to be mixed aerobic-anaerobic with anaerobes isolated in 90% of cases. The most frequently isolated possible pathogens were Bacteroides sp. (37), Bacteroides bivius (23), Bacteroides asaccharolyticus (12), Peptococcus asaccharolyticus (29), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (19), unidentified anaerobic gram-positive cocci (18), Escherichia coli (17), nonhemolytic streptococci (16), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (13), and Gardnerella vaginalis (38). Clinical cure was noted in 29 of 30 moxalactam-treated and 29 of 30 clindamycin/tobramycin-treated patients. Moxalactam was effective in five of six cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 22 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, the one case of endomyometritis and the one wound abscess. Clindamycin/tobramycin was effective in eight of nine cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 14 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, and all seven cases of endomyometritis. No adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted with either regimen.
TI  - Spenolimycin, a new spectinomycin-type antibiotic. III. Biological properties.
AB  - Spenolimycin is a new spectinomycin-type antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces gilvospiralis sp. nov. In vitro, it was active against a wide variety of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was two to four-fold more active against N. gonorrhoeae than spectinomycin. Spenolimycin was effective in the standard mouse protection test against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Trends in the development of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - In many ways it is ironic that the first description of a beta-lactamase occurred in 1940 with an enzyme isolated from Escherichia coli since in recent years there has been a major interest in Gram-negative species and the development of agents to overcome the hydrolytic action of beta-lactamases of Gram-negative species. There have been four distinctly different approaches to the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics. These have been the search for inhibitors of beta-lactamases and agents such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam are examples of compounds which by virtue of Kcat function act as suicide inhibitors and make old antibiotics new. There has been the modification of the penicillin and cephem nucleus to increase beta-lactamase stability or failing that to improve the ability of the compounds to pass through the cell wall and increase affinity for critical beta-lactam receptors, i.e. penicillin-binding proteins. There has been the development of carbapenem type of agents such as imipenem which would have broad activity including aerobic, anaerobic, Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. There has been the discovery of the monobactam agents of which aztreonam is an example of a compound with great beta-lactamase stability but with activity limited to Gram-negative aerobic species. Bacterial resistance has indeed been the major factor that has modified use of beta-lactams and influenced the development of the aforementioned types of drugs. The widespread presence of beta-lactamases in common pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis has made it necessary to have beta-lactamase stable compounds for initial therapy of infection. It is possible to analyze structure-activity relations of beta-lactam compounds to determine changes which will be most advantageous in light of known and expected resistance patterns. But the increased realization in recent years of the importance of the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam drugs has made it essential that the development of new compounds be based on an integration of microbiological and pharmacokinetic parameters. Interest in the prevention of resistant flora has also affected the development of new drugs since it is increasingly appreciated that alteration of intestinal flora contributes to selection of drug resistant microorganisms. Finally, new toxicities or adverse effects associated with the use of certain new agents has modified the development of certain compounds.
TI  - In vitro activity of enoxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of norfloxacin, new beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Enoxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. Its activity against 740 bacterial isolates was determined. It inhibited 90% Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Aeromonas sp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii at less than or equal to 0.8 micrograms/ml. The majority of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited by less than or equal to 3.1 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp. were inhibited by less than 0.1 micrograms/ml. Although most Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml, some streptococcal species had minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6.3 to 12.5 micrograms/ml and Bacteroides sp. had minimal inhibitory concentrations greater than or equal to 25 micrograms/ml. Activity of enoxacin and norfloxacin was similar. Enoxacin inhibited organisms resistant to cefotaxime, moxalactam, gentamicin, and piperacillin. Enoxacin was less active in urine at an acid pH than in broth, but serum did not decrease minimal inhibitory concentrations or minimal bactericidal concentrations. There was no major difference between minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations. Resistance frequency development was less than 10(-9) for most bacterial species.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - Survival of bacteria after freezing of human semen in liquid nitrogen.
AB  - Thirty-four semen samples from fertile men were subjected to bacteriologic evaluation before and after freezing to -196 degrees C using 10% glycerol as the protective medium. Cultures of the fresh portions from all ejaculates examined showed the presence of aerobic bacteria. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium sp., alpha-streptococci, and nonhemolytic streptococci were found so commonly that they were considered commensals. Enterococci, Escherichia coli, S. aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococci group B, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. maltophilia, and P. fluorescens, were also recovered from a few semen samples of these fertile men. Practically all bacteria isolated from the fresh ejaculate were also recovered from the portions frozen in liquid nitrogen.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefoxitin in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - Studies on antimicrobial activity, absorption and excretion and clinical use of cefoxitin in pediatric field were performed. 1. MIC of cefoxitin was compared with that of cefazolin and/or ampicillin for clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (36 strains), Escherichia coli (35 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (34 strains) and Haemophilus influenzae (80 strains). MIC of cefoxitin against S. aureus was approximately 1-2 tubes higher than that of cefazolin. Many strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae that showed high MIC to cefazolin were sensitive to cefoxitin. It is presumed that the results are due to the strong resistance of cefoxitin to beta-lactamase degradation. MIC of cefoxitin against H. influenzae was approximately 1-2 tubes lower than that of cefazolin, but approximately 4 tubes higher than that of ampicillin. 2. Serum level and urinary recovery rate of cefoxitin after one shot i.v. injection of 25 mg/kg were examined. The serum mean levels were 33.8 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 7.0 microgram/ml at 1 hour and 2.9 microgram/ml at 2 hours after the injection, respectively, and the drug was not detected in serum at 4 and 6 hours after the injection. The mean half-life of serum level was 27.1 minutes. The mean urinary recovery rate within 6 hours after injection was 96.0% and most of the drug were excreted into urine within 2 hours after the injection. 3. In order to evaluate clinical response, bacteriological response and side effects, cefoxitin was applied to 19 cases, i.e., 12 cases of either acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of acute pyelitis, 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent arthritis, acute orbital phlegmon and acute buccal abscess. As for clinical response, the overall efficacy rate (the percentage of cases showed excellent and good efficacy) was 88.9%. As for bacteriological response, among the 13 strains which were determined or supposed to be causative organisms, i.e., 6 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of H. influenzae and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, alpha-Streptococcus, Enterococcus, E. coli and Neisseria sp., all strains were disappeared except for Enterococcus which was reduced by the treatment with cefoxitin. No side effect was observed in any case. Abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case each of reduction of RBC and Hb, elevation of GOT and GPT and elevation of GPT, but all of them returned to normal following completion of the dosage term.
TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
TI  - Goiter prevalence and bacterial contamination of water supplies.
AB  - Previous epidemiological studies have shown a significant statistical correlation (P < 0.005 to P < 0.0005) between goiter prevalence and rock types in the watersheds that supply 37 localities in Western Columbia. Bacterial contamination has also been implicated as a cause of endemic goiter. We, therefore, did bacteriological studies to incorporate this variable into the statistical model in 34 of the 37 localities previously surveyed. Samples of the water in the 34 localities were taken at the water source or intake of water supply and at the pipeline system in households and schools. Samples were collected in sterile bottles and cultured on several media for 48 h. The number of bacteria per ml was determined by Quebec's camera and the bacteria (E. coli, Bacillus sp., K. pneumoniae, Proteus sp., and Neisseria sp.) were identified according to conventional methods. Multiple regression analysis and the logistic regression model were used to analyze the data. Only two variables had significant relationships with goiter prevalence: K. pneumoniae in the water source (P < 0.01) is related to a lower prevalence and the overall concentration of bacteria in the pipeline system (P < 0.05) is related to a higher prevalence. Multiple regression analysis to compare the effects of bacteriological variables to those of geological variables indicating rock types showed sedimentary rocks in the watershed associated (P < 0.005) with higher goiter prevalence and an increased concentration of K. pneumoniae in the water source again associated (P < 0.025) with lower goiter prevalence. Bacterial concentration in the pipeline system was of marginal importance (0.05 < P < 0.10). Thus, the presence of sedimentary rocks was the best indicator of disease. A second best indicator was the concentration of K. pneumoniae in the water source. We hypothesize that the lower goiter prevalence associated with K. pneumoniae may be a natural example of biodegradation of the organic contaminants that produce goiter.
TI  - Dihydrofolate reductase from Neisseria sp.
AB  - Members of the genus Neisseria are relatively nonsusceptible to trimethoprim, an  inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. For example, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of trimethoprim for N. gonorrhoeae ranges from 2 to 70 mug/ml, whereas the MIC for Escherichia coli is 0.2 mug/ml or less. In an effort to understand this difference, dihydrofolate reductase was partially purified from five Neisseria species and compared with the enzyme from E. coli. N. gonorrhoeae dihydrofolate reductase was similar to that from E. coli in molecular weight (18,000) and affinity for the substrates reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and dihydrofolate (K(m) = 13 and 8 muM, respectively). However, the gonococcal enzyme had a decreased affinity for trimethoprim, with an apparent K(i) of 45 x 10(-9) M, some 30-fold greater than the E. coli value of 1.2 x 10(-9) M. These enzymes also differed in their isoelectric points and pH activity profiles. Within the genus Neisseria, the dihydrofolate reductase isolated from N. meningitidis and N. lactamica resembled the N. gonorrhoeae enzyme, and only small differences were detected for the N. flavescens and Branhamella catarrhalis dihydrofolate reductases. These data indicate that the relatively poor affinity of trimethoprim for the dihydrofolate reductase from these organisms may be largely responsible for the relative nonsusceptibility of Neisseria sp. to trimethoprim. The contribution of other resistance mechanisms to the overall nonsusceptibility was assessed. Strains of N. gonorrhoeae with altered cell envelope permeability had MIC values less than twofold different from those of isogenic wild-type strains. Also, a direct relationship was observed between the affinity of trimethoprim analogs for gonococcal dihydrofolate reductase and the MIC of these compounds for the gonococcus. These observations suggest that the cell envelope of N. gonorrhoeae is not impermeable to trimethoprim. Changes in the amount of dihydrofolate reductase activity could cause alterations in the susceptibility of the gonococcus to trimethoprim, as demonstrated with N. gonorrhoeae strains selected for trimethoprim resistance after chemical mutagenesis. However, the level of dihydrofolate reductase activity in wild-type N. gonorrhoeae was similar to that of E. coli, indicating that the difference in the susceptibility of these organisms is not due to greater amounts of enzyme in N. gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Quantitative determination of antibody to gonococcal pili. Changes in antibody levels with gonococcal infection.
AB  - Gonococcal pili, pure by the criteria of electron microscopic examination and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, have been prepared by repeated cycles of precipitation with 0.1 M MgCl(2), followed by dissolution in 0.01 M Tris pH 8, 0.01 M NaN(3). Using a fluorescein-conjugated antibody prepared to pili from a single strain, pilar antigen(s) was found to be present in each of 18 strains of gonococci tested, and absent from strains of pilated meningococci, nonpathogenic Neisseria sp., and Escherichia coli. Purified pili, labeled with (125)I were used in an antigen binding assay to quantitatively measure antibody to pili in rabbit sera and in 561 human sera. The range of antibody activity for 133 persons unlikely to have experienced gonorrhea was 0.1-1.6 mug/ml with a geometric mean of 0.5 mug/ml. This geometric mean antibody activity was significantly lower than the geometric mean for asymptomatically infected males (1.0 mug/ml, P < 0.002), males with symptomatic gonococcal anterior urethritis (1.6 mug/ml, P < 0.001), or asymptomatically infected females (4.2 mug/ml, P < 0.001). Antibody appeared in elevated levels (> 1.6 mug/ml) 2-3 wk after infection and returned toward control levels 1 or more months after treatment. Antibody levels higher than 1.6 mug/ml were found in 26 (50%) of 52 males with gonococcal anterior urethritis, in 10 (33%) of 30 males with asymptomatic urethral infection and in 50 (89%) of 56 asymptomatically infected females. In a high-risk group of 103 females for whom culture results and antibody to pili were compared, 58 (57%) had elevated antibody levels to pili and 86% of the infected females were within this seropositive group. The antigen binding assay may provide a means to detect asymptomatic gonococcal infection in women.
TI  - Deoxyribonucleic acid homologies among species of the genus Neisseria.
AB  - Eleven aerobic species of Neisseria, a Mima sp., and a Herellea sp. were tested for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) homology in direct hybridization experiments. DNA labeled with either (14)C or (32)P was prepared from five species of Neisseria. Unlabeled DNA from the various microorganisms was immobilized on membrane filters, which, after pretreatment, were incubated with labeled DNA (4,000 counts per min per filter) for 14 hr at 67 C. The measure of relatedness was expressed as the relative percentage of direct binding compared to that obtained with homologous DNA. All serological types of N. meningitidis, including the newly proposed types, were homologous to the standard strain of N. meningitidis with one possible exception, type Z. The genus Neisseria is heterogeneous in nature, forming at least three distinct groups: first, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae; second, N. perflava, N. subflava, N. sicca, N. flavescens, and N. flava; third, N. catarrhalis and N. caviae. Mima and Herellea species show no significant homology with the Neisseria.
