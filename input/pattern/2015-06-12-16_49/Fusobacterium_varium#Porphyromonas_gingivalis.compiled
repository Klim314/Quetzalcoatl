TI  - Association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) using the colorimetric PerioGard (PTM) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (EOP). In each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (PD >5 mm) randomly chosen in each quadrant. Bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO(2) using selective and nonselective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Clinical measurements as well as AST activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the PTM, were recorded at the same sites. RESULTS: Sixty-two sites exhibited AST positive and 38 AST negative activity. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann Whitney U-test) showed that Streptococcus intermedius, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides forsythus, Camplobacter gracilis, Campylobacter rectus and Selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with AST-positive activity. The odds ratio of having high prevalence of S. intermedius, P. micros, C. concisus, B. forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus and S. sputigena in the presence of a positive AST site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Gemella morbillorum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium varium, Eubacterium lentum and Prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with AST negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of AST positive sites. The logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with AST activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of AST activity. The co-infection of Porphyromonas gingivalis, B. forsythus and P. micros, or P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and C. rectus were found to be significantly associated with the AST activity (p<0.001). AST positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. sputigena or by P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, S. intermedius than AST negative sites (p<0.001). P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, A. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the AST negative sites (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive AST scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. Prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.
TI  - Activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  - The activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. Gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions. Peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii) and Porphyromonas spp. (Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. The MICs of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Clostridium innocuum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Anaerobiospirillum spp., Bacteroides tectum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides gracilis (now Campylobacter gracilis), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella heparinolytica, and the Prevotella oris-buccae group. Fusobacterium naviforme and Fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while Fusobacterium varium strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other Fusobacterium species, such as Fusobacterium ulcerans and Fusobacterium russii, as well as Veillonella spp., the Prevotella melaninogenica group, Prevotella bivia, Clostridium difficile, and Bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (MIC(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).
TI  - In vitro activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. A fastidious facultative anaerobe, Gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. FK037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Clostridium perfringens, Mobiluncus spp., G. vaginalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. The MICs of FK037 for 50 and 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of FK037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. The activity of FK037 against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, and Bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml. Little influence of inoculum size on the activity of FK037 was observed for other isolates tested. Medium pH affected the activity of FK037 against F. varium (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and Bacteroides gracilis (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. FK037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from B. fragilis GAI 0558 and GAI 10150.
TI  - 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequences in Bacteroides and Fusobacterium: evolutionary relationships within these genera and among eubacteria in general.
AB  - The 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequences were determined for Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides capillosus, Bacteroides veroralis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Anaerorhabdus furcosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacterium varium. A dendrogram constructed by a clustering algorithm from these sequences, which were aligned with all other hitherto known eubacterial 5S rRNA sequences, showed differences as well as similarities with respect to results derived from 16S rRNA analyses. In the 5S rRNA dendrogram, Bacteroides clustered together with Cytophaga and Fusobacterium, as in 16S rRNA analyses. Intraphylum relationships deduced from 5S rRNAs suggested that Bacteroides is specifically related to Cytophaga rather than to Fusobacterium, as was suggested by 16S rRNA analyses. Previous taxonomic considerations concerning the genus Bacteroides, based on biochemical and physiological data, were confirmed by the 5S rRNA sequence analysis.
