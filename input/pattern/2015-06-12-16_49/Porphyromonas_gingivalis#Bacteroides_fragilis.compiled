TI  - Essential oils and isolated compounds from Lippia alba leaves and flowers: antimicrobial activity and osteoclast apoptosis.
AB  - In the present study, essential oils extracted from the leaves and flowers of Lippia alba (Mill.) N.E.Br. (L. alba) were analyzed for their antimicrobial activity and their effects on osteoclasts. The periodontal pathogens, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans; ATCC 43717), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum; ATCC 25586) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis); ATCC 33277) were used in antimicrobial activity assays for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), whereas Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis; ATCC 25285) was used as the control microorganism. Osteoclast (OC) apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay and Fas receptor expression was detected by immunocytochemistry. The analysis of antimicrobial activity revealed that P. gingivalis had the lowest MIC values, whereas A. actinomycetemcomitans had the highest. L. alba essential oils were found to be toxic to human cells, although the compounds, carvone, limonene and citral, were non-toxic and induced apoptosis in the OCs. This study demonstrates that L. alba has potential biotechnological application in dentistry. In fact periodontal disease has a multifactorial etiology, and the immune response to microbial challenge leads to osteoclast activation and the resorption of the alveolar bone, resulting in tooth loss.
TI  - Co-evolution of HAD phosphatase and hotdog-fold thioesterase domain function in the menaquinone-pathway fusion proteins BF1314 and PG1653.
AB  - The function of a Bacteroidetes menaquinone biosynthetic pathway fusion protein comprised of an N-terminal haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) family domain and a C-terminal hotdog-fold family domain is described. Whereas the thioesterase domain efficiently catalyzes 1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA hydrolysis, an intermediate step in the menaquinone pathway, the HAD domain is devoid of catalytic activity. In some Bacteroidetes a homologous, catalytically active 1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA thioesterase replaces the fusion protein. Following the gene fusion event, sequence divergence resulted in a HAD domain that functions solely as the oligomerization domain of an otherwise inactive thioesterase domain.
TI  - Discrimination based on Gly and Arg/Ser at position 673 between dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP) 7 and DPP11, widely distributed DPPs in pathogenic and environmental gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, an asaccharolytic gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium, expresses the novel Asp/Glu-specific dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP) 11 (Ohara-Nemoto, Y. et al. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 38115-38127), which has been categorized as a member of the S46/DPP7 family that is preferential for hydrophobic residues at the P1 position. From that finding, 129 gene products constituting five clusters from the phylum Bacteroidetes have been newly annotated to either DPP7 or DPP11, whereas the remaining 135 members, mainly from the largest phylum Proteobacteria, have yet to be assigned. In this study, the substrate specificities of the five clusters and an unassigned group were determined with recombinant DPPs from typical species, i.e., P. gingivalis, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Flavobacterium psychrophilum, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Shewanella putrefaciens. Consequently, clusters 1, 3, and 5 were found to be DPP7 with rather broad substrate specificity, and clusters 2 and 4 were DPP11. An unassigned S. putrefaciens DPP carrying Ser(673) exhibited Asp/Glu-specificity more preferable to Glu, in contrast to the Asp preference of DPP11 with Arg(673) from Bacteroidetes species. Mutagenesis experiments revealed that Arg(673)/Ser(673) were indispensable for the Asp/Glu-specificity of DPP11, and that the broad specificity of DPP7 was mediated by Gly(673). Taken together with the distribution of the two genes, all 264 members of the S46 family could be attributed to either DPP7 or DPP11 by an amino acid at position 673. A more compelling phylogenic tree based on the conserved C-terminal region suggested two gene duplication events in the phylum Bacteroidetes, one causing the development of DPP7 and DPP11 with altered substrate specificities, and the other producing an additional DPP7 in the genus Bacteroides.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of Aloe vera gel on some clinically isolated cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Aloe vera is a medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic and immune-boosting properties. In the present study we investigated the inhibitory activities of Aloe vera gel on some cariogenic (Streptococcus mutans), periodontopathic (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis) and an opportunistic periodontopathogen (Bacteroides fragilis) isolated from patients with dental caries and periodontal diseases. Twenty isolates of each of these bacteria were investigated for their sensitivity to Aloe vera gel using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. S. mutans was the species most sensitive to Aloe vera gel with a MIC of 12.5 microg/ml, while A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and B. fragilis were less sensitive, with a MIC of 25-50 microg/ml (P < 0.01). Based on our present findings it is concluded that Aloe vera gel at optimum concentration could be used as an antiseptic for prevention of dental caries and periodontal diseases.
TI  - Microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from HIV- and HIV+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 HIV- and 20 HIV+ subjects. Pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (MDA). Then, checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. The percentage of DNA probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. Significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the Mann-Whitney test and the Chi-square analysis, respectively. RESULTS: The most prevalent taxa detected were Dialister pneumosintes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sobrinus, Corynebacterium diphteriae, and Helicobacter pylori among HIV- subjects and D. pneumosintes, Prevotella tannerae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella nigrescens, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae among HIV+ individuals. D. pneumosintes, C. diphtheria, and C. albicans were the most abundant species in the HIV- group, whereas the predominant taxa in HIV+ samples were P. tannerae, D. pneumosintes and Olsenella uli. P. tannerae, O. uli, Veilonella dispar, Bacteroides fragilis, and Actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in HIV+ samples. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between HIV- and HIV+ individuals. The root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in HIV+ individuals.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from Viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  - Six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying MIC values ranging from 1 to 10 mug mL-1. The results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.
TI  - The structurally similar, penta-acylated lipopolysaccharides of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides elicit strikingly different innate immune responses.
AB  - Lipid A structural modifications can substantially impact the host's inflammatory response to bacterial LPS. Bacteroides fragilis, an opportunistic pathogen associated with life-threatening sepsis and intra-abdominal abscess formation, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a symbiont pivotal for proper host intestinal tissue development, both produce an immunostimulatory LPS comprised of penta-acylated lipid A. Under defined conditions, Porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral pathogen associated with periodontitis, also produces an LPS bearing a penta-acylated lipid A. However, this LPS preparation is 100-1000 times less potent than Bacteroides LPS in stimulating endothelial cells. We analyzed Bacteroides and P. gingivalis lipid A structures using MALDI-TOF MS and gas chromatography to determine the structural basis for this phenomenon. Even though both Bacteroides and P. gingivalis lipid A molecules are penta-acylated and mono-phosphorylated, subtle differences in mass and fatty acid content could account for the observed difference in LPS potency. This fatty acid heterogeneity is also responsible for the peak "clusters" observed in the mass spectra and obfuscates the correlation between LPS structure and immunostimulatory ability. Further, we show the difference in potency between Bacteroides and P. gingivalis LPS is TLR4-dependent. Altogether, the data suggest subtle changes in lipid A structure may profoundly impact the host's innate immune response.
TI  - Surface components of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Research on Porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontopathogen, has provided a tremendous amount of information over the last 20 years, which may exceed in part than that on other closely related members in terms of phylogenetic as well as proteomic criteria, including Bacteroides fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron as major anaerobic, opportunistic pathogens in the medical field. In this minireview, we focused on recent research findings concerning surface components such as outer membrane proteins and fimbriae, of P. gingivalis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Elucidation of the surface components in P. gingivalis was especially difficult because outer membrane proteins are tightly bound to lipopolysaccharide and they are resistant to dissociation and separation from each other, even during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, unless samples are appropriately heated. In addition, P. gingivalis is asaccharolytic and therefore a potent proteolytic bacterium, another factor causing difficulty in research. The study of the surface components was carefully carried out considering these unique features in P. gingivalis when compared with other gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: Separation of outer membrane proteins, and characterization of OmpA-like proteins and RagAB as major proteins, is described herein. Our recent findings on FimA and Mfa1 fimbriae, two unique appendages in this organism, and on their regulation of expression are also described briefly. CONCLUSION: Surface components of P. gingivalis somehow have contact with host tissues and cells because of the outermost cell elements. Therefore, such bacterial components are potentially important in the occurrence of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Detection of extra-cellular enzymes of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria from clinically diseased and healthy sites.
AB  - Anaerobic gram-negative bacteria (AGNB) produce enzymes that play a significant role in the development of disease. We tested 50 AGNB isolates, 25 each from clinically diseased and healthy human sites for in vitro production of caseinase, collagenase, etc. Majority of the isolates were Bacteroides fragilis and Porphyromonas gingivalis, which more commonly produced collagenase and haemolysin. Comparatively larger number of clinical AGNB produced collagenase (P = 0.004). No such difference was observed with other enzymes. Hence, collagenase is probably one of the key virulence markers of pathogenic AGNB, and the inhibitors targeting collagenases might help in the therapy of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis HmuY and HmuR: further characterization of a novel mechanism of heme utilization.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis HmuY is a putative heme-binding lipoprotein associated with the outer membrane. It is part of an operon together with a gene encoding an outer-membrane hemin utilization receptor (HmuR) and four uncharacterized genes. A similar operon organization was found in Bacteroides fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron, with the former containing an additional HmuY homologue encoded upstream of the hmuR-like gene. In P. gingivalis cultured under heme-limited conditions, a approximately 1-kb hmuY transcript was produced at high levels along with some approximately 3.5 and approximately 9-kb transcripts. Compared with the parental strain, mutants deficient in hmuY or hmuR or hmuY-hmuR gene function grew more slowly and bound lower amounts of hemin and hemoglobin. Significantly, they grew more slowly or were unable to grow when human serum was used as the sole iron/heme source. Analysis of the hmu promoter showed that it is regulated by iron. The HmuY protein normally occurs as a homodimer, but in the presence of hemin it may form tetramers. These results show that HmuY may be the first reported member of a new class of proteins in Porphyromonas and Bacteroides species involved in heme utilization, a function being exerted in conjunction with HmuR, an outer-membrane heme transporter.
TI  - The RprY response regulator of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a Gram-negative oral anaerobe associated with chronic adult periodontitis. Its ecological niche is the gingival crevice, where the organism adapts to the challenges of the infectious process such as host defence and bacterial products. Bacterial responses to environmental changes are partly regulated by two-component signal transduction systems. Several intact systems were annotated in the genome of P. gingivalis, as well as an orphan regulator encoding a homologue of RprY, a response regulator from Bacteroides fragilis. With the goal of defining the environmental cues that activate RprY in P. gingivalis, we used several strategies to identify its regulon. Results from gene expression and DNA-protein binding assays identified target genes that were either involved in transport functions or associated with oxidative stress, and indicated that RprY can act as an activator and a repressor. RprY positively activated the primary sodium pump, NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NQR), and RprY protein also interacted with the promoter regions of nqrA genes from B. fragilis and Vibrio cholerae. Given that gingival bleeding and infiltration of host defence cells are symptoms of periodontal infection, iron products released from blood and reactive oxygen species from polymorphonuclear leucocytes may be potential inducers of the RprY regulon.
TI  - Phylogeny and molecular signatures (conserved proteins and indels) that are specific for the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species constitute two main groups of  the Bacteria that are closely related in phylogenetic trees. The Bacteroidetes species are widely distributed and include many important periodontal pathogens. In contrast, all Chlorobi are anoxygenic obligate photoautotrophs. Very few (or no) biochemical or molecular characteristics are known that are distinctive characteristics of these bacteria, or are commonly shared by them. RESULTS: Systematic blast searches were performed on each open reading frame in the genomes of Porphyromonas gingivalis W83, Bacteroides fragilis YCH46, B. thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482, Gramella forsetii KT0803, Chlorobium luteolum (formerly Pelodictyon luteolum) DSM 273 and Chlorobaculum tepidum (formerly Chlorobium tepidum) TLS to search for proteins that are uniquely present in either all or certain subgroups of Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi. These studies have identified > 600 proteins for which homologues are not found in other organisms. This includes 27 and 51 proteins that are specific for most of the sequenced Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi genomes, respectively; 52 and 38 proteins that are limited to species from the Bacteroidales and Flavobacteriales orders, respectively, and 5 proteins that are common to species from these two orders; 185 proteins that are specific for the Bacteroides genus. Additionally, 6 proteins that are uniquely shared by species from the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla (one of them also present in the Fibrobacteres) have also been identified. This work also describes two large conserved inserts in DNA polymerase III (DnaE) and alanyl-tRNA synthetase that are distinctive characteristics of the Chlorobi species and a 3 aa deletion in ClpB chaperone that is mainly found in various Bacteroidales, Flavobacteriales and Flexebacteraceae, but generally not found in the homologs from other organisms. Phylogenetic analyses of the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi species is also reported based on concatenated sequences for 12 conserved proteins by different methods including the character compatibility (or clique) approach. The placement of Salinibacter ruber with other Bacteroidetes species was not resolved by other phylogenetic methods, but this affiliation was strongly supported by the character compatibility approach. CONCLUSION: The molecular signatures described here provide novel tools for identifying and circumscribing species from the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla as well as some of their main groups in clear terms. These results also provide strong evidence that species from these two phyla (and also possibly Fibrobacteres) are specifically related to each other and they form a single superphylum. Functional studies on these proteins and indels should aid in the discovery of novel biochemical and physiological characteristics that are unique to these groups of bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of subgingival bacteria in the dog and susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the subgingival aerobic and  anaerobic flora of 13 dogs with periodontal disease and the susceptibility of these bacteria to antibiotics currently approved in Italy for treatment of canine infections. Of the anaerobic bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis was most frequently isolated, followed by Peptostreptococcus + Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. Of the aerobic bacteria, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus was most frequently isolated, often associated with Escherichia coli or Pasteurella multocida. Resistance of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria to various antibiotics was generally high. Anaerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and erythromycin; aerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, erythromycin, gentamycin, and sulfa-trimethoprim. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant to all of the antibiotics tested. The emerging worldwide problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics resulting from overuse and misuse of antibiotics is discussed.
TI  - Non-enterobacterial endotoxins stimulate human coronary artery but not venous endothelial cell activation via Toll-like receptor 2.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether non-enterobacterial endotoxins, which are likely  to constitute the majority of the circulating endotoxin pool, may stimulate coronary artery endothelial cell activation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Interleukin-8 secretion, monocyte adhesion, and E-selectin expression were measured in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) challenged in vitro with highly purified endotoxins of common host colonisers Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis. HCAECs but not HUVECs expressed Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and were responsive to non-enterobacterial endotoxins. Transfection of TLR-deficient HEK-293 cells with TLR2 or TLR4/MD2 revealed that while E. coli endotoxin utilised solely TLR4 to signal, the endotoxins, deglycosylated endotoxins (lipid-A), and whole heat-killed bacteria of the other species stimulated TLR2-but not TLR4-dependent cell-signalling. Blockade of TLR2 with neutralizing antibody prevented HCAEC activation by non-enterobacterial endotoxins. Comparison of each endotoxin with E. coli endotoxin in limulus amoebocyte lysate assay revealed that the non-enterobacterial endotoxins are greatly underestimated by this assay, which has been used in all previous studies to estimate plasma endotoxin concentrations. CONCLUSION: Circulating non-enterobacterial endotoxins may be an underestimated contributor to endothelial activation and atherosclerosis in individuals at risk of increased plasma endotoxin burden.
TI  - Transcriptional organization, regulation and role of the Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 hmu haemin-uptake locus.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral bacterium associated with periodontal disease,  requires haemin for growth. Although several multigenic clusters encoding haemin-uptake systems are present on the genome of P. gingivalis, little is known regarding their transcriptional organization and expression. This study identified a 23 kDa iron-regulated haemin-binding protein encoded by a larger than previously reported variant of hmuY. It was shown that the hmu locus is larger than previously reported and is composed of six genes, hmuYRSTUV, encoding a novel hybrid haemin-uptake system. The locus has an operonic organization and the transcriptional start site is located 292 bp upstream of hmuY. The data indicate that the regulation of the operon is iron-dependent. Interestingly, differential regulation within the operon was demonstrated, resulting in excess of the hmuYR message encoding the outer-membrane proteins when compared to the full-length transcript. In addition, the hmuY transcript is more prevalent than the hmuR transcript. Secondary structure analysis of the hmuYRSTUV mRNA predicted the formation of several potential stem-loops in the 5' ends of hmuR- and hmuS-specific mRNAs, consistent with the differential regulation observed. Finally, it was demonstrated that haemin binding and uptake are elevated in iron-depleted conditions and are reduced 45 % and 70 %, respectively, in an hmu-deficient strain when compared to the parental strain, indicating that the hmu locus plays a major role in haemin acquisition in P. gingivalis. Since homologues of the hmu locus were also found in Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella intermedia, these findings may have implications for a better understanding of haemin acquisition in those organisms as well.
TI  - Bacteroides species produce Vibrio harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules.
AB  - Quorum sensing is a density-dependent gene regulation mechanism that has been described in many bacterial species in the last decades. Bacteria that use quorum sensing as part of their gene regulation circuits produce molecules called autoinducers that accumulate in the environment and activate target genes in a quorum-dependent way. Some specific clues led us to hypothesize that Bacteroides species can produce autoinducers and possess a quorum sensing system. First, Bacteroides are anaerobic bacteria that are frequently involved in polymicrobial infections. These infections often involve Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, two of the best understood examples of bacteria that employ quorum sensing systems as part of their pathogenesis. Also, studies have detected the presence of a quorum sensing gene involved in the production of autoinducers in Porphyromonas gingivalis, a species closely related to the Bacteroides genus. These and other evidences prompted us to investigate if Bacteroides strains could produce autoinducer molecules that could be detected by a Vibrio harveyi reporter system. In this paper, we show that supernatants of B. fragilis, B. vulgatus and B. distasonis strains are able to stimulate the V. harveyi quorum sensing system 2. Also, we were able to demonstrate that the stimulation detected is due to the production of autoinducer molecules and not the growth of reporter strains after addition of supernatant. Moreover, the phenomenon observed does not seem to represent the degradation of repressors possibly present in the culture medium used. We could also amplify bands from some of the strains tested using primers designed to the luxS gene of Escherichia coli. Altogether, our results show that B. fragilis, B. vulgatus and B. distasonis (but possibly some other species) can produce V. harveyi autoinducer 2-related molecules. However, the role of such molecules in the biology of these organisms remains unknown.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of a new chlorhexidine slow-release device.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effect of chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide slow-release devices on oral bacteria. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The agar diffusion test was used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the slow-release devices Activ Point (chlorhexidine; Roeko) and Calcium Hydroxide Plus Point (Roeko) on 8 anaerobic and 2 facultative oral bacterial strains, as well as 2 bacterial cultures randomly sampled from necrotic root canals and incubated in anaerobic and aerobic broth for 48 hours. The efficiency of the medicaments against the various strains was evaluated using a nonparametric test (Friedman type) and a second nonparametric test (Wilcoxon's signed rank test). RESULTS: Activ Point produced significantly larger inhibition zones (P < .001) than the calcium hydroxide slow-release device around all tested bacterial strains. CONCLUSION: The chlorhexidine slow-release device (Activ Point) exhibited significant antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion test and merits study as an intracanal medicament.
TI  - Superoxide dismutase-encoding gene of the obligate anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated by the redox-sensing transcription activator OxyR.
AB  - Inspection of the genomic DNA sequence of the oral anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis reveals that the micro-organism possesses the peroxide-sensing transcription activator OxyR, but not the superoxide-sensing transcription factor SoxR. Investigatation of oxidative-stress-responsive proteins in P. gingivalis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that two proteins were predominantly upregulated in oxidative conditions. In a P. gingivalis oxyR mutant these two proteins were not induced by treatment with hydrogen peroxide under aerobic conditions. By N-terminal amino acid sequencing, the two proteins were found to be superoxide dismutase and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, encoded by sod and ahpC, respectively. Northern blot and lacZ fusion analyses revealed that P. gingivalis sod and ahpC were positively regulated by OxyR. Primer extension analysis located the promoter regions of sod and ahpC, and putative -35 boxes of these promoters were found immediately adjacent to their putative OxyR-binding sequences. Moreover, the promoter regions of sod and ahpC had the ability to bind P. gingivalis OxyR protein. These results demonstrate that P. gingivalis sod is one of the OxyR regulons, suggesting that OxyR functions as an intracellular redox sensor rather than a peroxide sensor in this organism. A sod gene of Bacteroides fragilis, which is taxonomically related to P. gingivalis, is inducible by redox stresses but not controlled by its OxyR. A DNA fragment including the B. fragilis sod promoter region could bind the P. gingivalis OxyR protein; however, a putative OxyR binding sequence within the DNA fragment was 14 bases distant from a putative -35 box of its promoter.
TI  - Lipopolysaccharides of Bacteroides fragilis, Chlamydia trachomatis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa signal via toll-like receptor 2.
AB  - Recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is critical in the host defence against Gram-negative infection. While enterobacterial LPS signals via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), it has recently been reported that the LPS of Leptospira interrogans, Legionella pneumophila, Rhizobium species Sin-1 and at least one strain of Porphyromonas gingivalis are capable of signalling via TLR2. Using a TLR transfection assay and measurement of an NF-kappaB-sensitive promoter region, the results show that the LPS of Bacteroides fragilis NCTC-9343, Chlamydia trachomatis LGV-1 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAC-611 also signal via TLR2 and it is pointed out that all TLR2-signalling LPS discovered to date demonstrate relatively weak endotoxicity in some models and structural features distinct from those LPS shown to signal via TLR4.
TI  - [The chemical degradation of lipopolysaccharides from oral anaerobes]
AB  - OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the effect of drug on chemical degradation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from oral anaerobes.METHODS:LPSs from porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg),bacteroides fragilis (Bf) and fusobacteria nucleatum (Fn) were extracted by the hot phenol-water method and purified by the phenol-chloroform-petroleum ether procedure.1.0 ml (200microg) various LPSs were incubated with 2.0 ml various drugs at 37degrees centigrade for 15 or 30 minutes in vitro,respectively.The chemical degradation of LPS was quantitated by limulus synthetic chromogenic substrated method after dialysis.RESULTS:The order of degradation was 30% hydrogen peroxide (H),50% citric acid (C),garlic guice (G),1:1 diluted G,25% C and 3% H,and their efffcts were dose dependent and were time dependent except H but the effect of lysozyme was minimal.CONCLUSION:The study may imply that the dose and the mechanism of various drugs on LPS degradation are different and remains to be elucidated.
TI  - Evidence for local production of antibodies to auto and non-self antigens in periodontal disease.
AB  - Autoimmune mechanisms may contribute to periodontal disease (PD) pathogenesis; autoantibody to collagen type 1 is produced at the periodontal site and local levels are found to be higher than in serum. OBJECTIVES: To find any evidence of autoimmune destruction in diseased periodontal tissues in patients with periodontitis. The study examines the relationship of antibodies to a self antigen collagen Type 1 and antigens from two periodontal pathogens namely Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and a non-oral bacterium Bacteroides fragilis (Bf) in disease sites and in serum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Granulomatous tissues from periodontally diseased sites and serum samples were obtained from 13 patients (15 sites) undergoing surgical therapy. Tissues were homogenized at 4 degrees C on Tris saline buffer [1 g (5 ml)-1], homogenate was centrifuged and the resultant supernatants were used in assays. Antibody to collagen and Aa, Pg and Bf in tissue eluates and serum were determined by competitive enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and conventional ELISA respectively using an alkaline phosphatase/p-nitrophenyl phosphate enzyme-substrate system. Sera from age and sex matched healthy subjects and pooled human serum were used as controls. Antibody (Ab) levels in tissues and serum were standardized by concomitant albumin assay. RESULTS: Level of antibodies to collagen type 1 in tissue was significantly higher than in serum (P = 0.0001). Antibody levels in tissue to Pg were significantly higher than in serum (P = 0.0271). Ab levels to both Aa and Bf in tissues and serum were not significantly different from each other. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the process of the local production of antibodies to autoantigen namely collagen type-1 and to bacterial antigens in the granulomatous tissues housed within the periodontal lesions in patients with periodontitis.
TI  - The strict anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis grows in and benefits from nanomolar concentrations of oxygen.
AB  - Strict anaerobes cannot grow in the presence of greater than 5 micro M dissolved  oxygen. Despite this growth inhibition, many strict anaerobes of the Bacteroides class of eubacteria can survive in oxygenated environments until the partial pressure of O2 (PO2) is sufficiently reduced. For example, the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythensis colonize subgingival plaques of mammals, whereas several other Bacteroides species colonize the gastrointestinal tract of animals. It has been suggested that pre-colonization of these sites by facultative anaerobes is essential for reduction of the PO2 and subsequent colonization by strict anaerobes. However, this model is inconsistent with the observation that Bacteroides fragilis can colonize the colon in the absence of facultative anaerobes. Thus, this strict anaerobe may have a role in reduction of the environmental PO2. Although some strictly anaerobic bacteria can consume oxygen through an integral membrane electron transport system, the physiological role of this system has not been established in these organisms. Here we demonstrate that B. fragilis encodes a cytochrome bd oxidase that is essential for O2 consumption and is required, under some conditions, for the stimulation of growth in the presence of nanomolar concentrations of O2. Furthermore, our data suggest that this property is conserved in many other organisms that have been described as strict anaerobes.
TI  - Flavobacterium johnsoniae GldH is a lipoprotein that is required for gliding motility and chitin utilization.
AB  - Cells of Flavobacterium johnsoniae move rapidly over surfaces by gliding motility. The mechanism of this form of motility is not known. Six genes (gldA, gldB, gldD, gldF, gldG, and ftsX) that are required for gliding have been described. Tn4351 mutagenesis was used to identify another gene, gldH, which is required for cell movement. GldH mutants formed nonspreading colonies, and individual cells lacked the cell movements and ability to propel latex spheres along their surfaces that are characteristic of wild-type cells. gldH mutants also failed to digest chitin and were resistant to bacteriophages that infect wild-type cells. Introduction of pMM293, which carries wild-type gldH, restored to the gldH mutants colony spreading, cell motility, the ability to move latex spheres, phage sensitivity, and the ability to digest chitin. gldH encodes a predicted 141-amino-acid protein that localized to the membrane fraction. Labeling studies with [3H]palmitate demonstrated that GldH is a lipoprotein. GldB and GldD, which were previously described, also appear to be lipoproteins. GldH does not exhibit significant amino acid similarity to proteins of known function in the databases. Putative homologs of gldH of unknown function are found in motile (Cytophaga hutchinsonii) and apparently nonmotile (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides fragilis, Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia) members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of the oral pathogenic Bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis strain W83.
AB  - The complete 2,343,479-bp genome sequence of the gram-negative, pathogenic oral bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis strain W83, a major contributor to periodontal disease, was determined. Whole-genome comparative analysis with other available complete genome sequences confirms the close relationship between the Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides (CFB) phylum and the green-sulfur bacteria. Within the CFB phyla, the genomes most similar to that of P. gingivalis are those of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and B. fragilis. Outside of the CFB phyla the most similar genome to P. gingivalis is that of Chlorobium tepidum, supporting the previous phylogenetic studies that indicated that the Chlorobia and CFB phyla are related, albeit distantly. Genome analysis of strain W83 reveals a range of pathways and virulence determinants that relate to the novel biology of this oral pathogen. Among these determinants are at least six putative hemagglutinin-like genes and 36 previously unidentified peptidases. Genome analysis also reveals that P. gingivalis can metabolize a range of amino acids and generate a number of metabolic end products that are toxic to the human host or human gingival tissue and contribute to the development of periodontal disease.
TI  - Accelerated alveolar bone loss in mice lacking interleukin-10.
AB  - Interleukin-10 regulates pro-inflammatory cytokines, including those implicated in alveolar bone resorption. We hypothesized that lack of interleukin-10 leads to increased alveolar bone resorption. Male interleukin-10(-/-) mice, on 129/SvEv and C57BL/6J background, were compared with age-, sex-, and strain-matched interleukin-10(+/+) controls for alveolar bone loss. Immunoblotting was used for analysis of serum reactivity against bacteria associated with colitis and periodontitis. Interleukin-10(-/-) mice had significantly greater alveolar bone loss than interleukin-10(+/+) mice (p = 0.006). The 30-40% greater alveolar bone loss in interleukin-10(-/-) mice was evident in both strains, with C57BL/6J interleukin-10(-/-) mice exhibiting the most bone loss. Immunoblotting revealed distinct interleukin-10(-/-) serum reactivity against Bacteroides vulgatus, B. fragilis, Prevotella intermedia, and, to a lesser extent, against B. forsythus. The results of the present study suggest that lack of interleukin-10 leads to accelerated alveolar bone loss.
TI  - Mechanism of quinolone resistance in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Several recently developed quinolones have excellent activity against a broad range of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and are thus potential drugs for the treatment of serious anaerobic and mixed infections. Resistance to quinolones is increasing worldwide, but is still relatively infrequent among anaerobes. Two main mechanisms, alteration of target enzymes (gyrase and topoisomerase IV) caused by chromosomal mutations in encoding genes, or reduced intracellular accumulation due to increased efflux of the drug, are associated with quinolone resistance. These mechanisms have also been found in anaerobic species. High-level resistance to the newer broad-spectrum quinolones often requires stepwise mutations in target genes. The increasing emergence of resistance among anaerobes may be a consequence of previous widespread use of quinolones, which may have enriched first-step mutants in the intestinal tract. Quinolone resistance in the Bacteroides fragilis group strains is strongly correlated with amino acid substitutions at positions 82 and 86 in GyrA (equivalent to positions 83 and 87 of Escherichia coli). Several studies have indicated that B. fragilis group strains possess efflux pump systems that actively expel quinolones, leading to resistance. DNA gyrase seems also to be the primary target for quinolones in Clostridium difficile, since amino acid substitutions in GyrA and GyrB have been detected in resistant strains. To what extent other mechanisms, such as mutational events in other target genes or alterations in outer-membrane proteins, contribute to resistance among anaerobes needs to be further investigated.
TI  - Monocytes heterozygous for the Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile mutations in the Toll-like receptor 4 gene show no deficit in lipopolysaccharide signalling.
AB  - Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is required for efficient recognition of Gram-negative bacterial infections. Two commonly occurring mutations in the human TLR4 gene (Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile) have recently been shown to be associated with blunted physiological responses to inhaled LPS, and with increased risk of Gram-negative bacteraemia in sepsis patients and reduced risk of atherosclerosis in an Italian population. Here we show that monocytes from individuals heterozygous for both mutations in the TLR4 gene exhibit no deficit in recognition of LPS of Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Yersinia pestis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We propose that the relatively high frequency of these mutations in the Caucasian population may reflect modified responses of carriers to alternative TLR4 agonists.
TI  - Chemical structure and immunobiological activity of lipid A from Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The novel chemical structure and immunobiological activities of Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611 lipid A were investigated. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparation of P. intermedia was extracted using a phenol-chloroform-petroleum ether method, after which its purified lipid A was prepared by weak acid hydrolysis followed by chromatographic separations. The lipid A structure was determined by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance to be a diglucosamine backbone with a phosphate at the 4-position of the non-reducing side sugar, as well as five fatty acids containing branched long chains. It was similar to that of Bacteroides fragilis and Porphyromonas gingivalis, except for the phosphorylation site. P. intermedia lipid A induced weaker cytokine production and NF-kappaB activation in murine cells via Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 as compared to Escherichia coli synthetic lipid A (compound 506). Our results indicate that P. intermedia lipid A activates cells through a TLR4-dependent pathway similar to E. coli-type lipid A, even though these have structural differences.
TI  - Cloning, characterization, and possible origin of the Prevotella loescheii dnaK homolog.
AB  - Heat shock proteins play an important role in bacterial survival and response to  environmental stress. We cloned the Prevotella loescheii HSP70 homolog (dnaK) and characterized the coding sequence, regulatory regions, and evolutionary relationships to other bacteria. Predicted proteins encoded by the P. loescheii dnaK homolog (open reading frame ORF-1) and two downstream coding regions, ORF-2 and ORF-3, are highly homologous to the proteins encoded by ORF-4 (dnaK), ORF-5, and ORF-6 from the dnaK region of Porphyromonas gingivalis. The dnaK promoter resembles other HSP (heat shock protein) promoters. Alignment of the predicted protein encoded by ORF-2 showed significant homology to the Bacteroides fragilis tnpA gene from the transposon Tn4555, whereas the ORF-3 protein showed homology to B. fragilis transposase (Tn5220) and integrase (Tn4555) proteins. This suggests a transposition-like event may be responsible for transfer of these genes between Porphyromonas and Prevotella.
TI  - The redox-sensitive transcriptional activator OxyR regulates the peroxide response regulon in the obligate anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The peroxide response-inducible genes ahpCF, dps, and katB in the obligate anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis are controlled by the redox-sensitive transcriptional activator OxyR. This is the first functional oxidative stress regulator identified and characterized in anaerobic bacteria. oxyR and dps were found to be divergently transcribed, with an overlap in their respective promoter regulatory regions. B. fragilis OxyR and Dps proteins showed high identity to homologues from a closely related anaerobe, Porphyromonas gingivalis. Northern blot analysis revealed that oxyR was expressed as a monocistronic 1-kb mRNA and that dps mRNA was approximately 500 bases in length. dps mRNA was induced over 500-fold by oxidative stress in the parent strain and was constitutively induced in the peroxide-resistant mutant IB263. The constitutive peroxide response in strain IB263 was shown to have resulted from a missense mutation at codon 202 (GAT to GGT) of the oxyR gene [oxyR(Con)] with a predicted D202G substitution in the OxyR protein. Transcriptional fusion analysis revealed that deletion of oxyR abolished the induction of ahpC and katB following treatment with hydrogen peroxide or oxygen exposure. However, dps expression was induced approximately fourfold by oxygen exposure in DeltaoxyR strains but not by hydrogen peroxide. This indicates that dps expression is also under the control of an oxygen-dependent OxyR-independent mechanism. Complementation of DeltaoxyR mutant strains with wild-type oxyR and oxyR(Con) restored the inducible peroxide response and the constitutive response of the ahpCF, katB, and dps genes, respectively. However, overexpression of OxyR abolished the catalase activity but not katB expression, suggesting that higher levels of intracellular OxyR may be involved in other physiological processes. Analysis of oxyR expression in the parents and in DeltaoxyR and overexpressing oxyR strains by Northern blotting and oxyR'::xylB fusions revealed that B. fragilis OxyR does not control its own expression.
TI  - Review of the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic pathogens.
AB  - Published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. The studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. Using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/L, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against Gram-positive anaerobes (Clostridium perfringens, all Peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against Gram-negative anaerobes. Bacteroides stercoris, Bacteroides tectum and many Bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/L, while the other species of the B. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. Species variability was evident: Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas macaccae, Prevotella heparinolytica and Prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/L of gemifloxacin while most other Porphyromonas and Prevotella spp. were not. These data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which Gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. may predominate.
TI  - Identification and cloning of genes from Porphyromonas gingivalis after mutagenesis with a modified Tn4400 transposon from Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative, black-pigmented, oral anaerobe strongly associated with adult periodontitis. Previous transposon mutagenesis studies with this organism were based on the Bacteroides transposon Tn4351. Characterization of Tn4351-disrupted genes by cloning has not been an efficient way to analyze large numbers of mutants and is further complicated by the high rate of cointegration of the suicide delivery vector containing Tn4351. In this study, we mutagenized P. gingivalis with a modified version of the Bacteroides fragilis transposon Tn4400. Plasmid pYT646B carrying the transposon was mobilized from Escherichia coli to P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 by conjugation. Both normal and inverse transposition frequencies were similar (3 x 10(-8)). However, the inverse transposon (Tn4400') contains a pBR322 replicon and a beta-lactamase gene; thus, the cloning of disrupted genomic DNAs from inverse transposition mutants was easily accomplished after ligation of genomic fragments and transformation into E. coli. Thousands of transconjugants could be obtained in a single mating experiment, and inverse transposition was random as demonstrated by Southern hybridization. By this procedure the disrupted genes from P. gingivalis pleiotropic mutants were quickly cloned, sequenced, and identified.
TI  - Activities of the Porphyromonas gingivalis PrtP proteinase determined by construction of prtP-deficient mutants and expression of the gene in Bacteroides species.
AB  - PrtP is a major cysteine proteinase of Porphyromonas gingivalis. The gene encoding this proteinase, prtP, was cloned into the Escherichia coli-Bacteroides shuttle vectors pFD288 and pFD340 and was expressed in Bacteroides cells, apparently under the control of its own promoter, when in pFD288, or a Bacteroides promoter present on pFD340. Proteolytically active PrtP was detected by fibrinogen zymography in cells or spent growth medium of several Bacteroides species harboring the recombinant plasmids. The proteinase was recovered from Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285(pFD340-prtP) cells by 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) extraction and characterized with regard to exopeptidase specificity and sensitivity to proteinase inhibitors. Lys-amidolytic activity, but not Arg-amidolytic activity, was detected. PrtP was activated by cysteine and, to a lesser extent, dithiothreitol, and it was stimulated by glycine-containing compounds. It also was inhibited by Nalpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK) and, to a lesser extent, H-D-Tyr-L-Pro-L-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (YPRCK) and was relatively insensitive to EDTA and leupeptin. Neither B. fragilis ATCC 25285(pFD340-prtP) cells nor the CHAPS extract effected hemagglutination of sheep red blood cells or collagen cleavage, but the cells did cleave gelatin. Furthermore, P. gingivalis W12, ATCC 33277, KDP110, and HG66 with knockout mutations in prtP were constructed by allelic replacement. Unlike the parent strains, the mutant strains produced beige colonies on plates containing sheep blood. These strains also were affected in their ability to effect hemagglutination, cleave collagen, and cleave a Lys-specific peptide substrate. This report presents the results of the first characterization of the PrtP proteinase clearly in the absence of any influence by other P. gingivalis proteins and describes the properties of P. gingivalis cells defective in the production of PrtP.
TI  - [The application of a transponson, Tn4351, to an oral anaerobe, Porphyromonas gingivalis].
AB  
TI  - Comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of AM-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of AM-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. Although AM-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group and Prevotella bivia (MIC90s > or =3.13 mg/mL), 76% of the B. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at AM-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/L. AM-1155 was highly active against Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens and Mobiluncus spp. (MIC90s < or =0.39 mg/L). An in-vivo study using a mixed infection with AM-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible B. fragilis and Escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. AM-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against E. coli. These results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of AM-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. Clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in AM-1155-treated mice. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of AM-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the B. fragilis group and P. bivia should be evaluated further.
TI  - Distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetQ.
AB  - We tested 34 American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetQ gene using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and DNA-DNA hybridization. The identities of PCR products were confirmed by Southern blot hybridization of whole-cell DNA. Eleven of the ATCC strains were positive for tetQ, including five Bacteroides spp., five Prevotella spp. and a single isolate of Mitsuokella multiacidus. Twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical Gram-negative isolates carried the tetQ gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical Gram-positive isolates carried the tetQ gene. This is the first description of tetQ in Gram-positive species. All isolates except one Peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetQ integrated into the chromosome. The tetQ gene could be transferred from Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides distasonis into an Enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. In contrast, tetQ failed to transfer from two isolates of Prevotella intermedia, two isolates of Porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of Mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of Peptostreptococcus sp. The latter two are Gram-positive species. The PCR assay was used to screen 198 proteinase K-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. Thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the PCR assay could be of value in screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.
TI  - Serum antibodies to Porphyromonas gingivalis block the prostaglandin E2 response  to lipopolysaccharide by mononuclear cells.
AB  - The ability of rabbit and monkey immune sera to neutralize prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was examined. CD14-dependent LPS activation of PGE2 was examined under assay conditions which allowed the comparison of preimmune and immune sera. Serum obtained from rabbits immunized with formalin-fixed Porphyromonas gingivalis cells dramatically reduced the amount of PGE2 produced in response to LPS obtained from three different strains of P. gingivalis but not that from Escherichia coli or Bacteroides fragilis. In addition, a significant reduction in the mean PGE2 level was observed in the presence of sera from immunized but not control monkeys employed in a vaccine trial. Immune serum samples from five of nine immunized monkeys were able to reduce LPS-induced production of PGE2 by greater than 50% compared to that in the corresponding preimmune sera. Immune monkey serum, similar to immune rabbit serum, blocked PGE2 production in response to P. gingivalis LPS but not E. coli LPS. These data demonstrate that immunization with P. gingivalis whole cells can elicit an antibody response that is able to block the PGE2 response to LPS. Neutralization of LPS-mediated inflammatory mediator production may account in part for the observed suppression of alveolar bone loss in immunized monkeys.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 recA homolog and construction of a recA-deficient mutant.
AB  - Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used in PCR to amplify a region of the recA homolog from Porphyromonas gingivalis W83. The resulting PCR fragment was used as a probe to identify a recombinant lambda DASH phage (L10) carrying the P. gingivalis recA homolog. The recA homolog was localized to a 2.1-kb BamHI fragment. The nucleotide sequence of this 2.1-kb fragment was determined, and a 1.02-kb open reading frame (341 amino acids) was detected. The predicted amino acid sequence was strikingly similar (90% identical residues) to the RecA protein from Bacteroides fragilis. No SOS box, characteristic of LexA-regulated promoters, was found in the 5' upstream region of the P. gingivalis recA homolog. In both methyl methanesulfonate and UV survival experiments the recA homolog from P. gingivalis complemented the recA mutation of Escherichia coli HB101. The cloned P. gingivalis recA gene was insertionally inactivated with the ermF-ermAM antibiotic resistance cassette to create a recA-deficient mutant (FLL33) by allelic exchange. The recA-deficient mutant was significantly more sensitive to UV irradiation than the wild-type strain, W83. W83 and FLL33 showed the same level of virulence in in vivo experiments using a mouse model. These results suggest that the recA gene in P. gingivalis W83 plays the expected role of repairing DNA damage caused by UV irradiation. However, inactivation of this gene did not alter the virulence of P. gingivalis in the mouse model.
TI  - Evidence for serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses in Macaca fascicularis identified by monoclonal antibodies to human IgG subclasses.
AB  - This investigation determined the capacity of murine monoclonal antibodies directed to human immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses to identify molecules with conserved epitopes in the serum of the nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis. We subsequently utilized this cross-reactivity to document the characteristics of IgG subclass antibody responses in M. fascicularis to parenteral immunization with intact oral microorganisms, antigens from oral microorganisms, and finally a defined protein toxin, tetanus toxoid. The IgG response in nonhuman primates immunized with tetanus toxoid showed a 40-fold and 110-fold increase after primary and secondary immunizations, respectively. The major IgG subclass responses were IgG1 and IgG3, with little, though significant, responses in the IgG4 and IgG2 subclasses. Seventy-five to 94% of the natural IgG antibody in nonhuman primate sera to Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Campylobacter rectus was IgG1. IgG2 and IgG3 predominated to Bacteroides fragilis, IgG4 to Actinomyces viscosus and an equal distribution among the subclasses was noted in response to Fusobacterium nucleatum. Parenteral immunization of nonhuman primates with intact P. gingivalis elicited primarily IgG3 and IgG4, while the post-immunization IgG response to P. intermedia was largely IgG1. Nonhuman primates were also parenterally immunized with cell envelope antigens of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, or a combination of cell envelope antigen from C. rectus and F. nucleatum and cell wall antigens of A. viscosus. The greatest IgG antibody response seen post-immunization was reactive with anti-human IgG1 for all of these antigens except to C. rectus which bound nonhuman primate antibody reactive with anti-human IgG2. It appears that the bacteria and their products exhibit unique differences in their induction of serum IgG subclass antibody responses. The characteristics of their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate may contribute to the ability of the immune responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.
TI  - Comparison of lipopolysaccharides from Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Campylobacter and Wolinella spp. by tricine-SDS-PAGE.
AB  - Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of 11 bacterial strains from the type species of the genera Bacteroides (B. fragilis), Prevotella (Pr. melaninogenica), Porphyromonas (Po. gingivalis), Campylobacter (C. fetus subsp. fetus), and Wolinella (W. succinogenes), and from the type strains of B. distasonis, B. forsythus, B. ureolyticus, Po. levii, Po. macacae, and C. gracilis, were extracted with hot water-phenol (Westphal method). S-form LPSs, obtained from all organisms, were well resolved with tricine-sodium-dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. Lipid A was not stained. Also profiles from LPS of Escherichia coli, serotypes 0111:B4 and 055:B5, could be distinguished. While W. succinogenes showed a relatively short S-form LPS on electrophoregrams, the other bacteria, including B. fragilis, exhibited long-ladder LPSs. Po. gingivalis displayed the largest number of bands and the longest O-chain. The long O-chain of this bacterium may be important for its virulence.
TI  - Characteristics of systemic antibody responses of nonhuman primates following active immunization with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Periodontal disease is an infectious disease manifested by the progressive change of a healthy resident commensal microbiota to a pathogenic one characterized by a specific microbiota. Thus, the prospect for the use of selected bacteria or their antigens as a vaccine to interfere with the microbial changes and resulting progression of periodontal tissue destruction has been proposed. As a first step in examining the use of bacterial antigens as immunogens in periodontitis, this study characterized the humoral immune response in Macaca fascicularis after systemic immunization with intact Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Bacteroides fragilis. Parental immunization of the nonhuman primate with the intact bacteria resulted in the production of specific and significantly elevated levels of antibodies to P. gingivalis and P. intermedia, with the predominant isotype being immunoglobulin G (IgG). In contrast, the principal response to the nonoral, intestinal bacterium, B. fragilis, was of the IgM isotype. Immunization increased IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody by 14-227 fold to P. gingivalis and 8-108 fold to P. intermedia. The level of serum IgA antibody increased (77-227 fold). The kinetics of the antibody response post-immunization and post-ligation differed with respect to each of the bacteria tested. IgG antibody to P. gingivalis increased through week 16 of the experiment and remained elevated above baseline through week 32. The IgG antibody level to P. intermedia peaked at 4 weeks following the third immunization and decreased post-ligation to near baseline levels by week 16. Characterization of the immune response after active immunization in the nonhuman primate has demonstrated a substantial and specific increase in antibody response which was sustained for several weeks. The insights obtained from these studies should help optimize the potential for immunologic interference with progressing periodontitis.
TI  - [In vitro activities of sulopenem, a new parenteral penem, against anaerobes].
AB  - In vitro activities of sulopenem, a novel parenteral penem, was compared with those of imipenem, flomoxef, cefuzonam, cefoperazone and sulbactam/ampicillin against 66 reference strains (19 genera, 61 species) and 392 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and fastidious aerobic bacteria. Sulopenem had a very broad spectrum against anaerobic bacteria. In general, this compound was active against anaerobic reference strains with MICs of < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml, while being the least active against Bifidobacterium spp. and less active than imipenem against Lactobacillus spp. Sulopenem was more active against Bacteroides fragilis isolates than imipenem and had the highest activities against Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. among the antibiotics tested. Sulopenem was not hydrolyzed by oxyiminocephalosporinase type 1 produced by B. fragilis GAI-0558, GAI-7955 and GAI-10150 and its stability was comparable to imipenem. Its susceptibilities to hydrolysis by a metallo-beta-lactamase from B. fragilis GAI-30144 was less than imipenem. Sulopenem (120 mg/kg, 3 times a day for 4 days) was as effective as imipenem/cilastatin against a mixed intraabdominal mice infection due to E. coli and B. fragilis. Sulopenem (20 mg/kg twice a day for 5 days) did not induce an overgrowth of Clostridium difficile in the caecum of mice.
TI  - Analysis of the insertion characteristics of Tn4351 during high frequency transposition of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - In this study, we characterized the high frequency transfer of the Bacteroides fragilis transposon Tn4351 into the chromosome of Porphyromonas gingivalis using a system developed by Genco, et al. Using this system, transconjugants were isolated and genomic sequences analyzed using both Ava-I and EcoR1 to determine the insertion characteristics of Tn4351 into the genome of P. gingivalis. Although previous evidence pointed to the possibility of random insertion, this study shows that, in fact, the insertion characteristics of Tn4351 into the genome of P. gingivalis are nonrandom and predictable.
TI  - Characterization of a Tn4351-generated hemin uptake mutant of Porphyromonas gingivalis: evidence for the coordinate regulation of virulence factors by hemin.
AB  - The ability of Porphyromonas gingivalis to acquire iron in the iron-limited environment of the host is crucial to the colonization of this organism. We report here on the isolation and characterization of a transpositional insertion mutant of P. gingivalis A7436 (designated MSM-3) which is defective in the utilization and transport of hemin. P. gingivalis MSM-3 was selected on the basis of its nonpigmented phenotype on anaerobic blood agar following mutagenesis with the Bacteroides fragilis transposon Tn4351. P. gingivalis MSM-3 grew poorly when supplied with hemin as a sole source of iron; however, growth was observed with hemoglobin or inorganic iron. P. gingivalis MSM-3 grown in either hemin-replete or hemin-depleted conditions bound and transported less [14C]hemin or [59Fe]hemin than did the parent strain. At 4 h, P. gingivalis MSM-3 grown in hemin-replete conditions transported only 10,000 pmol of hemin per mg of protein, or 14% of the amount transported by P. gingivalis A7436. Unlike P. gingivalis A7436, hemin binding and transport by P. gingivalis MSM-3 were not tightly regulated by hemin or iron. Examination of P. gingivalis MSM-3 cultures by electron microscopy revealed an overproduction of membrane vesicles, and determination of the dry weight of purified vesicles indicated that P. gingivalis MSM-3 produced twice as much membrane vesicles as did strain A7436. Extracellular vesicles isolated from P. gingivalis MSM-3 also were found to express increased hemolytic and trypsin-like protease activities compared with the parent strain. When inoculated into subcutaneous chambers implanted in mice, P. gingivalis MSM-3 was highly infectious and more invasive than the parent strain, as indicated by secondary lesion formation and death. Taken together, these results indicate that the decreased transport of hemin by P. gingivalis MSM-3 results in the increased expression of several virulence factors which may be coordinately regulated by hemin.
TI  - Resistance of a Tn4351-generated polysaccharide mutant of Porphyromonas gingivalis to polymorphonuclear leukocyte killing.
AB  - In this study, we describe the development of an efficient transpositional mutagenesis system for Porphyromonas gingivalis using the Bacteroides fragilis transposon Tn4351. Using this system, we have isolated and characterized a Tn4351-generated mutant of P. gingivalis A7436, designated MSM-1, which exhibits enhanced resistance to polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) phagocytosis and killing. P. gingivalis MSM-1 was initially selected based on its colony morphology; MSM-1 appeared as a mucoid, beige-pigmented colony. Analysis of P. gingivalis MSM-1 by electron microscopy and staining with ruthenium red revealed the presence of a thick ruthenium red-staining layer that was twice the thickness of this layer observed in the parent strain. P. gingivalis MSM-1 was found to be more hydrophilic than strain A7436 by hydrocarbon partitioning. Analysis of phenol-water extracts prepared from P. gingivalis A7436 and MSM-1 by Western (immunoblot) analysis and immunodiffusion with hyperimmune sera raised against A7436 and MSM-1 revealed the loss of a high-molecular-weight anionic polysaccharide component in extracts prepared from MSM-1. P. gingivalis MSM-1 was also found to be more resistant to PMN phagocytosis and intracellular killing than the parent strain, as assessed in a fluorochrome phagocytosis microassay. These differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05) when comparing PMN phagocytosis in nonimmune serum and intracellular killing in nonimmune and immune sera. P. gingivalis MSM-1 was also more resistant to killing by crude granule extracts from PMNs than was P. gingivalis A7436. These results indicate that the increased evasion of PMN phagocytosis and killing exhibited by P. gingivalis MSM-1 may result from alterations in polysaccharide-containing antigens.
TI  - The role of neuraminidase in haemagglutination and adherence to colon WiDr cells  by Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The role of neuraminidase in haemagglutination and adherence to colon WiDr cells  by eight strains of Bacteroides fragilis and four strains of oral black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes was studied. Neuraminidase treatment resulted in a very small increase of haemagglutination by some of the strains but had no effect on adherence to WiDr cells by all bacterial strains tested except one strain of Prevotella intermedia (HG 110). Inhibition of neuraminidase had no effect on haemagglutination or adherence, nor was any correlation found between haemagglutinating ability and neuraminidase activity in the B. fragilis strain. The results indicated that haemagglutination and adherence of B. fragilis to WiDr cells were not mediated by neuraminidase.
TI  - Phylogeny of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  - The phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (CFB) phylum was examined by 16S rRNA sequence comparative analysis. Approximately 95% of the 16S rRNA sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Porphyromonas and related species by a modified Sanger sequencing method. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. The bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. The first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of Prevotella, including P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, and the ruminal species P. ruminicola. Two oral species, P. zoogleoformans and P. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus Prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. These two species and six species of Bacteroides, including the type species B. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. The third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. The first contained Porphyromonas gingivalis, P. endodontalis, P. asaccharolytica, P. circumdentaria, P. salivosa, [Bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [Bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [Bacteroides] forsythus and [Bacteroides] distasonis. [Bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. With few exceptions, the 16 S rRNA data were in overall agreement with previously proposed reclassifications of species of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas. Suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.
TI  - In vitro activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. A fastidious facultative anaerobe, Gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. FK037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Clostridium perfringens, Mobiluncus spp., G. vaginalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. The MICs of FK037 for 50 and 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of FK037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. The activity of FK037 against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, and Bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml. Little influence of inoculum size on the activity of FK037 was observed for other isolates tested. Medium pH affected the activity of FK037 against F. varium (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and Bacteroides gracilis (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. FK037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from B. fragilis GAI 0558 and GAI 10150.
TI  - Classification and typing methods of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes.
AB  - Until recently, black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes were classified as 'black-pigmented Bacteroides'. At present, 11 distinct species are recognized in this group. Because of major differences with Bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus Bacteroides, new genera have been proposed: Porphyromonas for three asaccharolytic species, and Prevotella for the saccharolytic species. Typing methods have been developed for some species of black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobes. These include biotyping and serotyping, but relatively few types can be distinguished with these methods. Recently, DNA restriction endonuclease analysis has been used for typing of P. gingivalis, Pr. intermedia and P. endodontalis strains. Great heterogeneity was observed within all three species. This typing method can be useful for epidemiological studies.
TI  - Virulence factors in anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Various surface structures can be expressed in Bacteroides fragilis, but little is known about capsular structures in other non-spore-forming anaerobes. Fimbriae have been isolated from Bacteroides fragilis and Porphyromonas gingivalis. The importance of iron-repressible outer membrane proteins as virulence factors in Bacteroides fragilis is under study. The low endotoxic activity of Bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide can be attributed to the chemical composition of this organism's lipid A. A tissue culture system for the demonstration of Bacteroides fragilis enterotoxin has recently been described. The toxins A and B of Clostridium difficile are immunologically distinct. The importance of IgA proteases and other enzymes as virulence factors in anaerobic bacteria remains unclear.
TI  - E-test: a new technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing for periodontal  microorganisms.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to validate the Epsilometer test (E-test) method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected periodontopathic microorganisms using the agar dilution method as a standard. The E-test has been developed to provide a direct quantification of antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. The device consists of a predefined, continuous, and exponential gradient of antibiotic concentrations immobilized along a rectangular plastic test strip. After 48 hours incubation a drop-shaped inhibition zone intersects the graded test strip at the inhibitory concentration (IC) of the antibiotic. Twenty-two subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites were plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% rabbit blood or 5% sheep blood and trypticase soy agar supplemented with vancomycin and bacitracin. A total of 60 strains of key periodontal pathogens (Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, and Capnocytophaga) isolated from 22 sites of 12 patients were studied. The antibiotics tested were clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and ampicillin at concentrations above and below the achieved blood or gingival crevicular fluid levels. As a standard reference the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the agar dilution method. MICs were compared with ICs determined using the E-test method. The results showed an agreement ranging from 67% to 100%; sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%; predictability ranging from 56% to 100% and specificity ranging from 33% to 96%. The E-test ICs for ampicillin, cefoxitin, and metronidazole against the Gram-negative capnophilic and microaerophilic rods and the black-pigmented anaerobic rods ICs for ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline showed a high percentage of agreement with the agar dilution MICS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  - A filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. A total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. Sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the Bacteroides fragilis group, 98% of 66 B. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): B. capillosus, 4; B. levii, 2; B. denticola, 22; B. loescheii, 23; B. melaninogenicus, 32; B. forsythus, 44; and B. buccalis, 2. However, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 B. buccae isolates, 79% of 14 B. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 B. oralis isolates. Sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of B. gracilis, 12 isolates of B. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of B. intermedius, or 26 isolates of B. corporis. Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and P. endodontalis (8 isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of P. gingivalis were sialidase positive. Sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of 10 isolates of Capnocytophaga ochracea of C. sputigena but not in any of 4 C. gingivalis isolates. Other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: Fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; Wolinella recta, 19 isolates; Eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; Haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. These data demonstrate sialidase activity in several species of the genera Bacteroides and Porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.
TI  - 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequences in Bacteroides and Fusobacterium: evolutionary relationships within these genera and among eubacteria in general.
AB  - The 5S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequences were determined for Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides capillosus, Bacteroides veroralis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Anaerorhabdus furcosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium mortiferum, and Fusobacterium varium. A dendrogram constructed by a clustering algorithm from these sequences, which were aligned with all other hitherto known eubacterial 5S rRNA sequences, showed differences as well as similarities with respect to results derived from 16S rRNA analyses. In the 5S rRNA dendrogram, Bacteroides clustered together with Cytophaga and Fusobacterium, as in 16S rRNA analyses. Intraphylum relationships deduced from 5S rRNAs suggested that Bacteroides is specifically related to Cytophaga rather than to Fusobacterium, as was suggested by 16S rRNA analyses. Previous taxonomic considerations concerning the genus Bacteroides, based on biochemical and physiological data, were confirmed by the 5S rRNA sequence analysis.
