TI  == caseinoglycomacropeptide inhibits adhesion of pathogenic escherichia coli strains to human cells in culture.
AB  == caseinoglycomacropeptide (cgmp) derived from kappa-casein was investigated for its ability to inhibit the adhesion of 3 strains of verotoxigenic escherichia coli (vtec) and 3 strains of enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) to human ht29 tissue cell cultures. effects on adhesion of desulfovibrio desulfuricans, lactobacillus pentosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus gasseri were also investigated. generally, cgmp exerted effective anti-adhesive properties at a dose of 2.5 mg/ml, albeit with a high degree of strain specificity. the cgmp reduced adhesion of vtec strains to <50% of the control and reduced adhesion of epec strains to between 80 and 10% of the control. the cgmp also reduced the adhesion of l. pentosus and l. casei to 44 and 42%, respectively. a slight but significant reduction of l. acidophilus, to 81%,  was observed, but no significant effects were detected with either dsv. desulfuricans or l. gasseri. further investigation of the dose response relationships with the e. coli strains gave ic50 values ranging between 0.12 and  1.06 mg/ml.
