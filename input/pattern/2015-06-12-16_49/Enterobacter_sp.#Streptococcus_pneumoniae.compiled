TI  - [Diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (BF) on the surface of the implanted material. The majority of natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. However, there always only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. The aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of BF on endotracheal tube (ETT), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. METHOD: Thirty-five ETTs were obtained from 26 neonates on mechanical ventilator (from October 2012 to March 2013) in Department of Neonatology of Children's Hospital. Among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. DGGE profiling of 16S rDNA gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. TA Cloning Kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ETT-BF. RESULT: The mean bands of 35 ETTs cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE, and the mean Shanon-Wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. The 16 ETTs were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. The indwelling days of 6/7 patients' ETTs increased, the Shanon-siener indexes were decreased. Among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different Shanon-siener indexes. The result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained Klebsiella SP., 28 cases (80%) had Pseudomonas SP., 27 cases (77%) had Streptococcus SP., and 32 cases (91%) had Uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) Klebsiella SP. and 22/27(82%) Streptococcus SP. were accompanied by Pseudomonas SP.. There were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. Eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the ETTs on which Klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. CONCLUSION: The diversity of microbiota in BF on ETT was confirmed. 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ETT-BF, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of BF.
TI  - Antibacterial potential of sponge endosymbiont marine Enterobacter sp at Kavaratti Island, Lakshadweep archipelago.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate antibacterial potential of sponge endosymbiotic bacteria from marine sponges at Lakshadweep archipelago. Also to identify the potent bacteria by 16s rDNA sequencing and determine the antibacterial activity against clinical pathogens by MIC. METHODS: Sponge samples was collected from sub-tidal habitats at Kavaratti Island and identified. The endosymbiotic bacteria were isolated and selected potential bacteria which show antibacterial activity in preliminary screening against clinical pathogens Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella typhi (S. typhi), Klebsiella pneumoniea (K. pneumoniea) and Streptococcus sp. by disc diffusion assay. The crude extracts of potential bacteria LB3 was tested against clinical pathogens by MIC. The LB3 strain was identified by 16s rDNA sequencing, 1 111 bp was submitted in NCBI (HQ589912) and constructed phylogenetic tree. RESULTS: Sponge sample was identified as Dysidea granulosa (D. granulosa) and potential bacteria LB3 identified as Enterobacter sp TTAG. Preliminary screening of sponge isolates against clinical pathogens, LB3 strain was selected as potential producer of secondary metabolites and crude extract was implies on MIC of LB3 have confirmed with lowest concentration of 5.0 mg/mL in broth medium influence of crude extract on growth inhibitory activity after 5 h of incubation period and completed the inhibitory activity at 15 h. CONCLUSIONS: The present study concluded that phylogenetic analysis of endosymbiotic bacteria Enterobacter sp from sponge D. granulosa of Lakshadweep islands showed significant antibacterial activity against clinical bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Activity of tigecycline against pathogen bacteria isolated in respiratory infectious disease in Europe. TEST study 2004-2007].
AB  - Tigecycline (TGC), a semisynthetic glycylcycline, has a documented activity on Gram+ and Gram- pathogens including oxacillin-resistant (MRSA) and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is an international surveillance study designed to assess the in vitro activity of TGC and 11 comparators against a range of important clinical pathogens from both the community and the hospital. The aim of this study was to assess efficacy of TGC, using this database, against pathogens implicated in community or hospital pneumonia and sinusitis. A total of 4163 isolates were consecutively collected in 21 European countries during three years (2004-2007). In all center, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determinated with the same Microscan panel (Dade-Behring). Tigecycline exhibited a good activity against respiratory pathogens, with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hundred percent of cocci Gram+ (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus sp.) and 100% of Haemophilus sp. are inhibited with 0.5 mg/L, without effect of an associated beta-lactam resistance mechanism. TGC is active in vitro on 89% of Enterobacteriaceae, with MIC 90 less or equal to 2mg/L. Eighty-nine percent of Enterobacter sp. and 77% of Serratia sp. are susceptible with range of MIC 90 from 2 to 4 mg/L. These interesting results obtained in vitro are to be strengthened by clinical studies.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. METHODS: We identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). RESULTS: Nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. A single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). Patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per mL of bile (> 105 cfu/mL). The predominant Gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), Pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). The predominant Gram-positive bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and Streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). Bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. All Gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all Gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (CIM90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/mL. Gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. Although all five isolates of E. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) E. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis and Streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
TI  - [Hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in Polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. This study describes the incidence of HAP in Poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in Polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and use of mechanical ventilation. The epidemiology of HAP as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. Data for this study was acquired from the Registry of Hospital-acquired Infectious Diseases for the year 1998. Out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be HAP. This study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed HAP (0.3%). Death occurred in 260 of 920 HAP cases or 30%; and HAP found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). The greatest incidence of HAP was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. The most frequently isolated causal agents were the Gram-negative rods (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp.), and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of HAP in this population. It was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. The isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). In the Enterobacteriaceae family, Klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and Enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.
TI  - Significance of fever in Jamaican patients with homozygous sickle cell disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cause and outcome of high fever in Jamaican children with homozygous sickle cell disease. DESIGN: Retrospective review of febrile episodes in a three year period (1 September 1993 to 31 August 1996). SETTING: Sickle cell clinic, an outpatient clinic in Kingston run by the Medical Research Council Laboratories (Jamaica). PATIENTS: Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease under 17 years of age presenting with an axillary temperature >/= 39.0 degrees C (102.4 degrees F). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis, death. RESULTS: There were 165 events in 144 patients (66 (45.8%) boys) with a median age of 6.1 years. Bacteraemia was found in 10 (6.1%) events (three Streptococcus pneumoniae, two Haemophilus influenzae type b, two Salmonella sp, one Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter sp, and one Acinetobacter sp), and urinary tract infections in four (2.4%). All cultures of cerebrospinal fluid were sterile. Acute chest syndrome occurred in 36 (21.8%) events. A painful crisis was associated with 45 (27.3%) events and was the only pathology identified in 20 events (12.1%). Hospital admission was necessary in 66 cases including all those with bacteraemia and 31 with acute chest syndrome. There were two deaths: a 5 year old boy with septic shock associated with H influenzae septicaemia, and a 3 year old boy with the acute chest syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Painful crisis and acute chest syndrome were the most common complications associated with high fever, but other important associated features included bacteraemia and urinary tract infection. Enteric Gram negative organisms accounted for 50% of positive blood cultures.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: MYSTIC Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - Multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. Bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (ICUs) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. The MYSTIC (Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. The in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. The isolates consisted of 19 species of Gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including K. pneumoniae (n=49), E. coli (n=48), A. baumannii (n=47), Enterobacter spp. (n=41), and P. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of Gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including Staphylococcus aureus (n=63), Enterococcus faecalis (n=22), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative Staphylococci (n=21). All isolates were collected from ICU patients. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by Etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. Meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest MIC(90) for all species tested. Gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). Carbapenems were the most active drugs overall and only P. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). We also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) among all Enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by Etest/ESBL strip. ESBL production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). Among them, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by Enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and E. coli (14.6%). The high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of ESBL production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.
TI  - Cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  - Topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. The anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. The present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. The pathogens used were Branhamella catarrhalis, Enterobacter sp., Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. The bacteria studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: Cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. Phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. These topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. Otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical anesthetics when culturing specimens. This is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. Further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. This type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. A modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program (United States and Canada, 1997).
AB  - The SENTRY Program was established in January 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the United States (30 sites), Canada (8 sites), South America (10 sites), and Europe (24 sites). During the first 6-month study period (January to June 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (BSI) were reported by North American SENTRY participants (4,119 from the United States and 939 from Canada). In both the United States and Canada, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common BSI isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10 most frequently reported species in both the United States and Canada. Although the rank orders of pathogens in the United States and Canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several pathogens. Overall, U.S. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from Canada. The differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (mecA, vanA, and vanB) in the Canadian microbial population. Among U.S. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among Enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. Antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.
TI  - [Clinical bacteriology and empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly at a national leprosarium].
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia is one of the most important fatal respiratory diseases in the elderly. Prompt and precise empiric therapy is essential for recovery. Fourteen isolates from twelve elderly lepromatous leprosy patients (9 men, 3 women, mean age of 75.8 years) with hospital-acquired pneumonia were studied. Subsequently, empiric therapy with gentamicin and beta-lactams for nosocomial pneumonia in the elderly was examined. Fourteen types of bacteria isolated from expectorated sputum specimens consisted mainly of ten strains of gram-negative bacilli (71%) six of Klebsiella pneumoniae, one each of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia liquefaciens, and Aeromonas hydrophilia and four strains of gram-positive cocci (29%) two of Staphylococcus sp., one each of Streptococcus sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas sp. were not detected. Resistance rates of the etiologic agents to the antibiotics showed that gentamicin was 7.7%, ceftazidime 0%, and cefmetazole 23.1%. Cephalosporins were superior to penicillins. As a result of empiric therapy, six elderly leprosy patients with nosocomial pneumonia were cured and one improved temporarily. This study shows the necessity of specific empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in a hospital with many elderly patients. The combination of gentamicin and beta-lactams is of value as an initial antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in children: etiology and clinical features, an 11-year review of 618 cases.
AB  - During the period January 1980 to December 1990 (11 years) a retrospective study  of patients with bacterial meningitis who were admitted to Bangkok Children's Hospital was carried out. There were 618 patients with 77 cases (12.5%) occurring below the age of one month (neonatal meningitis), and 541 cases (87.5%) between one month to 15 years (childhood meningitis). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common pathogenic organism (16.9%) in neonatal meningitis; other causative agents in this age group included Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), group B Streptococcus (11.7%), Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp (10.4% each). In childhood meningitis, Haemophilus influenzae was the most common causative organism (42.3%), and followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.2%) and Salmonella sp (12.4%). Excluding a 13 year-old leukemic patient, Salmonella meningitis occurred exclusively in infants, 87% of them were under six months, and 13% of them developed relapsing meningitis. Presenting symptoms and signs on admission of neonatal meningitis such as fever (81.8%), convulsions (45.4%), neck stiffness (22.5%), bulging fontanelle (33.3%) and Brudzinski sign (11.5%) were significantly less frequent than in the patients beyond the neonatal period (p < 0.05). The overall fatalities during 1980-1990 were 45.4% and 17.3% for neonatal meningitis and childhood meningitis, respectively. The fatalities of the two age groups declined significantly during 1987-1990 to 26.3% and 11.4% respectively.
TI  - The management of lateral sinus thrombosis.
AB  - The standard recommended treatment for lateral sinus thrombosis is intravenous antibiotics. For those that fail, some authors recommend anticoagulant therapy, others internal jugular vein ligation. Despite these recommendations, there is still a significant mortality in all reported large series and the main reason this is that the cause of the failure has not been found or investigated. Over a six-year-period, from January 1985 to December 1990, 36 patients were admitted with lateral sinus thrombosis. The initial treatment consisted of intravenous antibiotics and surgery. The surgery included cortical mastoidectomy for non-cholesteatomatous ears and modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatomatous ears and drainage of the intracranial collection of pus in patients with subdural empyema and brain abscess. There were nine failures (25 per cent) with this treatment regimen. Blood cultures and pus swab of the ears were taken from these patients. The blood cultures were positive in four patients and the organisms isolated included beta-haemolytic Streptococcus sp. in two, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one each. From the ear swab mixed cultures were found in eight and a single organism in one. Gram-negative organisms were isolated in nine (100 per cent), Proteus mirabilis in eight (89 per cent) and Enterobacter sp. in two. Both these organisms were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin but were sensitive to amikacin. Amikacin was then added to the treatment regimen and a dramatic response with a fall in the temperature, and improvement in the patients' general condition was noted within 24 hours, in all patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - Use of potentially infected donor hearts for cardiac transplantation.
AB  - Despite the nationwide shortage of heart donors, more patients, some of whom are  critically ill, are being accepted as candidates for transplantation. Thus, on occasion, we have liberalized our donor criteria to meet the demand. We have recently transplanted 16 potentially infected donor hearts into critically ill recipients. Of these 16 donors, 7 had multiple positive blood cultures as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), and Enterobacter sp (1). Seven other donors were accepted despite high fevers (rectal temperature greater than 38.9 degrees C), leukocytosis (greater than 18 x 10(9)/L [greater than 18,000 cells/microL]), and pulmonary infiltrates with positive sputa (Enterobacter [3], Klebsiella pneumoniae [2], and Staphylococcus [2]). Two other donors with hepatitis B surface antigen positivity were deemed at high risk but were used because the recipients were in immediate need. Early mortality (less than or equal to 30 days) among the recipients was 3/16 (18.7%) with 1 patient dying of uncontrolled allograft rejection, 1 of hepatic failure, and 1 of Pseudomonas septicemia. Late mortality (greater than 30 days after operation) occurred in 6 patients: 2 patients died of hepatic failure, 3 died of graft atherosclerosis, and 1 died of iatrogenic hemorrhage after a liver biopsy. Only 1 patient died of infection unrelated to that of the donor, and the other patients had no infectious complications resulting from the organisms identified in their respective donors. Use of potentially infected donor hearts resulted in surprisingly few infectious complications in this group of recipients. This practice can be safe and should be considered when other options are unavailable.
TI  - Evaluation of thiol broth for the culture of Salmonella typhi and other bacteria  from blood.
AB  - Thiol broth is known to neutralize various antimicrobial agents. Positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (TSB). As blood cultures are often used for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of Salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in TSB. Routine blood culture samples from Yonsei Medical Center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of TSB and thiol broth. The media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain CO2, but TSB contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS). Growth of S. paratyphi-A, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were similar in both media. However, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in TSB with S. typhi, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. It is concluded that thiol broth is inferior to TSB plus SPS for the culture of S. typhi from blood.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility to a new antimicrobial agent (imipenem) of pathogens isolated from inpatients at various centers].
AB  - Imipenem is a beta lactam antibiotic, a highly potent new carbapenem with broad antibacterial spectrum. To test the "in vitro" efficacy of this antimicrobial agent in pathogens more frequent in several Medical Centers in Brazil, susceptibility testing with 10 mcg imipenem disks and, or corresponding MIC were carried out with 1231 recent isolates of 41 different bacterial species, obtained mainly from hospitalized patients in 5 different medical centers of the cities of S. Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador. Our preliminary results with this antibiotic, in final phases of clinical and laboratorial experimentation in this country, are very promissing with, 96.79% of susceptibility of test isolates to 10 mcg imipenem disks and corresponding MIC correlation of up to 4 micrograms/ml. (92.31%). Of the 9 bacterial species more frequently isolated totaling 1108 (82%) of the 1230 test isolates, disk susceptibility was 99% (E. coli), 93% (Pseudomonas aeruginosas), 87% (Staphylococcus aureus), 100% (Klebsiella pneumoniae), 98% (Klebsiella sp), 97% (Proteus mirabiles), 94% (Enterobacter sp), 100% (Streptococcus faecalis) with good MIC correlation (up to 8 mcg/ml) and 100% for the anaerobic species Bacteroides sp (MIC up to 4 micrograms/ml). "In vitro" efficacy to hospital pathogens with high frequency of resistance to most antibiotics as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to anaerobes notably Bacteroides sp is emphasized.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Osteomyelitis secondary to trauma or infected contiguous soft tissue.
AB  - Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (NHO) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. Predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot puncture (3). Infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). Patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). In 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. Bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: Staphylococcus aureus (9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter sp. (2), Streptococcus faecalis, Serratia sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). Wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). NHO recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. The indolent nature of NHO complicates diagnosis, especially in patients with recent compound fractures. Only prompt bone culture can confirm the presence of NHO and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Osteoarticular infections in children with sickle cell disease.
AB  - Thirteen children with sickle cell disease were identified as having 14 episodes  of osteoarticular infection in a review of 27 years' experience. There were eight episodes of osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis and six of suppurative arthritis alone. The etiologic agents in osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis were Salmonella sp in four cases, Escherichia coli in one, Enterobacter aerogenes in one, Staphylococcus aureus in one, and Haemophilus influenzae type b in one. Five of the cases with infection limited to the joint were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae; the sixth was caused by H influenzae type b. Fever (greater than or equal to 38.3 degrees C) was present in all children and the temperature was in excess of 39 degrees C in 62%. The mean duration of pain before admission was 4.5 days. The initial total white blood cell count ranged from 5,200 to 29,700/microL (mean 19,436/microL) and the total band neutrophil count ranged from 0 to 5,103/microL (mean 1,660/microL). The ESR was greater than 20 mm/h in eight of the ten patients who were tested. Management consisted of antibiotic therapy in all. Needle aspiration was performed in two patients with osteomyelitis and in three with suppurative arthritis. Incision and drainage was performed in two cases of osteomyelitis and in four with suppurative arthritis. The outcome was satisfactory in all except one patient who had several complications as a consequence of femoral neck osteomyelitis. Recurrence was reported in only one patient.
TI  - [Bacterial infection agents in hospitalized patients].
AB  - During six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. All the specimens investigated were taken from patients of surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. In total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like Staphylococus aureus, Straphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. Out of the Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli and Klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by Enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive Proteus species. The over all isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. In the last time Pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional Streptococcus faecium and Corynebacterium JK. Dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like Bacteroides sp., Peptococcus- and Peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in the infectious diseases. The epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. From there preventive measures must be induced.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247, two orally administered cephalosporin metabolites.
AB  - The activity of two iminomethoxy aminothiazoly cephalosporins, Ro 15-8074 and Ro  19-5247, was compared with that of other beta-lactams against a total of 491 bacterial strains. Both were highly active (MIC for 90% of the strains tested [MIC 90], less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) against the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, being at least 16-fold more active than cephalexin and 8-fold more active than cefuroxime. There was no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor activity against Morganella morganii (in the case of Ro 15-8074), Enterobacter sp., and Citrobacter sp. Staphylococcus aureus was moderately susceptible to Ro 19-5247 (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml), but Ro 15-8074 was eightfold less active. The protein binding of the two compounds at 5 micrograms/ml was 9.1% for Ro 15-8074 and 69.9% for Ro 19-5247. The major target site for the two cephalosporins was PBP 3.
TI  - Susceptibility testing with disc diffusion for new cephalosporins: pre-diffusion  revisited.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of 20-hour pre-diffusion, i.e. placing the antibiotic-containing discs on the agar for 20 hours prior to inoculation, as compared to direct diffusion, i.e. placing the discs on the agar immediately after inoculation, for the newer 3. generation cephalosporins as represented by ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. Regression lines (zone sizes vs. inhibitory concentrations, as measured by plate-dilution) were constructed for three groups of bacteria chosen because of their differences in growth characteristics on agar: E. coli (n = 50), Enterobacter sp. (n = 35), and streptococci (n = 51). The results for both cephalosporins were: 20-hour pre-diffusion produced larger zones than direct diffusion, regression studies for 20-hour pre-diffusion as compared to direct diffusion resulted in greater variation in zone sizes, numerically lower slopes, lower residual variances and higher correlation coefficients, and regression lines were significantly different for the 3 groups of bacteria with direct diffusion but not so with 20-hour pre-diffusion. Considering the interpretation of zone sizes with disc diffusion for the cephalosporins tested, 20-hour pre-diffusion was superior to direct diffusion.
TI  - Cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. Plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. Values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. In a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. Plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. The data were unsuitable for determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. Ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. All strains of Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of Actinobacillus suis were highly susceptible to the drug (MIC less than 4 micrograms/ml). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (MIC 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be highly resistant to cefadroxil (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Bacteraemia at the University Hospital of the West Indies--a report of 222 cases.
AB  - A total of 222 cases of septicaemia was recorded at the University Hospital of the West Indies between June 1982 and June 1983. This gave an overall incidence of 16.1 per 1000 admissions. The 233 bacterial strains isolated comprised 100 Gram-positive and 133 Gram-negative organisms with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus being the most frequent. Highest rates of septicaemia were recorded in patients less than 1 year and over 50 years of age. Septicaemia caused by Gram-positive organisms was predominantly a disease of children whereas that caused by Gram-negative organisms arose more often in neonates and in patients over 50 years of age. A predisposing factor was noted in 104 patients of whom 42 had neoplastic disease. The most frequently identified initial sites of infection were the respiratory tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the meninges. Most blood stream infections were community-acquired, three quarters of all septicaemic patients being admitted to the departments of medicine or paediatrics. There were 11 cases of polymicrobial septicaemia caused predominantly by Gram-negative organisms in patients with underlying disease. Appropriate antimicrobial drugs were administered to 57% of septicaemic patients whereas 17% received superfluous antimicrobial therapy. In those patients who received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy there was a marked increase in mortality. Forty of 61 deaths were attributed to septicaemia. Mortality from septicaemia caused by Gram-negative organisms was 21% compared with 13% for that caused by Gram-positive organisms. The organisms associated with the highest case fatality rates were Escherichia coli, 53%; Enterobacter sp., 27%; and beta-haemolytic streptococci 24%. There were no deaths from septicaemia caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella sp. or Serratia sp. The highest mortality rates were associated with neoplastic disease, diabetes, polymicrobial septicaemia, urinary tract infections and old age.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Susceptibility of equine bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobic susceptibility patterns of commonly isolated aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens of equine origin were determined, using the agar-plate dilution method. All organisms were recent clinical isolates and included Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, (coagulase positive) Staphylococcus sp, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Actinobacillus sp, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella. In vitro susceptibility levels were outlined for 14 antimicrobics as follows: amikacin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, ampicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, amoxicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, cefadroxil less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, chloramphenicol less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, erythromycin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, gentamicin less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, kanamycin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, penicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, tetracycline less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, ormetoprim/sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml, sulfadiazine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, and trimethoprim/sulfadiazine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. The majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. One hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. The clinical response rates, by organism, were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); Haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, Pseudomonas sp, Klebsiella sp, Citrobacter sp, and Morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and Staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). In the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. Adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other US trials of the drug. The findings indicate that ceftizoxime, 1 to 2 gm BID, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients. This low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.
TI  - Direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  - In a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (Bennett MA-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (APHA guidelines) dilutions. The paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (P less than 0.001). Seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. The direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) CFU/ml. High densities of organisms frequently were found. Sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. The contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum. Fermenters were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Enterobacter agglomerans. Infrequently, gram-positive Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were noted.
TI  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of parenteral moxalactam in infants and children.
AB  - Thirty-four infants and children ranging in age from 2.5 to 180 months (mean, 40  months) were treated with parenteral moxalactam (150 mg/kg per day) for suspected or proved bacterial infections outside the central nervous system. Six patients infected with Haemophilus influenzae b, nine infected with Staphylococcus aureus, three infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, one infected with Streptococcus pyogenes, one infected with Enterobacter aerogenes, one infected with Fusobacterium nucleotum, and one infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis, microaerophilic streptococcus, and Propionibacterium sp. were clinically and bacteriologically cured. One patient with polymicrobial pansinusitis did not respond to moxalactam. No patients developed meningitis. All of the isolates tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 5 micrograms of moxalactam per ml, except for one Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate which was resistant to greater than 20 micrograms/ml. Five patients had transient neutropenia which resolved after the drug was discontinued. The mean peak serum level was 106 micrograms/ml at 15 min after a 50-mg/kg dose. The mean elimination half-life was 91.2 min. These data indicate that this dosage of moxalactam is a safe and effective treatment for bacterial infections outside the central nervous system.
TI  - Clinical trials with cefoperazone in the field of internal medicine in Japan.
AB  - A total of 466 patients were treated with cefoperazone. The drug was usually administered by drip infusion of 2 to 4 gm/day. Therapy was described as markedly effective and moderately effective in 64 of 77 patients (83.1%) treated for urinary tract infections; 253 of 316 patients (80.1%) treated for respiratory infections; 37 of 48 patients (77.1%) treated for liver biliary duct infections; ten of 16 patients (62.5%) treated for septicemia; and seven of nine patients (77.8%) being treated for other infections. Overall, cefoperazone was effective 79.6% of all patients treated. With respect to bacteriological activity, the overall eradication rate for gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp, and Proteus sp) was 81% (182/225) and for gram-positive (Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis) 90% (36/40). Of 205 patients who failed to respond to previous antibiotic therapy, 67.8% were treated effectively with cefoperazone. Side effects, such as skin eruption, pyrexia and diarrhea, occurred in only 4.8% of patients treated, while laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and eosinophil values, occurred in only 6.4% of the treated patients. None of these abnormal values were of clinical significance.
TI  - Quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  - Quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. Broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. These plates were incubated at 37 degrees C overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. After this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. These plates were incubated again at 37 degrees C overnight. The minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. The lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. When compared for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. Both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean MICs of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. However, the MBC for penicillin-resistant S. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. All strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of Streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. Eighty per cent of strains of H. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. Most strains of Enterobacter sp., indole-positive Proteus, Pseudomonas sp., and Serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of fosfomycin in clinical studies.
AB  - Since fosfomycin has behaved in vitro as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, an attempt  has been made to evaluate this behaviour in controlled clinical study carried out at different Spanish hospitals. A total of 959 patients were treated for some of the following infectious clinical processes: gonococcal urethritis, typhoid fever, enterocolitis, acute and chronic urinary tract infections, osteomyelitis, chronic otorrhoea, septicaemia, meningitis, peritonitis, surgical and suppurative infections, bronchitis, pneumonia, pharyngoamygdalitis, burns, endometritis, ocular infection, whooping cough and nasal carriers of S. aureus. The results obtained as a function of the microorganism isolated in these clinical processes in percentage of clinical and bacteriological success have been 96% of the S. aureus infections, 95% of the Streptococcus sp. including S. pneumoniae, 90% of the N. gonorrhoeae infections, 94% of the E. coli infections including enteropathogenic E. coli, 90% of the S. marcescens infections, 76% of the Proteus sp. infections, 72% of the Klebsiella-Enterobacter infections, 66% of P. aeruginosa infections and 78% of the S. typhi infections.
TI  - Microbiological properties of a new cephalosporin, BL-S 339: 7-(phenylacetimidoyl-aminoacetamido)-3-(2-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-5-ylthiomethyl) ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid.
AB  - BL-S 339 is a new broad-spectrum, parenterally effective cephalosporin whose expression of antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected by the nature of the assay medium. When assayed in nutrient agar, BL-S 339 was more active than cephalothin against strains of Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and indole-positive Proteus sp. However, when assayed in Mueller-Hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of cephalothin was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. The in vivo activity of BL-S 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than cephalothin in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. When BL-S 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with cephalothin. BL-S 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as cephalothin. Recovery of BL-S 339 in the urine within the 24-hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of cephalothin.
TI  - Enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (pH 6.0 to 8.2). This effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. The urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (Diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting E. coli and K. pneumoniae even when diluted up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same pH as the urine. Undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable of inhibiting these organisms. The range of pH (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.
