TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == proteolytic and ace-inhibitory activities of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria as affected by different levels of fat, inulin and starter culture.
AB  == in this study, the effects of fat (0.5 %, 3.2 % and 5.0 %), inulin (0.0 and 1.0 %) and starter culture (0.0 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 % and 1.5 %) on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory activity of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria were assessed. proteolytic activities of bacteria were also investigated. yogurts were prepared either using a sole yogurt commercial culture including streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus or bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la5 in addition to yogurt culture. relative degrees of proteolysis were found to be considerably higher in yogurt samples than uht milk as the control. both regular  and probiotic yogurts showed considerable ace-inhibitory activities. results showed that degree of proteolysis was not influenced by different fat contents, while was increased by high concentration of starter culture (1.5 % w/w) and reduced by inulin (1 % w/w). ace-inhibitory activities of yogurt were also negatively affected by the presence of inulin and high levels of fat (5 % w/w). moreover, yogurt containing probiotic bacteria showed higher inhibitory against ace in comparison to the yogurt prepared with non-probiotic strains.

TI  == does maternal perinatal probiotic supplementation alter the intestinal microbiota of mother and child? a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == objectives: maternal probiotic supplementation has been shown to prevent the development of atopic dermatitis (ad) in their offspring. we aimed to investigate whether probiotics in pregnant and breastfeeding mothers altered the colonization pattern and the diversity of the mothers' and children's intestinal microbiota. methods: in a randomized, double-blind trial, women received probiotic milk or placebo from 36 weeks of gestation until 3 months postnatally whilst breastfeeding. the probiotic milk contained lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), l.  acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. stool samples  were collected from the mothers at 30 to 36 weeks gestation and 3 months after birth, and from the child at age 10 days, 3 months, 1 year and 2 years, and bacteria were analysed by quantitative pcr. additionally, stool samples from 3 months old and 2 years old children were characterized using 16s rrna gene deep sequencing to estimate the bacterial classes and genera, and the alpha and beta diversity. results: three months after birth, both the prevalence and the relative abundance of the administered probiotic bacteria were significantly increased among the mothers in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group. only the lgg bacteria colonized the children at 10 days and at 3 months of age. there were no significant differences in the abundance of the administered probiotic bacteria between the groups at 1 and 2 years of age. for the bacterial  classes and genera, and alpha and beta diversity there were no significant differences between the groups. conclusions: different probiotic bacteria seem to have different ability to transfer from the mother to the child. we found no evidence that the probiotics altered the microbial composition or alpha and beta  diversity of the children.

TI  == the effects of probiotics and prebiotics on the fatty acid profile and conjugated linoleic acid content of fermented cow milk.
AB  == the ability of probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and bifidobacterium animalis bb12), to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) in association with streptococcus thermophilus and lb. bulgaricus during milk fermentation has been evaluated in this study. pasteurized cow milk and infant formula were used. infant formula was selected for its high linoleic acid content, for being a source of cla and for its prebiotic compounds, e.g. galacto-oligosaccharides. the microorganisms were not able to increase the cla content of the fermented products under the given experimental conditions. no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) occurred between the cla content in milk and the fermented samples. the cla contents of 10 commercial fermented milk products were determined. the highest cla content was observed in fermented  milk containing only str. thermophilus and lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == plant extract enhances the viability of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus acidophilus in probiotic nonfat yogurt.
AB  == a commercial plant extract (prepared from olive, garlic, onion and citrus extracts with sodium acetate (sa) as a carrier) was evaluated to extend the viability of yogurt starter and probiotic bacteria as a means to enhance the shelf life of live and active culture, probiotic nonfat yogurt. yogurts prepared  from three different formulas (0.5* plant extract, 0.25* sa, or no supplement) and cultures (yogurt starter plus bifidobacterium animalis,lactobacillus acidophilus, or both probiotics) were assessed weekly during 29 days of storage at 5 degrees c. supplemented yogurt mixes had greater buffering capacities than non-supplemented yogurt mixes. at the end of storage, lactobacillus bulgaricus and l. acidophilus counts in supplemented yogurts were greater compared with non-supplemented yogurts. supplementation did not affect streptococcus thermophilus and b. animalis counts. hence the greater buffering capacity of yogurt containing plant extract could enhance the longevity of the probiotics, l. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus, during storage.

TI  == evaluation of culture media for selective enumeration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to test the suitability of transgalactosylated oligosaccharides-mupirocin lithium salt (tos-mup) and mrs-clindamycin-ciprofloxacin (mrs-cc) agars, along with several other culture media, for selectively enumerating bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab)  species commonly used to make fermented milks. pure culture suspensions of a total of 13 dairy bacteria strains, belonging to eight species and five genera, were tested for growth capability under various incubation conditions. tos-mup agar was successfully used for the selective enumeration of both bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and b. breve m-16 v. mrs-cc agar showed relatively good selectivity for lactobacillus acidophilus, however, it also promoted the growth of lb. casei strains. for this reason, mrs-cc agar can only be used as a selective medium for the enumeration of lb. acidophilus if lb. casei is not present in a product at levels similar to or exceeding those of lb. acidophilus.  unlike bifidobacteria and coccus-shaped lab, all the lactobacilli strains involved in this work were found to grow well in mrs ph 5.4 agar incubated under  anaerobiosis at 37 degrees c for 72 h. therefore, this method proved to be particularly suitable for the selective enumeration of lactobacillus spp.

TI  == the effect of yoghurt and its probiotics on blood pressure and serum lipid profile; a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == background and aims: despite strong mechanistic data, and promising results from  in vitro and animal studies, the ability of probiotic bacteria to improve blood pressure and serum lipid concentrations in humans remains uncertain. the aim of this study was to determine the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis bb12, provided in either yoghurt or capsule form, on home blood pressure and serum lipid profile. methods and results: following a 3-week washout period, 156 overweight men and women over 55 y were randomized to a 6-week double-blinded, factorial, parallel study. the four intervention groups were: a) probiotic yoghurt plus probiotic capsules; b) probiotic yoghurt plus placebo capsules; c) control milk plus probiotic capsules; and d) control milk plus placebo capsules. each probiotic test article provided a minimum l. acidophilus la5 and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb12 dose of 3.0 x 10(9) cfu/d. home blood pressure monitoring, consisting of 7-day bi-daily repeat measurements, were collected at baseline and week 6. fasting total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldlc), high density lipoprotein cholesterol  (hdlc), and serum triglyceride were performed at baseline and week 6. when compared to control milk, probiotic yoghurt did not significantly alter blood pressure, heart rate or serum lipid concentrations (p > 0.05). similarly, when compared to placebo capsules, supplementation with probiotic capsules did not alter blood pressure or concentrations of total cholesterol ldlc, hdlc, or triglycerides (p > 0.05). conclusions: the probiotic strains l. acidophilus la5 and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb12 did not improve cardiovascular risk factors.

TI  == short communication: viability of culture organisms in honey-enriched acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type fermented camel milk.
AB  == the aim of this research was to monitor the survival during refrigerated storage  of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 (a), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (b), and streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 (t) in cultured dairy foods made from camel and, for comparison, cow milks supplemented with black locust (robinia pseudoacacia l.) honey and fermented by an acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type culture. two liters of dromedary camel milk and 2 l of cow milk were heated to 90 degrees c and held for 10 min, then cooled to 40 degrees c. one half of both types of milk was fortified with black locust honey at the rate of 5.0% (wt/vol), whereas the other half was devoid of honey and served as a control. the camel and cow milks with and without honey were subsequently inoculated with abt-5 culture and were fermented at 37 degrees c until a ph value of 4.6 was reached. thereafter, the probiotic fermented milks were cooled to 15 degrees c in ice water and were each separated  into 18 fractions that were transferred in sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes. after 24 h of cooling at 8 degrees c (d 0), the samples were stored at refrigeration temperature (4 degrees c). three tubes of all 4 products (i.e., fermented camel and cow milks with and without honey) were taken at each sampling time (i.e., following 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d of storage), and the counts of characteristic microorganisms and those of certain spoilage microbes (yeasts, molds, coliforms, escherichia coli) were enumerated. the entire experimental program was repeated twice. the results showed that addition of black locust honey at 5% to heat-treated camel and cow milks did not influence the growth and  survival of starter streptococci during production and subsequent refrigerated storage of fermented abt milks. in contrast, honey improved retention of viability of b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 in the camel milk-based product during storage at 4 degrees c up to 5 wk. no spoilage organisms were detected in any of  the samples tested in this study. in conclusion, supplementation of cultured dairy foods, especially those made from camel milk, with honey is recommended because honey is a healthy natural sweetener with a variety of beneficial microbiological, nutritional, and sensory properties.

TI  == evaluation of the effect of supplementing fermented milk with quinoa flour on probiotic activity.
AB  == in this work, we investigated the effect of supplementing fermented milk with quinoa flour as an option to increase probiotic activity during fermented milk production and storage. fermented milk products were produced with increasing concentrations of quinoa flour (0, 1, 2, or 3g/100g) and submitted to the following analyses at 1, 14, and 28 d of refrigerated storage: postacidification, bacterial viability, resistance of probiotics to simulated gastrointestinal (gi)  conditions, and adhesion of probiotics to caco-2 cells in vitro. the kinetics of  acidification were measured during the fermentation process. the time to reach maximum acidification rate, time to reach ph 5.0, and time to reach ph 4.6 (end of fermentation) were similar for all treatments. adding quinoa flour had no effect on fermentation time; however, it did contribute to postacidification of the fermented milk during storage. quinoa flour did not affect counts of bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 or lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 during storage, it did not protect the probiotic strains during simulated gi transit, and it did not have a positive effect on the adhesion of probiotic bacteria to caco-2 cells in vitro. additionally, the adhesion of strains to caco-2 cells decreased during refrigerated storage of fermented milk. although the addition of up to 3% quinoa flour had a neutral effect on probiotic activity, its incorporation to fermented milk can be recommended because it is an ingredient with high nutritive value, which may increase the appeal of the product to consumers.

TI  == superior prebiotic and physicochemical properties of novel dextran from weissella cibaria jag8 for potential food applications.
AB  == the dextran produced by dextransucrase from weissella cibaria jag8 was subjected  to physicochemical characterization and assessment of its prebiotic potential. dextran displayed a solubility of 24.5% and a water holding capacity of 352%. the emulsion and flocculation activity of dextran were 89% and 92%, respectively. the degradation temperature (td) of dextran was 353 degrees c. dextran exhibited 33-  and 12-fold less hydrolysis than inulin, in simulated gastric juice (ph 1.0) and  alpha-amylase (ph 7.0), respectively. dextran stimulated the growth of probiotic  bacteria such as bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis, bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus acidophilus significantly and was comparable to that of commercial inulin. however, the growth of e. coli was not enhanced by dextran  or inulin. the dextran used in this study can be used as a potential prebiotic for health benefits.

TI  == effects of probiotic supplementation over 5 months on routine haematology and clinical chemistry measures in healthy active adults.
AB  == use of probiotic-containing foods and probiotic supplements is increasing; however, few studies document safety and tolerability in conjunction with defined clinical end points. this paper reports the effects of 150 days of supplementation with either a single- (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bl-04) or a double-strain (lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07) probiotic on routine haematology and clinical chemistry measures in healthy active adults. pre- to post-intervention changes in laboratory measures were determined and compared between supplement and placebo groups. overall there were few differences in routine haematology and clinical chemistry measures between supplement and placebo groups post-intervention. exceptions included plasma calcium (p=0.03) and urea (p=0.015); however, observed changes were small and within assay-specific laboratory reference ranges. these data provide evidence supporting the use of these probiotic supplements over a period of 5 months in healthy active adults without obvious safety or tolerability issues.

TI  == probiotic bacteria survive in cheddar cheese and modify populations of other lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: starter lactic acid bacteria in cheddar cheese face physico-chemical stresses during manufacture and ageing that alter their abilities to survive and  to interact with other bacterial populations. nonstarter bacteria are derived from milk handling, cheese equipment and human contact during manufacture. probiotic bacteria are added to foods for human health benefits that also encounter physiological stresses and microbial competition that may mitigate their survival during ageing. we added probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei and bifidobacterium animalis subsp.  lactis to full-fat, reduced-fat and low-fat cheddar cheeses, aiming to study their survival over 270 days of ageing and to determine the role of the cheese matrix in their survival. methods and results: probiotic and other lactic acid bacterial populations were enumerated by quantitative pcr using primers specifically targeting the different bacterial genera or species of interest. bifidobacteria were initially added at 10(6) cfu g(-1) cheese and survived variably in the different cheeses over the 270-day ageing process. probiotic lactobacilli that were added at 10(7) cfu g(-1) cheese and incident nonstarter lactobacilli (initially at 10(8) cfu g(-1) cheese) increased by 10- to 100-fold over 270 days. viable bacterial populations were differentiated using propidium monoazide followed by species-specific qpcr assays, which demonstrated that the starter and probiotic microbes survived over ageing, independent of cheese type.  addition of probiotic bacteria, at levels 100-fold below that of starter bacteria, modified starter and nonstarter bacterial levels. conclusions: we demonstrated that starter lactococci, nonstarter lactobacilli and probiotic bacteria are capable of surviving throughout the cheesemaking and ageing process, indicating that delivery via hard cheeses is possible. probiotic addition at lower levels may also alter starter and nonstarter bacterial survival. significance and impact of the study: we applied qpcr to study multispecies survival and viability and distinctly enumerated bacterial species in commercial-scale cheddar cheese manufacture.

TI  == effect of green tea supplementation on the microbiological, antioxidant, and sensory properties of probiotic milks.
AB  == green tea and its constituents are known for a wide range of health-promoting properties. they may exert antimicrobial action but without altering lactic acid  bacteria. the aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of green tea addition on the selected properties of probiotic milks. bioyogurts (fermented with abt-1 coculture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12) and acidophilus milks (fermented with pure l. acidophilus la-5 culture) with addition of 0, 5, 10, or 15% (v/v) green tea infusion (gti) were produced and analyzed for the antioxidant capacity by the "diphenyl picrylhydrazyl" (dpph) and "ferric-reducing antioxidant power" (frap) methods, acidity, the count of starter bacteria, and sensory properties at the 1st, 7th, 14th, and 21st day of cold storage. the 15% addition  of gti to the acidophilus milk significantly reduced the lactic acid production during the whole study. the gti had no impact on the level of s. thermophilus and b. lactis bb-12 in bioyogurts, and its effect on the count of l. acidophilus la-5 depended on the concentration and probiotic milk type. gti similarly and in a dose-dependent manner enhanced the antioxidant capacity of both milk types. there were no significant differences between the sensory notes received for bioyogurts, whereas acidophilus milks with tea were less appreciated by the panelists. in conclusion, green tea could be successfully used as a functional additive for selected probiotic milks enhancing their health benefits, but the proper selection of tea additive and starter culture is recommended.

TI  == short communication: incorporation of inulin and transglutaminase in fermented goat milk containing probiotic bacteria.
AB  == goat milk is a good carrier for probiotic bacteria; however, it is difficult to produce fermented goat milk with a consistency comparable to that of fermented cow milks. it can be improved by the addition of functional stabilizers, such as  inulin, or treatment with transglutaminase. the aim of this study was to determine the effect of cold storage of inulin and microbial transglutaminase on  the viability of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 in fermented goat milk. microbiological analysis included the determination of the probiotic bacteria cell count in fermented milk samples, whereas physico-chemical analysis included the analysis of fat content, titratable acidity, and ph of raw, pasteurized, and fermented goat milk samples.  no positive influence of inulin or microbial transglutaminase on the viability of probiotics in fermented goat's milk samples was observed. nevertheless, the population of probiotics remained above 6 log cfu/g after 8 wk of storage at 5 degrees c.

TI  == microencapsulation of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and lactobacillus acidophilus in cocoa butter using spray chilling technology.
AB  == in the present study, the cells of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bi-01) and lactobacillus acidophilus (lac-04) were encapsulated in cocoa butter using spray-chilling technology. survival assays were conducted to evaluate the resistance of the probiotics to the spray-chilling process, their resistance to the simulated gastric and intestinal fluids (sgf and sif), and their stability during 90 days of storage. the viability of the cells was not affected by microencapsulation. the free and encapsulated cells of b. animalis subsp. lactis  were resistant to both sgf and sif. the micro-encapsulated cells of l. acidophilus were more resistant to sgf and sif than the free cells; the viability of the encapsulated cells was enhanced by 67%, while the free cells reached the detection limit of the method (10(3) cfu/g). the encapsulated probiotics were unstable when they were stored at 20 degrees c. the population of encapsulated l. acidophilus decreased drastically when they were stored at 7 degrees c; only 20%  of cells were viable after 90 days of storage. the percentage of viable cells of  the encapsulated b. animalis subsp.lactis, however, was 72% after the same period of storage. promising results were obtained when the microparticles were stored at -18 degrees c; the freeze granted 90 days of shelf life to the encapsulated cells. these results suggest that the spray-chilling process using cocoa butter as carrier protects l. acidophilus from gastrointestinal fluids. however, the viability of the cells during storage must be improved.

TI  == short communication: survival of the characteristic microbiota in probiotic fermented camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks during refrigerated storage.
AB  == the objective of this study was to monitor the viability during storage of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 (a), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (b), and streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 (t) in probiotic cultured dairy foods made from pasteurized camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks fermented by an abt-type culture. the products manufactured were stored at 4 degrees c for 42d. microbiological analyses were performed at weekly intervals. streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 was the most numerous culture component in all 4 products both at the beginning and at the end of storage. the viable counts of streptococci showed no significant decline in fermented camel milk throughout the entire storage period. the initial numbers of lb. acidophilus la-5 were over 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of strep. thermophilus chcc 742/2130. with the progress of time, a slow and constant decrease was observed in lactobacilli counts; however, the final viability percentages of this organism did not differ  significantly in the probiotic fermented milks tested. the cultured dairy foods made from cow, sheep, and goat milks had comparable b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 counts on d 0, exceeding by approximately 0.5 log10 cycle those in the camel milk-based product. no significant losses occurred in viability of bifidobacteria in fermented camel, cow, and sheep milks during 6wk of refrigerated storage. in conclusion, all 4 varieties of milk proved to be suitable raw materials for the manufacture of abt-type fermented dairy products that were microbiologically safe and beneficial for human consumption. it was suggested that milk from small ruminants be increasingly used to produce probiotic fermented dairy foods. the development of camel milk-based probiotic cultured milks appears to be even more  promising because new markets could thus be conquered. it must be emphasized, however, that further microbiological and sensory studies, technology development activities, and market research are needed before such food products can be successfully commercialized.

TI  == advantageous direct quantification of viable closely related probiotics in petit-suisse cheeses under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions by propidium monoazide--qpcr.
AB  == species-specific quantitative real time pcr (qpcr) alone and combined with the use of propidium monoazide (pma) were used along with the plate count method to evaluate the survival of the probiotic strains lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12, and the bacteriocinogenic and potentially probiotic strain lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei 2a in synbiotic (f1) and probiotic (f2) petit-suisse cheeses exposed throughout shelf-life to in  vitro simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions. the three strains studied showed a reduction in their viability after the 6 h assay. bb-12 displayed the highest survival capacity, above 72.6 and 74.6% of the initial populations, respectively, by plate count and pma-qpcr, maintaining population levels in the range or above 6 log cfu/g. the prebiotic mix of inulin and fos did not offer any additional protection for the strains against the simulated gastrointestinal environment. the microorganisms' populations were comparable among the three methods at the initial time of the assay, confirming the presence of mainly viable and culturable cells. however, with the intensification of the stress induced throughout the various stages of the in vitro test, the differences among the methods increased. the qpcr was not a reliable enumeration method for the quantification of intact bacterial populations, mixed with large numbers of injured and dead bacteria, as confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy results. furthermore, bacteria plate counts were much lower (p<0.05) than with the pma-qpcr method, suggesting the accumulation of stressed or dead microorganisms unable to form colonies. the use of pma overcame the qpcr inability to differentiate between dead and alive cells. the combination of pma and species-specific qpcr in this study allowed a quick and unequivocal way of enumeration of viable closely related species incorporated into probiotic and synbiotic petit-suisse cheeses and under stress conditions.

TI  == impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.
AB  == male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. this is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. in mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have  reduced motility when bacteria are present. in male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been  investigated. the sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. in this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. six different intestinal bacteria, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium bifermentans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. for each bacterium, 50 microl of semen was diluted in 450 microl of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. the experiment was repeated twice. in each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized  design with a split plot over time. also, the ph was measured for each treatment  at 0 and 10 min. the results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (p < 0.0001), but broths containing bifidobacterium or lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. although broth containing salmonella, campylobacter, and bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. broths containing e. coli, clostridium, and lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. however, ph was increased when semen was exposed to the e. coli and campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to bifidobacterium and lactobacillus treatments, ph was reduced. in conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.

TI  == incorporation of soybean by-product okara and inulin in a probiotic soy yoghurt:  texture profile and sensory acceptance.
AB  == background: this study evaluated the effect of inulin and okara flour on textural and sensory properties of probiotic soy yoghurt (sy) throughout 28 days of storage at 4 degrees c. employing a 2(2) design, four formulations of sy produced from soymilk and fermented with an abt-4 culture (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 and streptococcus thermophilus) were studied: sy-c (control); sy-i (with inulin); sy-o (with okara); sy-io (with inulin + okara). results: the addition of okara and the refrigerated storage led to significant differences in the instrumental texture parameters of sy (p < 0.05). inulin and okara did not affect sy sensory acceptability (p > 0.05), but there was a tendency for higher scores in the presence of inulin. on the other hand, the storage period, particularly at 21 days, was unfavourable regarding the acceptance of the different sy. conclusion: the results showed that the addition  of okara flour and the storage were significant factors to increase firmness of the soy yoghurts. sy acceptability was not affected by the incorporation of inulin or okara. these results suggest that okara, discarded as industrial waste, may be used in probiotic soy yoghurt, helping to increase the nutritional and functional properties without altering its acceptability.

TI  == in vitro growth of four individual human gut bacteria on oligosaccharides produced by chemoenzymatic synthesis.
AB  == the present study aimed at examining oligosaccharides (os) for potential stimulation of probiotic bacteria. nineteen structurally well-defined candidate os covering groups of beta-glucosides, alpha-glucosides and alpha-galactosides with degree of polymerization 2-4 were prepared in >100 mg amounts by chemoenzymatic synthesis (i.e. reverse phosphorolysis or transglycosylation). fourteen of the os are not naturally occurring and five (beta-d-glucosyl-fructose, beta-d-glucosyl-xylitol, alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-d-mannose, alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-d-xylose; alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-l-fucose) have recently been synthesized for the first time. these os have not been previously tested for effects of bacterial growth and here the ability of all 19 os to support growth of four gastrointestinal bacteria: three probiotic bacteria bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, and lactobacillus acidophilus, and one commensal bacterium, bacteroides vulgatus has  been evaluated in monocultures. the disaccharides beta-d-glucosyl-xylitol and beta-d-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose noticeably stimulated growth yields of l. acidophilus ncfm, and additionally, beta-d-glucosyl-(1,4)-xylose stimulated b. longum bl-05. alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-glucosamine and alpha-glucosyl-(1,4)-n-acetyl-glucosamine enhanced the growth rate of b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum bl-05, whereas l. acidophilus ncfm and bac. vulgatus  did not grow on these os. alpha-galactosyl-(1,6)-alpha-galactosyl-(1,6)-glucose advanced the growth rate of b. animalis subsp. lactis and l. acidophilus ncfm. thus several of the structurally well-defined os supported growth of beneficial gut bacteria. this reflects a broad specificity of their sugar transporters for os, including specificity for non-naturally occurring os, hence showing promise for design of novel prebiotics.

TI  == the substitution of a traditional starter culture in mutton fermented sausages by lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium animalis.
AB  == common starter cultures used in fermented mutton sausages were substituted by probiotic strains of lactobacillus acidophilus ccdm 476 and bifidobacterium animalis 241a. technological properties of the traditional and the probiotic sausages were compared. the potential probiotic effect was evaluated by enumeration of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in stool samples of 15 volunteers  before and after a 14-day consumption period. the numbers of lactobacilli (10(7)  cfu/g) and bifidobacteria (10(3) cfu/g) in the final product did not affect the technological properties. the use of l. acidophilus as a starter culture was found more beneficial than the use of b. animalis. even after 60 days of storage, high counts of l. acidophilus (10(6) cfu/g) were detected; on the other hand, the counts of b. animalis were under the detection limit. regarding sensory properties, the probiotic products showed better texture, and, curiously, a reduction of the typical smell of mutton. the numbers of lactobacilli in stool samples increased significantly after the consumption of the probiotic sausages.

TI  == impact of inulin and okara on lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium  animalis bb-12 viability in a fermented soy product and probiotic survival under  in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions.
AB  == the effect of inulin and/or okara flour on lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 viability in a fermented soy product (fsp) and on  probiotic survival under in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions were investigated throughout 28 days of storage at 4 degrees c. employing a 2(2) design, four fsp trials were produced from soymilk fermented with abt-4 culture (la-5, bb-12, and streptococcus thermophilus): fsp (control); fsp-i (with inulin, 3 g/100 ml of soymilk); fsp-o (with okara, 5 g/100 ml); fsp-io (with inulin + okara, ratio 3:5 g/100 ml). probiotic viabilities ranged from 8 to 9 log cfu/g during the 28 days of storage, and inulin and/or okara flour did not affect the viability of la-5 and bb-12. bb-12 resistance to the artificial gastrointestinal  juices was higher than for la-5, since the bb-12 and la-5 populations decreased approximately 0.6 log cfu/g and 3.8 log cfu/g, respectively, throughout storage period. even though the protective effect of inulin and/or okara flour on probiotic microorganisms was not significant, when compared to a fresh culture, the fsp matrix improved bb-12 survival on day 1 of storage and may be considered  a good vehicle for bb-12 and could play an important role in probiotic protection against gastrointestinal juices.

TI  == bioactivity of probiotic whey cheese: characterization of the content of peptides and organic acids.
AB  == background: probiotic whey cheeses have been produced for several years. it is recognized that several bacterium-mediated metabolic activities contribute differently to the final sensory and nutritional profiles of dairy products. hence the metabolic activity of probiotic strains in a whey cheese and their contribution to the bioactivity of such matrices were investigated here, including in particular bifidobacterium animalis, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei. results: both l. casei and b. animalis produce lactic and acetic acids, whereas l. acidophilus produce mainly lactic acid; these metabolites may be considered bioprotection factors. water-soluble extracts (wse) obtained from these cheese matrices were subjected to ultrafiltration through a 3 kda cut-off membrane, and the eluted peptides were resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography. different qualitative and quantitative profiles were obtained, depending on the strain. wse were further assayed for their ability to  inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme; the <3 kda fraction exhibited higher activities in the case of l. casei and b. animalis than the control and l. acidophilus. conclusion: whey cheeses with higher nutritional value were those inoculated with l. casei.

TI  == comparison of yacon (smallanthus sonchifolius) tuber with commercialized fructo-oligosaccharides (fos) in terms of physiology, fermentation products and intestinal microbial communities in rats.
AB  == the yacon (smallanthus sonchifolius) tuber was examined with regard to its prebiotic effects compared with commercialized fructo-oligosaccharides (fos). a feed containing 10% yacon tuber, which is equivalent to 5% commercialized fos in  terms of the amount of fructo-oligosaccharides (gf2, gf3 and gf4), was administrated to rats for 28 days. the yacon diet changed the intestinal microbial communities beginning in the first week, resulting in a twofold greater concentration of cecal short-chain fatty acids (scfas). the scfa composition differed, but the cecal ph in rats fed yacon tuber was equal to that in rats fed  fos. serum triglycerides were lower in rats fed yacon compared with rats fed fos  and the control diet. cecal size was greater with the yacon tuber diet compared with the control diet. the abundant fermentation in the intestines created a selective environment for the intestinal microbiota, which included lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium animalis and barnesiella spp. according to identification with culture-independent analysis, 16s rrna gene pcr-dgge combined with cloning and sequencing. barnesiella spp. and b. pseudolongum were only found in the rats fed the yacon diet, while l. acidophilus and b. animalis were found in abundance in rats fed both the yacon and fos diets. the genus barnesiella has not previously been reported to be associated with yacon or fos fermentation. we concluded that the physiological and microbiological effects of the yacon tuber were different from those of fos.  differences in cecal size, blood triglycerides and microbial community profiles including their metabolites (scfas) between the yacon tuber and fos were shown to be more greatly affected by the yacon tuber rather than fos.

TI  == effect of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on insulin resistance in pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == background/objectives: owing to excess body weight and increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines primarily during the third trimester, pregnancy is associated with elevated insulin resistance. to our knowledge, no report is available indicating the effects of probiotic yoghurt consumption on serum insulin levels in pregnant women. this study was designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on insulin resistance and serum insulin levels of iranian pregnant women. subjects/methods: in this randomized controlled clinical trial, 70 primigravida pregnant women with singleton pregnancy at their third trimester were participated. we randomly assigned participants to consume 200 g per day of conventional (n=33) or the probiotic group (n=37) for 9 weeks. the probiotic yoghurt was a commercially available product prepared with the starter cultures of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus, enriched with probiotic culture of two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus la5) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium  animalis bb12) with a total of min 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units. fasting blood  samples were taken at baseline and after 9-week intervention to measure fasting plasma glucose and serum insulin levels. homeostatic model assessment of insulin  resistance (homa-ir) was used to calculate insulin resistance score. results: although consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks did not affect serum insulin levels and homa-ir score, significant differences were found comparing changes in these variables between probiotic and conventional yogurts (changes from baseline in serum insulin levels: +1.2+/-1.2 vs +5.0+/-1.1 muiu/ml, respectively, p=0.02;  and in homa-ir score: -0.2+/-0.3 vs 0.7+/-0.2, respectively, p=0.01). conclusions: it is concluded that in contrast to conventional yogurt, daily consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks maintains serum insulin levels and might help pregnant women prevent developing insulin resistance.

AB  == a validated in vitro model of the large intestine (tim-2), set up with human or pig faeces, was used to evaluate the impact of potentially probiotic lactobacillus amylovorus dsm 16698, administered alone (i), in the presence of prebiotic galactooligosaccharides (gos) (ii), and co-administered with probiotic  bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (bb-12) (iii) on gos degradation, microbial growth (l. amylovorus, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and total bacteria) and metabolite production. high performance anion exchange chromatography revealed that gos degradation was more pronounced in tim-2 inoculated with pig faeces than with human faeces. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiling  of pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes detected a more complex lactobacillus spp. community in pig faecal material than in human faecal inoculum. according to 16s  rrna gene-targeted qpcr, gos stimulated the growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in faecal material from both materials. the cumulative production  of short chain fatty acids and ammonia was higher (p < 0.05) for pig than for human faeces. however, lactate accumulation was higher (p < 0.05) in the human model and increased after co-administration with gos and bb-12. this study reinforced the notion that differences in microbiota composition between target host organisms need to be considered when animal data are extrapolated to human,  as is often done with pre- and probiotic intervention studies.

TI  == the effect of selected synbiotics on microbial composition and short-chain fatty  acid production in a model system of the human colon.
AB  == background: prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics can be used to modulate both the composition and activity of the gut microbiota and thereby potentially affecting host health beneficially. the aim of this study was to investigate the  effects of eight synbiotic combinations on the composition and activity of human  fecal microbiota using a four-stage semicontinuous model system of the human colon. methods and findings: carbohydrates were selected by their ability to enhance growth of the probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm (ncfm) and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bl-04 (bl-04) under laboratory conditions. the most effective carbohydrates for each probiotic were further investigated, using the colonic model, for the ability to support growth of the probiotic bacteria, influence the composition of the microbiota and stimulate formation of short-chain fatty acids (scfa).the following combinations were studied: ncfm with isomaltulose, cellobiose, raffinose and an oat beta-glucan hydrolysate (obgh) and bl-04 with melibiose, xylobiose, raffinose and maltotriose. all carbohydrates showed capable of increasing levels of ncfm and bl-04 during fermentations in the colonic model by 10(3)-10(4) fold and 10-10(2)  fold, respectively. also the synbiotic combinations decreased the modified ratio  of bacteroidetes/firmicutes (calculated using qpcr results for bacteroides-prevotella-porphyromonas group, clostridium perfringens cluster i, clostridium coccoides - eubacterium rectale group and clostridial cluster xiv) as well as significantly increasing scfa levels, especially acetic and butyric acid, by three to eight fold, as compared to the controls. the decreases in the modified ratio of bacteroidetes/firmicutes were found to be correlated to increases in acetic and butyric acid (p=0.04 and p=0.03, respectively). conclusions: the results of this study show that all synbiotic combinations investigated are able to shift the predominant bacteria and the production of scfa of fecal microbiota in a model system of the human colon, thereby potentially being able to manipulate the microbiota in a way connected to human health.

TI  == gut balance, a synbiotic supplement, increases fecal lactobacillus paracasei but  has little effect on immunity in healthy physically active individuals.
AB  == synbiotic supplements, which contain multiple functional ingredients, may enhance the immune system more than the use of individual ingredients alone. a double blind active controlled parallel trial over a 21 d exercise training period was conducted to evaluate the effect of gut balance, which contains lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (l. casei 431(r)), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (bb-12(r)), lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5(r)), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lgg(r)), two prebiotics (raftiline and raftilose) and bovine whey derived lactoferrin and immunoglobulins with acacia gum on fecal microbiota, short chain  fatty acids (scfa), gut permeability, salivary lactoferrin and serum cytokines. all subjects randomized were included in the analysis. there was a 9-fold (1.2-fold to 64-fold; 95% confidence intervals p = 0.03) greater increase in fecal l. paracasei numbers with gut balance compared with acacia gum supplementation. gut balance was associated with a 50% (-12% to 72%; p = 0.02) smaller increase in the concentration of serum il-16 in comparison to acacia gum  from pre- to post-study. no substantial effects of either supplement were evident in fecal scfa concentrations, measures of mucosal immunity or gi permeability. clinical studies are now required to determine whether gut balance may exert beneficial gi health effects by increasing the recovery of fecal l. paracasei. both supplements had little effect on immunity. twenty two healthy physically active male subjects (mean age = 33.9 +/- 6.5y) were randomly allocated to either daily prebiotic or synbiotic supplementation for 21 d. saliva, blood, urine and fecal samples were collected pre-, mid and post-intervention. participants recorded patterns of physical activity on a self-reported questionnaire.

AB  == background: due to enhanced fat storage primarily during the mid-pregnancy period, pregnancy is associated with elevated levels of lipid profiles. to our knowledge, no reports are available indicating the effects of probiotic yoghurt consumption on serum lipid profiles in pregnant women. objective: this study was  designed to determine the effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on lipid profiles of iranian pregnant women. methods: this randomized single-blinded controlled clinical trial was performed among 70 pregnant women, primigravida, aged 18-30 years old who were carrying singleton pregnancy at their third trimester. subjects were randomly assigned to consume 200 g/d of conventional (n=33) or the probiotic group (n=37) for 9 weeks. the probiotic yoghurt was a commercially available product prepared with the starter cultures of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus, enriched with probiotic  culture of two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus la5) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis bb12) with a total of min 1 x 10(7) colony-forming units. the conventional yoghurt contained the starter cultures of  s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 9-weeks intervention to measure serum lipid profiles. results: although consumption of probiotic yogurt for 9 weeks had been resulted in a significant reduction in serum total- (-53.7 mg/dl, p=0.001), ldl- (-35.2 mg/dl, p=0.006) and hdl-cholesterol levels (-9.8 mg/dl, p=0.002) as well as serum triglyceride concentrations (-42.8 mg/dl, p=0.029), no significant differences were found comparing probiotic and conventional yogurts in terms of their effect on serum lipid profiles. within-group differences in conventional yogurt group revealed a  significant reduction in hdl-cholesterol levels (-8.4 mg/dl, p=0.005) and borderline significant reduction in serum total cholesterol concentrations (-21.6 mg/dl, p=0.08). conclusion: in conclusion, consumption of probiotic yogurt among  pregnant women could not affect serum lipid profiles as compared to the conventional yogurt.

TI  == evaluation of chitoligosaccharides effect upon probiotic bacteria.
AB  == the main objective of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial effect  - through the determination of minimum inhibitory (and lethal) concentrations, as well as the possible prebiotic potential of chitooligosaccharides (cos) - through the determination of growth curves, on bifidobacterium animalis bb12, bifidobacterium animalis bo and lactobacillus acidophilus ki. atomic force microscopy was further used to obtain high resolution images of cos effects upon  the cell morphology. our results demonstrate that cos do not stimulate the growth of those strains, neither the strains are capable of using cos as a primary source of carbon. analysis of morphology when exposed to inhibitory/bactericidal  concentrations, suggested that cos do not exert any direct damage upon the bacteria structure, instead the bacteria are apparently covered by cos, which likely prevent nutrient uptake.

TI  == the effect of probiotics on faecal microbiota and genotoxic activity of faecal water in patients with atopic dermatitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == background: colonic microbiota is involved in the etiology of colon cancer according to several reports. studies also indicate that the microbiota differs between atopic patients and healthy subjects. objective: to evaluate whether a probiotic mix containing lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37, lactobacillus acidophilus 74-2, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dgcc 420 can affect  the microbiota and its genotoxic activity in healthy subjects and patients with atopic dermatitis (ad). methods: a placebo-controlled cross-over study was conducted. fifteen healthy adults and 15 adult ad patients consumed 2x100 ml/d of either a probiotic or a placebo drink for 8 weeks followed by a wash out period of 2 weeks before crossing the intervention. faecal water was isolated from stool samples collected at the end of each period. ht29c19a cells incubated with faecal water were measured for dna damage using single-cell gel electrophoresis ("comet  assay"). bacterial species were determined by qpcr and concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were measured by means of gas chromatography. results: probiotic supplementation resulted in a significant increase in lactobacilli, whereas numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroidetes remained unchanged. clostridium perfringens cluster i-ii was significantly reduced in healthy subjects. genotoxic potential (expressed as tail intensity) of faecal water, was  not affected. however, tail intensity decreased significantly in the probiotic period compared to placebo (23.5 vs. 16.7%) in ad patients. although faecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids were not affected, faecal ph was significantly reduced (7.0 vs. 6.6) in ad patients after probiotics. conclusion:  the results indicate that probiotics lower the genotoxic potential of faecal water in ad patients. the faecal c. perfringens cluster i-ii levels remained unaffected suggesting either a change in their activity, or the fact that other bacterial species are responsible for the reduced genotoxic activity of faecal water.

TI  == effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on inflammatory factors in pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == previous studies have shown that inflammatory factors increases in pregnancy and  is associated with several complications of pregnancy. the aim of this study was  to assess effects of daily consumption of probiotic yoghurt on inflammatory factors in pregnant women. in a randomized clinical trial, seventy primigravid (the first pregnancy) and singleton pregnant women aged 18-30 years were assigned to two groups. subjects consumed daily 200 g probiotic yoghurt containing lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and bifidobacterium animalis bb12 (10(7) cfu g(-1)  for each) or 200 g conventional yoghurt for 9 weeks. fasting blood samples were collected at baseline (28 weeks of gestation) and after intervention (37 weeks of gestation). inflammatory factors, hs-crp and tnf-alpha, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). independent t-test was used to compare the two groups after intervention and paired-sample t-test compared variables before and after treatment. the results showed that the probiotic yogurt brought  about a decrease in the serum hs-crp level, from 10.44 +/- 1.56 to 7.44 +/- 1.03  microg ml(-1) (p = 0.041). there was no significant change in the conventional yogurt group in the serum hs-crp level (12.55 +/- 1.57 to 14.51 +/- 1.62 microg ml(-1), p = 0.202). the probiotic yogurt had no effect on tnf-alpha (from 73.75 +/- 6.59 to 77.91 +/- 5.61 pg ml(-1), p = 0.633). serum tnf-alpha did not change  in the conventional yogurt group (p = 0.134). in conclusion probiotic yogurt significantly decreased hs-crp in pregnant women but had no effect on tnf-alpha.

TI  == analysis of the human intestinal epithelial cell transcriptional response to lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, bifidobacterium lactis and escherichia coli.
AB  == the complex microbial population residing in the human gastrointestinal tract consists of commensal, potential pathogenic and beneficial species, which are probably perceived differently by the host and consequently could be expected to  trigger specific transcriptional responses. here, we provide a comparative analysis of the global in vitro transcriptional response of human intestinal epithelial cells to lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus salivarius ls-33, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 420, and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec). interestingly, l. salivarius ls-33 dce-induced changes were overall more similar to those of b. lactis 420 than to l. acidophilus ncfm, which is consistent with previously observed in vivo immunomodulation properties. in the gene ontology and pathway analyses both specific and unspecific changes were observed. common to all was the regulation of apoptosis and adipogenesis, and lipid-metabolism related regulation by the probiotics. specific changes such as regulation of cell-cell adhesion by b. lactis 420, superoxide metabolism by l. salivarius ls-33, and regulation of mapk  pathway by l. acidophilus ncfm were noted. furthermore, fundamental differences were observed between the pathogenic and probiotic treatments in the toll-like receptor pathway, especially for adapter molecules with a lowered level of transcriptional activation of myd88, trif, irak1 and traf6 by probiotics compared to ehec. the results in this study provide insights into the relationship between probiotics and human intestinal epithelial cells, notably with regard to strain-specific responses, and highlight the differences between transcriptional  responses to pathogenic and probiotic bacteria.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of gastrointestinal survival of lactobacillus amylovorus dsm  16698 alone and combined with galactooligosaccharides, milk and/or bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12.
AB  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus amylovorus dsm 16698 were previously demonstrated in piglets. here, its potential as a human probiotic was studied in  vitro, using the tim-1 system, which is fully validated to simulate the human upper gastrointestinal tract. to evaluate the effect of the food matrix composition on the survival of l. amylovorus dsm 16698 in tim-1, the microorganism was inoculated alone or with prebiotic galactooligosaccharides (gos), partially skimmed milk (psm) and/or commercial probiotic bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 (bb-12). samples were collected from tim-1 for six hours, at one-hour intervals and l. amylovorus populations were enumerated on mrs agar plates with confirmation of identity of selected isolates by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) fingerprinting. the cumulative survival for l. amylovorus alone (control) was 30% at the end of the experiment (t=6h). co-administration of l. amylovorus with gos, psm and/or bb-12 increased its survival in comparison with the control significantly from the 4th hour after ingestion onwards (p<0.05). furthermore, by the use of high performance anion exchange chromatography, both l. amylovorus and bb-12 were observed to promptly degrade gos compounds in samples collected from tim-1, as assessed at t=2h. hence, food matrix composition interfered with survival and growth of l. amylovorus during passage through tim-1, providing leads towards optimization of  probiotic properties in vivo.

TI  == effect of kynurenic acid on the viability of probiotics in vitro.
AB  == probiotics are bacteria that are commercially available as dietary supplements. one of the important properties of probiotics is their ability to survive in the  intestine. recent evidence has identified kynurenic acid (kyna) as a bactericidal constituent of intestinal fluid. these data led us to study the influence of kyna on the viability of selected probiotics. we found that kyna supported the growth  of bacteria in the probiotics acidolac (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium) and lakcid forte (lactobacillus rhamnosus) or retarded the growth of bacteria from the acidolac, biogaia (lactobacillus reuteri protectis),  dicoflor (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg), lacium (lactobacillus plantarum) and trilac (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) probiotics depending on its concentration. kyna did not affect the viability of bacteria from the probiotic linex (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12). our results suggest a potential role of kyna in the regulation of bacterial growth in the digestive system.

TI  == a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis.
AB  == background and aims: to investigate the clinical effect of treatment with lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 (probio-tec ab-25) to maintain remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. methods: patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis in remission - including proctitis and at least one relapse within the last year were randomised (2:1) in  a double-blind placebo-controlled study to probio-tec ab-25 or placebo for 52 weeks. the patients were evaluated clinically, endoscopically and histologically  at entry and if relapsing. no other medication for ulcerative colitis than the study drug was allowed during the study. primary endpoint was maintenance of clinical remission, secondary endpoints comparisons of days to relapse, and safety and tolerability of the study drug. the concentrations of the probiotic bacterial strains in stool were analysed in a subset of patients. results: thirty-two patients were randomised. twenty patients received probio-tec ab-25 and twelve patients received placebo. five patients (25%) in the probio-tec ab-25 group and one patient (8%) in the placebo group maintained remission after 1 year of treatment (p=0.37). the median time to relapse was 125.5days (range 11-391 days) in the probiotic group and 104 days (range 28-369 days) in the placebo group respectively, (p=0.683). probio-tec ab-25 was overall well tolerated. conclusions: in this small randomised placebo-controlled trial no significant clinical benefit of probio-tec ab-25 could be demonstrated in comparison with placebo for maintaining remission in patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis. a difference may be achieved in larger studies, but the clinical significance of  this would be questionable. this study was registered in clinicaltrial.gov (nct00268164).

TI  == impact of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5-containing yoghurt, on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults.
AB  == this randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel dose-response study investigated the impact of 4-week commercial yoghurt consumption supplemented with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb-12) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5) on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults. fifty-eight volunteers were randomly assigned to three different groups: 1. placebo (no probiotic, no starter and no green tea extract); 2. yoptimal (10(9)cfu/100g of bb-12 and la-5 and 40mg  of green tea extract) and 3. yoptimal-10 (10(10)cfu/100g of bb-12, 10(9)cfu/100g  of la-5 and 40mg of green tea extract). these yoghurt products also contained lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (10(7)cfu/100g) and streptococcus thermophilus (10(10)cfu/100g). the quantitative pcr (qpcr) results showed that there were significant increases (p=0.02) in bifidobacteria counts with the yoptimal treatment as compared to baseline. the fecal numbers of b. animalis subsp. lactis and la-5 significantly increased in the two probiotic treatments compared to the placebo treatment. viable counts of fecal lactobacilli were significantly higher (p=0.05) and those of enterococci were significantly lower (p=0.04) after the intervention when compared to placebo. no significant difference was observed between treatments in volunteers' weight, waist girth, blood pressure, fasting plasma triglyceride and hdl-c concentrations, as well as  cholesterol/hdl-cholesterol ratio. however, a significant increase in plasma cholesterol levels was observed in the placebo group (p=0.0018) but the levels remained stable in the two probiotic yoghurt groups. these results show that probiotic strains supplemented in the form of yoghurt remain active during gut transit and are associated with an increase in beneficial bacteria and a reduction in potentially pathogenic bacteria. this trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct00730626.

TI  == beneficial effects of a synbiotic supplement on self-perceived gastrointestinal well-being and immunoinflammatory status of healthy adults.
AB  == the use of synbiotics as health promoters is still poorly defined, and human intervention studies are scarce. this study was designed to evaluate the effects  of a commercialized synbiotic product containing lactobacillus acidophilus la5, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and fructooligosaccharides on the self-reported gastrointestinal well-being and the immunoinflammatory status of healthy human subjects. in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 20 women and 16 men (25-45 years old) received either three tablets per day of the synbiotic product (2.4 x 10(9) colony-forming units/day) or placebo during 6 weeks. gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were evaluated through a self-administered questionnaire. in those subjects suffering from any kind of digestive disturbance (mild dyspepsia,  flatulence, postprandial bloating, constipation, etc.), improvements in symptoms  after product consumption were also evaluated. blood lymphocyte subsets, phagocytic activity, serum c-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, and adhesion molecules concentrations were analyzed prior and after treatment. a significant improvement in overall self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habit was found in the synbiotic group. a marginal effect of treatment (analysis of variance p = .050) was observed with l-selectin, which showed a significant decrease in the synbiotic group (p = .019). in addition, basal l-selectin levels  correlated with final intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1 levels (r = 0.468; p = .050), and basal icam-1 levels tended to correlate negatively with final l-selectin concentration (r = -0.457; p = .056). none of these correlations was found in the placebo group. the rest of the immunological parameters studied were not modified by the intervention. in conclusion, consumption of the synbiotic product improves self-perceived bowel habits and might facilitate a better profile of adhesion molecules in healthy adults.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == [probiotic properties of industrial strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria].
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from the samples of dry microbial substance "vivolac" and identified. the lactic acid bacteria were identified as lactobacillus acidophilus. l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. paracasei. bifidobacteria belonged to the species bifidobacterium animalis. manifestation of biological activity of all studied strains was investigated. it  was shown, that adhesive activity of the studied strains depended on the genus of the strain: lactobacilli manifested medium adhesiveness to buccal epithelium (medium adhesive index 2.07-2.26), bifidobacteria manifested high adhesiveness (medium adhesive index 4.11-4.76). antagonism against pathogenic and opportunistic reference strains was manifested to a greater extent to pseudomonas aeruginosa. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were resistant to aminoglycosides. sensitivity of the studied strains to antibiotics did not depend on the genus and species of microorganism. lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains were capable  to survive in gastric juice and at different concentration of bile, which is promising for development of probiotic preparations on the basis of these strains.

TI  == quantification of live and dead probiotic bacteria in lyophilised product by real-time pcr and by flow cytometry.
AB  == the basic requirement for probiotic bacteria to be able to exert expected positive effects is to be alive; therefore, appropriate quantification methods are crucial. due to disadvantages of conventional microbiological methods, the bacterial quantification based on the nucleic acid detection is increasingly used. the objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility to use propidium monoazide (pma) in combination with real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method or live/dead baclight viability kit in combination with flow cytometry (fcm) for determination of probiotic bacteria in a lyophilised product  containing lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12. in addition, the viability of probiotic bacteria in lyophilised product during 3 months storage was investigated. in the product, the results of  real-time pcr quantification of pma-treated cells did not differ significantly from those of non-treated cells, which indicate that most of the bacterial cells  retained the membrane integrity although they have lost the culturability. the results obtained by fcm analysis were comparable with those by pma real-time pcr. in conclusion, the pma real-time pcr and fcm determination of the viability of probiotic bacteria could complement the plate count method which considers only the culturable part of the population.

TI  == prevention of tnbs-induced colitis by different lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains is associated with an expansion of gammadeltat and regulatory t cells of  intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.
AB  == background: probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (lpls) function. data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (iels). the aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both iels and lpls. methods: balb/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as mix1 (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum), or mix2 (lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). colitis  was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs). probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). colon subpopulations of iels and lpls were assayed by flow cytometry. serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (cba). results: all probiotics colonized the intestine. the 2 mixtures prevented the tnbs-induced intestinal damage, and mix1 was the most effective. the mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in cd4(+) cells of iels and lpls, an increase in gammadeltat cells of iels, and a decrease in gammadeltat cells of lpls. an expansion of t regulatory (treg) cells of iels was induced by mix1 and mix2. both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (il)-10. in addition, mix1 prevented the tnbs-induced increase of il-12 and interferon (ifn)-gamma. conclusions: the 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the tnbs-induced colitis; the l. acidophilus and b. longum mixture was the most effective. other than an involvement of lpls, our results report a novel importance of the iels population in probiotic protection.

TI  == early administration of probiotics alters bacterial colonization and limits diet-induced gut dysfunction and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm pigs.
AB  == following preterm birth, bacterial colonization and enteral formula feeding predispose neonates to gut dysfunction and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec), a serious gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. we hypothesized that administration of probiotics would beneficially influence early bacterial colonization, thereby reducing the susceptibility to formula-induced gut atrophy, dysfunction, and nec. caesarean-delivered preterm pigs were provided total parenteral nutrition (1.5 d) followed by enteral feeding (2 d) with porcine colostrum (colos; n = 5), formula (form; n = 9), or formula with probiotics (form-p; bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus: l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum; n = 13). clinical nec scores were reduced (p < 0.05) in form-p (2.0 +/- 0.2) and colos groups (1.7 +/- 0.5) compared with form pigs (3.4  +/- 0.6). lower nec scores were associated with elevated intestinal weight, mucosa proportion, villus height, rna integrity, and brush border aminopeptidase  a and n activities, and lower gastric organic acid concentration in the form-p and colos groups (p < 0.05). diversity of the mucosa-associated bacteria in the distal small intestine was similar among formula-fed pigs, yet the abundance of specific bacterial groups differed between form-p and form pigs. form-p pigs had  lower colonization density of a potential pathogen, clostridium perfringens, and  had commensal lactobacillus bacteria more closely associated with enterocytes along the villus-crypt axis relative to form pigs. these results suggest that probiotic administration immediately after birth promotes the colonization of a beneficial commensal microbiota capable of limiting the formula-induced mucosal atrophy, dysfunction, and pathogen load in preterm neonates, thereby reducing the incidence and severity of nec.

AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == detoxification of patulin and ochratoxin a, two abundant mycotoxins, by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aim of the present study was to investigate the detoxification of two abundant mycotoxins, namely ochratoxin a (ota) and patulin (pat) which are frequently found in human foods, by lactic acid bacteria. the removal of the two mycotoxins  from liquid medium by thirty different lab strains was analyzed in a screening trial by the use of hplc coupled with uv- or fluorescence detection. two highly effective strains were identified; lactobacillus acidophilus vm 20 caused a decrease of ota by > or = 95% and bifidobacterium animalis vm 12 reduced pat levels by 80%. subsequently experiments showed that the binding of these compounds depends on different parameters, i.e. the concentration of toxins, the  cell density, the ph-value and on the viability of the bacteria. to proof that the decrease of the toxins by lab from liquid medium results in a reduction of their toxic properties, micronucleus (mcn) assays were conducted with a human derived hepatoma cell line (hepg2). indeed, a substantial decrease (39-59%) of ota and pat induced mcn formation was observed with the most effective strains detected in the chemical analyses. furthermore, also the inhibition of the cell division rates by the toxins was significantly reduced. these findings indicate that certain lab strains are able to detoxify the two toxins and may be useful to protect humans and/or animals against the adverse health effects of these compounds.

TI  == the immune system in healthy adults and patients with atopic dermatitis seems to  be affected differently by a probiotic intervention.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria are proposed to alleviate atopic dermatitis (ad) in infants. there are few indications about the effect of probiotics on ad in adults. objective: the purpose of this study was to elucidate the influence of a  probiotic drink containing a combination of the probiotics lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37, lactobacillus acidophilus 74-2 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dgcc 420 (b. lactis 420) in healthy volunteers and in patients with ad on clinical and immunological parameters and their detection in feces. methods: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study was conducted in 15 healthy adults and 15 patients with ad. the probiotic product or  placebo was given over 8 weeks. a 2-week washout period was interconnected before the intervention was crossed. at the end of each period, blood and stool samples  were collected. in patients, the severity of ad was evaluated using the scoring of atopic dermatitis (scorad). results: l. paracasei and b. lactis were recovered in high numbers in feces after supplementation, whereas l. acidophilus marginally increased. in patients, the scorad tended to decrease by 15.5% (p=0.081). major lymphocyte subsets were not affected by the probiotic intervention. however, cd57(+) increased significantly (p=0.034) in healthy subjects after probiotic intake and was not changed in patients, whereas cd4(+)cd54(+) decreased significantly (p=0.031) in patients with ad and remained uninfluenced in healthy  subjects. the expression of cd4(+)cd25(+) t cells was similar in healthy subjects and ad patients. the phagocytic activity of monocytes and granulocytes was significantly increased in healthy subjects after probiotic intervention (p=0.014). conclusion: l. paracasei lpc-37 and b. lactis 420 are able to colonize the intestine transiently. this study reveals that the probiotics differently modulate peripheral immune parameters in healthy subjects and patients with ad.

TI  == effect of a probiotic mixed culture on texture profile and sensory performance of minas fresh cheese in comparison with the traditional products.
AB  == the effect of a mixed probiotic culture on instrumental texture, and on sensorial and related properties of minas fresh cheese during refrigerated storage was investigated. three cheese-making trials were prepared: t1, with the traditional  type o starter culture (lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis + l. lactis subsp. cremoris), t2 with only lactic acid and t3, with lactic acid and the probiotic abt culture (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 + bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 + streptococcus thermophilus). instrumental texture profile analysis and related properties were monitored during storage for up to 21 days. lb. acidophilus and b. animalis were present in high levels throughout storage of cheeses t3, above 6 log cfu.g(-1), threshold required for probiotic activity, and stimulation of the  la-5 growth was observed. cheeses with added probiotic abt culture, as well as those made adding lactic acid only, showed to be less brittle and with more favorable sensorial features, due to higher ph values. results indicated that the use of probiotic abt culture complementary to lactic acid for the purpose of substituting the type o (lc. lactis subsp. lactis + lc. lactis subsp. cremoris) culture, traditionally employed for minas cheese production, is advantageous.

TI  == endogenous beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities from selected probiotic micro-organisms and their role in isoflavone biotransformation in soymilk.
AB  == aim: to compare endogenous beta-glucosidases and beta-galactosidases for hydrolysis of the predominant isoflavone glycosides into isoflavone aglycones in  order to improve biological activity of soymilk. methods and results: beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities of probiotic organisms including lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4461, lactobacillus casei 2607 and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12 in soymilk were evaluated and correlated with the increase in concentration of isoflavone aglycones during fermentation. the concentrations of isoflavone compounds in soymilk were monitored using a varian model high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with an amperometric electrochemical detector. in all micro-organisms, beta-glucosidase activity was found greater than that of beta-galactosidase. there was an increase in the aglycone concentration with incubation time because  of the apparent hydrolytic action on isoflavone glycosides. aglycone concentration in the soymilk with l. acidophilus 4461, l. casei 2607 and b. animalis ssp. lactis bb12, increased by 5.37-, 5.52- and 6.10-fold, respectively, after 15 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the maximum hydrolytic potential was  also observed at 15 h of fermentation for the three micro-organims coinciding with peak activities of the two enzymes. conclusions: beta-glucosidase activity was more than 15 times higher than beta-galactosidase activity in soymilk for each of the micro-organisms during fermentation. beta-glucosidase played a greater role in isoflavone glycoside hydrolysis. significance and impact of the study: screening for beta-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase activities among probiotics in soymilk is important for the improvement of biological activity of  soymilk and in the selection of micro-organisms for use in the growing industry of functional foods and beverages.

TI  == a comparison of changes in the transformation of isoflavones in soymilk using varying concentrations of exogenous and probiotic-derived endogenous beta-glucosidases.
AB  == aims: to compare endogenous and exogenous beta-glucosidases for the hydrolysis of the predominant isoflavone glucosides in soymilk in order to improve the biological activity. methods and results: beta-glucosidase activity of probiotic  organisms, including bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4461 and lactobacillus casei 2607 in soymilk, was evaluated and  was related to the increase in the concentration of isoflavone aglycones during fermentation. the concentrations of isoflavone compounds in soymilk were monitored using a varian model hplc with an amperometric electrochemical detector. the aglycone composition, also known as aglycone equivalent ratio, has  been considered to be important for the delivery of health benefits of isoflavones, and was monitored during the fermentation of soymilk. comparison of  the hydrolytic effectiveness of both exogenous and endogenous enzyme during 4-h incubation in soymilk was conducted using the otieno-shah (o-s) index. results showed that exogenous enzyme exhibited faster rate of isoflavone glucoside hydrolysis than that by endogenous enzyme. highest o-s indices were obtained after 4, 3 and 2 h of incubation with enzyme solution having beta-glucosidase activity of 0.288 u ml(-1), 0.359 u ml(-1) and 0.575 u ml(-1), resulting into aglycone concentration increments of 5.87-, 6.07- and 5.94-fold, respectively. conversely, aglycone concentration in the soymilk with b. animalis ssp. lactis bb12, l. casei 2607 and l. acidophilus 4461 increased by 3.43-, 2.72- and 3.03-fold, respectively, after 4 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. in addition,  the o-s index of endogenous enzyme was much lower than that of the exogenous enzyme over the same 4-h incubation period. optimum aglycone equivalent ratios coincided with highest o-s indices and highest aglycone concentrations in soymilk hydrolysed with exogenous enzyme. the same correlation of o-s indices and highest aglycone concentrations occurred for endogenous enzyme during the 24 h of fermentation. conclusions: obtaining highest aglycone concentration and optimum aglycone equivalent ratio could provide a critical beginning point in clinical trials for the realization of unique health benefits of soy isoflavones. significance and impact of the study: screening for beta-glucosidase activities of probiotics in soymilk and comparing their hydrolytic potentials with that of exogenous beta-glucosidase could find wide applications in the development of different aglycone-rich functional soy beverages.

TI  == microscopic colitis.
AB  == as the diagnosis of microscopic colitis (mc) is made on the basis of histologic criteria, it is crucial to render an accurate microscopic interpretation. features include 20 or more lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells, mixed lamina propria inflammatory infiltrate, and preservation of crypt architecture for both  lymphocytic and collagenous colitis (cc). cc is further characterized by a collagen band at least 10 mum thick. although the pathogenesis of mc is poorly understood, medication-induced toxicity to the colonic mucosa is important to recognize, as medication cessation leads to prompt improvement. if mc is mild, symptomatic treatment is all that is needed, because some cases are self-limiting. budesonide, 9 mg daily for at least 8 weeks, is the best documented treatment of choice for more severe or protracted cases. a 75% response rate has been reported; however, when treatment is discontinued, relapse is common, and longer-term tapering dose therapy often is necessary. there are disadvantages and no advantage to other forms of steroid therapy. cholestyramine, bismuth, and 5-aminosalicylate derivatives appear to be less efficacious but are  reasonable therapeutic options for less severe cases. use of immunosuppressant therapy such as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine should be highly restricted because mc is a benign condition that does not result in other complications. probiotic therapy with lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium animalis has not been shown to be effective in reducing bowel frequency. surgical diversion of the fecal stream can control diarrhea and improve histology but is very rarely indicated and should be reserved for highly selected cases of severely symptomatic steroid-refractory mc.

TI  == selected prebiotics support the growth of probiotic mono-cultures in vitro.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to identify suitable prebiotics for synergistic  combinations with representative probiotics from the lactobacilli and bifidobacterium genera. eleven different types of commercially available carbohydrates and compounds were screened in basal media for their effects on the growth of the probiotic cultures lactobacillus acidophilus lafti l10 (l10), bifidobacterium animalis lactis lafti b94 (b94) and lactobacillus casei lafti l26 (l26). growth of these probiotics was investigated by measuring optical density (od) levels over a period of 48 h. the results of this study showed that all three probiotic strains were able to utilize a range of carbohydrates. maximal growth of l10 was observed in basal medium supplemented with soybean oligosaccharide (sos), followed by fructooligosaccharide (fos) and inulin, while  maximal growth of b94 was observed in basal medium supplemented with sos, followed by raffinose, fos, beta-glucan hydrolysate, inulin and fibregum tan. l26 was shown to exhibit maximal growth in basal medium supplemented with fos followed by inulin, sos, beta-glucan hydrolysate and beta-glucan concentrate. the results of this study indicate that several carbohydrates/compounds can enhance the growth of these representative probiotic strains in vitro.

TI  == canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria agglutinated with concanavalin a.
AB  == twenty-six out of 46 representative lactic acid bacteria (lab) that we isolated from 36 dogs in a previous study were agglutinated by concanavalin a (cona) at a  concentration of 0.1563 mg/ml, while isolates did not agglutinate without the addition of cona. amongst the isolates, l. reuteri, l. mucosae, and e. canintestini agglutinated strongly, while l. gallinarum, l. kitasatonis, l. acidophilus, l. saerimneri, b. animalis ssp. animalis, p. acidilactici, and e. hirae did not agglutinate. cona-agglutination of lab was specifically inhibited by d-glucose, d-galactose, and d-mannose at a concentration of 1.563 mg/ml. among the sugars, cona-agglutination was strongly inhibited by d-mannose, while the inhibition level by d-glucose and d-galactose were lower than that of d-mannose.  cona- agglutination of all the lab isolates was inhibited by d-mannose, except for l. reuteri (one species) and l. mucosae (two species). cona-agglutination of  bifidobacterium spp. was inhibited by only d-mannose. based on our results, cona-agglutination of lab seems to be strain-specific, but not species-specific.

TI  == tetracycline susceptibility of the ingested lactobacillus acidophilus lach-5 and  bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 strains during antibiotic/probiotic  intervention.
AB  == we investigated the effects of oral therapy with doxycycline, a tetracycline group antibiotic, on the gastrointestinal (gi) survival and tetracycline susceptibility of probiotic strains lactobacillus acidophilus lach-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. in addition, the influence of doxycycline therapy on the diversity of the predominant faecal microbiota was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). faecal samples from the antibiotic group (receiving antibiotics and probiotics) and the control group (receiving probiotics only) were analysed for anaerobically and aerobically growing bacteria, bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria as well as for the dominant microbiota. although doxycycline consumption did not have a large impact on gi survival of the probiotics, it had a detrimental effect on the bifidobacteria and on the diversity of the dominant faecal microbiota. a higher proportion of tetracycline-resistant anaerobically growing bacteria and bifidobacteria was detected in the antibiotic group than in  the control group. several antibiotic group subjects had faecal b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12-like isolates with reduced tetracycline susceptibility. this  was unlikely to be due to the acquisition of novel tetracycline resistance determinants, since only tet(w), which is also present in the ingested b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12, was found in the resistant isolates. thus, concomitant ingestion of probiotic l. acidophilus lach-5 and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 with the antibiotic did not generate a safety risk regarding the possible gi transfer of tetracycline resistance genes to the ingested strains.

TI  == probiotic treatment of collagenous colitis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis.
AB  == background: probiotic treatment may be effective in diseases involving gut microflora and intestinal inflammation. in collagenous colitis (cc), a potential  pathogenic role of the gut microflora has been proposed. the effect of probiotic  treatment in cc is unknown. our aim was to investigate the clinical effect of treatment with lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 (ab-cap-10) in patients with cc. materials and methods: patients with cc and diarrhea were in a double-blind placebo-controlled study randomized (2:1) to ab-cap-10 or placebo for 12 weeks. the primary end point was reduction in bowel frequency per week of >or=50%. secondary end points were changes in bowel frequencies, stool consistency, stool weight, histopathology, and abdominal bloating and pain. results: twenty-nine patients were randomized: 21 to probiotics and 8 to placebo. reduction in bowel frequency per week of >or=50% occurred in 6 of 21 (29%) and in 1 of 8 (13%) patients receiving probiotic and placebo, respectively (p = 0.635). no differences between treatments were observed regarding the secondary end points. post hoc analysis showed a median reduction in bowel frequency per week from 32 (range 18-84) to 23 (range 11-56; p < 0.005), a reduction in number of days with liquid stools per week from 6 days (range 0-7 days) to 1 day (range 0-7 days; p < 0.005), and an increase in number  of days with solid stools per week (p < 0.05) in the ab-cap-10 group. conclusions: ab-cap-10 had no significant effect on the chosen end points. post hoc analysis demonstrated amelioration of clinical symptoms in the ab-cap-10 group, indicating that probiotic treatment may potentially influence the disease  course of cc.

TI  == a dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study of probiotics.
AB  == a dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. the dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees c, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. the model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (bifidobacterium  animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus kefir, lactobacillus kefirgranum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. five strains were not  able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at ph 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. two strains (bifidobacterium animalis atcc 25527 and lactobacillus johnsonii la-1 ncc 533) showed good survival with both methods. the dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper gi tract  transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to ph levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

TI  == effects of feeding a probiotic preparation (sim) containing inulin on the severity of colitis and on the composition of the intestinal microflora in hla-b27 transgenic rats.
AB  == an overly aggressive immune response to the intestinal microflora in a genetically susceptible host background has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. we measured the impact of a probiotic preparation (sim) containing inulin on the severity of colitis and on intestinal microflora profiles of hla-b27-beta(2)-microglobulin transgenic (tg) rats. sim is a mixture  of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and inulin. two-month-old tg rats received either sim or water. control tg rats received metronidazole, alone or in combination with sim, for 8 weeks. nontransgenic rats received sim or water. the  cecal content was removed for analysis of the intestinal microflora by pcr combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. the colon was scored for histological evidence of inflammation, colonic myeloperoxidase activity and interleukin-1beta rna levels were measured photometrically or by real-time quantitative pcr. at 4 months, the colonic inflammation of tg rats treated with sim was histologically diminished compared to that in untreated tg rats (2.2 +/-  0.2 versus 2.9 +/- 0.1; p </= 0.03). the administration of sim altered the microflora profiles of tg rats by increasing the diversity and stimulating specifically the growth of bifidobacterium animalis. the probiotic bacteria added to sim were below the detection level in cecal stool samples at the end of the study period. the administration of sim resulted in a measurable impact on the cecal microflora profiles of tg rats with attenuation of colitis. the lack of detection of any added probiotic bacteria in the cecal content suggests that prebiotic inulin is the major effective compound.

TI  == relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. methods and results: hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, b. animalis and enterococcus faecalis. we also determined the number of immunoglobulin (ig)a+, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha+, interleukin (il)-6+ and il-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to balb/c mice.  all strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. no correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. when some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation  to liver was observed. the oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1))  and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. the differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. conclusions: indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. however, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. significance and impact of the study: the immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. the ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of il-6 by il-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.

AB  == growth and metabolism of five probiotic strains with well-documented health effects were studied in ultra-high temperature (uht) treated milk, supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) tryptone or 0.75% (w/v) fructose. the probiotic strains were lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lb. acidophilus 1748, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg,  lactobacillus reuteri sd 2112 and bifidobacterium animalis bb12. fermentation was followed for 72 h at 37 degrees c and the samples were analysed for ph, log cfu ml(-1), volatile compounds, organic acids and carbon dioxide. the strains reduced ph from 6.7 to between 3.9 and 4.4 after 24 h of incubation. all strains attained viable cell counts above 8.7-9.18 log cfu ml(-1) after 6-16 h of incubation. the  two lb. acidophilus strains showed a stable level of viable cells during 12-72 h  of incubation but the three other strains showed a reduction of 0.4-1.1 log cfu ml(-1) from 24 to 72 h of incubation. however, all strains showed cell levels between 7.8 and 8.7 log cfu ml(-1) after 72 h of incubation. after 48 h of incubation, the amount of lactic acid produced varied according to strain from 6949 to 14,000 mg kg(-1) and acetic acid produced varied from 0 to 6901 mg kg(-1). three of the strains metabolised citrate but only low amounts of diacetyl and acetoin were detected within strains, 0.2-0.8 and 6.5-10 mg kg(-1), respectively. carbon dioxide produced varied from 221 to 3942 mg kg(-1) and was connected to the citrate-fermenting ability of the strain used and their carbohydrate fermentation pathway. three of the strains produced detectable levels of acetaldehyde and the concentration varied from 9.4 to 12.6 mg kg(-1) after 24 h of incubation. all five probiotic strains showed very different profiles of metabolites during fermentation; however, the two lb. acidophilus strains were the most alike. our findings show the importance of controlling the  fermentation time since the probiotic strains produced different amounts of metabolic products according to fermentation time.

TI  == effects of different probiotic strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on bacterial translocation and liver injury in an acute liver injury model.
AB  == septic complications represent frequent causes of morbidity in liver diseases and following hepatic operations. most infections are caused by the individual own intestinal microflora. the intestinal microflora composition is important in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the human gastrointestinal tract, but their influence on liver in different situations is unclear. we therefore studied the effect of different lactobacillus strains and a bifidobacterium strain on the extent of liver injury, bacterial translocation and intestinal microflora in an acute liver injury model. sprague-dawley rats were divided into five groups: acute liver injury control, acute liver injury + b. animalis nm2, acute liver injury + l. acidophilus nmi, acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and acute liver injury + l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 and l. plantarum dsm 9843. the bacteria were administered rectally daily for 8 days. liver injury was induced on the 8th day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg bw). samples were collected 24 h after the liver injury. liver enzymes and bilirubin serum levels, bacterial translocation (to arterial and portal blood, liver and mesenteric lymph nodes (mlns)), and intestinal microflora were evaluated. l. acidophilus nm1; l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, and l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 decreased bacterial translocation compared to the liver injury control group. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes. the levels of alanine aminotransferase (alat) were significantly lower in the l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103, l. rhamnosus dsm 6594 + l. plantarum dsm 9843 groups compared to the liver injury group. the l. rhamnosus and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum groups significantly reduced alat levels compared to the b. animalis group. all administered bacteria decreased the enterobacteriaceae count in the cecum and colon. administration of different lactobacilli and a bifidobacterium strain in an acute liver injury rat model, has shown different effects on bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus,  and l. rhamnosus + l. plantarum reduced bacterial translocation and hepatocellular damage. b. animalis nm2 increased bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes and did not affect hepatocellular damage.

TI  == a probiotic strain of l. acidophilus reduces dmh-induced large intestinal tumors  in male sprague-dawley rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria strains were examined for their influence on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced intestinal tumors in 100 male sprague-dawley  rats. lactobacillus acidophilus (delvo pro la-1), lactobacillus rhamnosus (gg), bifidobacterium animalis (cscc1941), and streptococcus thermophilus (dd145) strains were examined for their influence when added as freeze-dried bacteria to  an experimental diet based on a high-fat semipurified (ain-93) rodent diet. four  bacterial treatments were compared: l. acidophilus, l. acidophilus + b. animalis, l. rhamnosus, and s. thermophilus, the bacteria being added daily at 1% freeze-dried weight (10(10) colony-forming units/g) to the diet. trends were observed in the incidence of rats with large intestinal tumors for three treatments: 25% lower than control for l. acidophilus, 20% lower for l. acidophilus + b. animalis and l. rhamnosus treatments, and 10% lower for s. thermophilus. large intestinal tumor burden was significantly lower for treated rats with l. acidophilus than for the control group (10 and 3 tumors/treatment group, respectively, p = 0.05). large intestinal tumor mass index was also lower  for the l. acidophilus treatment than for control (1.70 and 0.10, respectively, p < 0.05). other treatments showed no statistically significant change from control for these indexes of tumorigenesis. for rats fed l. acidophilus, no adenocarcinomas were present in the colons. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial chromosomal dna fragments was used to differentiate introduced (exogenous) bacterial strains from indigenous bacteria of the same genera present in the feces. survival during gut passage and displacement of indigenous lactobacilli occurred with introduced l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus gg during the probiotic treatment period. however, introduced strains of b. animalis and s. thermophilus were not able to be isolated from feces. it is concluded that this strain of l. acidophilus supplied as freeze-dried bacteria in the diet was protective, as seen by a small but significant inhibition of tumors within the rat colon.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == biotherapeutic effects of probiotic bacteria on candidiasis in immunodeficient mice.
AB  == four species of probiotic bacteria were assessed for their capacities to protect  athymic bg/bg-nu/nu and euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice from mucosal and systemic candidiasis. each bacterial species and candida albicans colonized the gastrointestinal tracts of both strains of mice. the presence of probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus casei gg, or bifidobacterium animalis) in the gastrointestinal tracts prolonged the survival of adult and neonatal bg/bg-nu/nu mice compared to that of isogenic mice colonized with c. albicans alone. the incidence of systemic candidiasis in bg/bg-nu/nu mice was significantly reduced by each of the four probiotic bacterial species. the numbers of c. albicans present in the alimentary tracts of euthymic bg/bg-nu/+ mice were significantly reduced by l. casei gg and b. animalis. none of the probiotic bacteria species completely prevented mucosal candidiasis, but b. animalis reduced its incidence and severity. probiotic bacteria also modulated antibody- and cell-mediated immune responses to c. albicans. the prolonged survival of mice, decreased severity of mucosal and systemic candidiasis, modulation of immune responses, decreased number of c. albicans in the alimentary tract, and reduced numbers of orogastric infections demonstrated not only that probiotic bacteria have biotherapeutic potential for prophylaxis against and therapy of this fungal disease but also that probiotic bacteria protect mice from candidiasis by a variety of immunologic (thymic and extrathymic) and nonimmunologic mechanisms in this model.

TI  == colonization of congenitally immunodeficient mice with probiotic bacteria.
AB  == we assessed the capacity of four probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus casei gg, and bifidobacterium animalis) to colonize, infect, stimulate immune responses in, and affect the growth and survival of congenitally immunodeficient gnotobiotic beige-athymic (bg/bg-nu/nu)  and beige-euthymic (bg/bg-nu/+) mice. the bacteria colonized and persisted, in pure culture, in the alimentary tracts of both mouse strains for the entire study period (12 weeks). although all adult and neonatal beige-euthymic mice survived probiotic colonization, some infant mortality occurred in beige-athymic pups born to mothers colonized with pure cultures of l. reuteri or l. casei gg. the probiotic bacteria manifested different capacities to adhere to epithelial surfaces, disseminate to internal organs, affect the body weight of adult mice and the growth of neonatal mice, and stimulate immune responses. although the probiotic species were innocuous for adults, these results suggest that caution and further studies to assess the safety of probiotic bacteria for immunodeficient hosts, especially neonates, are required.

TI  == antiproliferative effect of fermented milk on the growth of a human breast cancer cell line.
AB  == in vivo and in vitro studies have shown an antitumor activity of lactobacilli in  colon cancer, and some epidemiologic studies have indicated a reduced risk of breast cancer in women who consume fermented milk products. we studied the direct effect of milk fermented by five bacteria strains (bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium animalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus paracasei) on the growth of the mcf7 breast cancer cell line. our results showed a growth inhibition induced by all fermented milks, even though b. infantis and l. acidophilus were the most effective (85% inhibition after 9 days). the antiproliferative effect was not related to the presence of bacteria in fermented milk, and neither whole milk (crude or ultrahigh temperature sterlizied) nor its main fractions (lactalbumin or beta-lactoglobulin fraction) affected cell growth. our findings suggest the presence of an ex novo soluble compound produced by lactic acid bacteria during milk fermentation or the microbial transformation of some milk components in a biologically active form. although the mechanism of the antitumor activity is not clear, the present study  suggests the potentiality offered by fermented milk as producers of compounds with antiproliferative activity useful in the prevention and therapy of solid tumors like breast cancer.
