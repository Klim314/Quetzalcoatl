TI  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterium diversity in horse feces, revealed by pcr-dgge.
AB  == lactobacillus equi, lactobacillus hayakitensis, lactobacillus johnsonii, and weissella confusa/cibaria were the dominant species in 12 south african horses. the bifidobacterium-group was detected in the feces of only one of the 12 horses. sequencing of the nested-pcr amplicon identified the bifidobacterium-group as parascardovia denticolens. cell numbers of l. equi, l. hayakitensis, and w. confusa/cibaria were consistent in all samples. p. denticolens, bifidodobacterium pseudolongum, and a phylogenetic relative of alloscardovia omnicolens were rarely detected. l. equigenerosi, a dominant species in japanese horses, was detected in the fecal samples of only one horse.
