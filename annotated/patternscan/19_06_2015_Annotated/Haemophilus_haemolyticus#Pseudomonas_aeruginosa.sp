TI  == identification of unknown ocular pathogens in clinically suspected eye infections using ribosomal rna gene sequence analysis.
AB  == dna sequence-based identification of pathogens from ocular samples of patients with clinically suspected eye infections was accomplished using 16s and internal  transcribed spacer (its) ribosomal rna gene sequence analysis. pcr was positive for 24 of 99 samples tested. both culture and 16s rdna sequence analysis identified pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococci and enterobacteriaceae. isolates  misidentified as burkholderia cepacia by biochemical tests were identified as ralstonia mannitolilytica by 16s rdna sequence analysis. sequence analysis identified the following microorganisms from 19 culture-negative samples: haemophilus influenzae, sphingomonas sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus haemolyticus, morganella morganii, mycobacterium sp., chryseobacterium sp., pseudomonas saccharophila (xanthomonas) and the fungus, phaeoacremonium inflatipes.

TI  == bacterial colonization in suspected sexually abused children.
AB  == objective: previous studies concluded that symptomatic prepubertal children with  gardnerella vaginalis infection should be investigated for child sexual abuse. gardnerella vaginalis is only one out of a group of organism that cause bacterial vaginosis. the aim of the study was to report the frequency of bacterial colonization as well as sexually transmitted diseases and to correlate these data with patient characteristics. methods: data were collected from 1996 to 2006. medical records of 180 girls, median age at first sexual abuse 7.44 years (range  1-16, sd 3.937), have been evaluated retrospectively. spss software 12.0 has been used for statistical analysis. results: only 18.3% of patients complained of vaginal discharge or pruritus. sexually transmitted diseases were documented: gonorrhoea 1 (1.8%, 56 tested), chlamydia trachomatis 1 (1.6%, 62 tested), syphilis 0 (0%, 5 tested), trichomonas vaginalis 1 (0.7%, 136 tested) and hiv 0 (0%, 27 tested). bacterial colonization were documented (121 tested): gardnerella vaginalis 29 (24%), enterobacteriaceae 50 (41.3%), haemophilus influenzae 11 (9.1%), streptococcus a haemolyticus 35 (28.9%), streptococcus group b 8 (6.6%),  staphylococcus koag neg. 37 (30.6%), staphylococcus aureus 10 (8.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (4.1%), bacteroides 19 (15.7%), prevotella 24 (19.8%), klebsiella 4  (3.3%), corynebacteria 20 (16.5%) and ureaplasma 9 (7.4%). conclusions: sexually  transmitted diseases are infrequent in children suspected for child sexual abuse. bacterial colonization is common, however, not correlated with clinical symptoms  (except for bacteroides) and hymenal/vaginal injuries.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of cp-99,219, a novel azabicyclo-naphthyridone.
AB  == cp-99,219 is a trifluoronaphthyridone with significant antibacterial activity that includes the family enterobacteriaceae (mics for 90% of the strains tested [mic90s], < or = 0.015 to 0.5 micrograms/ml), moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus  influenzae, and gonococci (mics, < or = 0.015 micrograms/ml). legionella spp. were also cp-99,219 susceptible, with mics of 0.008 to 0.12 micrograms/ml. cp-99,219 demonstrated activity greater than that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or enoxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), xanthomonas maltophilia (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 1 microgram/ml), and pneumococci (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). numerous ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were susceptible to cp-99,219, a new compound showing potential value for further in vivo trials.

TI  == in vitro activity of ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae and all aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or  equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was also active against acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. the mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. all group a and b streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were  inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. all methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the mic90 for staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus haemolyticus and enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; mic90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.

TI  == clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  == a total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of  3 g/die by intramuscular route. pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject  (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. in vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to sa and 7 (16%) were resistant. at the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. in patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: e. coli in 40 cases, s. albus in 16 cases, proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, streptococcus faecalis in 3  cases, streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases.  in vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. at the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  == in in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains  resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of acinetobacter spp. and aeromonas hydrophila. they were also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. other pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. both agents were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher mics. gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and campylobacter coli/jejuni usually  susceptible. both antibiotics had good activity against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. all streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. both antibiotics had little useful activity against the bacteroides fragilis group or bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. clostridium difficile and some other clostridium species were resistant.
