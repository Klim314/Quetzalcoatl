TI  == intestinal microbiota: a source of novel biomarkers in inflammatory bowel diseases?
AB  == the human intestine harbours a complex microbial ecosystem that performs manifold functions important to the nutrition and health of its host. extensive study has  revealed that the composition of the intestinal microbiota is altered in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). the ibd associated intestinal  microbiota generally has reduced species richness and diversity, lower temporal stability, and disruption of the secreted mucus layer structure. multiple studies have identified certain bacterial taxa that are enriched or depleted in ibd including enterobacteriaceae, ruminococcus gnavus, and desulfovibrio (enriched) and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, lachnospiraceae, and akkermansia (depleted). additionally, the relative abundance of some taxa appears to correlate with established markers of disease activity such as enterobacteriaceae (enriched) and lachnospiraceae (depleted). signature shifts in fecal microbial community composition may therefore prove to be valuable as diagnostic biomarkers, particularly for longitudinal monitoring of disease activity and response to treatments.

TI  == dysbiosis of the faecal microbiota in patients with crohn's disease and their unaffected relatives.
AB  == background and aims: a general dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been established in patients with crohn's disease (cd), but a systematic characterisation of this dysbiosis is lacking. therefore the composition of the predominant faecal microbiota of patients with cd was studied in comparison with  the predominant composition in unaffected controls. whether dysbiosis is present  in relatives of patients cd was also examined. methods: focusing on families with at least three members affected with cd, faecal samples of 68 patients with cd, 84 of their unaffected relatives and 55 matched controls were subjected to community fingerprinting of the predominant microbiota using denaturing gradient  gel electrophoresis (dgge). to analyse the dgge profiles, bionumerics software and non-parametric statistical analyses (spss v.17.0) were used. observed differences in the predominant microbiota were subsequently confirmed and quantified with real-time pcr. results: five bacterial species characterised dysbiosis in cd, namely a decrease in dialister invisus (p=0.04), an uncharacterised species of clostridium cluster xiva (p = 0.03), faecalibacterium  prausnitzii (p < 1.3 x 10(-)(5)) and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p = 5.4 x 10(-)(6)), and an increase in ruminococcus gnavus (p = 2.1 x 10(-)(7)). unaffected relatives of patients with cd had less collinsella aerofaciens (p = 0.004) and a member of the escherichia coli-shigella group (p = 0.01) and more ruminococcus torques (p = 0.02) in their predominant microbiota as compared with  healthy subjects. conclusion: unaffected relatives of patients with cd have a different composition of their microbiota compared with healthy controls. this dysbiosis is not characterised by lack of butyrate producing-bacteria as observed in cd but suggests a role for microorganisms with mucin degradation capacity.
