TI  == pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of panax ginseng against the adhesion of helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. in this study, this acidic polysaccharide from p. ginseng, pg-f2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/ml. however, results showed no inhibitory effects of pg-f2 against lactobacillus acidophilus,  escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. pg-f2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean mw of 1.2 x 10(4) da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. the complete hydrolysis of pg-f2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (ec. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor pg-f2 (the mic of ca. 0.01 mg/ml against h. pylori and p. gingivalis). our results suggest that pg-f2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.

TI  == specific antibiotics in the treatment of periodontitis--a proposed strategy.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present study was to propose a strategy for the selection of antibiotics that specifically target complexes of periodontal pathogens present in patients with periodontitis. methods: seven hundred seventy-four (774) patients with various forms of periodontitis were included in  the study. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest periodontal pockets in each quadrant using a sterile curet, and pooled. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, tannerella  forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were identified by polymerase chain reaction, and the prevalence of combinations of these pathogens  was determined. to each pathogen complex (pc), i.e., combination of pathogens, those antibiotics were assigned that were most specific according to the published minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values and the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) concentrations achievable in vivo. antibiotic gcf concentrations had to be at least 10 times the mic90 values, and the narrowest spectrum was selected with respect to the assessed periodontal pathogens. results: nine major pcs (each > or = 3% of all patients) were found in 73.4% of all patients, whereas 38 minor pcs (each < 3% of all patients) were distributed in 26.6% of all patients. ten different antibiotic regimens were found to be specific for the total of 46 pcs; i.e., metronidazole and amoxicillin in 11 pcs (55.0% of all patients), metronidazole and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or metronidazole and ciprofloxacin in 13 pcs (18.9%), amoxicillin in 4 pcs (8.3%), doxycycline in 2 pcs (6.1%), metronidazole in 8 pcs (4.1%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 3 pcs (2.9%), clindamycin in 2 pcs (1.5%), ciprofloxacin in 2 pcs (0.4%), and tetracycline in 1 pc (0.3%). conclusion: the results of the study indicate that there are at least 46 different combinations of the assessed periodontal pathogens in subjects with periodontitis, and at least 10 different antibiotic regimens might be required to specifically target the various pathogen complexes.

TI  == endpoint quantitative pcr assays for bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background: conventional polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for periodontal pathogens are so sensitive that they detect infections of no clinical significance. quantitative pcr (qpcr) may provide a solution to this problem. however, most qpcr systems require expensive real-time thermal cyclers. objective: our goal was to develop qpcr assays which would allow endpoint quantification. materials and methods: 16s rrna primers for bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were adapted to the amplifluor qpcr system, which incorporates fluorescein into the pcr product so that endpoint fluorescence is proportional to the original amount of template. dna dilutions representing known numbers of cells were used as standard curves. pooled subgingival plaques from the four deepest pockets of 21 severe adult periodontitis patients were assayed. buccal molar supragingival plaque from 35 dental students provided healthy controls. endpoint fluorescence was measured with a microplate reader. results: optimized standard curves were linear in log-log or semilog fits over a range of 100-10(6) cells. countable b. forsythus was present in all patients, with counts (as logs) from 2.4 to 7.3 (mean = 5.0), and 11 controls with counts from 2.1 to 4.5 (mean = 3.0). p. gingivalis was present in 11 patients and no controls, with counts from 2.2 to 4.7 (mean = 3.2). a. actinomycetemcomitans was present in two patients, with counts of 1.5 and 3.5. conclusions: amplifluor qpcr assays discriminated between  plaque samples differing by one log or more, allowing major infections to be distinguished from minor ones. this approach allows high-throughput qpcr of plaque samples, using equipment available to many laboratories.

TI  == regulation of matrix metalloproteinase production by cytokines, pharmacological agents and periodontal pathogens in human periodontal ligament fibroblast cultures.
AB  == matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). produced by both infiltrating and resident cells of the periodontium, play a role in physiologic and pathologic events. it is recognized that an imbalance between activated mmps and their endogenous inhibitors leads to pathologic breakdown of the extracellular matrix during periodontitis. to date, little is known about the regulation of mmp synthesis and secretion in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (pdlfs). the purpose of this  study was to examine the effects of cytokines, pharmacological agents (protein synthesis inhibitor and protein kinase c inhibitors) and predominant periodontal  pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis) on  mmp production in human pdlfs using gelatin zymography. the gelatin zymograms revealed that the main gelatinase secreted by human pdlfs migrated at 72 kda and  represents mmp-2. minor gelatinolytic bands were also observed at 92 kda regions  that correspond to mmp-9. we found that a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and il-1alpha can elevate mmp-2 secretion in human pdlfs. these results indicate  that periodontal pathogens and inflammatory cytokines play an important role in tissue destruction and disintegration of extracellular matrix in periodontal diseases. thus, activation of mmps may be one of the distinct host degradative pathways in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. in addition, h7, staurosporine, cycloheximide and tgf-beta could suppress mmp-2 production. agents that target protein synthesis or the protein kinase c pathway in human pdlfs inhibit mmp-2 production, and such inhibition may contribute to the pathogenesis of periodontal inflammation. taken together, these findings suggest a possible new therapeutic approach, involving the use of drugs that modify host-response mechanisms to suppress or inhibit mmp-mediated tissue destruction.

TI  == untreated periodontal disease in indonesian adolescents. clinical and microbiological baseline data.
AB  == at present, several risk factors for the initiation and progression of periodontitis have been identified. in order to investigate the role of various potential clinical and microbiological risk factors and indicators, a longitudinal study was initiated in a young population deprived from regular dental care. the present communication describes the baseline cross-sectional data obtained in 1987 in terms of the clinical periodontal condition and prevalence of periodontal bacteria in the oral cavity. all inhabitants in the age range 15-25 years of a village with approximately 2000 inhabitants at a tea estate on western java, indonesia, were examined clinically and microbiologically. in total, 255 adolescents, comprising 130 males and 125 females participated in the study. samples for bacteriological examination were taken from the gingiva, the dorsum of the tongue, and the saliva. plaque index, bleeding upon probing, pocket depth, and attachment loss (al) were scored on the  approximal surfaces from the vestibular aspect of all teeth as well as the mid-vestibular and mid-lingual aspects of the ramfjord teeth. calculus was scored only on the 4 surfaces of the ramfjord teeth. following the clinical measurements, the deepest bleeding pocket with no clinical loss of attachment was sampled for microbiological examination. in addition, in 37 subjects a deep bleeding (> or = 4 mm) with at least 4 mm of attachment loss was sampled. moderate periodontitis (max. al 3-4 mm) was found in 26% of the population, advanced periodontitis (max. al > or = 5 mm) in 8%, whereas 66% of the population showed no or minor periodontitis (max. al 0-2 mm). actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found in 57% of the population, porphyromonas gingivalis in 87%, prevotella intermedia and motile rods in all cases and spirochetes in 89%. p. gingivalis (66%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (37%) and spirochetes (63%) were, of all the sampled sites of the oral cavity, most frequently detected in pockets without attachment loss. motile rods were most prevalent on the tongue and in the saliva (92% and 89%, respectively). a high prevalence of the investigated periodontal bacteria was detected both in the pockets without and with attachment loss. no significant association between the  clinical periodontal parameters and the prevalence of the microorganisms was observed at a patient level. at a site level, both p. gingivalis and spirochetes  were more prevalent in sites with attachment loss. the actual role of these putative periodontal pathogens may be elucidated more extensively, when longitudinal data on the present population become available.

TI  == periodontitis patient and the spouse: periodontal bacteria before and after treatment.
AB  == suspected periodontal pathogens can be transmitted between spouses. the treatment response may be unsuccessful in periodontitis patients, if the spouse harbors these bacteria. the aim of the present 6-month follow-up study was to clarify whether the microbiological treatment outcome of periodontitis patients is related to the detection of suspected periodontal pathogens in the saliva of the  spouse. 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and their spouses were included in the study. the patients received mechanical periodontal treatment and 500 mg metronidazole systemically 2x a day for 7 days. the presence of visible plaque, gingival bleeding after probing, suppuration, supragingival and subgingival calculus and pocket depths were assessed at baseline and 1 and 6 months after treatment. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus and peptostreptococcus micros were cultured from pooled subgingival samples from the  patients and from salivary samples from the spouses at corresponding occasions. periodontal conditions in the patients improved after treatment as determined by  the significantly lower values of clinical variables 1 and 6 months after treatment compared to those at baseline. however, the re-emergence of periodontal bacteria after treatment of the patients was not related to the concurrent detection of the respective bacteria in the saliva of the spouses. in this study  design, it seemed that the salivary bacterial load in the spouse was of minor importance for the microbiological treatment outcome of the patient.

TI  == semiquantitative analysis of periodontopathogens by gene amplification.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, which are known as major causative organisms of periodontitis, were semiquantitatively identified by two-step polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the sets of specific primers for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were prepared on the basis of the nucleotide sequences of the lkta and the fima genes, respectively. the set of universal primers for eubacteria was designed from the nucleotide sequence of  a highly conserved region in the eubacterial 16s rrna sequence. the number of bacteria detectable by one-step pcr assay was no fewer than 10(3) cells. less than 10(3) bacterial cells were detectable by two-step pcr assay. subgingival plaque samples from 37 sites of 16 patients were obtained with paperpoints and analyzed by two-step pcr assay. more than 2 x 10(6) bacterial cells were found in the subgingival plaque samples from all diseased sites. in contrast, the number of total bacteria in those from more than half of healthy sites estimated by pcr  assay was less than 2 x 10(6) cells, suggesting that subgingival plaque in diseased sites consists of a relatively larger number of bacteria compared with the population in healthy sites. while a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in both healthy and diseased sites, p. gingivalis was observed only in diseased sites. both periodontopathic bacteria occupied a minor part (less than 0.1%) of the total subgingival plaque bacteria.

TI  == interdental supragingival plaque--a natural habitat of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that suspected periodontal pathogens form a minor component of the supragingival plaque of individuals without periodontal diseases. twenty-one dental hygienist trainees with a mean age of 23.5 years were twice sampled for interdental plaque between 1st and 2nd molars in all quadrants. the samples were assessed for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and the prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens group of organisms. bacteria of this group were predominantly p. nigrescens and showed both the highest prevalence (100%) and the highest colonization density of the investigated species. seven of 21 samples harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans. serotypes a, b, and c were found in three samples each, while serotype e was present in one sample. three subjects had two different a. actinomycetemcomitans  serotypes. bacteroides forsythus and c. rectus were detected in 10 (48%) and nine (43%) subjects, respectively. the detected cell numbers accounted for approximately 0.01% to 1% of the sampled flora. in contrast, p. gingivalis was found only in a single sample, which in addition harbored b. forsythus, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes b and e), and p. intermedia. these results suggest that the investigated periodontal bacteria are not "exogenous pathogens", but amphibiotic, opportunistic microorganisms which may have a natural habitat in the supragingival plaque of the interproximal area of molars.

TI  == levels of salivary iga antibodies reactive with bacteria from dental plaque are associated with susceptibility to experimental gingivitis.
AB  == serum igg, iga and igm and salivary iga antibody levels reactive with extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eubacterium  saburreum and streptococcus mutans, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay in samples from 12 persons before, during and after experimental gingivitis. the participants refrained from cleaning their teeth until 50% of their gingival units showed bleeding after gentle probing, but not longer than 15 days. samples were taken from serum and saliva, before and during the period of experimental gingivitis, and up to 8 weeks after the start of the experiment. a pattern with minor fluctuations in specific serum and salivary antibody activities was consistently found in all patients. this indicates that immunoregulatory mechanisms succeed in maintaining unchanged antibody levels when plaque load increases. a subgroup of participants with low mean numbers of bleeding gingival units after plaque accumulation, showed significantly higher salivary iga antibody levels reactive with s. mutans, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. saburreum, as compared with the subgroup reaching high bleeding after probing scores (p < 0.05). when 1 person with outlying values (p < 0.05) for p. gingivalis was excluded from the tests, the former group also showed statistically significant higher salivary antibody levels to this bacterial species. high levels of salivary iga directed against bacteria in dental plaque might thus protect against the development of gingivitis.

TI  == microbiological and clinical monitoring of non-localized juvenile periodontitis in young adults: a report of 11 cases.
AB  == it has been shown that patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) often harbor actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in the subgingival area. however, little is known of the oral microflora in non-ljp juvenile periodontitis patients with less extensive disease. the purpose of this study was to describe the microflora and clinical parameters of young adults with minor to moderate periodontitis during treatment for a period of 1 year. eleven patients 15 to 16 years of age were studied. all of them had 4 to 8 mm loss of attachment at minimally one site, but the typical clinical description of localized juvenile periodontitis was an exclusion criterion in this study. microbiological examination of the deepest periodontal pocket and of the tongue revealed that 6 patients harbored actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and 5 harbored porphyromonas gingivalis. almost all subjects showed relatively high proportions  of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, motile organisms, and spirochetes. on the basis of clinical and microbiological parameters the 11 patients could be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. six cases had moderate periodontal breakdown with loss of attachment at 7 to 44 sites. all harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans and 5 of them p. gingivalis. these 6 cases responded relatively well to initial treatment despite the continued presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. the other group consisted of 5 cases with relatively minor periodontal breakdown; i.e, 1 or 2 sites with 4 to 6 mm loss of attachment. neither a. actinomycetemcomitans nor p. gingivalis was detected in the deepest pocket of these patients. all 5 responded well to initial treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
