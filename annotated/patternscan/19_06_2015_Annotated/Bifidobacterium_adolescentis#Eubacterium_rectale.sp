TI  == disrupted intestinal microbiota and intestinal inflammation in children with cystic fibrosis and its restoration with lactobacillus gg: a randomised clinical  trial.
AB  == background & aims: intestinal inflammation is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis (cf). administration of probiotics can reduce intestinal inflammation and the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations. we investigated the composition of intestinal microbiota in children with cf and analyzed its relationship with intestinal inflammation. we also investigated the microflora structure before and after lactobacillus gg (lgg) administration in children with cf with and without antibiotic treatment. methods: the intestinal microbiota were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). intestinal inflammation was assessed by measuring fecal calprotectin (clp) and rectal nitric oxide (rno) production in children with cf as compared with healthy controls. we  then carried out a small double-blind randomized clinical trial with lgg. results: twenty-two children with cf children were enrolled in the study (median  age, 7 years; range, 2-9 years). fecal clp and rno levels were higher in children with cf than in healthy controls (184+/-146 microg/g vs. 52+/-46 microg/g; 18+/-15 vs. 2.6+/-1.2 micromol/l no2 (-), respectively; p<0.01). compared with healthy controls, children with cf had significantly different intestinal microbial core structures. the levels of eubacterium rectale, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were reduced in children with cf. a similar but more extreme pattern was observed in children with cf who were taking antibiotics. lgg administration reduced fecal clp and partially restored intestinal microbiota. there was a significant correlation between reduced microbial richness and intestinal inflammation. conclusions: cf causes qualitative and quantitative changes in intestinal microbiota, which may represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of cf. administration of probiotics restored gut microbiota, supporting the efficacy of probiotics in reducing intestinal inflammation and pulmonary exacerbations. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct 01961661.

TI  == ruminococcus bromii is a keystone species for the degradation of resistant starch in the human colon.
AB  == the release of energy from particulate substrates such as dietary fiber and resistant starch (rs) in the human colon may depend on the presence of specialist primary degraders (or 'keystone species') within the microbial community. we have explored the roles of four dominant amylolytic bacteria found in the human colon  in the degradation and utilization of resistant starches. eubacterium rectale and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron showed limited ability to utilize rs2- and rs3-resistant starches by comparison with bifidobacterium adolescentis and ruminococcus bromii. in co-culture, however, r. bromii proved unique in stimulating rs2 and rs3 utilization by the other three bacterial species, even in a medium that does not permit growth of r. bromii itself. having previously demonstrated low rs3 fermentation in vivo in two individuals with undetectable populations of r. bromii-related bacteria, we show here that supplementation of mixed fecal bacteria from one of these volunteers with r. bromii, but not with the other three species, greatly enhanced the extent of rs3 fermentation in vitro. this argues strongly that r. bromii has a pivotal role in fermentation of  rs3 in the human large intestine, and that variation in the occurrence of this species and its close relatives may be a primary cause of variable energy recovery from this important component of the diet. this work also indicates that r. bromii possesses an exceptional ability to colonize and degrade starch particles when compared with previously studied amylolytic bacteria from the human colon.

TI  == arabinoxylans and inulin differentially modulate the mucosal and luminal gut microbiota and mucin-degradation in humanized rats.
AB  == the endogenous gut microbiota affects the host in many ways. prebiotics should favour beneficial intestinal microbes and thus improve host health. in this study, we investigated how a novel class of potential prebiotic long-chain arabinoxylans (lc-ax) and the well-established prebiotic inulin (in) modulate the gut microbiota of humanized rats. six weeks after axenic rats were inoculated with a human faecal microbiota, their colonic microbiota was similar to this inoculum ( approximately 70%), whereas their caecal microbiota was enriched with  verrucomicrobia and firmicutes concomitant with lower abundance of bacteroidetes. moreover, different bifidobacterium species colonized the lumen (b. adolescentis) and mucus (b. longum and b. bifidum). both lc-ax and in increased scfa levels and induced a shift from acetate towards health-promoting propionate and butyrate respectively. by applying a high-resolution phylogenetic micro-array (hitchip) at the site of fermentation (caecum), in and lc-ax were shown to stimulate bacterial groups with known butyrate-producers (roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, anaerostipes caccae) and bifidobacteria (b. longum) respectively. prebiotic administration also resulted in lower caecal abundances of the mucin-degrading akkermansia muciniphila and potentially more mucin production by  the host. both factors might explain the increased caecal mucin levels for lc-ax  (threefold) and in (sixfold). these mucins were degraded along the colon, resulting in high faecal abundances of akkermansia muciniphila for lc-ax and especially in-treated rats. finally, the microbial changes caused an adaptation period for the host with less weight gain, after which the host fine-tuned the interaction with this altered microbiota. our results demonstrate that next to in, lc-ax are promising prebiotic compounds by stimulating production of health-promoting metabolites by specific microbes in the proximal regions. further, prebiotic supplementation shifted mucin degradation to distal regions, where mucin-degraders may produce beneficial metabolites (e.g. propionate by akkermansia muciniphila), so that prebiotics may potentially improve gut health along the entire length of the intestine.

TI  == resistant starches types 2 and 4 have differential effects on the composition of  the fecal microbiota in human subjects.
AB  == background: to systematically develop dietary strategies based on resistant starch (rs) that modulate the human gut microbiome, detailed in vivo studies that evaluate the effects of different forms of rs on the community structure and population dynamics of the gut microbiota are necessary. the aim of the present study was to gain a community wide perspective of the effects of rs types 2 (rs2) and 4 (rs4) on the fecal microbiota in human individuals. methods and findings: ten human subjects consumed crackers for three weeks each containing either rs2,  rs4, or native starch in a double-blind, crossover design. multiplex sequencing of 16s rrna tags revealed that both types of rs induced several significant compositional alterations in the fecal microbial populations, with differential effects on community structure. rs4 but not rs2 induced phylum-level changes, significantly increasing actinobacteria and bacteroidetes while decreasing firmicutes. at the species level, the changes evoked by rs4 were increases in bifidobacterium adolescentis and parabacteroides distasonis, while rs2 significantly raised the proportions of ruminococcus bromii and eubacterium rectale when compared to rs4. the population shifts caused by rs4 were numerically substantial for several taxa, leading for example, to a ten-fold increase in bifidobacteria in three of the subjects, enriching them to 18-30% of  the fecal microbial community. the responses to rs and their magnitudes varied between individuals, and they were reversible and tightly associated with the consumption of rs. conclusion: our results demonstrate that rs2 and rs4 show functional differences in their effect on human fecal microbiota composition, indicating that the chemical structure of rs determines its accessibility by groups of colonic bacteria. the findings imply that specific bacterial populations could be selectively targeted by well designed functional carbohydrates, but the inter-subject variations in the response to rs indicates that such strategies might benefit from more personalized approaches.

TI  == linking phylogenetic identities of bacteria to starch fermentation in an in vitro model of the large intestine by rna-based stable isotope probing.
AB  == carbohydrates, including starches, are an important energy source for humans, and are known for their interactions with the microbiota in the digestive tract. largely, those interactions are thought to promote human health. using 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)-based stable isotope probing (sip), we identified starch-fermenting bacteria under human colon-like conditions. to the microbiota of the tim-2 in vitro model of the human colon 7.4 g l(-1) of [u-(13)c]-starch was added. rna extracted from lumen samples after 0 (control), 2, 4 and 8 h was subjected to density-gradient ultracentrifugation. terminal-restriction fragment  length polymorphism (t-rflp) fingerprinting and phylogenetic analyses of the labelled and unlabelled 16s rrna suggested populations related to ruminococcus bromii, prevotella spp. and eubacterium rectale to be involved in starch metabolism. additionally, 16s rrna related to that of bifidobacterium adolescentis was abundant in all analysed fractions. while this might be due to the enrichment of high-gc rna in high-density fractions, it could also indicate an active role in starch fermentation. comparison of the t-rflp fingerprints of experiments performed with labelled and unlabelled starch revealed ruminococcus bromii as the primary degrader in starch fermentation in the studied model, as it was found to solely predominate in the labelled fractions. lc-ms analyses of the  lumen and dialysate samples showed that, for both experiments, starch fermentation primarily yielded acetate, butyrate and propionate. integration of molecular and metabolite data suggests metabolic cross-feeding in the system, where populations related to ruminococcus bromii are the primary starch degrader, while those related to prevotella spp., bifidobacterium adolescentis and eubacterium rectale might be further involved in the trophic chain.

TI  == selective colonization of insoluble substrates by human faecal bacteria.
AB  == insoluble plant polysaccharides and endogenous mucin are important energy sources for human colonic microorganisms. the object of this study was to determine whether or not specific communities colonize these substrates. using faecal samples from four individuals as inocula for an anaerobic in vitro continuous flow system, the colonization of wheat bran, high amylose starch and porcine gastric mucin was examined. recovered substrates were extensively washed and the  remaining tightly attached bacterial communities were identified using polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s rrna gene sequences and fluorescent in situ hybridization. the substrate had a major influence on the species of attached bacteria detected. sequences retrieved from bran were dominated by clostridial cluster xiva bacteria, including uncultured relatives of clostridium hathewayi, eubacterium rectale and roseburia species. bacteroides species were also detected. the most abundant sequences recovered from starch were related to the cultured species ruminococcus bromii, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve and e. rectale. the most commonly recovered sequences from  mucin were from bifidobacterium bifidum and uncultured bacteria related to ruminococcus lactaris. this study suggests that a specific subset of bacteria is  likely to be the primary colonizers of particular insoluble colonic substrates. for a given substrate, however, the primary colonizing species may vary between host individuals.

TI  == molecular monitoring of the fecal microbiota of healthy human subjects during administration of lactulose and saccharomyces boulardii.
AB  == diet is a major factor in maintaining a healthy human gastrointestinal tract, and this has triggered the development of functional foods containing a probiotic and/or prebiotic component intended to improve the host's health via modulation of the intestinal microbiota. in this study, a long-term placebo-controlled crossover feeding study in which each subject received several treatments was performed to monitor the effect of a prebiotic substrate (i.e., lactulose), a probiotic organism (i.e., saccharomyces boulardii), and their synbiotic combination on the fecal microbiota of three groups of 10 healthy human subjects  differing in prebiotic dose and/or intake of placebo versus synbiotic. for this purpose, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicons was used to detect possible changes in the overall bacterial composition using the universal v(3) primer and to detect possible changes at the subpopulation level using group-specific primers targeting the bacteroides fragilis subgroup, the genus bifidobacterium, the clostridium lituseburense group (cluster xi), and the clostridium coccoides-eubacterium rectale group (cluster xiva). although these populations remained fairly stable based on dgge profiling, one pronounced change was observed in the universal fingerprint profiles after lactulose ingestion. band position analysis and band sequencing revealed that a band appearing or intensifying following lactulose administration could be assigned to the species bifidobacterium adolescentis. subsequent analysis with real-time pcr (rt-pcr) indicated a statistically significant increase (p < 0.05)  in total bifidobacteria in one of the three subject groups after lactulose administration, whereas a similar but nonsignificant trend was observed in the other two groups. combined rt-pcr results from two subject groups indicated a borderline significant increase (p = 0.074) of b. adolescentis following lactulose intake. the probiotic yeast s. boulardii did not display any detectable universal changes in the dgge profiles, nor did it influence the bifidobacterial  levels. this study highlighted the capacity of an integrated approach consisting  of dgge analysis and rt-pcr to monitor and quantify pronounced changes in the fecal microbiota of healthy subjects upon functional food administration.

TI  == genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.

TI  == lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

TI  == predominant gram-positive bacteria in human feces: numbers, variety, and persistence.
AB  == the predominant gram-positive bacteria in 47 fecal specimens from 10 healthy men  were studied by microscopic and cultural counts, by the characterization and tentative identification of isolates, and by the use of fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-conjugated globulins prepared using some of the isolates. gram-positive bacteria averaged 10(10.5+/-0.4(sd)/g (wet weight) of feces with significant variation from host to host. characterization of 865 isolates, all strict anaerobes and carbohydrate fermenters, showed 12 to 39 distinguishable strains from each host and indicated that some strains were present the full period of about 18 months. sixty percent of the isolates belonged to one of five  types, tentatively identified with five species-bifidobacterium adolescentis, eubacterium aerofaciens, e. rectale, peptostreptococcus productus, and ruminococcus bromii. there was distinct host idiosyncrasy in the pattern of estimated counts of these five types. certain strains resembling b. adolescentis, e. aerofaciens, and p. productus, distinguished with fitc conjugates, were resident in their hosts for many months. in direct smears each strain constituted about 1% of the total bacteria.
