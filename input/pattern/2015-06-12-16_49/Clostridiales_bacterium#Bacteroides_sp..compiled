TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus salivarius Ren on cancer prevention and intestinal microbiota in 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat model.
AB  - Probiotics have been suggested as a prophylactic measure in colon cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Lactobacillus salivarius Ren (Ren) in modulating colonic microbiota structure and colon cancer incidence in a rat model after injection with 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (DMH). The results indicated that oral administration of Ren could effectively suppress DMH-induced colonic carcinogenesis. A significant decrease in cancer incidence (87.5% to 25%) was detected in rats fed with a dose of 5 x 1010 CFU/kg bodyweight per day. Using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and Real-time PCR combined with multivariate statistical methods, we demonstrated that injection with DMH significantly altered the rat gut microbiota, while Ren counteracted these DMH-induced adverse effects and promoted reversion of the gut microbiota close to the healthy state. Tvalue biplots followed by band sequencing identified 21 bacterial strains as critical variables affected by DMH and Ren. Injection of DMH significantly increased the amount of Ruminococcus species (sp.) and Clostridiales bacteria, as well as decreasing the Prevotella sp. Administration of Ren reduced the amount of Ruminococcus sp., Clostridiales bacteria, and Bacteroides dorei, and increased the amount of Prevotella. Real-time PCR results were consistent with the results derived by t-value biplots. These findings suggested that Ren is a potential agent for colon cancer prevention. In conclusion, the results in the present study suggest a potential therapeutic approach based on the modulation of intestinal microflora by probiotics may be beneficial in the prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis.
TI  - Characterization of an anaerobic population digesting a model substrate for maize in the presence of trace metals.
AB  - The influence of a defined trace metal solution and additionally Ni(2+) on anaerobic digestion of biomass was investigated. A novel synthetic model substrate was designed consisting of cellulose, starch and urea as carbon and nitrogen source in a ratio mimicking the basic composition of maize silage. Two independent batch fermentations were carried out over 21 d with the synthetic model substrate in the presence of the trace metal solution. Particularly an increase in nickel concentrations (17 and 34 microM) enhanced methane formation by up to 20%. This increased activity was also corroborated by fluorescence microscopy measurements based on cofactor F(420). The eubacterial and methanogenic population was characterized with the single strand conformational polymorphism analysis and the amplified 16S rDNA restriction analysis of 16S rRNA genes amplified by different primer systems. Nearly the half of the analyzed bacteria were identified as Firmicutes while 70% in this phylum belonged to the class of Clostridiales and 30% to the class of Bacilli. Bacteroides and uncultured bacteria represented each a quarter of the analyzed community. Methanogenic archaea were investigated with ARDRA, too. The hydrogenotrophic Methanoculleus sp. was the dominant genus which is commonly described for maize digestion thus confirming the value of the model substrate.
TI  - Enhancement of biogas production by addition of hemicellulolytic bacteria immobilised on activated zeolite.
AB  - Biogas from agricultural biomass and residues is a valuable source of renewable energy. However, recalcitrant plant cell structures represent a barrier in the fermentative biodegradation process in single- and two-stage reactors. Therefore, approaches concerning a more efficient de-polymerisation of cellulose and hemicellulose to monomeric sugars are required amongst others in order to optimise the fermentation efficiency and to increase methane yields. Here we show a new strategy for the enhancement of biogas production from hemicellulose-rich substrates. Hemicellulolytic populations from a common biogas fermenter consortium were successively enriched in batch-cultures using a synthetic medium containing xylan powder as single carbon source under anaerobic mesophilic conditions. Enriched hemicellulolytic bacteria were immobilised on trace metal activated zeolite to ensure a stable storage and easy application. Xylanase activity increased continuously during subsequent enrichment cycles by up to 162%. In batch-culture experiments we were able to observe an increase of methane by 53% compared to controls without additionally introduced microorganisms immobilised on zeolite. Specific enrichment of hemicellulolytic bacteria during the process was confirmed by using single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis based on amplification of the eubacterial 16S rDNA fragments. Using sequence analysis conspicuous bands from SSCP patterns could be identified as belonging to the groups Bacteroides sp., Azospira oryzae (Dechlorosoma sp.) as well as to a wide spectrum of diverse species within the order of Clostridiales (Firmicutes).
TI  - Uncultivated bacteria as etiologic agents of intra-amniotic inflammation leading  to preterm birth.
AB  - Intra-amniotic infection and inflammation are major causes of preterm birth (PTB). However, intra-amniotic inflammation is often detected in the absence of infection. This may partly be due to the culturing methods employed in hospital laboratories, which are unable to detect the uncultivated species. In this study, intra-amniotic microbial infections associated with PTB were examined by both culture and 16S rRNA-based culture-independent methods and were corroborated by the presence of intra-amniotic inflammation. Amniotic fluid (AF) specimens from 46 pregnancies complicated by PTB and 16 asymptomatic women were analyzed. No bacterial DNA was amplified in AF collected from the asymptomatic women. Among the 46 samples associated with PTB, bacterial DNA was amplified from all (16/16) of the culture-positive samples and 17% (5/30) of the culture-negative samples. In the culture-positive group, additional species were detected in more than half (9/16) of the cases by PCR and clone analysis. Altogether, approximately two- thirds of the species detected by the culture-independent methods were not isolated by culture. They included both uncultivated and difficult-to-cultivate species, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Leptotrichia (Sneathia) spp., a Bergeyella sp., a Peptostreptococcus sp., Bacteroides spp., and a species of the order Clostridiales. To examine intra-amniotic inflammation, an AF proteomic fingerprint (mass-restricted score) was determined by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Inflammation was detected in all five samples which were culture negative but PCR positive. Women who were PCR positive more often had elevated interleukin-6 levels in their AF, histological chorioamnionitis, and funisitis and delivered neonates with early-onset neonatal sepsis. Previously unrecognized, uncultivated, or difficult-to-cultivate species may play a key role in the initiation of PTB.
