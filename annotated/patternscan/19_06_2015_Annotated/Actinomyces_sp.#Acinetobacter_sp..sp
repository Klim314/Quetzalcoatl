TI  == microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  == background: knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. objective: the objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. materials and methods: retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were  reviewed. results: cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and  the organisms included staphylococcus aureus 18, streptococci 7, pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of enterobactersp, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of actinomyces israelii, diptheroids, coagulase negative staphylococcus, citrobacter freundii, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. four had polymicrobial infection. culture of purulent  nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. in 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from  the orbit and from cultures from other sites. gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. conclusion: gram-positive cocci, especially s. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. infections by gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of staphylococcal organisms and gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == bacteria with dual resistance to elevated concentrations of heavy metals and antibiotics in nigerian contaminated systems.
AB  == samples of soil, water, and sediments from industrial estates in lagos were collected and analyzed for heavy metals and physicochemical composition. bacteria that are resistant to elevated concentrations of metals (cd(2+), co(2+), ni(2+),  cr(6+), and hg(2+)) were isolated from the samples, and they were further screened for antibiotic sensitivity. the minimum tolerance concentrations (mtcs)  of the isolates with dual resistance to the metals were determined. the physicochemistry of all the samples indicated were heavily polluted. twenty-two of the 270 bacterial strains isolated showed dual resistances to antibiotics and  heavy metals. the mtcs of isolates to the metals were 14 mm for cd(2+), 15 mm for co(2+) and ni(2+), 17 mm for cr(6+), and 10 mm for hg(2+). five strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, actinomyces turicensis, acinetobacter junni, nocardia sp., and micrococcus sp.) resisted all the 18 antibiotics tested. whereas rhodococcus sp. and micrococcus sp. resisted 15 mm ni(2+), p. aeruginosa resisted 10 mm co(2+). to our knowledge, there has not been any report of bacterial strains resisting such high doses of metals coupled with wide range of antibiotics. therefore, dual expressions of antibiotics and heavy-metal resistance make the isolates, potential seeds for decommissioning of sites polluted with industrial effluents rich in heavy metals, since the bacteria will  be able to withstand in situ antibiosis that may prevail in such ecosystems.

TI  == diversity of biosurfactant producing microorganisms isolated from soils contaminated with diesel oil.
AB  == biosurfactant production is a desirable property of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms (hdm). we characterized biosurfactant producing microbial populations from a long beach soil, california (usa) and a hong kong soil (china), contaminated with diesel oil. a total of 33 hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms were isolated from the soils. twelve isolates and three defined consortia were tested for biosurfactant production and emulsification activity. the highest reduction of surface tension was achieved with a consortium of l1, l2 and l3 isolates from a long beach soil (41.4mn m(-1)). isolate l1 (acinetobacter  junii) displayed the highest reduction of surface tension (46.5 mn m(-1)). the emulsifying capacity evaluated by the e24 emulsification index was highest in the culture of isolate l5 (74%). no substantial emulsification was achieved with the  cell-free extracts, indicating that the emulsifying activity was not extracellular. based on surface tension and the e24 index results, isolates f1, f2, f3, f4, l1, l2, l3 and l4 were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing as bacillus cereus, bacillus sphaericus, b. fusiformis, acinetobacter junii, a non-cultured bacterium, pseudomonas sp. and b. pumilus, respectively. cluster analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences of the bacterial isolates revealed 70% similarity amongst hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial community present in both soils. five isolates (isolates f1, f2, f3, f4 and l4) belong to the firmicutes order, two isolates (l1 and l3) belong to the proteobacteria order and one isolate (l2) is an actinomyces sp. simpson's index (1 - d) and the shannon-weaver index (h) revealed more diversity of hdm in the hong kong soil, while evenness (e) and the equitability (j) data indicated that there was not a dominant population. bacterial isolates displaying substantial potential for production of biosurfactants can be applied in the bioremediation of soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons.

TI  == microbiological investigation on black crusts from open-air stone monuments of bologna (italy).
AB  == samples of black crusts taken from open-air stone monuments in bologna dating back to between the twelfth and the nineteenth century were considered. the microbiological test procedures isolated from a high number of chemoorganotrophic bacteria, each of the samples although it was expected to find chemo-lithotrophic (specially sulfur-oxidizing and nitrifying) bacteria on account of the great amounts of sulphur, carbon, nitrogen dioxides and ammonia in the air. sporogenous and asporogenous species were found among the isolated bacteria: the first were recognized as bacillus subtilis, bacillus brevis, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus mycoides and bacillus megaterium; the latter were corynebacterium glutamicum, actinomyces sp., alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, flavobacterium breve, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas stutzeri. these species were differently associated in the samples studied with a frequency of more than sixty-four per cent. this finding leads us  to believe that their presence in the black crusts is not occasional, but the result of an ecologically significant process of colonization. although behavioural tests (solubilization of calcium carbonate, of calcium sulphate and marble dust) did not reveal lithic activity among the bacteria studied, one can presume that their behaviour in nature - as a more or less complex microbial consortium - can be totally different and exert a decomposing action with regard  to several minerals, most of them acidify the media in which they develop.

TI  == [effects of antibiotics and anti-bacterial components of preparations for local treatment of suppurative wounds on pathogens of odonto- genic infections].
AB  == the results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. in the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, veillonella and actinomyces. significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. there was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine  used locally showed satisfactory results. the above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: bacillus coagulans, b.  licheniformis, pseudomonas sp., acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp.

TI  == bacterial flora of the vagina and uterus of healthy cats.
AB  == bacterial culturing was conducted on samples from the reproductive tracts of 53 clinically healthy female cats. aerobic bacteria were isolated from 52 of 53 vaginal swab samples and from 2 of 29 uterine swab samples. anaerobic bacteria were detected in 4 of 30 vaginal and 1 of 29 uterine cultures. the aerobic bacteria included species of acinetobacter, actinomyces, corynebacterium, escherichia, haemophilus, klebsiella, lactobacillus, staphylococcus, and streptococcus. coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus canis, and e coli were the most common organisms and were isolated from 56%, 52%, and 44% of the vaginal samples, respectively. anaerobes isolated from vaginal samples included 3 species of bacteroides and 2 isolates of peptococcus. the single uterine anaerobe isolate was a lactobacillus sp. the number of bacterial species isolated from each vaginal culture ranged from 1 to 8 (mean, 3). the number of colony forming units tended to vary inversely with the number of bacterial species detected in each sample.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
