TI  - The short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects was performed. Bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: No halitosis (identified by VSC assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone, in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. At day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, Fusobacterium sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Tannerella forsythia. A decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: P. gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, S. aureus, and Treponema denticola. Baseline VSC scores were correlated with several bacterial species. The use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of VSC compared to rinsing alone. CONCLUSIONS: VSC scores were not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. The active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. Tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.
TI  - Molecular analysis of bacterial flora associated with chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses.
AB  - Chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. Bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to assess the diversity of the flora present. Washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to PCR amplification of bacterial 16S rDNA using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. The samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. Viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16S rDNA were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). Three sinus samples were positive by both PCR and culture methods, one was positive only by PCR, and one only by culture. Thirteen bacterial species were identified: Abiotrophia defectiva, Enterococcus avium, Eubacterium sp., Granulicatella elegans, Neisseria sp., Prevotella sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus sp. Fungi were not detected. In one patient Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis, and in another patient Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific PCR primers. These results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis cases.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of otorrhea associated with tympanostomy tubes in children.
AB  - The microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. Aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (TT). The middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. Analysis of the 138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28 patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in 20 (36%). There were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. Commonly recovered aerobes were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (11), Proteus sp. (7), Moraxella catarrhalis (6), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (5). Commonly isolated anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), Prevotella sp. (10), Bacteroides sp. (8) and Fusobacterium sp. (6). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of TT-related otorrhea in children. Specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. Reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the TT or through the open perforation after their removal.
TI  - Microbiology and management of sinusitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: The pathophysiology, microbiology, and treatment of acute and chronic sinusitis are reviewed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current literature is reviewed. REVIEW: Sinusitis generally develops as a complication of viral or allergic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. Bacterial pathogens contribute to the inflammatory process-Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are predominant in acute sinusitis, while anaerobic bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus are predominant in chronic sinusitis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has emerged as a potential pathogen in the immunocompromised patients and in those who have nasal tubes or catheters. Many of these organisms recovered from sinusitis became resistant to penicillins either through the production of beta-lactamase (H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, Fusobacterium sp., and Prevotella sp.) or through changes in the penicillin-binding protein (S. pneumoniae). The pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria is expressed directly through their ability to cause infections, and indirectly through the production of beta-lactamase. CONCLUSIONS: The indirect pathogenicity is conveyed not only by surviving penicillin therapy, but also by "shielding" penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. The direct and indirect virulent characteristics of these bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections. Proper therapy, with antimicrobial and decongestants combined when indicated with surgical drainage and correction of pathology, constitutes the cornerstone of management of sinusitis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. SETTING: Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. Aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Escherichia coli (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella sp (n = 3). The most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), Prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; B fragilis and Enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and S aureus and P aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp, with burns. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - Microbiology of secondary bacterial infection in scabies lesions.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were grown from specimens obtained from 30 children with secondarily infected scabies lesions. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 14 (47%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (20%) patients, and a mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 10 (33%) patients. Fifty isolates were recovered (1.7 per specimen); 27 were aerobic or facultative bacteria and 23 were strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (nine isolates), group A streptococci (five isolates), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (nine isolates) and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (four isolates). Single bacterial isolates were recovered from nine (30%) patients; five of these were S. aureus. Sixteen organisms isolated from 12 (40%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to or in contact with the lesions predominated in those infections. Enteric gram-negative rods were recovered in leg and trunk lesions. Group A streptococci and S. aureus predominated in finger and hand lesions. Bacteroides fragilis group and Clostridium sp. were isolated from leg lesions, and pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were recovered from finger lesions. The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected scabies lesions in children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical sites of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - Clinical features and aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis and correlate them with the infection site. DESIGN: Of 342 specimens, 64 obtained using needle aspiration and 278 using swabs were studied over 10 years. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 15 (23%) of the 64 needle aspirates and 259 (93%) of the 278 swab aspirates. The microbial results of the 15 specimens obtained through needle aspiration are separately presented. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 138 (53%) of swab samples, anaerobic bacteria only in 69 (27%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 52 (20%). In total, there were 582 isolates, 247 aerobic or facultative and 335 anaerobic bacteria, with an average of 2.2 isolates per specimen. The predominance of certain isolates in different anatomical sites correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. The highest recovery rates of anaerobes was from the neck, trunk, groin, external genitalia, and leg areas. Aerobes outnumbered anaerobes in the arm and hand. The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis group, Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, and Clostridium sp. Certain clinical findings correlated with the following organisms: swelling and tenderness with Clostridium sp, Prevotella sp, S aureus, and group A streptococci; regional adenopathy with B fragilis group; bulbous lesions with Enterobacteriaceae; gangrene and necrosis with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group, Clostridium sp, and Enterobacteriaceae; foul odor with Bacteroides sp; and gas in tissues with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group and Clostridium sp. Certain predisposing conditions correlated with the following organisms: trauma with Clostridium sp; diabetes with Bacteroides sp, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus; and burn with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of cellulitis.
TI  - Pneumonia in mechanically ventilated children.
AB  - The quantitative aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of bronchial aspirates, obtained using protective brush catheters, from 10 children with ventilator-associated pneumonia, is presented. Aerobic or faculative organisms only were isolated in 1 child, anaerobic bacteria only in 3, and aerobic mixed with anaerobic bacteria in 6. There were 10 aerobic or faculative and 17 anaerobic isolates. The predominant aerobes were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 isolates) and Klebsiella sp. (2). The predominant anaerobes were pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas species (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium sp. and B. fragilis group (2). A total of 10 beta-lactamase-producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 8 patients. All patients except 1 responded to antimicrobial therapy directed against the recovered isolates. These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora isolated from pulmonary specimens of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic suppurative otitis media in children in Surabaya, Indonesia.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of 38 children from Surabaya, Indonesia, who suffered from chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) was studied using strict microbiological methodology. A total of 106 isolates (49 anaerobic and 57 aerobic) were recovered. Aerobic organisms alone were isolated from 11 (29%), anaerobic bacteria only in 4 (11%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were present in 23 (60%). The predominant organisms were Peptostreptococcus sp., Prevotella sp., Bacteroides sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Fusobacterium sp. Thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 22 (58%) patients. These findings demonstrate the role of penicillin resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial etiology of CSOM in children from Indonesia. Judicious use of antimicrobial therapy may prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  - Otitis media (OM) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. A knowledge of the pathogens responsible for OM can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. The microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic OM is reviewed. The major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute OM and half of serous OM cultures are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute OM. The predominant organisms isolated from chronic OM are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, Bacteroides sp, and Fusobacterium sp. Many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing OM can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. The appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.
TI  - The role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  - The effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. Support for the importance of encapsulated Gram-negative anaerobic rods (Bacteroides sp., Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp.), anaerobic and facultative Gram-positive cocci (AFGPC) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, abscesses and blood, compared to their number in the normal flora. The pathogenicity of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, and AFGPC was studied by inoculating them into mice and observing their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses. Encapsulated Bacteroides, Fusobacteria, and AFGPC generally induced abscesses, whereas non-encapsulated organisms did not. However, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (< 1%) survived in the abscesses, and they became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or non-viable encapsulated bacteria. Thereafter, these strains were able to induce abscesses when injected alone. Encapsulated Gram-negative anaerobic rods and AFGPC-induced bacteraemia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the non-encapsulated form of the same strains. As determined by using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative cultures of abscesses induced in mice, possession of a capsule generally made Gram-negative anaerobic rods more important than their aerobic counterparts. Synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated Gram-negative anaerobic rods and all tested aerobic bacteria and most AFGPC, and also between most AFGPC and Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus. These studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
TI  - Anaerobic isolates in chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. Treatment with  carbenicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed in 32 pediatric patients with chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. The aspirate was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Aerobes were isolated from ten patients (31.2%); anaerobes from one patient; and both aerobes and anaerobes from 21 patients (65.6%). There were 46 aerobic isolates. The aerobes commonly recovered were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) Proteus sp. (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (3). There were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and Bacteroides sp., the latter of which included Bacteroides fragilis group and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). The patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). An aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. The clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. There were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. The above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.
