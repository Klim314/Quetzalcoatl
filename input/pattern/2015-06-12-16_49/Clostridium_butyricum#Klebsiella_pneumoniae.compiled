TI  - Unraveling the dha cluster in Citrobacter werkmanii: comparative genomic analysis of bacterial 1,3-propanediol biosynthesis clusters.
AB  - In natural 1,3-propanediol (PDO) producing microorganisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Clostridium sp., the genes coding for PDO producing enzymes are grouped in a dha cluster. This article describes the dha cluster of a novel candidate for PDO production, Citrobacter werkmanii DSM17579 and compares the cluster to the currently known PDO clusters of Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridiaceae. Moreover, we attribute a putative function to two previously unannotated ORFs, OrfW and OrfY, both in C. freundii and in C. werkmanii: both proteins might form a complex and support the glycerol dehydratase by converting cob(I)alamin to the glycerol dehydratase cofactor coenzyme B12. Unraveling this biosynthesis cluster revealed high homology between the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frames of C. werkmanii DSM17579 and those of C. freundii DSM30040 and K. pneumoniae MGH78578, i.e., 96 and 87.5 % identity, respectively. On the other hand, major differences between the clusters have also been discovered. For example, only one dihydroxyacetone kinase (DHAK) is present in the dha cluster of C. werkmanii DSM17579, while two DHAK enzymes are present in the cluster of K. pneumoniae MGH78578 and Clostridium butyricum VPI1718.
TI  - [Effects of probiotics on intestinal bacterial colonization in premature infants].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the possible roles of probiotics in decreasing intestinal bacterial colonization rate and the incidence of enterogenic infections in premature infants. METHODS: Seventy premature infants were randomly assigned to two groups: probiotics and conventional treatment groups (control) (n=35 each). The probiotics treatment group was administered with oral Clostridium butyricum powder (250 mg, twice daily up to discharge) 24 hrs after birth except conventional treatment. Rectal swab cultures were done at admission, 5 and 12 days after admission, and before discharge. Clinical and laboratory findings were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The intestinal bacterial colonization rate in the probiotics treatment group was lower than that in the control group 12 days after admission (60% vs 83%; p<0.05) and before discharge (51% vs 80%; p<0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium were common colonization bacteria in the two groups. Diarrhea occurred in 7 cases (20%) in the probiotics treatment group compared with 16 cases (46%) in the control group (p<0.05). Two infants (6%) developed sepsis in the probiotics treatment group compared with 9 cases (26%) in the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics can decrease intestinal bacterial colonization rate and the incidence of diarrhea and sepsis in premature infants.
TI  - Evidence for clostridial implication in necrotizing enterocolitis through bacterial fermentation in a gnotobiotic quail model.
AB  - Despite extensive research, the pathogenesis of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains elusive. The aim of our work was to investigate the role of bacterial strains involved in NEC in gnotobiotic quails as experimental model. Six groups of germ-free quails that were fed a lactose diet were associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, C. paraputrificum, or C. butyricum (two strains). Implantation level, incidence of cecal lesions, production of short-chain fatty acids, and histologic lesions of the cecal wall were investigated. Whatever the strain, the implantation level was high (10(9) UFC/g). Neither K. pneumoniae nor C. difficile induced any cecal lesions. In contrast, the four other clostridial strains led to cecal NEC-like lesions with a variable occurrence: four of 12 quails for C. perfringens, eight of 12 quails for C. paraputrificum, and the same highest value, nine of 12 quails and eight of 10 quails for both C. butyricum strains. Gross aspects of the lesions may be linked to the short-chain fatty acid profiles and/or concentrations: thickening of the cecal wall (C. butyricum and C. perfringens) with high proportion of butyric acid, hemorrhages (C. paraputrificum) with high proportion of iso-butyric acid, and presence of other iso-acids. In addition, C. butyricum was characterized by pneumatosis, linked to a high gas production. Microscopic aspects confirmed the presence of edemas and intramucosa hemorrhages. Clostridia species, whose role is controversial, seem to be strongly implicated in NEC through excessive production of butyric acid as a result of colonic lactose fermentation. These results call for anaerobe detection in feces of infants who have NEC.
TI  - Comparative genomic analysis of dha regulon and related genes for anaerobic glycerol metabolism in bacteria.
AB  - The dihydroxyacetone (dha) regulon of bacteria encodes genes for the anaerobic metabolism of glycerol. In this work, genomic data are used to analyze and compare the dha regulon and related genes in different organisms in silico with respect to gene organization, sequence similarity, and possible functions. Database searches showed that among the organisms, the genomes of which have been sequenced so far, only two, i.e., Klebsiella pneumoniae MGH 78578 and Clostridium perfringens contain a complete dha regulon bearing all known enzymes. The components and their organization in the dha regulon of these two organisms differ considerably from each other and also from the previously partially sequenced dha regulons in Citrobacter freundii, Clostridium pasteurianum, and Clostridium butyricum. Unlike all of the other organisms, genes for the oxidative and reductive pathways of anaerobic glycerol metabolism in C. perfringens are located in two separate organization units on the chromosome. Comparisons of deduced protein sequences of genes with similar functions showed that the dha regulon components in K. pneumoniae and C. freundii have high similarities (80-95%) but lower similarities to those of the Clostridium species (30-80%). Interestingly, the protein sequence similarities among the dha genes of the Clostridium species are in many cases even lower than those between the Clostridium species and K. pneumoniae or C. freundii, suggesting two different types of dha regulon in the Clostridium species studied. The in silico reconstruction and comparison of dha regulons revealed several new genes in the microorganisms studied. In particular, a novel dha kinase that is phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent is identified and experimentally confirmed for K. pneumoniae in addition to the known ATP-dependent dha kinase. This finding gives new insights into the regulation of glycerol metabolism in K. pneumoniae and explains some hitherto not well understood experimental observations.
TI  - A new balance equation of reducing equivalents for data consistency check and bioprocess calculation.
AB  - The reducing equivalent (RE) balance is a basic equation for data consistency check and calculations of bioprocesses. The macroscopic approach is often used because it does not require detailed knowledge of metabolic pathways. In this work, the conventional Minkevich-Eroshin balance equation is examined with data of anaerobic glycerol conversion by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Clostridium butyricum as examples. It is shown that the Minkevich-Eroshin equation is very insensitive to measurement errors in products of less dominance and/or with relatively low reductance degree. Relatively large deviations from experimental values are encountered when the Minkevich-Eroshin equation is used for the calculations of these products. To overcome some of these shortcomings an improved RE balance equation is proposed that is based on 'reductance equations' of substrate conversion into the individual carbon containing products (including biomass). The proposed new equation significantly improves the performance of the RE balance equation for data consistency check and for the calculations of unknown variables with relatively low reductance degree. The rationale for this is that it considers merely the REs that really participate in the bioreactions. The use of the proposed method requires no detailed knowledge of metabolic pathways and is therefore of macroscopic nature. It can be reduced to the pathway balance equation if the pathways are known.
TI  - Comparison of the energetic efficiencies of hydrogen and oxychemicals formation in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Clostridium butyricum during anaerobic growth on glycerol.
AB  - Data for the anaerobic growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae DSM 2026 and Clostridium butyricum DSM 5431 on glycerol have been analyzed using the concept of material and available electron balances with consideration for hydrogen production. Models for the kinetics of energetic efficiencies of product formation under low residual glycerol are presented. For Klebsiella pneumoniae, the specific rates of electron transfer to the products were mainly significantly dependent on specific growth rate with the exception of ethanol and hydrogen which were also significantly non-growth associated. In the case of Clostridium butyricum, the rates were only growth rate dependent, except for hydrogen formation. The analysis also indicated that the production of 1,3-propanediol by Klebsiella pneumoniae was favoured by limitations other than glycerol limitation, while hydrogen generation was best under low residual glycerol and particularly in the presence of external 1,3-propanediol. Klebsiella pneumoniae appeared to be able to incorporate more of the available electrons of glycerol into hydrogen as compared with the Clostridium butyricum. The study demonstrates the need for properly considering H2 in models describing anaerobic processes.
TI  - Multiple product inhibition and growth modeling of clostridium butyricum and klebsiella pneumoniae in glycerol fermentation.
AB  - The inhibition potentials of products and substrate on the growth ofClostridium butyricum and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the glycerol fermentation are examined from experimental data and with a mathematicalmodel. Whereas the inhibition potential of externally added and self-produced 1,3-propanediol is essentially the same, butyric acid produced by the culture is more toxic than that externally added. The same seems to apply for acetic acid. The inhibitory effect of butyric acid is due tothe total concentration instead of its undissociated form. For acetic acid, it cannot be distinguished between the total concentration and the undissociated formThe inhibition effects of products and substrate in the glycerol fermentation are irrespective of the strains, and, therefore, the same growth model can be used. The maximum product concentrations tolerated (critical concentrations C(*) (pi)) are 0.35 g/Lfor undissociated acetic acid, 10.1 g/L for total butyric acid, 16.6 g/L for ethanol, 71.4 g/L for 1,3-propanediol, and 187.6 g/L for glycerol, which are applicable to C. butyricum and K. pneumoniae grown under a variety of conditions. For 55 steady-states, which were obtained from different types of continuous cultures over a pHrange of 5.3-8.5 and under both substrate limitation and substrate excess, the proposed growth model fits the experimental data with an average deviation of 17.0%. The deviation of model description from experimental values reduces of 11.4% if only the steady-states with excessive substrate are considered. (c) 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
TI  - Efficiency factors and ATP/ADP ratios in nitrogen-fixing Bacillus polymyxa and Bacillus azotofixans.
AB  - The efficiency factor, the number of moles of ATP generated per mole of glucose fermented, was determined in anaerobic, non-carbon-limited N2-fixing cultures of Bacillus polymyxa, Bacillus macerans, Bacillus azotofixans, and Clostridium butyricum through identification and quantitation of the fermentation products by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and measurement of acetate kinase activities. All three Bacillus species had acetate kinase activities and produced acetate and ethanol as the major fermentation products. The maximum amounts of ATP generated per mole of glucose fermented were 2.70, 2.64, and 2.88 mol in B. polymyxa, B. macerans, and B. azotofixans, respectively, compared with 3.25 mol in C. butyricum. Thus, in the N2-fixing Bacillus species, the efficiency factors are lower than that in C. butyricum. Steady-state ATP/ADP concentration ratios were measured in non-carbon-limited N2-fixing cultures of B. polymyxa and B. azotofixans through separation and quantitation of the adenylates in cell extracts by ion-pair reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The observed ATP/ADP ratios were 4.5 and 3.8, and estimated energy charges were 0.81 to 0.86 and 0.81 to 0.83, respectively, for B. polymyxa and B. azotofixans. The results suggest that under these growth conditions, the rate of ATP regeneration is adequate to meet the energy requirement for N2 fixation in the Bacillus species, in contrast to N2-fixing Clostridium pasteurianum and Klebsiella pneumoniae, for which substantially lower steady-state ATP/ADP ratios and energy charges have been reported. Implications of the results are discussed in relation to possible differences between Bacillus and Clostridium species in energy requirements for N2 fixation and concomitant ammonia assimilation.
TI  - Changes in the cell wall of Clostridium species following passage in animals.
AB  - Morphological changes in clostridial isolates after animal passage with other flora in mixed infections were studied by utilizing a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. We used 26 isolates of 7 clostridial species, and one isolate each of Bacteroides fragilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Abscesses were induced by all 7 Clostridium perfringens and 3 Clostridium butyricum isolates and by some of the other isolates. A thick granular wall prior to animal inoculation was shown only in C. perfringens, C. butyricum, and C. difficile. This structure was observed in other clostridia only following their animal passage alone or when co-inoculated with K. pneumoniae or B. fragilis.
