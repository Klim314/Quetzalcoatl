TI  - Diversity of butyrivibrio group bacteria in the rumen of goats and its response to the supplementation of garlic oil.
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the diversity of the Butyrivibrio group bacteria  in goat rumen and its response to garlic oil (GO) supplementation as revealed by molecular analysis of cloned 16S rRNA genes. Six wethers fitted with ruminal fistulas were assigned to two groups for a cross-over design with 28-d experimental period and 14-d interval. Goats were fed a basal diet without (control) or with GO ruminal infusion (0.8 g/d). Ruminal contents were used for DNA extraction collected before morning feeding on d 28. A total bacterial clone library was firstly constructed by nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene cloned sequences using universal primers. The resulting plasmids selected by Butyrivibrio-specific primers were used to construct a Butyrivibrio group-specific bacterial clone library. Butyrivibrio group represented 12.98% and 10.95% of total bacteria in control and GO group, respectively. In libraries, clones were classified to the genus Pseudobutyrivibrio, Butyrivibrio and others within the family Lachnospiraceae. Additionally, some specific clones were observed in GO group, being classified to the genus Ruminococcus and others within the family Ruminococcaceae. Based on the criterion that the similarity was 97% or greater with database sequences, there were 29.73% and 18.42% of clones identified as known isolates (i.e. B. proteoclasticus and Ps. ruminis) in control and GO groups, respectively. Further clones identified as B. fibrisolvens (5.41%) and R. flavefaciens (7.89%) were specifically found in control and GO groups, respectively. The majority of clones resembled Ps. ruminis (98% to 99% similarity), except for Lachnospiraceae bacteria (87% to 92% similarity) in the two libraries. The two clone libraries also appeared different in Shannon diversity index (control 2.47 and GO group 2.91). Our results indicated that the Butyrivibrio group bacteria had a complex community with considerable unknown species in the goat rumen.
TI  - Determination of bacteria constituting ruminal fibrolytic consortia developed on  orchard grass hay stem.
AB  - To determine the relationship between Fibrobacter succinogenes and other rumen bacteria, the bacterial community structure on fiber was analyzed by using two different materials. These were ruminally incubated orchard grass hay stems without and with preincubation with F. succinogenes (natural and artificial consortia, respectively). The natural consortium mainly consisted of Firmicutes (56.6%) and Bacteroidetes (33.1%), while the artificial consortium showed a significantly higher proportion of Firmicutes (85.5%) and a lower proportion of Bacteroidetes (4.6%). At species or genus level, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, the U2 group, Ruminococcus albus and Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis made up a higher proportion in the artificial consortium. The most dominant bacterial group was the Butyrivibrio-Pseudobutyrivibrio-Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis group, which accounted for 19.7% in the natural and 29.5% in the artificial consortium. Within the genus Butyrivibrio, the phylogenetic groups SA and VA2 and phylogeny-undefined Butyribivrio, but not VA1, were detected at high frequency in the artificial consortium. These results suggest that ecological and possibly functional relationships exist in the rumen among F. succinogenes, a subset of B. fibrisolvens, the U2 group, R. albus and Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis.
TI  - Dominant bacterial communities in the rumen of Gayals (Bos frontalis), Yaks (Bos  grunniens) and Yunnan Yellow Cattle (Bos taurs) revealed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The dominant rumen bacteria in Gayals, Yaks and Yunnan Yellow Cattle were investigated using PCR-DGGE approach. The analysis of DGGE profiles, identification of dominant bands and phylogenetic analysis 16S rDNA sequences in DGGE profiles were combined to reveal the dominant bacterial communities and compared the differences between those cattle species. DGGE profiles revealed that Gayals had the most abundant dominant bacteria and the lowest similarity of intraspecies between individuals than other two cattle species. A total of 45 sequences were examined and sequence similarity analysis revealed that Gayals had the most sequences appeared to uncultured bacteria, accounting for 85.0% of the total sequences, Yaks and Yunnan Yellow Cattle had 44.4 and 68.8% uncultured bacterial sequences, respectively. According to phylogenetic analysis, the rumen dominant bacteria of Gayals were mainly phylogenetically placed within phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known bacteria were mainly belonged to the genera Lachnospiraceae bacterium, Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Clostridium celerecrescens. Moreover, the dominant bacteria of Yaks were also mainly belonged to phyla firmicutes and bacteroidetes, and the known dominant bacteria were including Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Schwartzia succinivorans and Clostridiales bacterium, most of them are common rumen bacteria. In addition, the dominant bacteria in Yunnan Yellow Cattle were belonged to phyla firmicutes, bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria, and the known dominant bacteria containing Prevotella sp., Staphylococci lentus, Staphylococcus xylosus and Corynebacterium casei. Present study first detected Staphylococcus lentus and Staphylococcus xylosus in the rumen of cattle.
