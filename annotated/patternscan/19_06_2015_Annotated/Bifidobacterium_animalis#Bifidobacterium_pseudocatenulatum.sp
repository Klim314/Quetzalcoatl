TI  == promotion of intestinal peristalsis by bifidobacterium spp. capable of hydrolysing sennosides in mice.
AB  == background: while there are a variety of identifiable causes of constipation, even idiopathic constipation has different possible mechanisms. sennosides, the main laxative constituents of daio, an ancient kampo medicine, are prodrugs that  are converted to an active principle, rheinanthrone, by intestinal microbiota. in this study, we aimed to determine the sennoside hydrolysis ability of lactic acid bacterial strains and bifidobacteria in the intestine and to investigate their effect on intestinal peristalsis in mice. methodology/principal findings: a total of 88 lactic acid bacterial strains and 47 bifidobacterial strains were evaluated for their ability to hydrolyze sennosides. our results revealed that 4 strains, all belonging to the genus bifidobacterium, had strong sennoside hydrolysis ability, exhibiting a decrease of >70% of sennoside content. by thin-layer chromatography analysis, rheinanthrone was detected in the medium cultured with b. pseudocatenulatum lkm10070 and b. animalis subsp. lactis lkm512. the fecal sennoside contents significantly (p<0.001) decreased upon oral administration of  these strains as compared with the control. intestinal peristalsis activity was measured by the moved distance of the charcoal powder administered orally. the distance travelled by the charcoal powder in lkm512-treated mice was significantly longer than that of control (p<0.05). intestinal microbiota were analysed by real-time pcr and terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism.  the diversity of the intestinal microbiota was reduced by kanamycin treatment and the diversity was not recovered by lkm512 treatment. conclusion/significance: we  demonstrated that intestinal peristalsis was promoted by rheinanthrone produced by hydrolysis of sennoside by strain lkm512 and lkm10070.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == effects of administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis gcl2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (b. lactis) gcl2505 (gcl2505) in the intestine after administration of gcl2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. an increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. longum, b. adolescentis, b. anglatum, b. catenulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. dentium, b. longum subsp. infantis and b. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of gcl2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time  polymerase chain reaction analysis. however, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding b. lactis) remained unchanged. b. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. taking into account the number of gcl2505 administered, the findings further suggested that gcl2505 proliferated in the intestine. in addition, the defecation frequency increased during gcl2505 administration compared with the placebo. moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that gcl2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. this is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.

TI  == distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-n-biose i, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == this study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-n-biose i (lnb) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. lnb is a building block for the human milk  oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. a total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies  were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase (glnbp) gene (lnpa) and examined for growth when lnb was used as the sole carbohydrate source. while all strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp.  longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. breve, and b. bifidum were able to grow on  lnb, none of the strains of b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. angulatum, b. animalis subsp. lactis, and b. thermophilum showed any growth. in addition, some strains of b. pseudocatenulatum, b. animalis subsp. animalis, and  b. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize lnb. with the exception for b. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpa coincided with lnb utilization in almost  all strains. these results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of lnb. these findings support the hypothesis that glnbp plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  == although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. we performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rrna gene sequences (16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer [its] 16s-23s spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. a total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa,  i.e., bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e.,  bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. we encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. in contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide  ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.

TI  == effect of inulin on the human gut microbiota: stimulation of bifidobacterium adolescentis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  == prebiotics are food ingredients that improve health by modulating the colonic microbiota. the bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin is well established; however, it remains unclear which species of bifidobacterium are stimulated in vivo and whether bacterial groups other than lactic acid bacteria are affected by inulin consumption. changes in the faecal microbiota composition were examined by real-time pcr in twelve human volunteers after ingestion of inulin (10 g/d) for a 16-d period in comparison with a control period without any supplement intake. the prevalence of most bacterial groups examined did not change after inulin intake, although the low g+c % gram-positive species faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibited a significant increase (10.3% for control period v. 14.5% during inulin intake, p=0.019). the composition of the genus bifidobacterium was studied in four of the volunteers by clone library analysis. between three and five bifidobacterium spp. were found in each volunteer. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum were present in all volunteers, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium were also detected. real-time pcr was employed to quantify the four most prevalent bifidobacterium spp., b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum and b. bifidum, in ten volunteers carrying detectable levels of bifidobacteria. b. adolescentis showed the strongest response to inulin consumption, increasing from 0.89 to 3.9% of the total microbiota (p=0.001). b. bifidum was increased from 0.22 to 0.63% (p<0.001) for the five volunteers for whom this species was present.

TI  == rapd and rep-pcr fingerprinting for characterization of bifidobacterium species.
AB  == dna fingerprinting methods, rapd with 7 random primers, and rep-pcr using both boxa1r and (gtg)(5) ones, were used for the discrimination of 16 type and collection bifidobacterium strains of 9 species of human origin, b. animalis ssp. animalis and b. animalis ssp. lactis and 7 bifidobacterium strains collected in the culture collection of dairy microorganisms (ccdm). both rapd and rep-pcr methods provided similar results. the strains were identified as b. animalis ssp. lactis (6 strains) and b. adolescentis (1 strain). the reclassification of the collection strain ccm 3761 as b. pseudocatenulatum species (previously classified as b. adolescentis) was confirmed.

TI  == evaluation of the pcr method for identification of bifidobacterium species.
AB  == aims: bifidobacterium species are known for their beneficial effects on health and their wide use as probiotics. although various polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods for the identification of bifidobacterium species have been published, the reliability of these methods remains open to question. methods and results: in this study, we evaluated 37 previously reported pcr primer sets designed to amplify 16s rdna, 23s rdna, intergenic spacer regions, or repetitive  dna sequences of various bifidobacterium species. conclusions: ten of 37 experimental primer sets showed specificity for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. longum, b. longum biovar infantis and b. dentium. significance and impact of the study: the results suggest that published bifidobacterium primer sets should be re-evaluated for both reproducibility and specificity for the identification of bifidobacterium species using pcr. improvement of existing pcr methods will be needed to facilitate identification of other bifidobacterium strains, such as b. animalis, b. catenulatum, b. thermophilum and b. subtile.

TI  == screening for plasmids among human bifidobacteria species: sequencing and analysis of pbc1 from bifidobacterium catenulatum l48.
AB  == analysis of 72 bifidobacterial isolates for plasmid dna identified six different  plasmid profiles, two profiles consisted of a single plasmid and four contained at least two. a plasmid identified in a bifidobacterium catenulatum strain (pbc1) was chosen for further characterization based on its small size and stability. the plasmid was shown to be a circular molecule of 2540 base pairs with an overall g+c content of 64%. at the putative origin of replication a direct repeat of 24 nucleotides repeated three and a half times was observed, as well as five inverted repeats, which resembled the organization of theta-type replicating plasmids. three open reading frames encoding peptides larger than 50 amino acids  were also identified: repb, encoding a replicase of 315 amino acids, a transcriptionally coupled gene (orfx-like), similar to the orfx of some theta-replicating lactococcal plasmids, and copg-like in the complementary strand, which showed a conserved domain present in proteins of the copg family. comparison of the deduced repb protein of pbc1 to other replication proteins in databases, identified pmb1 from bifidobacterium longum as its closest relative (81% amino acid identity). the pbc1 replicon proved to be functional in several bifidobacterium species, including b. animalis, b. longum, and b. pseudocatenulatum. hybridization experiments showed the replicon was uncommon among bifidobacteria. the relative copy number of pbc1 was estimated to be 30.9+/-4.62 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.

TI  == characterization of the genus bifidobacterium by automated ribotyping and 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == in order to characterize the genus bifidobacterium, ribopatterns and approximately 500 bp (escherichia coli positions 27 to 520) of 16s rrna gene sequences of 28 type strains and 64 reference strains of the genus bifidobacterium were determined. ribopatterns obtained from bifidobacterium strains were divided into nine clusters (clusters i-ix) with a similarity of 60%. cluster v, containing 17 species, was further subdivided into 22 subclusters with a similarity of 90%. in the genus bifidobacterium, four groups were shown according to miyake et al.: (i) the bifidobacterium longum infantis-longum-suis type group, (ii) the b. catenulatum-pseudocatenulatum group, (iii) the b. gallinarum-saeculare-pullorum group, and (iv) the b. coryneforme-indicum group, which showed higher than 97% similarity of the 16s rrna gene sequences in each group. using ribotyping analysis, unique ribopatterns were obtained from these species, and they could be separated by cluster analysis. ribopatterns of six b.  adolescentis strains were separated into different clusters, and also showed diversity in 16s rrna gene sequences. b. adolescentis consisted of heterogeneous  strains. the nine strains of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum were divided into five subclusters. each type strain of b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum and b. pseudolongum subsp. globosum and two intermediate groups, which were suggested by yaeshima et al., consisted of individual clusters. b. animalis subsp. animalis and b. animalis subsp. lactis could not be separated by ribotyping using eco ri. we conclude that ribotyping is able to provide another characteristic of bifidobacterium strains in addition to 16s rrna gene sequence phylogenetic analysis, and this information suggests that ribotyping analysis is  a useful tool for the characterization of bifidobacterium species in combination  with other techniques for taxonomic characterization.

TI  == evaluation of amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) and species-specific pcr for identification of bifidobacterium species.
AB  == molecular biological methods based on genus-specific pcr, species-specific pcr, and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) of two pcr amplicons (523 and 914bp) using six restriction enzymes were used to differentiate among species of bifidobacterium. the techniques were established using dna from 16 type and reference strains of bifidobacteria of 11 species. the discrimination power of 914bp amplicon digestion was higher than that of 523bp amplicon digestion. the 914bp amplicon digestion by six restrictases provided unique patterns for nine species; b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum were not differentiated yet. the ncii digestion of the 914bp pcr product enabled to discriminate between each of b. animalis, b. lactis, and b. gallicum. the reference strain b. adolescentis ccm 3761 was reclassified as a member of the b.  catenulatum/b. pseudocatenulatum group. the above-mentioned methods were applied  for the identification of seven strains of bifidobacterium spp. collected in the  culture collection of dairy microorganisms (ccdm). the strains collected in ccdm  were differentiated to the species level. six strains were identified as b. lactis, one strain as b. adolescentis.

TI  == genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of the present study was to compare several molecular methods for the identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria, and further to investigate genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of bifidobacterial isolates from  intestinal samples of finnish adult subjects. methods and results: a total of 153 intestinal bifidobacterial isolates were included in initial screening and 34 isolates were further characterized. identification results obtained with pcr-elisa and ribotyping were well in accordance with each other, while randomly  amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) gave tentative identification only to bifidobacterium bifidum and to 65% of the b. longum isolates. the most commonly detected species were b. longum biotype longum followed by b. adolescentis and b. bifidum. in addition, b. animalis (lactis), b. angulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum were found. ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) proved to be discriminatory methods for bifidobacteria, but also rapd revealed intraspecies heterogeneity. besides two b. animalis (lactis) isolates with very close similarity to a commercially available probiotic strain, none of the intestinal isolates showed optimal survival in all tolerance (acid, bile and oxygen) or growth performance tests. conclusions: several species/strains of bifidobacteria  simultaneously colonize the gastrointestinal tract of healthy finnish adults and  intestinal bifidobacterium isolates were genetically heterogeneous. functional properties of bifidobacteria were strain-dependent. significance and impact of the study: applicability of ribotyping with the automated riboprinter system for  identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria was shown in the present study.

TI  == molecular microbial analysis of bifidobacterium isolates from different environments by the species-specific amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra).
AB  == one hundred and six isolates of the genus bifidobacterium, isolated from different environments (mainly gastrointestinal), were identified and classified  taxonomically to species level by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. two restriction endonucleases (sau3ai and bamhi) were chosen for aligning the 16s rrna sequences of 16 bifidobacterial species retrieved from various databases, to obtain species-specific restriction patterns. a rapid and accurate identification scheme was obtained by comparing the resulting 16s rdna digestion profiles of 16  bifidobacterium type-strains and 90 strains of various origins. all of the investigated strains were previously confirmed at the species level as belonging  to the genus bifidobacterium by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and by polymerase chain reaction amplification with genus- and species-specific primers. the present work demonstrates that species-specific detection of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium coryneforme, bifidobacterium  cuniculi, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium magnum, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and bifidobacterium pullorum present in different micro-ecological environments (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) can be accomplished in a reliable, rapid and accurate manner, circumventing the recognised deficiencies of traditional identification techniques.

TI  == adhesion of bifidobacterium spp. to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == twenty-four bifidobacterium strains were examined for their ability to bind to immobilized human and bovine intestinal mucus glycoproteins. each of the tested bacteria exhibited its characteristic adhesion to human and bovine fecal mucus. no significant differences were found among the taxonomic species. among the tested bacteria, b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. infantis, b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum adhered to human fecal mucus better than bovine fecal mucus, while the binding of b. animalis and  b. lactis was not preferential. these results suggest that the mucosal adhesive properties of bifidobacteria may be a strain dependent feature, and the mucosal binding of the human bifidobacteria may be more host specific.

TI  == phenotypic differentiation of bifidobacteria of human and animal origins.
AB  == the phenotypes of 153 strains belonging or related to the genus bifidobacterium were studied. these organisms included 38 collection strains and 115 wild strains (41 strains of human origin, 56 strains of animal origin, and 18 strains obtained from rivers or sewage). our phenotypic analysis revealed seven main groups that were subdivided into 20 subgroups. seven subgroups contained no type or collection strain. among the human strains, the type strains of bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and b. catenulatum fell into group i, which contained the type  strains of b. adolescentis (subgroup ib), b. dentium (subgroup ic), and b. angulatum (ungrouped). the type strain of b. breve belonged to subgroup iiia1, and the type strains of b. infantis and b. longum fell into subgroup iiib1. group vii comprised only wild strains that were isolated from human infant feces. among the animal strains, group ii consisted mainly of bifidobacteria that were isolated from pig feces and contained the type strains of b. suis (subgroup iib), b. thermophilum (subgroup iif), b. choerinum, and b. boum (ungrouped). wild strains belonging to group v were isolated from pig, calf, cow, and chicken feces; this included the type strains of b. animalis (subgroup va), b. magnum (subgroup vb), b. pseudolongum, and b. globosum (subgroup vc). the strains of human origin (groups i, iii, and vii) were well separated from the animal strains (groups ii, iv, and v). it was not surprising that the wild strains isolated from surface water or sewage were distributed in the animal groups as well as the human groups. thus, bifidobacteria can be considered to be successful indicators  of human or animal fecal pollution when they are correctly classified. the acidification patterns were not adequate to differentiate bifidobacterium species, as determined previously by mitsuoka (bifidobacteria microflora 3:11-28, 1984) and scardovi (p. 1418-1434, in p. h. a. sneath, n. s. mair, m. e. sharpe, and j. g. holt, ed., bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology, vol. 2, 1986). however, enzymatic tests furnished new taxonomic criteria for the genus.
