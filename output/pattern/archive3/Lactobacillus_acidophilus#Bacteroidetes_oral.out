effect of porphyromonas gingivalis and lactobacillus acidophilus on secretion of  il1b, il6, and il8 by gingival epithelial cells.
porphyromonas gingivalis alters cytokine expression in gingival epithelial cells, stimulating inflammatory responses that may lead to periodontal disease. this study explored the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus on the specific expressions of the interleukins (ils) il1b, il6, and il8 induced by the pathogen. human gingival epithelial cells were co-cultured with p. gingivalis, l. acidophilus, or l. acidophilus + p. gingivalis; the control group consisted of the cells alone. protein and gene expression levels of the ils were detected using elisa and qrt-pcr, respectively. the supernatant from the p. gingivalis group held significantly higher protein and mrna levels of il1b, il6, and il8, compared to the control group. in the mixed bacterial group (l. acidophilus + p. gingivalis), the levels of all three ils decreased with increasing concentrations of l. acidophilus and were significantly different from the p. gingivalis group. this suggests that in gingival cells, l. acidophilus offsets the p. gingivalis-induced secretion of these ils in a dose-dependent manner.
