TI  == composition and antimicrobial activity of euphrasia rostkoviana hayne essential oil.
AB  == eyebright, euphrasia rostkoviana hayne (scrophulariaceae), is a medicinal plant traditionally used in europe for the treatment of various health disorders, especially as eyewash to treat eye ailments such as conjunctivitis and blepharitis that can be associated with bacterial infections. some euphrasia species have been previously reported to contain essential oil. however, the composition and bioactivity of e. rostkoviana oil are unknown. therefore, in this study, we investigated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the eyebright essential oil against some organisms associated with eye infections: enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans. gc-ms analysis revealed more than 70 constituents, with n-hexadecanoic acid (18.47%) as the main constituent followed by thymol (7.97%), myristic acid (4.71%), linalool  (4.65%), and anethole (4.09%). the essential oil showed antimicrobial effect against all organisms tested with the exception of p. aeruginosa. the best activity was observed against all gram-positive bacteria tested with the minimum  inhibitory concentrations of 512 microg/ml. this is the first report on the chemical composition of e. rostkoviana essential oil and its antimicrobial activity.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of portuguese foeniculum vulgare fruits.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the  centre and south of portugal. composition of essential oils was established by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (gc-fid) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) analysis. the obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. a total of 16 compounds were identified. the main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). the percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: aspergillus niger, a. japonicus, a. oryzae, fusarium oxysporum, rhizophus oryzae and r. stolonifer. antibacterial  activity was assessed against three gram-positive strains: enterococcus faecalis  atcc 29212, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228 and s. aureus atcc 28213; and against six gram-negative strains: escherichia coli atcc 25922; morganella morganii lfg 08; proteus mirabilis lfg 04; salmonella enteritidis lfg 05; s. entiritidis serovar typhimurium lfg 06 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. the mic values varied from 62.5 (e. coli atcc 25922) to 2000 microml (p. aeruginosa atcc 27853).

TI  == is256 abolishes gelatinase activity and biofilm formation in a mutant of the nosocomial pathogen enterococcus faecalis v583.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis is one of the most controversial species of lactic acid bacteria. some strains are used as probiotics, while others are associated with severe and life-threatening nosocomial infections. their pathogenicity depends on the acquisition of multidrug resistance and virulence factors. gelatinase, which  is required in the first steps of biofilm formation, is an important virulence determinant involved in e. faecalis pathogenesis, including endocarditis and peritonitis. the gene that codes for gelatinase (gele) is controlled by the fsr quorum-sensing system, whose encoding genes (fsra, fsrb, fsrc, and fsrd) are located immediately upstream of gele. the integration of a dna fragment into the  fsr locus of a derived mutant of e. faecalis v583 suppressed the gelatinase activity and prevented biofilm formation. sequence analysis indicated the presence of is256 integrated into the fsrc gene at nucleotide position 321. interestingly, is256 is also associated with biofilm formation in staphylococcus  epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus. this is the first description of an insertion sequence that prevents biofilm formation in e. faecalis.

TI  == an antibacterial ortho-quinone diterpenoid and its derivatives from caryopteris mongolica.
AB  == to identify antibacterial components in traditional mongolian medicinal plant caryopteris mongolica, an ortho-quinone abietane caryopteron a (1) and three its  derivatives caryopteron b-d (2-4) were isolated from the roots of the plant together with three known abietanes demethylcryptojaponol (5), 6alpha-hydroxydemethyl cryptojaponol (6), and 14-deoxycoleon u (7). the chemical  structures of these abietane derivatives were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data. compounds 1-4 had c-13 methylcyclopropane substructures, and  2-4 had a hexanedioic anhydride ring c instead of ortho-quinone in 1. the stereochemistry of these compound was assumed from noe spectra and ecd cotton effects. compounds 1 and 5-7 showed antibacterial activities against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and micrococcus luteus, being 1 the more potent.

TI  == quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion using surface free energy determined with a spectrophotometric method.
AB  == bacterial adhesion onto solid surfaces is of importance in a wide spectrum of problems, including environmental microbiology, biomedical research, and various  industrial applications. despite many research efforts, present thermodynamic models that rely on the evaluation of the adhesion energy are often elusive in predicting the bacterial adhesion behavior. here, we developed a new spectrophotometric method to determine the surface free energy (sfe) of bacterial cells. the adhesion behaviors of five bacterial species, pseudomonas putida kt2440, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and escherichia coli dh5alpha, onto two model substratum surfaces, i.e., clean glass and silanized glass surfaces, were studied. we found that bacterial adhesion was unambiguously mediated by the sfe difference between the bacterial cells and the solid substratum. the lower the sfe difference, the higher degree of bacterial adhesion. we therefore propose the use of the sfe difference as an accurate and simple thermodynamic measure for quantitatively predicting bacterial adhesion. the methodological advance and thermodynamic simplification in the paper have implications in controlling bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on solid surfaces.

TI  == review and phylogenetic analysis of qac genes that reduce susceptibility to quaternary ammonium compounds in staphylococcus species.
AB  == the qac genes of staphylococcus species encode multidrug efflux pumps: membrane proteins that export toxic molecules and thus increase tolerance to a variety of  compounds such as disinfecting agents, including quaternary ammonium compounds (for which they are named), intercalating dyes and some antibiotics. in stapylococcus species, six different plasmid-encoded qac efflux pumps have been described, and they belong to two major protein families. qaca and qacb are members of the major facilitator superfamily, while qacc, qacg, qach, and qacj all belong to the small multidrug resistance (smr) family. not all smr proteins are called qac and the reverse is also true, which has caused confusion in the literature and in gene annotations. the discovery of qac genes and their presence in various staphylococcal populations is briefly reviewed. a sequence comparison  revealed that some of the pcr primers described in the literature for qac detection may miss particular qac genes due to lack of dna conservation. despite  their resemblance in substrate specificity, the qac proteins belonging to the two protein families have little in common. qaca and qacb are highly conserved in staphylococcus species, while qaca was also detected in enterococcus faecalis, suggesting that these plasmid-born genes have spread across bacterial genera. nevertheless, these qaca and qacb genes are quite dissimilar to their closest homologues in other organisms. in contrast, smr-type qac proteins display considerable sequence variation, despite their short length, even within the staphylococcus genus. phylogenetic analysis of these genes identified similarity  to a large number of other smr members, found in staphylococci as well as in other genera. a number of phylogenetic trees of smr qac proteins are presented here, starting with genes present in s. aureus and s. epidermidis, and extending  this to related genes found in other species of this genus, and finally to genes  found in other genera.

TI  == cytotoxic and antibacterial angucycline- and prodigiosin-analogues from the deep-sea derived streptomyces sp. scsio 11594.
AB  == two new c-glycoside angucyclines, marangucycline a (1) and marangucycline b (2),  along with three known compounds, dehydroxyaquayamycin (3), undecylprodigiosin (4) and metacycloprodigiosin (5), have been identified as products of the deep-sea sediment strain streptomyces sp. scsio 11594. new structures were elucidated on the basis of hresims, 1d and 2d nmr analyses and comparisons to previously reported datasets. compounds 2 and 4 displayed in vitro cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines a594, cne2, hepg2, mcf-7 superior to those obtained with cisplatin, the positive control. notably, compound 2 bearing a keto-sugar displayed significant cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines with ic50 values ranging from 0.24 to 0.56 mum; an ic50 value of 3.67 mum was found when using non-cancerous hepatic cell line hl7702, demonstrating the cancer cell selectivity of 2. compounds 1-3 were proved to have weak antibacterial activities against enterococcus faecalis atcc29212 with an mic value of 64.0 mug/ml. moreover, 3 displayed selective antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis shhs-e1 with an mic value of 16.0 mug/ml.

TI  == new antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
AB  == microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging.  in search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. the antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth  of the nosocomial pathogens staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical e. faecalis, e. faecium, and s. aureus isolates. it also strongly reduced the growth of legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of escherichia coli in urine. we postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 leader surveillance program.
AB  == the 2013 leader surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the united states. a total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. the groups were staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. the mic90 value for each of the 6  pathogen groups was 1 mug/ml. susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was  99.83%. only 12 isolates (2 s. aureus, 3 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 streptococcus sanguinis, 5 enterococcus faecium, and 1 enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). three of these (2 s. aureus and 1 e. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. the findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.

TI  == physicochemical and biological properties of oxovanadium(iv), cobalt(ii) and nickel(ii) complexes with oxydiacetate anions.
AB  == the potentiometric and conductometric titration methods have been used to characterize the stability of series of vo(iv)-, co(ii)- and ni(ii)-oxydiacetato  complexes in dmso-water solutions containing 0-50 % (v/v) dmso. the influence of  dmso as a co-solvent on the stability of the complexes as well as the oxydiacetic acid was evaluated. furthermore, the reactivity of the complexes towards superoxide free radicals was assessed by employing the nitro blue tetrazolium (nbt) assay. the biological properties of the complexes were investigated in relation to their cytoprotective activity against the oxidative damage generated  exogenously by using hydrogen peroxide in the human dermal fibroblasts adult (hdfa) cell line as well as to their antimicrobial activity against the bacteria  (bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis). the relationship  between physicochemical and biological properties of the complexes was discussed.

TI  == community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis pyelonephritis in a child: a case report.
AB  == introduction: staphylococcus epidermidis is currently the most frequent pathogen  of opportunistic and nosocomial infections worldwide. most cases of staphylococcus epidermidis infections are associated with indwelling medical devices and/or immunocompromised conditions. community-acquired urinary tract infections are rare, particularly among pediatric populations, and clinicians often do not consider staphylococcus epidermidis as a uropathogen. case presentation: a previously healthy japanese boy developed pyelonephritis caused by enterococcus faecalis at 10 months of age. subsequently, he was diagnosed with severe bilateral vesicoureteral reflux (right side grade v, left side grade iii), and was administered trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as the prophylaxis. at 18 months of age, he presented with fever. gram staining of urine obtained through catheterization revealed gram-positive cocci. we suspected pyelonephritis caused  by enterococci, and administered oral fluoroquinolone empirically. the fever promptly resolved, and eventually, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis was detected at significant levels in the urine. thus, our final diagnosis was pyelonephritis caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis. conclusions: our case indicated that even immunocompetent children without a urinary catheter can develop staphylococcus epidermidis pyelonephritis. staphylococcus epidermidis can be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed as sample contamination in community-acquired urinary tract infections. therefore, when gram staining of appropriately obtained urine samples reveals gram-positive cocci, clinicians should take into consideration not only the possibility of enterococci but also staphylococci, including staphylococcus epidermidis, particularly in children with urinary abnormalities and/or those receiving continuous antibiotic prophylaxis.

TI  == synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  == aim: to investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus  epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. the treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% proteinase k and 2% chx (with and without ultrasonics). 2% chx was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (p < 0.05). the viable counts of the proteinase k and chx group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu ml-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/-  1.36 log10 cfu ml-1 ) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) as compared with the  untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu  ml-1 ). the chx group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase k. conclusion: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.

TI  == in-vitro screening of malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial  activity of malaysian honey is still limited. in this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of malaysian monofloral honey from koompassia excelsa (becc.) taub (tualang), melaleuca cajuputi powell (gelam) and durio zibethinus murr. (durian). honey samples were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc6518  and atcc25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc12228, enterococcus faecium lmg16192, enterococcus faecalis lmg16216 and atcc29212, escherichia coli atcc25922, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc14028 and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc13883. results: marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas tualang and gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). conclusion: present findings suggested gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested malaysian honey samples.

TI  == antibacterial compounds from salvia adenophora fernald (lamiaceae).
AB  == from the aerial parts of salvia adenophora fernald four derivatives of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (1-4) together with five clerodane diterpenoids (5, 6, 8-10), and one known diterpene (7) have been isolated. compounds 1-6 and 8-10 are described for the first time. the structures were established by extensive 1d, 2d nmr and hresi-tofms spectroscopic methods. finally, the absolute configuration has been established by comparing of experimental and quantum chemical calculation of ecd spectra. despite a total lack of antimicrobial activity of the plant extract, hinting to the existence of antagonistic interactions in the crude material, three oxylipins (2-4) displayed a promising inhibition on gram-positive multidrug-resistant clinical strains including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and, particularly, staphylococcus epidermidis, while the compounds 9 and 10 revealed a specific and strain-dependent activity against s. epidermidis. interestingly, the inhibition provided by these compounds was independent of the resistance patterns of these pathogens to classic antibiotics. no action was reported on gram-negative strains nor on candida albicans. these results confirm that clerodanes and, particularly, prostaglandin-like compounds can be considered as interesting antimicrobial agents deserving further study.

TI  == blood stream infections in renal transplant recipients: a single-center study.
AB  == introduction: bacteremias among renal transplant recipients are more frequent as  a result of immunosuppression. they are considered extremely high-risk because they are correlated with decreased allograft and recipient survival. patients and methods: all episodes of bacteremia among renal transplant recipients were documented following review of medical records, from january 2010 to may 2013. results: in total 26 episodes of bacteremia were observed in 22 patients. gram negative bacteremia was identified in 73% (19/26) cases. pathogens according to their frequency were the following escherichia coli (6/26, 23%), klebsiella pneumonia (5/26, 19%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3/26, 11%), staphylococcus epidermidis (3/26, 11%), acinetobacter baumanni (2/26, 7.7%), enterococcus faecalis (2/26, 7.7%). the first trimester post renal transplantation 18 episodes (69%) of bacteremia were presented that were not correlated to indwelling urinary catheter or stent. positive urinary culture with the same pathogen was recognized in 13 patients. all recipients manifested fever, eight recipients had leucocytosis and three cases were complicated by septic shock. immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids and non-nephrotoxic antibiotic regimen was  initiated. acute renal allograft dysfunction (defined as an increase in serum creatinine more than 0.5 mg/dl from baseline) was observed in five patients and was restored following infection resolution. conclusion: increased prevalence of  bacteremia in renal transplant recipients is attributed to immunosuppression and  usually bacteremic episodes follow urinary tract infection. the commonest pathogens are gram negative bacteria with e. coli the most frequent. early detection and proper management are important as bacteremia affects renal allograft and recipient survival.

TI  == monotreme lactation protein is highly expressed in monotreme milk and provides antimicrobial protection.
AB  == monotremes (platypus and echidna) are the descendants of the oldest ancestor of all extant mammals distinguished from other mammals by mode of reproduction. monotremes lay eggs following a short gestation period and after an even briefer  incubation period, altricial hatchlings are nourished over a long lactation period with milk secreted by nipple-less mammary patches located on the female's  abdomen. milk is the sole source of nutrition and immune protection for the developing young until weaning. using transcriptome and mass spectrometry analysis of milk cells and milk proteins, respectively, a novel monotreme lactation protein (mlp) was identified as a major secreted protein in milk. we show that platypus and short-beaked echidna mlp genes show significant homology and are unique to monotremes. the mlp transcript was shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues; however, highest expression was observed in milk cells and was expressed constitutively from early to late lactation. analysis of recombinant mlp showed that it is an n-linked glycosylated protein and biophysical studies predicted that mlp is an amphipathic, alpha-helical protein,  a typical feature of antimicrobial proteins. functional analysis revealed mlp antibacterial activity against both opportunistic pathogenic staphylococcus aureus and commensal enterococcus faecalis bacteria but showed no effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and salmonella enterica. our data suggest that mlp is an evolutionarily ancient component of milk-mediated innate immunity absent in other mammals. we propose that mlp evolved specifically in the monotreme lineage supporting the evolution of lactation in these species to provide bacterial protection, at a time when mammals lacked nipples.

TI  == the influence of urinary ph on antibiotic efficacy against bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == objective: to determine the effects of ph on the activity of clinically relevant  antibiotics against bacterial uropathogens. numerous factors affect antibiotic efficacy within the urinary tract including ph. because human urine can substantially vary from acidic (ph 4.5) to alkaline (ph 8) conditions and can be  easily clinically manipulated, it would be a great advantage to better understand the role of ph in antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection. materials and  methods: this in vitro study investigated the activity of 24 widely used antimicrobial agents against bacterial strains comprising 6 major uropathogenic species (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) over the  range of ph 5-8. standard disk-diffusion and broth-microdilution assays were used. one-way analysis of variance was applied to determine significance (p <.05). results: for 18 of the 24 agents, ph was shown to play a significant role  in overall inhibitory activity. although most agents behaved similarly across most or all of the uropathogens tested, several only showed ph-dependent effects  against certain organisms. the fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, aminoglycosides, and macrolides all functioned optimally at alkaline ph, whereas the tetracyclines, nitrofurantoin, and many of the beta-lactams tested exhibited their highest activity under more acidic conditions. sulfamethoxazole, oxacillin, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, vancomycin, imipenem, and clindamycin were largely unaffected by ph. conclusion: clinicians should consider the urinary ph of their patients when treating urinary tract infection, especially in complicated scenarios. future clinical investigations examining urinary ph and antibiotic efficacy may result in the application of decreased antibiotic dosages and regimen durations, potentially reducing antibiotic resistance development.

TI  == a comparison of conventional methods for the quantification of bacterial cells after exposure to metal oxide nanoparticles.
AB  == background: due to potential interference of nanoparticles on bacterial quantification, there is a challenge to develop a fast, accurate and reproducible method for bacterial quantification. currently various bacterial quantification methods are used by researchers performing nanoparticles study, but there has been no efficacy evaluation of these methods. here we study interference of nanoparticles on three most commonly used conventional bacterial quantification methods, including colony counting to determine the colony-forming units (cfu), spectrophotometer method of optical density (od) measurement, and flow cytometry  (fcm). results: three oxide nanoparticles including zno, tio2, and sio2 and four  bacterial species including salmonella enterica serovar newport, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and escherichia coli were included in the test. results showed that there is no apparent interference of the oxide nanoparticles on quantifications of all four bacterial species by fcm measurement; cfu counting is time consuming, less accurate and not suitable for automation; and the spectrophotometer method using od measurement was the most unreliable method to quantify and detect the bacteria in the presence of the nanoparticles. conclusion: in summary, fcm measurement proved to be the best method, which is suitable for rapid, accurate and automatic detection of bacteria in the presence of the nanoparticles.

TI  == novel nonribosomal peptide synthetase (nrps) genes sequenced from intertidal mudflat bacteria.
AB  == nonribosomal peptide synthetases (nrps) are actively sought out, due to pharmacologically important activities of their metabolites. in marine environment, the most prevalent nonribosomal peptide antibiotic producers are sponges inhabiting microorganisms. conversely, strains from marine sediments and  more especially from intertidal mudflats have not been extensively screened for the presence of new nrps. in this study, for the first time, a collection of one  hundred intertidal mudflat bacterial isolates (marennes-oleron bay, france) was assessed for (1) the presence of nrps genes by degenerated pcr targeting conserved adenylation domains and (2) for their production of antimicrobial molecules. (1) bacteria with adenylation domains (14 strains) were identified by  16s rrna gene sequence analysis and grouped into firmicutes (one strain) and proteobacteria (13 strains). in silico analysis of the nrps amino acid sequences  (n = 7) showed 41-58% id with sequences found in the ncbi database. three new putative adenylation domain signatures were found. (2) the culture supernatant of one of these strains, identified as a bacillus, was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis. this  study portends that the intertidal mudflat niche could be of interest for the discovery of new nrps genes and antimicrobial producing strains.

TI  == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == safety of topical vancomycin for pediatric spinal deformity: nontoxic serum levels with supratherapeutic drain levels.
AB  == study design: retrospective cohort analysis. objective: to establish if drain levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentrations for common pathogens (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, and propionibacterium acnes-2 mug/ml; staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis-4 mug/ml). evaluate the safety of topical vancomycin in pediatric patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery and determine if postoperative serum levels approach toxicity (25 mug/ml). summary of background data: the application of topical vancomycin powder has decreased postoperative wound infections in retrospective analyses in the adult population  with minimal local and systemic risks. the safety and efficacy of vancomycin powder has not been completely evaluated in the pediatric population after deformity surgery. methods: topical vancomycin powder (1 g) was applied during wound closure after instrumented posterior spinal fusion. all patients received intravenous perioperative antibiotics and a subfascial drain was used. serum and  drain vancomycin levels were collected immediately postoperatively and during the first 2 postoperative days (pods). complications were recorded. results: the study population consisted of 25 patients with a mean age of 13.5 years (9.5-17.1 yr) and mean +/- standard deviation body weight of 44.5 +/- 18 kg. underlying diagnoses included: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (12), neuromuscular scoliosis (10), and kyphosis (3). mean serum vancomycin levels trended downward from 2.5 mug/ml (pod 0) to 1.9 mug/ml (pod 1) to 1.1 mug/ml (pod 2). mean drain levels also trended downward from 403 mug/ml (pod 0) to 251 mug/ml (pod 1) to 115 mug/ml (pod 2). no vancomycin toxicity or deep wound infections were observed. one patient with neuromuscular scoliosis developed a superficial wound dehiscence that was managed with dressing changes. conclusion: topical application of vancomycin powder in pediatric spinal deformity surgery produced local levels well above the minimum inhibitory concentration for common pathogens and serum levels below the toxicity threshold (25 mug/ml). there were no deep wound or antibiotic related complications. level of evidence: 3.

TI  == linezolid update: stable in vitro activity following more than a decade of clinical use and summary of associated resistance mechanisms.
AB  == linezolid, approved for clinical use since 2000, has become an important addition to the anti-gram-positive infection armamentarium. this oxazolidinone drug has in vitro and in vivo activity against essentially all gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). the in vitro activity of linezolid was well documented prior to its clinical application, and several ongoing surveillance studies demonstrated consistent and potent results during the subsequent years of clinical use. emergence of resistance has been limited and associated with invasive procedures, deep organ involvement, presence of foreign  material and mainly prolonged therapy. non-susceptible organisms usually demonstrate alterations in the 23s rrna target, which remain the main resistance  mechanism observed in enterococci; although a few reports have described the detection of cfr-mediated resistance in enterococcus faecalis. s. aureus isolates non-susceptible to linezolid remain rare in large surveillance studies. most isolates harbour 23s rrna mutations; however, cfr-carrying mrsa isolates have been observed in the united states and elsewhere. it is still uncertain whether the occurrences of such isolates are becoming more prevalent. coagulase-negative  isolates (cons) resistant to linezolid were uncommon following clinical approval. surveillance data have indicated that cons isolates, mainly staphylococcus epidermidis, currently account for the majority of gram-positive organisms displaying elevated mic results to linezolid. in addition, these isolates frequently demonstrate complex and numerous resistance mechanisms, such as alterations in the ribosomal proteins l3 and/or l4 and/or presence of cfr and/or  modifications in 23s rrna. the knowledge acquired during the past decades on this initially used oxazolidinone has been utilized for developing new candidate agents, such as tedizolid and radezolid, and as linezolid patents soon begin to expire, generic brands will certainly become available. these events will likely  establish a new chapter for this successful class of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == [clinical distribution and antimicrobial resistance analysis of 754 pathogenic bacteria in diabetic foot infection].
AB  == objective: to explore the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibility  patterns of organisms isolated from diabetic foot ulcers so as to provide selection rationales of antibiotics. methods: a retrospective study was conducted on the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibilities in 754 strains of pathogens isolated from 519 patients with diabetic foot ulcers at our hospital from january 2010 to august 2013. the inter-group data were compared by chi-square test. results: there were 322 (62.0%) males and 197 (38.0%) females. their mean age was (67.7 +/- 12.3) (30-93) years, duration of diabetes 10 (0-40)  years, duration of lower-limb lesion 1.0 (0.0-72.0) months and hba1c (9.09% +/- 2.28%). among 444 (85.5%) cases, a total of 754 strains of pathogens were isolated. gram-positive aerobes were the most frequently isolated (47.3%, 357 strains) and followed by gram-negative aerobes and fungus (40.3% vs 12.3%, 304 vs 93 strains respectively). with rising wagner's grades, bacterial floras transformed from gram-positive cocci to gram-negative rods while fungus and composite infections increased. and 122 strains were of multi drug resistant organisms (mdro). among 357 strains of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis were dominating floras. staphylococcus was highly resistant to penicillin g, erythromycin, and oxacillin while vancomycin and linezolid were the most effective agents against gram-positive bacteria. among 304 strains of gram-negative bacteria, enterobacteria were the most prevalent, including 48 strains of escherichia coli, 34 strains of proteus mirabilis and 31 strains of proteus vulgaris. and there were 29 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa. enterobacteria were highly resistant to ampicillin, followed by bactrim and furadantin while meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/sulbactam, sulperazone and cefepime were the most effective agents.  the predominant fungus was blastomyces albicans. conclusions: in patients with severe diabetic foot ulcers, gram-negative rods predominate while the prevalence  of fungus and composite infections increases. vancomycin and imipenem maintain highly antibacterial activity. it is essential to pay attention to pathogen survey and use antibiotics more rationally.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of antibiotic beads in treating abdominal vascular graft infections.
AB  == objective: abdominal aortic vascular graft infection often involves several different organisms. antibiotic polymethyl methacrylate (pmma) beads may be effective in controlling infection after debridement, but bacterial species identification and antibiotic susceptibility are often not available at the time  of operation, generating a need for a broad-spectrum drug combination for empirical use. we sought to determine an effective antibiotic in pmma beads for use in abdominal vascular graft infection. methods: pmma beads were impregnated with combinations of antibiotics, consisting of daptomycin, tobramycin, and meropenem. antibiotics were selected on the basis of activity spectrum and heat stability. beads were placed on separate agar plates with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. antibiotic inhibition was recorded by use of a modified agar-based disk-diffusion method. results: daptomycin alone  was not active against k. pneumoniae (average = 0 mm). tobramycin alone was not active against vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, k. pneumoniae, or methicillin-resistant s. aureus. tobramycin and daptomycin in combination had moderate broad-spectrum activity with 8- to 14-mm mean inhibition halos. meropenem showed strong activity against all tested organisms with >15-mm mean inhibition halos. the addition of daptomycin to meropenem provided improved coverage of gram-positive organisms. the presence of tobramycin reduced the efficacy of meropenem. conclusions: antibiotic pmma beads containing 10% meropenem with 2.5% daptomycin had excellent in vitro activity against typical bacterial species associated with abdominal vascular graft infections. the addition of antibiotic beads may be a useful adjunct in managing such cases. further studies are required to determine efficacy in clinical practice.

TI  == recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. lipocalin 2 (lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. this study  was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of lcn2 in preventing bacterial  contamination of platelets. methods: recombinant lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. then,  platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees c. results: results revealed that lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) cfu/ml s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, e. coli, and e. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. at this concentration, lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) cfu/ml staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis. conclusion: recombinant lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.

TI  == spiromastixones a-o, antibacterial chlorodepsidones from a deep-sea-derived spiromastix sp. fungus.
AB  == fifteen new depsidone-based analogues named spiromastixones a-o (1-15) were isolated from the fermentation broth of a deep-sea spiromastix sp. fungus. their  structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive nmr and mass spectroscopic analysis in association with chemical conversion. spiromastixones a-o are classified into two subtypes based on the orientation of ring c relative to ring  a, while the n-propyl substituents on rings a and c are rarely seen in natural products. most analogues are substituted by various numbers of chlorine atoms. all compounds exhibited significant inhibition against gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, and bacillus subtilis with mic values ranging from 0.125 to 8.0 mug/ml. in addition, compounds 6-10 displayed potent inhibitory effects against methicillin-resistant bacterial strains of s. aureus (mrsa) and s. epidermidis (mrse), while 10 also inhibited the growth of the vancomycin-resistant bacteria enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium (vre). the structure-activity relationships are discussed.

TI  == [investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food products].
AB  == preservatives are added to food, drugs and other pharmaceutical products to avoid microbial contamination. for antimicrobial activity testing and preservative efficacy testing, vegetative forms of the standard test organisms are used. however, microbial biofilm formation may occur on living tissues, medical implants, industrial or drinking water pipes, natural aquatic systems, glass and  plastic surfaces. in our study, it was aimed to determine the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drug, cosmetics and food products and to compare the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (mbic) of microbial biofilm formed on glass surfaces which are commonly used in those areas and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of the planktonic forms. in the study pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, salmonella thyphimurium sl1344, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis nctc 11047, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were used as the standard strains; sodium nitrate, methylparaben, prophylparaben, potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate as the preservatives; ampicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, amphotericin b and itraconazole as the antimicrobial agents. mic values were determined through the guidelines of clsi m100-s18 and m27-a3 protocols. biotimer method was used to determine the mbic values. the value of "colony forming unit (cfu)/glass beads" was calculated using the graphics drawn by plotting the time of color change for phenol red or resazurin against log10cfu. all experiments were done with four media at different ph values namely ph: 7, ph: 6.5, ph: 6 and ph: 5.5. according to the results of tests on planktonic forms of the microorganisms, sodium benzoate was determined to be the most effective preservative against all the microorganisms tested except s.aureus and e.faecalis. the most effective preservative against s.aureus  and e.faecalis was prophylparaben. prophylparaben was also effective against s.epidermidis. however, in our study it was determined that preservatives were not effective against biofilm forms even if the inoculum was lower, equal to or higher than the inocula of the planktonic forms. the data obtained from this study indicated that preservatives used to prevent microbial contamination in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food products, are not effective against biofilm forms of the microorganisms. this study is thought to be a guide for further studies to be held in the investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects  of preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food industry.

TI  == gamma-alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5h)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. we have recently reported that  some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis. in the present letter we describe results of the biological evaluation  of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus mutans. our  results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms  of s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. in some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/ml (1.3 mum, compound 3d) and 0.7  mug/ml (1.3 mum, 3f). results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.

TI  == the effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  == aim: to establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k  with or without ultrasonic activation. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. the treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase k, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) (with and without ultrasonics). naocl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium ph became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. the clsm showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. on the disc model, trypsin and proteinase k were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. naocl was the most  effective agent (p < 0.001). in the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase k  (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (p < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/-  4.9). conclusion: trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.

TI  == [pathogens of prostatitis and their drug resistance: an epidemiological survey].
AB  == objective: to investigate the epidemiological features of the pathogens responsible for prostatitis in the changshu area, and offer some evidence for the clinical treatment of prostatitis. methods: this study included 2 306 cases of prostatitis that were all clinically confirmed and subjected to pathogenic examinations in 3 hospitals of changshu area from 2008 to 2012. neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma urealyticum and chlamydia trachomatis were detected by nucleic acid amplification abi 7500, the bacterial data analyzed by vitek-2 compact, the drug-resistance to antibacterial agents determined using the whonet  5.6 software, and the enumeration data processed by chi-square test and curvilinear regression analysis using spss 19.0. results: the main pathogens responsible for prostatitis were found to be staphylococcus haemolyticus (30%), staphylococcus epidermidis (12%), enterococcus faecalis (9%), escherichia coli (6%), staphylococcus warneri and staphylococcus aureus (3%), mycoplasma urealyticum (8%), chlamydia trachomatis (5%) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (6%). statistically significant increases were observed in the detection rates of escherichia coli (chi2 = 17.56, p<0.05), mycoplasma urealyticum (chi2 = 8.73, p<0.05), chlamydia trachomatis (chi2 = 8.73, p<0.05) and enterococcus (chi2 = 8.22, p<0.05), but not in other pathogens. the resistance rates of gram-positive  bacteria to erythromycin and benzylpenicillin g were both above 45%, but with no  significant difference between the two, those of oxacillin (chi2 = 10.06, p<0.05) and cefoxitin (chi2 = 9.89, p<0.05) were markedly increased, but those of quinolones, gentamycin and clindamycin remained low, except rifampicin (chi2 = 11.09, p<0.05). the resistance rates of gram-negative bacteria to cefazolin and ampicillin were relatively high (mean 57.3%), and those to ceftriaxone (chi2 = 11.26, p<0.05) and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (chi2 =11.00, p< 0.05) significantly high; those to amikacin, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem remained at low levels with no significant changes. however, the resistance rates of mycoplasma urealyticum to ciprofloxacin (chi2 = 11.18, p<0.05) and azithromycin (chi2 = 9.89, p<0.05) were remarkably increased. conclusion: gram-positive bacteria are the major pathogens responsible for prostatitis, but escherichia coli, enterococcus and sexually transmitted disease  pathogens are found to be involved in recent years. quinolones and aminoglycosides are generally accepted as the main agents for the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infection. however, rational medication for prostatitis should be based on the results of pathogen isolation and drug sensitivity tests in a specific area.

TI  == photocatalytic antibacterial effects are maintained on resin-based tio2 nanocomposites after cessation of uv irradiation.
AB  == photocatalysis induced by tio2 and uv light constitutes a decontamination and antibacterial strategy utilized in many applications including self-cleaning environmental surfaces, water and air treatment. the present work reveals that antibacterial effects induced by photocatalysis can be maintained even after the  cessation of uv irradiation. we show that resin-based composites containing 20% tio2 nanoparticles continue to provide a pronounced antibacterial effect against  the pathogens escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis for up to two hours post uv. for biomaterials or implant coatings, where direct uv illumination is not feasible, a prolonged antibacterial effect after the cessation of the illumination would offer new unexplored treatment possibilities.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == emergence of enterococcus species in the infectious microorganisms cultured from  patients with endophthalmitis in south korea.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the microorganisms in culture-proven endophthalmitis and  their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents commonly used in south korea. methods: medical records of consecutive patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at eight institutions between 1 january 2004 and 31 july 31 2010  were reviewed. four categories of endophthalmitis were studied: postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and unspecified. outcome measures were culture-proven  infectious organisms, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and final visual acuity in  the patients. results: a total of 93 microorganisms were identified from 103 patients during the study period. the positive culture rate was 59.2 % (103/174). the most common organisms identified were enterococcus faecalis (in 20.8 % of patients, 20/96), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.8 %, 18/96), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (10.4 %, 10/96), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3 %,  6/96), and klebsiella pneumoniae (6.3 %, 6/96). two cases of enterococcus faecium (2.1 %) were recognized. overall, 70 of 96 (73.0 %) isolates were gram-positive bacteria, 22 (23.0 %) were gram-negative bacteria, and 4 (4.2 %) were fungi. the  most common organisms resulting in reduced light perception were e. faecalis and  k. pneumoniae. conclusions: the emergence of e. faecalis in endophthalmitis is mainly caused by the high incidence of e. faecalis in postoperative endophthalmitis. this increase also impacts the final visual acuity of the patients.

TI  == rapid detection of gram-positive organisms by use of the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the bact/alert pediatric fan system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == this study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (utis). urine samples from patients with utis (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. the urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. bacterial species were identified by a combination of  bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the bact-ist microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. the most common seven species of bacteria in the study included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection"  method using capillary electrophoresis (ce). each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. the mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (r(2)=0.99). the effect of urine composition on ce results was also investigated. the results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (wbcs) and red blood cells (rbcs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. the results demonstrated that the bacteria in  urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using ce. the "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from utis.

TI  == multiplex identification of gram-positive bacteria and resistance determinants directly from positive blood culture broths: evaluation of an automated microarray-based nucleic acid test.
AB  == background: a multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of the verigene gram-positive blood culture test (bc-gp) test to identify 12 gram-positive bacterial gene targets and three genetic resistance determinants directly from positive blood culture broths containing gram-positive bacteria. methods and findings: 1,252 blood cultures containing gram-positive bacteria were prospectively collected and tested at five clinical centers between april, 2011 and january, 2012. an additional 387 contrived blood cultures containing uncommon targets (e.g., listeria spp., s. lugdunensis, vanb-positive enterococci) were included to fully evaluate the performance of the bc-gp test. sensitivity and specificity for the 12 specific genus or species targets identified by the bc-gp test ranged from 92.6%-100% and  95.4%-100%, respectively. identification of the meca gene in 599 cultures containing s. aureus or s. epidermidis was 98.6% sensitive and 94.3% specific compared to cefoxitin disk method. identification of the vana gene in 81 cultures containing enterococcus faecium or e. faecalis was 100% sensitive and specific. approximately 7.5% (87/1,157) of single-organism cultures contained gram-positive bacteria not present on the bc-gp test panel. in 95 cultures containing multiple  organisms the bc-gp test was in 71.6% (68/95) agreement with culture results. retrospective analysis of 107 separate blood cultures demonstrated that identification of methicillin resistant s. aureus and vancomycin resistant enterococcus spp. was completed an average of 41.8 to 42.4 h earlier using the bc-gp test compared to routine culture methods. the bc-gp test was unable to assign meca to a specific organism in cultures containing more than one staphylococcus isolate and does not identify common blood culture contaminants such as micrococcus, corynebacterium, and bacillus. conclusions: the bc-gp test is a multiplex test capable of detecting most leading causes of gram-positive bacterial blood stream infections as well as genetic markers of methicillin and vancomycin resistance directly from positive blood cultures.

TI  == bacterial contamination of unused, disposable non-sterile gloves on a hospital orthopaedic ward.
AB  == background: non-sterile disposable gloves are used on large hospital wards, however their potential role as a vehicle for pathogen transmission has not been  explored in this setting. aims: this study investigates glove use on a hospital orthopaedic ward to examine whether pathogen contamination occurs prior to contact with patients. method: glove samples were aseptically removed from boxes  on a hospital orthopaedic ward on opening and days 3, 6 and 9 thereafter. following elution of bacteria and viable counts, glove isolates were identified by standard techniques and 16s rdna sequencing. methicillin resistance of staphylococci was determined by disc diffusion, epsilon tests and pcr. gloves were inoculated to determine two isolate survival rates. results: total bacterial counts ranged from 0 to 9.6 x 10(3) cfu/glove. environmental bacteria, particularly bacillus species, were present on 31/38 (81.6%) of samples. half (19/38) the samples were contaminated with skin commensals; coagulase negative staphylococci were predominant. enterococcus faecalis , klebsiella pneumoniae , pseudomonas sp. or methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus were recovered from 5/38 (13.2%) of samples. significantly more skin commensals and pathogens were recovered from samples from days 3, 6, 9 than box-opening samples. staphylococcus epidermidis and klebsiella pneumoniae inoculated onto gloves remained viable for several days but counts decreased. conclusion: health care workers introduced skin commensals and pathogenic bacteria into glove boxes indicating that unused, non-sterile gloves are potential pathogen transmission vehicles in hospitals. findings highlight adherence to handwashing guidelines, common glove retrieval practice, and glove-box design as targets for decreasing bacteria transmission via gloves on hospital wards.

TI  == a novel combinatorial biocatalytic approach for producing antibacterial compounds effective against mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb).
AB  == two bacterial hosts expressing cloned aromatic oxygenases were used to catalyze the oxidation and polymerization of indole and related substrates, creating mixtures of indigoid compounds comprised of novel dimers and trimers. crude extracts and purified compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of gram-positive organisms, in general, and mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb), in particular. of the 74 compounds tested against m. tuberculosis, ~66 % had minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 5 mug/ml or less. the most effective antibiotic found was designated sab-p1, a heterodimer of indole and anthranil, which had a mic of 0.16 mug/ml, and did not inhibit kidney cells (ic(50)) at concentrations of >8 mug/ml. combinatorial biocatalysis was used to create a series of halogenated derivatives of sab-p1 with a wider therapeutic window. none of the derivatives had mic values that were superior to sab-p1, but  some had a wider therapeutic window because of decreased kidney cell toxicity. generally, the indigoid dimers that were effective against tb appeared to be specific for tb. some of the trimers generated, however, had a broader spectrum of activity inhibiting not only tb (mic = 1.1 mug/ml) but also the growth of mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis 168, and clostridium acetobutylicum. the structure of two of the novel dimers (sab-c4 and sab-p1) and  a trimer (sab-r1) were solved using x-ray crystallography.

AB  == purpose of the study: prosthetic joint infection is a feared complication in total hip arthroplasty. the use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement is the important part of preventive and therapeutic strategies. at present a number of commercial bone cements are available and support of their use by the results of  experimental trials and clinical studies has varied. in relation to this issue we studied essential microbiological and pharmacological characteristics of vancogenx in comparison with gentamicin-loaded bone cement used conventionally. material and methods: based on a previously described protocol, we tested pellets of four commercial bone cements, namely, hi-fatigue g, palacos r+g, vancogenx, and palacos r as a control. bone cement was prepared in a vacuum-mixing system. the strains used for bacterial load included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. each cement was tested for its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities and the results were evaluated by standard methods. in addition, we investigated time-related release of gentamicin and vancomycin from the bone cements tested. results: all antibiotic-loaded cement pellets were able to prevent growth of the bacterial strains tested. the bactericidal effect lasted for several days in relation to the bacterial species and cement used, with the exception of s. epidermidis whose growth was inhibited by gentamicin-loaded cement only for one day. the antibiotic-loaded pellets also prevented the formation of a biofilm for 24 hours at least. the major amount of vancomycin (32.915 mg/l) was released from vancogenx to mh medium within 24 hours and the last measureable amount (4.327 mg/l) was recorded at 48 hours after the start of  the experiment. in physiological saline the highest level of vancomycin was 139.852 mg/ml measured at 24 hours, and the antibiotic was detectable at a level  of 2.334 mg/ml as late as 8 days after the experiment started. release of gentamicin from vancogenx was as follows: the 24-hour level was higher in mh medium than physiological saline (178 versus 131.4 mg/ml); however, gentamicin was still detectable in physiological saline at 192 hours after the start of the  experiment while no gentamicin was found in mh medium after 72 hours. discussion: the antimicrobial effect of vancogenx bone cement was not an unexpected finding since both gentamicin and vancomycin have been used with bone cement for a long time and their combination is optimal in terms of preventing prosthetic joint infection. however, there is a disputable issue of poor release of vancomycin from bone cement. in mh medium we were able to detect the vancomycin released from vancogenx only for two days after the initial rapid elution while its release into physiological saline seemed to be slower but much longer. it is possible that more vancomycin is released from bone cement, but this amount is immediately bound to proteins in the cement vicinity and this process is not detectable by any analytical method. conclusions: the bone cement vancogenx showed excellent antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties and can be recommended  for use in orthopaedic practice. therapy of prosthetic joint infection is the main indication. extension of the indication to the prevention of prosthetic joint infection in high-risk patients should be preceded by biomechanical studies demonstrating that the cement is appropriate for long-term implant fixation.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == propeptide processing and proteolytic activity of proenzymes of the staphylococcal and enterococcal gluv8-family protease.
AB  == proenzymes with various lengths of propeptides have been observed in gluv8 from staphylococcus aureus and gluse from s. epidermidis. however, the production mechanism of these proenzymes and roles of truncated propeptides have yet to be elucidated. here we demonstrate that shortening of propeptide commonly occurs in  an auto-catalytic manner in gluv8-family members, including those from coagulase  negative staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis. accompanied with propeptide shortening, the pro-mature junction (asn/ser_1-val1) becomes more susceptible towards the hetero-catalytic maturation enzymes. the auto-catalytic propeptide truncation is not observed in ser169ala inert molecules of gluv8-family members.  a faint proteolytic activity of proenzymes from staphylococcus caprae and e. faecalis is detected. in addition, proteolytic activity of proenzyme of gluv8 carrying arg-3alaasn.1 is demonstrated with synthetic peptide substrates lle/q-mca. these results suggest that gluv8-family proenzymes with shortened propeptides intrinsically possess proteolytic activity and are involved in the propeptide shortening that facilitates the final hetero-catalytic maturation.

TI  == verigene(r) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test.
AB  == bloodstream infections (bsis) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and impose considerable costs on healthcare systems. a key predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with bsis is the early initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial therapy. however, with conventional blood culture methods, the gold standard, there is a significant time delay of approximately 2-3 days before clinical results are available, with many patients receiving inappropriate and/or unnecessary antimicrobial therapy in the interim. during the past two decades, the use of in vitro assays that utilize nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns has led to a significant reduction in the time (hours vs. days with blood culture) to detection and identification of several of the causative pathogens of bsis and, potentially, earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy. this review focuses on the  properties and clinical use of one of these molecular diagnostic assays, the verigene((r)) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp), which detects many of the potentially pathogenic gram-positive bacteria associated with bsis, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., listeria spp., and enterococcus spp., and specific resistance markers (meca, vana, and vanb). based  on more than 1,600 samples, there was a high degree of agreement between bc-gp test results and those obtained using conventional blood culture and assay methods, irrespective of whether samples were fresh or frozen, and a high degree  of agreement for identification of meca-mediated meticillin resistance in s. aureus and s. epidermidis organisms and vana- or vanb-mediated vancomycin resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium organisms.

TI  == recurrent endophthalmitis after trabeculectomy for glaucoma: importance of timely filtering bleb coverage for the conjunctiva.
AB  == purpose: to report the occurrence of endophthalmitis after trabeculectomy for glaucoma that was treated by vitrectomy without bleb closure and recurred 3 times after an initial clinically inapparent period of about 2 years. methods: interventional case report and short review of the pertinent literature. results: a 73-year-old caucasian female underwent trabeculectomy (without mitomycin) for glaucoma. four years after the trabeculectomy, an endophthalmitis with staphylococcus epidermidis as the causative organism occurred and was treated with a pars plana vitrectomy (20-gauge) and a combined antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drug regimen. the bleb was not covered during the emergency procedure because the filtering bleb was heavily infected and filled with pus. as the filtering bleb healed nicely and the filtering function was restored, the filtering bleb was left as it was, and best-corrected visual acuity initially recovered to 0.8. after 22 months, the endophthalmitis recurred, this time with enterococcus faecalis as the causative organism. its treatment required a total of four further vitrectomies (23-gauge), each accompanied by the same antibiotic  and anti-inflammatory drug regimen that had been applied previously. however, the visual acuity could not be preserved, and the eye is blind with defective light projection. conclusions: the literature suggests an aggressive surgical approach  to endophthalmitis, and the present case report confirms this. since the visual prognosis of eyes after endophthalmitis is poor, the course of treatment for endophthalmitis after trabeculectomy should emphasize recurrence prophylaxis rather than address glaucoma symptoms and therefore include safe bleb leak coverage.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187  strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the  ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm), linezolid (lzd) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 microg/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. cefpirome, carbapenems, vcm, teicoplanin (teic), lzd and qpr/dpr had mic90s of <  or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of e. faecalis strains and 1.2% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate to lzd. 17.1% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr.  against all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm was under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity. carbapenems showed good activity against clostridiales, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., but one strain of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. and so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting  continuously.

TI  == use of multiparameter flow cytometry to determine the effects of monoterpenoids and phenylpropanoids on membrane polarity and permeability in staphylococci and enterococci.
AB  == monoterpenoids and phenylpropanoids are major components of many plant essential  oils and are relatively simple, low-molecular-weight compounds with antimicrobial activity. this study used multiparameter flow cytometry to examine changes in membrane polarity and permeability in staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis following exposure to the monoterpenoids carvacrol, 1,8-cineole and terpinen-4-ol and the phenylpropanoids eugenol and cinnamaldehyde. melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) essential oil was also investigated. the fluorescent dyes dioc(2)(3) (3,3'-diethyloxacarbocyanine oxide) and to-pro((r))-3 were used to assess membrane potential and permeability, respectively, following treatment with the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of each test compound for 5 min and 30 min. four subpopulations of cells were identified based on polarity and permeability. eugenol treatment resulted in the  greatest depolarisation and permeabilisation at 5 min, followed by carvacrol. cinnamaldehyde, whilst having the lowest mics (0.006-0.1%, v/v), did not induce changes in polarity or permeability at the mic, and substantially higher concentrations were required to induce significant effects. at 30 min, treatment  with all six compounds resulted in significant depolarisation (60.9-99.3% of cells), whereas fewer compounds (ranging from two to five per organism) resulted  in significant permeabilisation. the extent of permeabilisation was always less than depolarisation, with overall means for all treatments of 46.1% and 89.4% of  cells permeabilised and depolarised, respectively, at 30 min. these data demonstrate that several monoterpenoids and phenylpropanoids as well as tea tree  oil alter membrane properties by decreasing polarity and increasing permeability  in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.

TI  == monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals.
AB  == the drug resistance of microorganisms isolated from laboratory animals never treated with antibiotics is being reported consistently, while the number of laboratory animals used in medicine, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, agriculture,  nutrition, and environmental and health science has increased rapidly in korea. therefore, this study examined the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals bred in korea. a total of 443 isolates  (7 species) containing 5 sphingomonas paucimobilis, 206 escherichia coli, 60 staphylococcus aureus, 15 staphylococcus epidermidis, 77 enterococcus faecalis, 27 citrobacter freundii, 35 acinetobacter baumannii were collected from the nose, intestine, bronchus and reproductive organs of icr mice and sd rats. of these species, acinetobacter baumannii and enterococcus faecalis showed significant antimicrobial resistance according to the minimum inhibition concentration (mic)  in e-test. in case of acinetobacter baumannii, several isolates showed mic values 16-128 microg/ml for cefazolin and cefoxitin, and higher resistance (128-512 microg/ml) to nitrofurantoin than that of standard type. resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin was detected in 17.14, 20.00, and 8.57% of the acinetobacter baumannii isolates, respectively. in addition, 44.1% of the enterococcus faecalis isolates collected from the laboratory animals were resistant to oxacillin concentration of 16-32 microg/ml range, while mic value of standard type was below oxacillin concentration of 6 microg/ml. these results suggest that in rodent species of laboratory animals, acinetobacter baumannii are resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin, whereas those of enterococcus faecalis were resistance to oxacillin.

TI  == volatile organic compound analysis by ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry for gram-positive bacteria differentiation.
AB  == approximately 50 % of all clinically proven infections in critically ill patients are caused by gram-positive bacteria. the timely and appropriate treatment of these infections is vital in order to avoid negative outcomes. hence, fast and reliable methods are needed for the early detection and identification of microorganisms. recently, direct mass spectrometry-based analysis of volatile organic compounds emitted by microorganisms has been employed to study gram-negative bacteria. here, we report a feasibility study of ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry (imr-ms) for in vitro growth detection and species differentiation of selected gram-positive bacteria that are frequently isolated in blood culture samples, namely, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry was used to analyze the headspace above cultures containing gram-positive bacteria incubated at 37 degrees c starting with 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. measurements to determine the presence of volatile organic compounds were performed 4, 8, and 24 h after incubation, respectively. the detection of microbial growth was accomplished already after 8 h in cultures  containing e. faecalis. after 24 h of incubation, characteristic mass spectra were obtained for all species. processing these mass spectra by hierarchic clustering and principal component analysis (pca) enabled us to differentiate between bacterial species. imr-ms in conjunction with a cumulative end-point model provides the means for rapid growth detection and differentiation of gram-positive bacteria on the species level, typically within an analysis time of less than 3 min per sample.

TI  == infected total knee arthroplasty treatment outcome analysis.
AB  == background/aim: infected total knee arthroplasty (tka) is a topic of great importance, because its diagnosing and treatment requires a lot of resources, and often has an unsatisfactory outcome. the aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of the treatment of infection developed following tka. methods: this retrospective study of infected tkas was performed in the period from 1998 to 2008 in the orthopedics & traumatology clinic of the military medical academy (mma) in belgrade. a total of 654 primary and revised tkas were performed in the  said period. we registered and surgically treated 28 infected tkas (primary tkas: mma--22, other institutions--6). the incidence of tka infection in the mma was 3.36%. the most common pathogens were: staphylococcus aureus--14 (50%) cases, and staph. epidermidis--3 (10.7%) cases. other isolated pathogens were: enterococcus  faecalis, klebsiella pneum., klebsiella spp., streptoccocus viridans, seratia spp, micrococcus luteus and peptostreptococcus spp. in one case we had mixed anaerobic flora, and in 3 cases cultures were negative. we analyzed diagnostic challenges, risk factors (such as age and previous viscosupplementation) and treatment outcomes in our series of infected tkas. results: in our series 2 infections healed after iv antibiotics and debridement, 1 patient responded to open debridement with component retention, 4 patients responded fully to one-stage reimplantation, 10 cases responded fully to two-stage reimplantation, 11 patients ended with arthrodesis and we had 1 patient withabove knee amputation. conclusion: two-stage reimplantation remains gold standard for treatment of infected tka, and we recommend it as treatment of choice for eradication of infection. the antibiotic loaded spacer prothesis concept in most  cases allows infection eradication, good function and high patient satisfaction.

TI  == characterization of the antibacterial activity and the chemical components of the volatile oil of the leaves of rubus parvifolius l.
AB  == rubus parvifolius l. (rp) is a medicinal herb that possesses antibacterial activity. in this study, we extracted the volatile oil from the leaves of rp to assess its antibacterial activity and analyze its chemical composition. a uniform distribution design was used to optimize the extraction procedure, which yielded  0.36% (w/w) of light yellowish oil from the water extract of rp leaves. we found  that the extracted oil effectively inhibited the growth of a wide range of gram positive and negative bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii, bacillus cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further analyzed the components contained in the hydro-distillated rp volatile oil by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. twenty nine compounds were identified, including 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene (66%), 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (10%) and 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid (2%). our results suggest that one or multiple constituents contained in rp volatile oil may account for its antibacterial activity.

AB  == objectives: an aqueous extract and fraction from the marine sponge petromica citrina have antibacterial activity. we performed a chemical and biological characterization of the antibiotic substance from p. citrina and investigated its mode of action on staphylococcus aureus cells. methods: the inhibitory activity of the aqueous extract of p. citrina was determined against 14 bacteria belonging to type strains and clinical antibiotic-resistant strains. the aqueous extract was fractionated under bioassay guidance and the bioactive substance was identified by its (1)h-nmr, (13)c-nmr and mass spectra. the mic and the mbc of this substance were determined. this substance was also subjected to cytotoxic bioassays. the mode of action on s. aureus cells was investigated by light and transmission electron microscopy analysis. results: p. citrina showed a large spectrum of activity against type strains and resistant-bacteria such as s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium fortuitum and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the aqueous extract was fractionated and halistanol trisulphate (24epsilon,25-dimethylcholestane-2beta,3alpha,6alpha-triol trisodium sulphate) was isolated for the first time from p. citrina. halistanol trisulphate had a bactericidal effect on exponentially growing s. aureus cells at the mic (512 mg/l). cytotoxicity biossays showed moderate toxicity against cancer cell line l929 (fibrosarcoma). this substance apparently acts by damaging the cell membrane, with subsequent cell lysis. conclusions: halistanol trisulphate is a broad-spectrum antibiotic isolated from p. citrina with a mode of action involving disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. it is a new candidate for research on antibacterial substances.

TI  == activation of type iii interferon genes by pathogenic bacteria in infected epithelial cells and mouse placenta.
AB  == bacterial infections trigger the expression of type i and ii interferon genes but little is known about their effect on type iii interferon (ifn-lambda) genes, whose products play important roles in epithelial innate immunity against viruses. here, we studied the expression of ifn-lambda genes in cultured human epithelial cells infected with different pathogenic bacteria and in the mouse placenta infected with listeria monocytogenes. we first showed that in intestinal lovo cells, induction of ifn-lambda genes by l. monocytogenes required bacterial  entry and increased further during the bacterial intracellular phase of infection. other gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis, also induced ifn-lambda genes when internalized by lovo cells. in contrast, gram-negative bacteria salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, shigella flexneri and chlamydia trachomatis did not substantially induce ifn-lambda. we also found that ifn-lambda genes were up-regulated in a549 lung epithelial cells infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and in hepg2 hepatocytes and bewo trophoblastic cells infected with  l. monocytogenes. in a humanized mouse line permissive to fetoplacental listeriosis, ifn-lambda2/lambda3 mrna levels were enhanced in placentas infected  with l. monocytogenes. in addition, the feto-placental tissue was responsive to ifn-lambda2. together, these results suggest that ifn-lambda may be an important  modulator of the immune response to gram-positive intracellular bacteria in epithelial tissues.

TI  == lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. however, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded  as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of gram positive pathogens, including strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. it is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting  a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.

TI  == phosphoinositide binding by the toll adaptor dmyd88 controls antibacterial responses in drosophila.
AB  == the cell biological principles that govern innate immune responses in drosophila  are unknown. here, we report that toll signaling in flies was dictated by the subcellular localization of the adaptor protein dmyd88. dmyd88 was located at the plasma membrane by a process dependent on a c-terminal phosphoinositide-binding domain. in vivo analysis revealed that lipid binding by dmyd88 was necessary for  its antimicrobial and developmental functions as well as for the recruitment of the downstream cytosolic adaptor tube to the cell surface. these data are reminiscent of the interactions between the mammalian toll adaptors myd88 and tirap with one major exception. in the mammalian system, myd88 is the cytosolic adaptor that depends on the phosphoinositide-binding protein tirap for its recruitment to the cell surface. we therefore propose that dmyd88 is the functional homolog of tirap and that both proteins function as sorting adaptors to recruit downstream signaling adaptors to activated receptors.

TI  == action of linezolid or vancomycin on biofilms in ventriculoperitoneal shunts in vitro.
AB  == cerebrospinal fluid (csf) shunts used to treat hydrocephalus have an overall infection rate of about 10% of operations. the commonest causative bacteria are staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. major difficulties are encountered with nonsurgical treatment due to biofilm development in the shunt tubing and inability to achieve sufficiently high csf drug levels by intravenous administration. recently, three cases of s. epidermidis csf shunt infection have been treated by intravenous linezolid without surgical shunt removal, and we therefore investigated vancomycin and linezolid against biofilms of these bacteria in vitro. a continuous-perfusion model of shunt catheter biofilms was used to establish mature (1-week) biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis (both methicillin resistant  [mrsa and mrse]), enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. they were then "treated" with either vancomycin or linezolid in concentrations achievable in csf for 14 days. the biofilms were then monitored for 1 week for eradication and for  regrowth. enterococcal biofilms were not eradicated by either vancomycin or linezolid. staphylococcal biofilms were eradicated by both antibiotics after 2 days and did not regrow. no resistance was seen. linezolid at concentrations achievable by intravenous or oral administration was able to eradicate biofilms of both s. epidermidis (mrse) and s. aureus (mrsa). neither vancomycin at concentrations achievable by intrathecal administration nor linezolid was able to eradicate enterococcal biofilms. it is hoped that these in vitro results will stimulate further clinical trials with linezolid, avoiding surgical shunt removal.

TI  == protection against staphylococcus aureus by antibody to the polyglycerolphosphate backbone of heterologous lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == type 1 lipoteichoic acid (lta) is present in many clinically important gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and antibodies against lta have been shown to opsonize nonencapsulated enterococcus faecalis strains. in the present study, we show that antibodies against e. faecalis lta also bind to type 1 lta from other gram-positive species  and opsonized staphylocccus epidermidis and staphylcoccus aureus strains as well  as group b streptococci. inhibition studies using teichoic acid oligomers indicated that cross-reactive opsonic antibodies bind to the teichoic acid backbone. passive immunization with rabbit antibodies against e. faecalis lta promoted the clearance of bacteremia by e. faecalis and s. epidermidis in mice. furthermore, passive protection also reduced mortality in a murine s. aureus peritonitis model. the effectiveness of rabbit antibody against lta suggests that this conserved bacterial structure could function as a single vaccine antigen that targets multiple gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == antiadhesive activity of the biosurfactant pseudofactin ii secreted by the arctic bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens bd5.
AB  == background: pseudofactin ii is a recently identified biosurfactant secreted by pseudomonas fluorescens bd5, the strain obtained from freshwater from the arctic  archipelago of svalbard. pseudofactin ii is a novel compound identified as cyclic lipopeptide with a palmitic acid connected to the terminal amino group of eighth  amino acid in peptide moiety. the c-terminal carboxylic group of the last amino acid forms a lactone with the hydroxyl of thr3. adhesion is the first stage of biofilm formation and the best moment for the action of antiadhesive and anti-biofilm compounds. adsorption of biosurfactants to a surface e.g. glass, polystyrene, silicone modifies its hydrophobicity, interfering with the microbial adhesion and desorption processes. in this study the role and applications of pseudofactin ii as a antiadhesive compound has been investigated from medicinal and therapeutic perspectives. results: pseudofactin ii lowered the adhesion to three types of surfaces (glass, polystyrene and silicone) of bacterial strains of five species: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis and two candida albicans strains. pretreatment of a polystyrene surface with 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin ii inhibited bacterial adhesion by 36-90% and that of c. albicans by 92-99%. the same concentration of pseudofactin ii dislodged 26-70% of preexisting biofilms grown on previously untreated surfaces. pseudofactin ii also caused a marked inhibition of the initial adhesion of e. faecalis, e. coli, e. hirae and c. albicans strains to silicone urethral catheters. the highest concentration tested (0.5 mg/ml) caused a total growth inhibition of s. epidermidis, partial (18-37%) inhibition of other bacteria and 8-9% inhibition of c. albicans growth. conclusion: pseudofactin ii showed antiadhesive activity against several pathogenic microorganisms which are potential biofilm formers on catheters, implants and internal prostheses. up to 99% prevention could be achieved by 0.5 mg/ml pseudofactin ii. in addition, pseudofactin ii dispersed preformed biofilms. pseudofactin ii can be used as a disinfectant or surface coating agent against microbial colonization of different surfaces, e.g. implants or urethral catheters.

TI  == assessment of the antimicrobial activity of acellular vascular grafts.
AB  == several studies have reported biological vascular grafts to be more resistant to  microbial infection than synthetic counterparts in vivo. indeed, small intestinal submucosa (sis) materials have previously been reported to be antimicrobial. the  aim of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity and the ability to resist biofilm formation of a novel acellular vascular graft and compare it to commercially available alternatives using a range of organisms: mrsa, mssa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. this was achieved using a modified disk diffusion assay and extraction of the materials into solution followed by minimum inhibitory concentration assays. to assess resistance to biofilm formation a novel biofilm assay was developed which compared the total colony forming units (cfu) recovered from each material and identification of the percentage of cfu which were loosely attached, residing within the biofilm or attached to the biomaterial. the results indicated a lack of antimicrobial activity for all materials tested, including sis. the biological materials were more resistant to the formation of a biofilm compared to dacron.

TI  == garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  == when thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. as the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. in the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (allium sativum). wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (garo) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. garo prevented biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within enterococcus faecalis biofilms. additionally, garo disrupted partially developed  biofilms produced by s. aureus, s. epidermidis and a. baumannii. the antistaphylococcal activity of garo was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. thus, garo could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound  biofilms caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.

TI  == antioxidant, antimicrobial activities and fatty acid components of flower, leaf,  stem and seed of hypericum scabrum.
AB  == the hexane extracts of flower, leaf, stem, and seed of hypericum scabrum, which were collected from northwestern iran, were obtained by extraction in a soxhlet apparatus. the fatty acids were converted to methyl esters and determined by gas  chromatography/flame ionization detector (gc/fid) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (gc/ms) systems. the hexane extract from the flower, leaf, stem, and seed contained 39.1%, 43.2%, 29.0%, and 37.6% of omega-3 fatty acids, respectively. the other main components of the flower extract were tetracosane (12.2%) and palmitic acid (9.3%), and that of the leaf extract was palmitic acid  (7.4%). the stem and seed extracts contained bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (18.7% and 35.7%), nonacosane (11.7% and 3.9%) and linoleic acid (6.5% and 6.9%) as major components. the hexane extracts of different parts from h. scabrum represent an important source of omega-3 fatty acids in several hypericum species. the antioxidant activity of all hexane extracts was evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical scavenging method. the results indicate that hexane extracts from different parts of h. scabrum possess considerable antioxidant activity. the highest radical scavenging activity was detected in seed, which had an ic50 = 165 microg/ml. the antimicrobial activity of the extracts of those samples were determined against seven gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria (bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus  aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella  pneumoniae), as well as three fungi (candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae,  and aspergillus niger). the bioassay showed that the oil exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity. this study reveals that the all parts of this plant are attractive sources of fatty acid components, especially the essential ones, as well as of effective natural antioxidants.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance dynamics and isolation rate of staphylococci and enterococci from patients of reconstructive surgery units].
AB  == the dynamics of isolation of staphylococci and enterococci from clinical material of patients and their antibiotic susceptibility within a 5-year period (2005-2009) was analysed. 5990 isolates were tested: 1250 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, 3268 isolates of s. epidermidis, 1005 isolates of enterococcus faecalis and 467 isolates of e. faecium. grampositive infections were shown to be prevailing within the last 2-3 years, the nosocomial epidermal staphylococci more and more replacing s. aureus (the ratio of s. epidermidis and  s. aureus in 2009 was 3.3). the isolation rate of e. faecalis significantly increased (by 3.5 times) and the ratio of e. faecalis and e. faecium in 2009 was  4.3. the microflora composition with respect to the isolation source was analysed and its clinical significance was estimated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that oxacillin had its own specific niche, while antibiotics active against resistant grampositive cocci, such as rifampicin, fusidic acid, fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin), cefoxitin, as well as amoxicillin/clavulane in infections due to e. faecalis, might be considered as the drugs of choice. in the treatment of nosocomial infections, when the etiological role of mrsa or vre is suspected or confirmed, the complex therapy should obligatory include the most active antibiotics (vancomycin or linezolid among them).

TI  == extracellular dna in biofilms.
AB  == extracellular dna (edna) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, then enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. autolysis is the common mechanism by which edna is released. in p. aeruginosa edna is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. in e. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. in staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic  suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells.  in s. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in s. epidermidis by the autolysin protein atle. in p. aeruginosa edna is located primarily in the  stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. in s. aureus the crucial role of edna in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of dnase i. edna represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. edna and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the tlr family of pattern recognition receptors (prrs).

TI  == role of antibiofilm-antimicrobial agents in controlling device-related infections.
AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of n-acetylcysteine (nac) on organism viability in planktonic and biofilm phases, biofilm thickness, and extracellular polysaccharide content. methods: we performed time-kill curves and broth macrodilution assays of bacterial and fungal clinical isolates with varying concentrations of nac. we also created in vitro bacterial biofilms, incubated them with nac or control, and then stained with propidium iodide and fitc-labeled concanavalin a. we measured biofilm thickness, number of non-viable cells, and fluorescent intensity as a marker of extracellular matrix via a confocal laser scanning microscope. all experiments were conducted in triplicate. tested organisms included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa, mrsa), s. epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans and c. krusei. results: nac 80 mg/ml was uniformly bactericidal (>99.9%  reduction) against all tested bacteria with no recoverable organisms after 30 minutes of incubation, but was fungistatic against candida species. minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of nac ranged from 5-10 mg/ml. biofilm thickness was significantly decreased in nac-treated biofilms for all organisms except vre. the number of non-viable cells in nac-treated gram-positive biofilms  was increased (p<0.05 for mrsa and vre). nac-treated gram-negative biofilms had scant cellularity and lacked complex 3-dimensional structures that were characteristic of controls. fluorescent intensity was similar in the experimental and control arms. conclusions: nac is bactericidal against clinically relevant and drug-resistant bacteria and also leads to biofilm disruption. nac has the potential for use as a novel agent for prevention or treatment of biofilm-related infections.

TI  == do dental impression materials play a role in cross contamination?
AB  == objective: dentists are required to institute infectious control procedures. dental impression materials possessing antimicrobial properties may aid in reducing the risk of cross contamination since impression materials might play a  role as carriers. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of four impression materials. method and materials: four impression materials--orthoprint, impregum penta, aquasil ultra monophase, and permlastic--were evaluated by the direct contact test. the materials were tested  in contact with enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and candida albicans. the materials were mixed; allowed to set; and  examined immediately and after aging for 24, 48, and 72 hours and 1 week. two-way anova, one-way anova, and tukey multiple comparison procedures were applied to the results. results: impregum penta presented the broadest antibacterial spectrum of all the materials tested. there was a complete growth inhibition of s aureus and s epidermidis, and it sustained this ability for at least 7 days. it also showed an antifungal effect by partially inhibiting the growth of c albicans, a quality that was seen only immediately after setting. aquasil ultra showed an antifungal effect only immediately after setting. permlastic showed a complete growth inhibition when in contact with c albicans and sustained this ability for at least 7 days. no significant antimicrobial properties were recorded for orthoprint. when in contact with e faecalis, no significant antibacterial properties were recorded for any of the materials. conclusion: none of the tested materials exhibited a long-lasting or complete antibacterial and antifungal property. therefore, disinfection of impressions is essential.

TI  == bile culture and susceptibility testing of malignant biliary obstruction via ptbd.
AB  == purpose: to assess the information obtained by bile culture and susceptibility testing for malignant biliary obstruction by a retrospective one-center study. methods: a total of 694 patients with malignant biliary obstruction received percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage during the period july 2003 to september 2010, and subsequently, bile specimens were collected during the procedure. among the 694 patients, 485 were men and 209 were women, ranging in age from 38 to 78 years (mean age 62 years). results: a total of 42.9% patients had a positive bile culture (298 of 694). further, 57 species of microorganisms and 342 strains were identified; gram-positive bacteria accounted for 50.9% (174  of 342) and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 41.5% (142 of 342) of these strains. no anaerobes were obtained by culture during this study. the most common microorganisms were enterococcus faecalis (41 of 342, 11.9%), escherichia coli (34 of 342, 9.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (28 of 342, 8.2%), staphylococcus epidermidis (19 of 342, 5.5%), enterococcus (18 of 342, 5.3%), and enterobacter cloacae (16 of 342, 4.7%). the percentage of beta-lactamase-producing gram-positive bacteria was 27.6% (48 of 174), and the percentage of gram-negative bacteria was 19.7% (28 of 142). the percentage of enzyme-producing escherichia coli was 61.7% (21 of 34). conclusion: the bile cultures in malignant biliary obstruction are different from those in the tokyo guidelines and other benign biliary obstruction researches, which indicates that a different antibacterial therapy should be applied. thus, knowledge of the antimicrobial susceptibility data could aid in the better use of antibiotics for the empirical therapy of biliary infection combined with malignant biliary obstruction.

AB  == hospital-acquired infections (hais) remain a leading cause of death in the united states. unfortunately, treatment of hais is complicated by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. in an effort to enhance the body's natural immune response to infection, we have developed an artificial opsonin to  promote the recognition, phagocytosis, and destruction of pathogenic bacteria by  human phagocytes. the artificial opsonin is constructed from multivalent conjugates of poly(l-lysine)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) with vancomycin and human igg-fc. our approach utilizes vancomycin's inherent ability to bind to d-ala-d-ala terminated peptides present in the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. here, we show that conjugation of vancomycin to pll-g-peg prevents its  action as an antibiotic and allows vancomycin to function solely as a recognition molecule. human igg-fc antibody fragment serves as a phagocyte recognition molecule and is recognized by the fcgamma cell surface receptors expressed on professional human phagocytes. using flow cytometry, we found that a polysaccharide-encapsulated, methicillin-resistant strain of staphylococcus epidermidis is efficiently recognized by the artificial opsonin (nearly 100% of cells were opsonized) and that opsonin binding is specific since it can be inhibited by the soluble cell wall peptide analog acetyl-lys-d-ala-d-ala. opsonization of s. epidermidis resulted in an approximate 2-fold increase in phagocytosis by a human neutrophil cell line. notably, enterococcus faecalis vanb, a bacterial strain with inducible vancomycin resistance, was used to show that the artificial opsonin does not unintentionally induce antibiotic resistance mechanisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all  staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </=  0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus  pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the  broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == count, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria recovered from dental solid waste in brazil.
AB  == in brazil, few studies on microbial content of dental solid waste and its antibiotic susceptibility are available. an effort has been made through this study to evaluate the hazardous status of dental solid waste, keeping in mind its possible role in cross-infection chain. six samples of solid waste were collected at different times and seasons from three dental health services. the microbial content was evaluated in different culture media and atmospheric conditions, and  the isolates were submitted to antibiotic susceptibility testing. a total of 766  bacterial strains were isolated and identified during the study period. gram-positive cocci were the most frequent morphotype isolated (48.0%), followed  by gram-negative rods (46.2%), gram-positive rods (5.0%), gram-negative-cocci (0.4%), and gram-positive coccobacillus (0.1%). only two anaerobic bacteria were  isolated (0.3%). the most frequently isolated species was staphylococcus epidermidis (29.9%), followed by stenotrophomonas maltophilia (8.2%), and enterococcus faecalis (6.7%). high resistance rate to ampicillin was observed among gram-negative rods (59.4%) and gram-positive cocci (44.4%). for gram-negative rods, high resistance was also noted to aztreonam (47.7%), cefotaxime (47.4%), ceftriaxone and cefazolin (43.7%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (38.2%). against gram-positive cocci penicillin exhibit a higher resistance  rate (45.0%), followed by ampicillin, erythromycin (27.2%), and tetracycline (22.0%). the present study demonstrated that several pathogenic bacteria are present in dental solid waste and can survive after 48 h from the waste generation time and harbor resistance profiles against several clinical recommended antibiotics.

TI  == suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  == acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. the main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of suprathel (polymedics innovations gmbh, denkendorf, germany) in combination with  various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii, or pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. the study  was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [hibicet]). as a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive  bacteria strains were tested: escherichia coli, p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups a and b. the tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, and a baumannii, except for the combination of  suprathel and mafenide acetate. it can be concluded that suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. the authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. the combination of  suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.

TI  == prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern nigeria.
AB  == enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. the aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in osogbo, nigeria. the study was conducted between january and june 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of enterococcus species at the  bacteriology laboratory of ladoke akintola university of technology, osogbo using standard microbiological methods. there were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (hai); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. two species of enterococcus were identified; enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection  (uti) and surgical site infection (ssi) of 6 (85.7%) patients and enterococcus faecium from uti in 1 (14.3%) patient. other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were klebsiella spp 31.0%, pseudomonas spp 20.7%, staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, escherichia coli 12.1%, staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and serratia spp 1.7%. all the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) with the vre strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. other gram-positive and gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except e. coli and pseudomonas spp which  were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. this limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci  infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. there is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and  rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

TI  == effects of demethylfruticuline a and fruticuline a from salvia corrugata vahl. on biofilm production in vitro by multiresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == in this study, demethylfruticuline a (dfa) and fruticuline a (fa), two quinones representing the major diterpenoid components of the exudate produced by the aerial parts of salvia corrugata, were assessed for their ability to modify surface characteristics, such as hydrophobicity, and to inhibit synthesis of biofilm in vitro by multiresistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. five strains of s. aureus (three meticillin-resistant and two meticillin-susceptible), five strains of s. epidermidis (four meticillin-resistant and one meticillin-susceptible) and eight  vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, all recently isolated from clinical specimens and capable of slime production, were studied. fa decrease by at least two-fold the hydrophobic properties of the s. aureus cell membrane but did not affect s. epidermidis or e. faecalis. biofilm formation on polystyrene plates was quantified spectrophotometrically by established methodologies. inhibition of biofilm formation was also confirmed by the congo red agar plate assay. dfa and fa were more effective against s. aureus strains (>70% effect at subinhibitory concentrations) than against s. epidermidis in inhibiting slime synthesis. against e. faecalis, dfa at subinhibitory concentration induced an inhibition of  biofilm production of ca. 60%; fa was less active and more strain-dependent. moreover, the two compounds were shown to possess chelating activity on divalent  and trivalent metal cations. interactions of fa and dfa with bacteria could be very complex, possibly being species-specific, and could depend not only on inhibition of exopolysaccharide synthesis but also on their chelating activity and on changes in the microorganism's surface, including cell hydrophobicity.

AB  == background: biofilm-associated infections in trauma surgery are difficult to treat with conventional therapies. therefore, it is important to develop new treatment modalities. maggots in captured bags, which are permeable for larval excretions/secretions, aid in healing severe, infected wounds, suspect for biofilm formation. therefore we presumed maggot excretions/secretions would reduce biofilm formation. questions/purposes: we studied biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, and enterobacter cloacae on polyethylene, titanium, and stainless steel. we compared the quantities of biofilm formation between the bacterial species on the various biomaterials and the quantity of biofilm formation after various incubation times. maggot excretions/secretions were added to existing biofilms to examine their effect. methods: comb-like models of the biomaterials, made to fit in a 96-well microtiter plate, were incubated with bacterial suspension. the formed biofilms were stained in crystal violet, which was eluted in ethanol. the optical density (at 595 nm) of the eluate was determined to quantify biofilm formation. maggot excretions/secretions were pipetted in different concentrations to (nonstained) 7-day-old biofilms, incubated 24 hours, and finally measured. results: the strongest biofilms were formed by s. aureus and s. epidermidis on polyethylene and the weakest on titanium. the highest quantity of biofilm formation was reached within 7 days for both bacteria. the presence of excretions/secretions reduced biofilm formation on all biomaterials. a maximum of 92% of biofilm reduction was measured. conclusions: our observations suggest maggot excretions/secretions decrease biofilm formation and could provide a new treatment for biofilm formation on infected biomaterials.

TI  == inhibition of sodium hypochlorite antimicrobial activity in the presence of bovine serum albumin.
AB  == introduction: this study investigated the inhibition of the antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite (naocl) by bovine serum albumin (bsa). the killing of enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, staphylococcus epidermidis, and escherichia coli by naocl in concentrations from 2% to 0.03% was measured in  the presence of bsa in concentrations between 6.7% and 0.1%. methods: naocl, bsa, and microorganism suspensions were mixed, and, after 30 seconds, 6 minutes, and 30 minutes, samples were taken and naocl was inactivated by 5% sodium thiosulphate. the microbes were incubated in tryptic soy broth broth for up to 7  days for the detection of growth. results: all microorganisms were killed within  30 seconds by 0.03% naocl when bsa was not present. high concentrations of bsa significantly reduced the antimicrobial activity of naocl against the four species. conclusions: the inhibition of sodium hypochlorite by bsa was directly dependent on their quantitative relationships. the result partly explains the poorer performance in vivo of naocl as compared to in vitro experiments.

TI  == [evolution in the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance].
AB  == over the last decade the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has been a growing problem, especially in some geographic areas, making useless most of the classical antibiotic therapies. the rapid emergence of resistant bacteria is  the result of different factors as the intrinsic microbial complexity, the growing attitude to travel of humans, animals and goods, the use of antibiotics outside hospitals, and the lack of precise therapeutic chooses for high risk group of patients. the antibiotic-resistance becomes certainly a serious problem  when a resistant pathogen, and often multi-resistant today, is present in an infective site. in fact in a recent estimate of the centre for disease control and prevention (cdc) about 90.000 deaths per year in the usa are attributable to  bacterial infections and in particular to resistant pathogens. it appears clear that the clinic relevance of this problem is the decimation of the sensible germs of the normal flora that leads to the upper hand of the only resistant bacteria.  the antibiotic therapy, in fact, select the resistance and each bacteria has developed a particular strategy to survive: mutations of the genetic content or acquisition of resistance genes from the external. among the gram positive bacteria, besides methicillin resistant staphyloccocus aureus, there are other pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, some species of streptococci and multiresistant corynebacterium. the cons, eg. s. epidermidis, s. hominis and s. haemolyticus, are recognized as new important nosocomial pathogens and are not only responsible of invasive infections but have become in few years resistant to oxacillin (more  than 60%) and multiresistant. the unsuspected fragility of glycopeptides, which for 40 years have been the most important treatment against infections due to gram-positive bacteria, has posed the need for new antimicrobial molecules. among the therapeutic possible options there are linezolid, tygecyline and daptomycin,  but new other molecules are appearing in the clinical use like ceftobiprole and dalbavancin.

TI  == zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program: linezolid surveillance program results for 2008.
AB  == the seventh year of the zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against gram-positive pathogens in latin america, europe, canada, and the asia-pacific region. linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the united kingdom, japan, and china where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: s. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (748), enterococci (864), streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). eight linezolid-resistant (lzd-r) isolates were detected in 7 countries (italy [2], france, china, brazil, sweden, germany, and united kingdom) among the enterococci (enterococcus faecalis [3] and e. faecium [2]) and cons (3  staphylococcus epidermidis). five lzd-r isolates contained 23s rrna mutations (g2576t or g2447t), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. one cons (italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in taiwan. all streptococci  were linezolid susceptible (mic(90), 1 microg/ml). in conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. documented lzd-r remains rare  (only 0.13% overall but highest for cons [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of mrsa varied by geographic region and  between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.

TI  == ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssi), including those caused by meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (pbp)2a, an mrsa-specific pbp that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. the high binding affinity of  ceftaroline to pbp2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/ml) correlates  well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for mrsa. ceftaroline is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci, including mrsa, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (not e. faecium). the broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampc-derepressed enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug)  is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. for multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/ml and 21.0 microg/ml for first and  last dose, respectively. ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 l/kg (28.3 l), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. no drug  accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through  renal excretion (49.6%). based on monte carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. a phase ii study randomized 100 patients with csssi to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. in a phase iii trial, 702 patients with csssi were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating csssi caused by both gram-positive and -negative pathogens. adverse event rates were similar between groups. ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is  consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for csssi and cap, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == sonication is superior to scraping for retrieval of bacteria in biofilm on titanium and steel surfaces in vitro.
AB  == background and purpose: low-virulence implant infections are characterized by bacterial colonization of the implant with subsequent biofilm formation. in these cases, soft tissue biopsies often prove to be culture negative. consequently, detachment of the causative adherent bacteria is crucial for correct microbiological diagnosis. using an in vitro model, we compared 4 methods of biofilm sampling from metal surfaces. methods: discs of titanium and steel were incubated in the presence of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and propionibacterium acnes in mueller hinton broth. non-adherent bacteria were removed by repeated rinsing of the discs. 10 parallels of each disc were subjected to 1 of 4 methods for bacterial recovery: (a) sonication of the discs, (b) scraping of the discs using surgical blades followed by streaking of the blades onto agar plates, (c) scraping of the discs followed by vortex mixing of the surgical blades, and (d) scraping of the discs followed by sonication of the surgical blades. quantitative bacterial cultures were performed for each sampling method. results: with the exception of s. epidermidis on steel, sonication efficiently and reliably dislodged biofilm bacteria. the scraping methods employed did not detach bacteria embedded in biofilm. interpretation: scraping of metal surfaces is not an adequate method for sampling of biofilm bacteria in vitro.

TI  == characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  == the present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a r. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. the bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium, and enterobacteriaceae (enterobacter spp., escherichia coli) while pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. the lactobacillus plantarum and l. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. while l. plantarum crl 1606 also inhibited  red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. however, by using a mrs medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. the surface properties of lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate abo human erythrocytes, while  the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. this  paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.

TI  == biofilm evidence and the microbial diversity of horse wounds.
AB  == evidence of biofilms in human chronic wounds are thought to be responsible for preventing healing in a timely manner. however, biofilm evidence in horse wounds  has not yet been documented. consequently, this study aimed to determine whether  biofilms could be detected in wounds, and to investigate the microbiology of chronic wounds in horses. prior to analysis, wound surfaces were irrigated with 5 ml of sterile saline to remove debris. all wounds were swabbed twice (1 cm2 area) using sterile cotton-tipped swabs. in addition to this, 2 tissue biopsies were taken to investigate evidence of biofilm and the microbiology richness of the wounds. all swabs and 1 biopsy sample were transported to the laboratory in robertson's cooked meat broth. traditional culturable techniques and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis with pcr were utilized to identify common bacteria isolated in all wounds. following analysis of a number of the biopsy samples, biofilms could be clearly seen. the most common bacteria isolated from each wound analysed included pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, enterococcus faecalis, and providencia rettgeri. sequencing of the 16s ribosmonal dnas, selected on the basis of dgge profiling, enabled identification of bacterial species not identified using culturable technology. this study is the first to identify biofilms in the chronic wounds of horses. in  addition, this study also demonstrated the importance of combining dgge-pcr with  culture techniques to provide better microbiology analysis of chronic wounds.

TI  == the antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  == acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. the main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused  by organisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa. this study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect  of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (hibicet). former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial  strains were tested: escherichia coli, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii,  enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and beta-haemolytic streptococcus group a and b. the tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii. the microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested  at a low concentration of 3%. in comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. an evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic  acid is currently underway. it can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.

TI  == clinical investigation of isolated bacteria from urinary tracts of hospitalized patients and their susceptibilities to antibiotics.
AB  == complicated urinary tract infections (utis) are often difficult to treat, partly  because of the existence of isolated antibiotic-resistant strains. even though the definition of uti is determined by the quantity of cultured bacteria, it has  been unclear if the quantity of cultured uti bacteria affects their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. also, the gram stain is generally performed to assume the causative bacteria and their quantity before culture results can be obtained; therefore, we could start to use effective antibiotics if the relationship between bacterial quantity and resistance to antimicrobial agents were clear. we studied patients diagnosed as having complicated utis at the urological department in kobe university hospital between june 2002 and march 2003 and analyzed the relationships between the quantity of cultured bacteria and their antimicrobial mics for antibiotics. the most commonly isolated bacteria were serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. there was no significant correlation between the quantity of cultured bacteria and antimicrobial mics in all the bacteria and antibiotics that we tested, suggesting that resistant phenotype, but not inoculum of the organism, did determine resistance to antibiotics. in conclusion, our investigation suggested the total number of isolated bacteria in  urine culture did not determine the mics and that inoculum of the bacteria might  be important for this determination.

TI  == infection after elective colorectal surgery: bacteriological analysis of failures in a randomized trial of cefotetan vs. ertapenem prophylaxis.
AB  == background: a randomized study comparing single-dose cefotetan and ertapenem prophylaxis for elective colorectal surgery in 1,002 patients found ertapenem to  be significantly more effective (p < 0.001). failures of prophylaxis were thought to involve organisms resistant to both antimicrobial agents, isolated most often  from deep or superficial incision sites. methods: further testing and analysis of the microbial data was performed. susceptibility results were correlated with the clinical outcomes reported previously. results: of the 216 aerobes tested, 62.6%  were resistant to cefotetan and 44% to ertapenem. enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were the aerobes recovered most  frequently, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium innocuum, and eubacterium lentum were the most frequent anaerobes. enterococcus faecalis usually was associated in mixed culture with bacteroides fragilis group species.  approximately one-half of the 158 anaerobes (50.7%), including all the species above, were resistant to cefotetan; most of these (61.4%) came from superficial incision sites. only one anaerobe (desulfovibrio fairfieldensis), found in a superficial incisional infection, was resistant to ertapenem, and no ertapenem-resistant enteric bacteria were recovered. in vitro resistance was associated with therapeutic failure. conclusions: the in vitro activity of ertapenem was superior to that of cefotetan against all anaerobic and many aerobic bacteria isolated from postoperative cultures of patients who failed prophylaxis with these agents. our findings help to elucidate the results of the  clinical trial.

TI  == glycopeptide bone penetration in patients with septic pseudoarthrosis of the tibia.
AB  == background and objective: in the treatment of bone infections, a major determinant of the clinical response is the active drug concentration at the infected site. because of the high prevalence of meticillin (methicillin)-resistant staphylococci and enterococci, glycopeptides are widely used for the treatment of bone and joint infections, but data on their penetration into human bone are lacking. the aim of our study was to measure vancomycin and teicoplanin concentrations in infected human bone under steady-state conditions and verify their relationship with inflammatory markers,  patient demographic characteristics and pharmacodynamic microbiological markers.  methods and patients: twenty-seven adult orthopaedic patients undergoing surgical debridement for septic pseudoarthrosis of the tibia and receiving either intravenous vancomycin (vancocina) 1 g twice daily) or teicoplanin (targosid) 10  mg/kg/day) were studied from january 2004 to january 2008. plasma and bone specimens were simultaneously collected during surgery for pharmacokinetic and microbiological assays at a variable interval after antimicrobial administration. bone samples were dissected into cortical and cancellous bone, cleaned of soft tissues, crushed and eluted into phosphate buffer. necrotic samples and sequestra were not analysed.plasma and bone antimicrobial concentrations were measured by a validated method of high-performance liquid chromatography with uv detection, and bone/plasma concentration ratios were calculated. cortical and cancellous bone area under the concentration-time curve (auc) over 24 hours (auc(24)) values were measured by the linear-log trapezoidal rule, using winnonlin) software, and were  compared with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the infecting agents. results: for vancomycin, the mean +/- sd concentrations were 2.66 +/- 1.2 mg/l in cortical bone and 11.53 +/- 7.8 mg/l in cancellous bone (corresponding to 20.67% and 89.39% of intraoperative plasma concentrations), and the mean +/- sd tissue auc(24) values were 55.15 +/- 25.26 h . mg/l for cortical bone and 299.16  +/- 299.54 h . mg/l for cancellous bone. for teicoplanin, the mean +/- sd concentrations were 2.01 +/- 1.7 and 7.51 +/- 7.0 mg/l in cortical and cancellous bone, respectively (12.35% and 48.6% of intraoperative plasma concentrations), and the mean +/- sd teicoplanin tissue auc(24) values were 34.08 +/- 23.6 h . mg/l and 155.17 +/- 132.8 h . mg/l for cortical bone and cancellous bone, respectively. the mean vancomycin auc(24)/mic ratios were 215.02 for plasma, 47.14 for cortical bone and 268.95 for cancellous bone. the mean teicoplanin auc(24)/mic ratios were 336.48, 36.27 and 197.21 for plasma, cortical bone and cancellous bone, respectively. conclusions: bone penetration of both glycopeptides ranged from poor (<15%) to satisfactory (15-30%) in the cortical compartment, while it was far higher into the highly vascularized cancellous tissue. vancomycin bone penetration was slightly higher than with teicoplanin, but the difference was not statistically significant. higher bone concentrations  were observed with higher inflammatory markers, possibly as a result of increased vascularization and vascular permeability under inflammatory conditions. bone concentrations over the mic and auc/mic ratios suggested that both glycopeptides  achieve a satisfactory pharmacokinetic exposure in the cancellous bone, as far as gram-positive pathogens are concerned. on the other hand, cortical bone exposure  was suboptimal in most patients. furthermore, as antimicrobial penetration may be affected by impaired blood supply, the role of radical surgical removal of purulent and necrotic tissues appears to be essential in order to shorten treatment duration and to reduce the risk of treatment failure.

AB  == background: breast milk is an important source of staphylococci and other bacterial groups to the infant gut. the objective of this work was to analyse the bacterial diversity in feces of breast-fed infants and to compare it with that of formula-fed ones. a total of 23 women and their respective infants (16 breast-fed and 7 formula-fed) participated in the study. the 16 women and their infants provided a sample of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 7, 14, and 35.  the samples were plated onto different culture media. staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates were submitted to genetic profiling and to a characterization scheme, including detection of potential virulence traits and sensitivity to antibiotics. results: the feeding practice had a significant effect on bacterial counts. a total of 1,210 isolates (489 from milk, 531 from breast-fed and 190 from formula-fed infants) were identified. staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant species in milk and feces of breast-fed infants while it was less prevalent in those of formula fed-infants. enterococcus faecalis was the second predominant bacterial species among the fecal samples provided by the breast-fed infants but it was also present in all the samples from the formula-fed ones. the biofilm-related icad gene and the meca gene were only detected in a low number of the s. epidermidis strains. several enterococcal isolates were also characterized and none of them contained the cyla or the vanabdeg antibiotic-resistance genes. all were sensitive to vancomycin. conclusion: the presence of s. epidermidis is a differential trait of the fecal microbiota of breast-fed infants. globally, the staphyloccal isolates obtained from milk and feces of breast-fed infants contain a low number of virulence determinants and are sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested.

TI  == surface antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of incorporated polyethylenimine nanoparticles.
AB  == the antimicrobial effect and biocompatibility of insoluble cross-linked quaternary ammonium polyethylenimine (pei) nanoparticles incorporated at 1 or 2%w/w in a resin composite were assayed. the antimicrobial effect against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli was tested using the direct contact test (dct), agar diffusion test (adt) and scanning electron microscopy (sem). biocompatibility was tested by assessing macrophage viability, and tnfalpha secretion. samples incorporating 2%w/w nanoparticles inhibited the growth of all  bacterial strains tested. reducing the amount of the added nanoparticles to 1%w/w resulted in complete inhibition of s. aureus and e. faecalis, and decreased growth of s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa and e. coli (p<0.0001). the dct results were confirmed by sem. however, adt showed no inhibition halo in all test bacteria, indicating the antimicrobial nanoparticles are not diffusing into the agar milieu. biocompatibility tests revealed macrophage viability, and tnfalpha secretion was not altered by the presence of the nanoparticles in the resin. incorporation of pei nanoparticles in a resin composite had a long lasing antimicrobial effect against a wide range of bacteria with no measured effect on  biocompatibility.

TI  == ceftobiprole: a review of a broad-spectrum and anti-mrsa cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase iii clinical development. ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and meticillin-resistant s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, gram-negative bacilli including ampc-producing escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. in single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for ampc beta-lactamases.ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30  minutes. peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/ml for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/ml for  a 750-mg dose. the volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 l/kg ( approximately 18 l), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in  the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (pae) of approximately 0.5 hours for mrsa and a longer pae of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f t(>mic) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole mic < or =4 and < or =2 mg/l, respectively.currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. in a phase iii trial, 784 patients with gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for mrsa infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared  with 90% for vancomycin. a phase iii, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. no difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. microbiologic eradication of gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) [ceftobiprole 91% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and mrsa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as gram-negative bacilli, e. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and p. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl)-positive mssa and pvl-positive mrsa.currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase iii trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to mrsa and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven mrsa; phase iii trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety  profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. the broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole  and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == oral levofloxacin 500 mg once daily in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to confirm further the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (cbp) in europe. men  with a history of cbp were enrolled in a prospective, multinational (eight countries), open-label study to receive levofloxacin 500 mg once daily per os (p.o.) for 28 days. patients were followed for 6 months. a total of 117 patients  were treated. gram-negative bacteria were identified in 57/106 patients (mainly escherichia coli (n=37)) and gram-positive bacteria in 60/106 patients (mainly enterococcus faecalis (n=18) and staphylococcus epidermidis (n=14)). among the intention-to-treat population (n=116), the clinical success rate (cured and improved patients) was 92% (95% confidence interval (ci) 84.8-96.5%), 77.4% (95%  ci 68.2-84.9%), 66.0% (95% ci 56.2-75.0%) and 61.9% (95% ci 51.9-71.2%) at 5-12 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post treatment. the microbiological eradication rate according to evaluation scheme ii was 82/98 (83.7%, 95% ci 74.8-90.4%) at 1 month and the continued eradication rate was 52/57 (91.2%, 95% ci 80.7-97.1%) at 6 months post treatment. comparison of four classification schemes showed similar results. thus, the present investigation is suitably comparable in methods and results to previous studies. levofloxacin was well tolerated. four patients (3.4%) discontinued therapy due to adverse events and 15 patients (12.8%) experienced at least one adverse event. levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. once daily for 28 days is clinically and microbiologically effective in the treatment of cbp caused by susceptible pathogens and is well tolerated.

TI  == frequencies of resistance to melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil and rifampicin in staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == this study was conducted to determine the frequencies at which single-step mutants resistant to tea tree oil and rifampicin occurred amongst the gram-positive organisms staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. for tea tree oil, resistance frequencies were very low at  <10(-9). single-step mutants resistant to tea tree oil were undetectable at two times the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for s. aureus rn4220 and derivative mutator strains or at 3 x mic for the remaining s. aureus strains, including a clinical meticillin-resistant s. aureus isolate. similarly, no mutants were recovered at 2x mic for s. epidermidis or at 1x mic for e. faecalis. resistance frequencies determined in vitro for rifampicin (8 x mic) ranged from 10(-7) to 10(-8) for all isolates, with the exception of the s. aureus mutator strains, which had slightly higher frequencies. these data suggest that gram-positive organisms such as staphylococcus and enterococcus spp. have very low frequencies of resistance to tea tree oil.

AB  == our research group is interested in the study of different technological approaches to treat hospital biofilm as a means to constrain nosocomial-acquired  infections. the present work investigated the effect of the incorporation of the  antibacterial agent triclosan (ts) into polymeric micelles of poloxamine t1107 (mw=15 kda, 70 wt% peo). the aggregation phenomenon was primarily investigated by means of critical micellar concentration in a broad range of ph. then, the effect of the polymer concentration on the micellar size was evaluated by dynamic light  scattering. solubility levels increased up to 4 orders of magnitude. the drug inclusion affected the micellization, resulting in size increase and micellar fusion. this phenomenon was only apparent in ts-saturated systems. ts-loaded aggregates proved to be active in vitro against a broad spectrum of bacteria but  more importantly, also against two representative clinical pathogens: methicilin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vref). while the former was sensitive to even very low ts  levels attainable in poloxamine-free aqueous media, the later was inhibited only  when exposed to higher drug levels affordable exclusively using an inclusion system. these findings indicated the release of the drug from the reservoir. finally, the activity of a ts-containing 5% poloxamine combination of ph 7.4 was  assessed on biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis. results showed a significant  decrease (p<0.001) in the number of colony-formation units when the biofilm was exposed to the ts/poloxamine as compared to the limited activity of the polymer-free ts control.

TI  == the infected breast prosthesis after mastectomy reconstruction: successful salvage of nine implants in eight consecutive patients.
AB  == background: the use of tissue expanders and permanent implants has an established role in breast reconstruction after mastectomy. periprosthetic infection, however, represents a known complication. the most conservative approach to severe or recalcitrant prosthetic infection remains removal of the device. however, removal makes subsequent reinsertion and reexpansion more difficult, with less predictable cosmetic results. the authors believe that timely surgical  intervention directed toward salvage of infected breast prostheses can be successful, without demonstrating increased capsular contracture. methods: the authors present nine consecutive cases of infected breast implants (nine implants in eight patients). all patients had previously undergone mastectomy for malignancy and immediate expander/implant reconstruction. six patients had localized infections that failed to respond to oral antibiotics and two women initially presented with systemic infection. all patients were placed on intravenous antibiotics followed by drainage of fluid, manual debridement and curettage of the infected pocket, device exchange, and postoperative antibiotics. results: all nine infected breast prostheses responded to this approach and currently remain intact and without recurrent infection. mean time to follow-up for all patients was 14.6 months (range, 10 to 25 months). conclusions: in patients with severely infected breast prostheses, timely operative intervention  can salvage the previously "unsalvageable" implant; in addition, the surgically replaced implants did not develop severe capsular contractures. surgical salvage  of severely infected breast prostheses after mastectomy is a treatment option that should be considered when dealing with severe or recalcitrant infection in a suitable patient.

AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == high-throughput synthesis and screening of cyclic peptide antibiotics.
AB  == cyclic peptides are a rich source of biologically active compounds and are produced in nature by plants, bacteria, fungi, and lower sea animals. a high-throughput methodology has been developed for the combinatorial synthesis, screening, and identification of cyclic peptide natural product analogues with improved biological activities or useful new activities. the methodology was applied to generate a library of 1716 tyrocidine a analogues, which were screened for antibacterial activity in 96-well plates. the identity of the active peptides was determined by partial edman degradation/mass spectrometry. this has resulted  in the discovery of a series of tyrocidine analogues that have significantly improved therapeutic indices compared to the natural product. the availability of tyrocidine analogues with varying antibacterial activities has provided important insights into the structure-function relationship of tyrocidine a, which should help reveal its mechanism of action.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == reversal of resistance in microorganisms by help of non-antibiotics.
AB  == intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. however, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (dpr), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (adpr) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on mdr staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the dpr l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines nnc 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and nnc 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity  relationship. these compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. this may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally  prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. the results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic dpr and adpr, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic dpr and adpr of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.

TI  == bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  == the most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. the most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. three bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. other prevalent bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis and  enterococcus faecalis, while acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all intensive care unit (icu) isolates. 7% of s. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. although e. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. all the gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=4 microg/ml. almost 10% of escherichia coli, 14% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of serratia marcescens and 50% of enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. amikacin was the most active antibiotic against p. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. finally, acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). the results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital  setting in italy.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenoids from hairy roots of salvia sclarea l.: salvipisone as a potential anti-biofilm agent active against antibiotic resistant staphylococci.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of crude dichloromethane fractions from acetone extracts of agrobacterium rhizogenes transformed roots and roots of field-grown plants of salvia sclarea as well as four pure abietane diterpenoids isolated from the hairy root cultures were determined. the growth of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis) but not gram-negative ones (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) or pathogenic fungi (candida albicans) was inhibited by fractions tested at concentrations of 37.5-75.0 microgml(-1). abietane diterpenoids: salvipisone, aethiopinone, 1-oxoaethiopinone and ferruginol were shown to be bacteriostatic as well as bacteriocidal for the cultures of s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains, regardless of their antibiotic susceptibility profile. this was demonstrated by using simultaneously the optical density measuring method and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-reduction assay. the highest activity was shown by salvipisone which demonstrated also a very interesting activity when its effect on 24-h-old staphylococcal biofilm cells viability was examined. it limited the survival of biofilms formed by s. aureus as well as by s. epidermidis, putting this compound to the list of potential anti-biofilm agents, better than most of known antibiotics.

TI  == biofilm formation on hydrophilic intraocular lens material.
AB  == purpose: to estimate bacterial biofilm formation on the hydrophilic acrylic (hydrogel) intraocular lens (iol) meridian (hp60m, baush & lomb) and to investigate a preventive effect against biofilm formation of hydrogel iols presoaked in antibiotics. methods: two staphylococcus epidermidis strains, atcc 12228 and atcc 35984 (biofilm-producer), and an enterococcus faecalis strain (kos1, clinical isolate from an endophthalmitis patient) were used. biofilms were cultivated on disks of different iol materials: hydrogel, pmma (polymethylmethacrylate), and acrylic. biofilms were stained with crystal violet  (cv), which served as an index of biofilm formation. the bacterial population was enumerated after biofilm homogenization. biofilms were also examined by scanning  electron microscopy (sem). iols were presoaked in two antibiotics, levofloxacin (lvfx) and gatifloxacin (gflx), and then the bacterial population was enumerated. as in vivo experiment, antibiotics-treated and nontreated meridian iols were implanted in rabbit eyes, which served as an endophthalmitis model, and the bacterial population was enumerated. results: the amount of biofilm formed was the least on hydrogel from among the three materials tested after 48- and 72-hr incubation (p < 0.05 to 0.01). the bacterial population was the least on hydrogel from among the three materials with atcc 12228 (p < 0.05 to 0.01), and the bacterial population was significantly different between hydrogel and acrylic after 72-hr incubation with atcc 35984 (p < 0.05). biofilm by the two s. epidermidis strains were recognized after 24-hr incubation. rates of biofilm-positive sem fields, which were defined as being occupied by biofilm over at least half of the area, were increased through 72 hr with atcc 35984. while the e. faecalis strain showed no bacterial adherence on the antibiotics-treated hydrogel iols, adherence of the s. epidermidis strain, atcc 35984 was recognized  on the lvfx-treated iols after 48-hr incubation (103 to 104 cfu/ml). in the rabbit in vivo model, the bacterial populations in eyes with an antibiotics-treated meridian iol were significantly smaller than in eyes with a nontreated iol for 72 hr after surgery (p < 0.05 to 0.01). conclusions: the biofilm formation was less on hydrogel than on other two materials tested. hydrogel presoaked in antibiotics exhibited a preventive effect against biofilm formation at least for 24 hr in vitro and against bacterial proliferation in the  rabbit in vivo endophthalmitis model.

TI  == automated detection and quantitation of bacterial rna by using electrical microarrays.
AB  == low-density electrical 16s rrna specific oligonucleotide microarrays and an automated analysis system have been developed for the identification and quantitation of pathogens. the pathogens are escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis, which are typically involved in urinary tract infections. interdigitated gold array electrodes (ida-electrodes), which have structures in the nanometer range, have been used for very sensitive analysis. thiol-modified oligonucleotides are immobilized on the gold ida as capture probes. they mediate  the specific recognition of the target 16s rrna by hybridization. additionally three unlabeled oligonucleotides are hybridized in close proximity to the capturing site. they are supporting molecules, because they improve the rna hybridization at the capturing site. a biotin labeled detector oligonucleotide is also allowed to hybridize to the captured rna sequence. the biotin labels enable  the binding of avidin alkaline phophatase conjugates. the phosphatase liberates the electrochemical mediator p-aminophenol from its electrically inactive phosphate derivative. the electrical signals were generated by amperometric redox cycling and detected by a unique multipotentiostat. the read out signals of the microarray are position specific current and change over time in proportion to the analyte concentration. if two additional biotins are introduced into the affinity binding complex via the supporting oligonucleotides, the sensitivity of  the assays increase more than 60%. the limit of detection of escherichia coli total rna has been determined to be 0.5 ng/microl. the control of fluidics for variable assay formats as well as the multichannel electrical read out and data handling have all been fully automated. the fast and easy procedure does not require any amplification of the targeted nucleic acids by pcr.

AB  == we suggest a method for the reproducible and efficient capillary isoelectric focusing of proteins and microorganisms in the ph gradient 3-10. the method involves the segmental injection of the simple ampholytes, the solution of the selected electrolytes, and the sample mixture of bioanalytes and carrier ampholytes to the fused silica capillaries dynamically modified by poly(ethylene  glycol), peg 4000, which is added to the catholyte, the anolyte and injected solutions. in order to receive the reproducible results, the capillaries were rinsed by the mixture of acetone/ethanol between analyses. for the tracing of the ph gradients the low-molecular-mass pi markers were used. the simple proteins and the mixed cultures of microorganisms, saccharomyces cerevisiae ccm 8191, escherichia coli ccm 3954, candida albicans ccm 8180, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae ccm 6187, enterococcus faecalis ccm 4224, staphylococcus epidermidis ccm 4418 and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were focused and separated by the method suggested. the minimum detectable number of microbial cells was 5x10(2) to 1x10(3) with on-column uv detection at 280 nm.

TI  == antimicrobial and toxicological profile of the new biocide akacid plus.
AB  == objectives: akacid plus is a new member of the polymeric guanidine family of disinfectants. it was especially developed to enhance the antimicrobial activity  of this class with significantly less toxicity. the in vitro activity of akacid plus compared with chlorhexidine digluconate and mupirocin was tested against a total of 369 recent clinical isolates. methods: the organisms tested by clsi reference methods included the following: staphylococcus aureus (98), staphylococcus epidermidis (9), bacillus spp. (2), enterococcus faecalis (32), klebsiella spp. (45), enterobacter spp. (20), escherichia coli (65), salmonella spp. (6), shigella spp. (2), yersinia enterocolitica (1), acinetobacter spp. (4), proteus spp. (7), pseudomonas aeruginosa (59), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4),  candida spp. (10) and aspergillus spp. (7). in vitro selection of resistance to akacid plus was carried out on 24 strains. toxicological analyses were also performed. results: all tested agents were more effective against staphylococcus  spp. and bacillus spp. than against e. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria. the mic90s of chlorhexidine and mupirocin showed a 4-fold and 32-fold increase for methicillin-resistant s. aureus in comparison with methicillin-susceptible strains, while mic values of akacid plus were similar for antibiotic-susceptible  and multiresistant strains. bactericidal action of akacid plus was observed at 1-2x mic. the in vitro selection of resistance test showed no increase in mic values of akacid plus for any isolate after 30 passages. in addition, akacid plus showed low oral and dermal toxicity. conclusions: these preliminary results demonstrate the broad antimicrobial properties of akacid plus, which makes it a promising tool for topical application in the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.

TI  == antibiofilm activity of glmu enzyme inhibitors against catheter-associated uropathogens.
AB  == the colonization of uropathogenic bacteria on urinary catheters resulting in biofilm formation frequently leads to the infection of surrounding tissue and often requires removal of the catheter. infections associated with biofilms are difficult to treat since they may be more than 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. we have developed an antibiofilm  composition comprising an n-acetyl-d-glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase (glmu) inhibitor and protamine sulfate, a cationic polypeptide. the antibiofilm activity of glmu inhibitors, such as iodoacetamide (ida), n-ethyl maleimide (nem), and nem analogs, including n-phenyl maleimide, n,n'-(1,2-phenylene)dimaleimide (opdm), and n-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (pyrm), was tested against that of catheter-associated uropathogens. both ida and nem inhibited biofilm formation in escherichia coli. all nem analogs showed antibiofilm activity against clinical isolates of e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis. the combination of opdm with protamine sulfate (ps) enhanced its antibiofilm activity and reduced its effective concentration to as low as 12.5 microm. in addition, we found that the in vitro inhibitory activity of opdm-plus-ps-coated silicone catheters against p. aeruginosa and s. epidermidis colonization was superior to that of catheters coated with silver hydrogel. confocal scanning laser microscopy further confirmed that the opdm-plus-ps-coated silicone catheters were almost free from bacterial colonization. thus, a broad-spectrum antibiofilm composition comprising a glmu inhibitor and protamine  sulfate shows promise for use in anti-infective coatings for medical devices, including urinary catheters.

TI  == promotion of opsonization by antibodies and phagocytosis of gram-positive bacteria by a bifunctional polyacrylamide.
AB  == this paper describes the application of a bifunctional polyacrylamide (pa-v-f) presenting both vancomycin and fluorescein groups, to modify the surfaces of multiple species of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) to control molecular recognition of these surfaces. the vancomycin groups allowed the specific recognition of a structural component of the bacterial cell wall: peptides terminated in d-ala-d-ala. the fluorescein groups allowed the imaging of binding of polymer to the surfaces of bacteria by fluorescence, and are representative, low molecular weight haptens; their recognition by anti-fluorescein antibodies provides proof-of-principle that bifunctional polymers can be used to introduce haptens onto the surface of the bacteria. flow  cytometry revealed that polymer-labeled s. aureus and s. pneumoniae were opsonized by anti-fluorescein antibodies approximately 20-fold more than were untreated bacteria; nearly all ( approximately 92%) polymer-labeled s. aureus, and a large (76%) fraction of polymer-labeled s. pneumoniae were opsonized. the bound antibodies then promoted phagocytosis of the bacteria by cultured j774 macrophage-like cells. flow cytometry revealed that macrophages ingested s. aureus decorated with the polymer-antibody complexes approximately 2-fold more efficiently than s. aureus in control groups, in spite of the high background (caused by efficient antibody-independent ingestion of s. aureus by macrophages). this paper, thus, demonstrates the ability of a bifunctional polymer to carry out three distinct functions based on polyvalent molecular recognition: (i) recognition of the surface of gram-positive bacteria, (ii) modification of this surface to generate specific binding sites recognized by an antibody, and (iii) promotion of phagocytosis of the opsonized bacteria.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid against key gram-positive organisms isolated in the united states: results of the leader 2004 surveillance program.
AB  == since the approval of linezolid in 2000, sporadic reports of resistance have been given and a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has  been gained. however, since these developments, an updated status of the in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive organisms from the united states has  not been reported. the leader 2004 surveillance initiative was undertaken to obtain current and representative data on the activity of linezolid against key species, including isolates with significant resistance phenotypes. organisms were isolated during 2004 and included 2,872 staphylococcus aureus, 496 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns), 428 enterococcus faecalis, 196 enterococcus faecium, and 422 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. all s. aureus isolates (54.2% oxacillin resistant) were susceptible to linezolid (mic90 = 2 microg/ml); mic distributions were consistent, regardless of oxacillin or multidrug resistance status. for cns, one nonsusceptible isolate was encountered  (staphylococcus epidermidis; mic = 32 microg/ml), but overall, the mic(90) (1 microg/ml) was lower than that obtained with s. aureus. for e. faecalis and e. faecium, 99.5% and 96.4% of isolates, respectively, were linezolid susceptible. both species had an mic90 of 2 microg/ml, and mic distributions did not vary with the vancomycin susceptibility status of the populations analyzed. linezolid nonsusceptibility was not encountered among the s. pneumoniae isolates. these findings indicate that linezolid nonsusceptibility has remained rare among staphylococci and uncommon and sporadic among enterococci. nonetheless, careful and ongoing monitoring of the in vitro effectiveness of linezolid will be needed  so that any changes to the current status may be detected as soon as possible.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. all laboratories  engaged in this study received 3 strains: s. aureus (s. aureus sc+ cf+, resistant to methicillin., or s. aureus sc - cf+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (s. epidermidis or s. haemolyticus or s. saprophyticus) and enterococcus sp. (e. faecalis hlar-positive or e. faecalis hlar-negative or e. faecium or e. gallinarum). all these strains previously were  identified in department of bacteriology of national institute of hygiene. of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by e. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). the determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the nccls and national recommendations. some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.

AB  == bloodstream infection (bsi) is a significant problem after cord blood transplantation (cbt). however, little information has been reported on bsi after reduced-intensity cbt (ri-cbt). we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 102 patients. the median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 17-79 years). preparative regimens comprised fludarabine 125 to 150 mg/m 2 , melphalan  80 to 140 mg/m 2 , or busulfan 8 mg/kg and total body irradiation 2 to 8 gy. prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease comprised cyclosporin or tacrolimus. bsi developed within 100 days of ri-cbt in 32 patients. the cumulative incidence of bsi was 25% at day 30 and 32% at day 100. the median onset was day 15 (range, 1-98 days). causative organisms included pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 11), staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), enterococcus faecium (n = 4), enterococcus faecalis (n = 4), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 4), and others (n = 7). of the 32 patients with bsi, 25 (84%) died within 100 days after ri-cbt. bsi was the direct cause of death in 8 patients (25%). univariate analysis failed to identify any significant risk factors. bsi clearly represents a significant and fatal complication after ri-cbt. further studies are warranted to determine clinical characteristics, identify patients at high risk of bsi, and establish therapeutic strategies.

TI  == bacterial contamination of test stimulation leads during percutaneous nerve stimulation.
AB  == objectives: to analyze the bacterial contamination of conventional percutaneous nerve stimulation (pne) leads. sacral neuromodulation has become an important tool for the treatment of urgency and chronic retention. patients likely to benefit from this type of therapy are identified by pne testing before implantation of the definitive system. recently, a new system was introduced, using a self-blocking electrode that remains in place for both pne testing and final implantation. pne testing warrants an extracorporeal stimulator. thus, using the same electrode for both external stimulation and definitive implantation may carry a significant risk of infection. methods: bilateral pne testing was performed in 11 consecutive patients (8 women and 3 men, mean age 41.6 years) for either urgency (n = 7) or chronic retention (n = 4). electrodes were placed under aseptic conditions and stimulated for 3 days. at the end of each test, the electrodes were removed and evaluated microbiologically. results:  in 5 of the 11 patients (9 of 22 leads), significant bacterial growth was detected: staphylococcus epidermidis in 5, escherichia coli in 3, and enterococcus faecalis in 1. however, no patient showed signs of inflammation at the electrode insertion sites. conclusions: bacterial growth was found in 45.5% of the patients after conventional pne testing under aseptic conditions. therefore, the new electrodes may well carry an elevated risk of infection. infection of the implant can lead to major surgical revision or even explantation. thus, additional studies of the infection risk of this new electrode are warranted before its general use can be recommended.

TI  == chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different anatolian propolis samples.
AB  == propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. it is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. the aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from four different anatolian propolis samples and examined whether eep inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mic) were determined by using macrodilution method. the mic values of the most effective propolis (tb) were 2 microg/ml for streptococcus sobrinus and enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and c. krusei, 8 microg/ml for streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for escherichia coli and c. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the chemical compositions of eep's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. the main compounds of four anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. although propolis samples were collected from different regions of anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the gram positive bacteria and yeasts. propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and c. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.

TI  == local delivery of vancomycin for the prophylaxis of prosthetic device-related infections.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics of vancomycin delivered from glycerylmonostearate (gms) implants in a prosthetic-device based biofilm infection model. methods: a biofilm infection model was developed in male sprague-dawley rats by implanting a vascular graft on the dorsal side of each rat and infecting it with 1.5 x 10(8) cfu/ml staphylococcus epidermidis. the rats were divided into 3 groups of 6 rats each: 1) the control group that received no  antibiotics, 2) the im group that received multiple im injections of vancomycin at a dose of 25 mg/kg every 6 h for a total of 12 doses, and 3) the implant group that received gms implants designed to deliver vancomycin at a total dose of 300  mg/kg for a period of 4 days. the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin was determined from im and implant groups by analyzing for vancomycin in blood using hplc. in vivo efficacy was studied by evaluation of the wound site and the prosthetic device upon excision, for evidence of infection in the form of purulent discharge at the wound site and yellowish discoloration of the prosthetic device and inflammation as sign of biofilm formation. microbiological evaluation on the wound site and the prosthetic device was performed by culturing the swabs at the  wound site and the prosthetic device in sterile tryptic soy broth for 36-48 h at  37 degrees c. results: vancomycin was successfully delivered in a sustained manner for 100 h from gms implants and the resulting plasma profile showed that the concentrations, after an initial burst, plateaued at about of 4.77 +/- 1.43 mug/ml with less fluctuations than the im group in which the plasma concentrations fluctuated between 2.73 +/- 0.94 mug/ml and 19.26 +/- 3.67 mug/ml. upon excision of the wound site, all the animals in the control group developed infection in the form of purulent discharge and yellowish discoloration of the prosthetic device. however, none of the rats in the implant group showed evidence of infection clearly demonstrating the efficacy of the local delivery system in preventing infection. systemically delivered vancomycin by im injections failed to prevent infection in four out of six rats. microbiological evaluation of the wound site and prosthetic device resulted in isolation of biofilm-producing organisms such as staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. these organisms were isolated in greater number of animals in the control group compared to the im and implant groups. conclusions: the gms  implants as a delivery system for vancomycin were successful in preventing infection in all the animals compared to the im and control groups demonstrating  the efficacy of a local delivery system in a prosthetic device related biofilm infection model.

TI  == survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  == in 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  we assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints recommended by the national committee  for clinical standards (nccls). methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most common gram-positive species was enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (bls), fluoroquinolones (fqs), and tetracyclines (tcs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. the proportion of fq-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). all the esbl-producing strains (esbls) possess resistance to fqs. over 95% of klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. the distribution of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and  an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among proteus species. no esbl-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from serratia marcescens. this survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of esbl-producing or fqs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of antibiotic release from and bacteria growth inhibition by  antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement spacers.
AB  == the antibiotic release from and the bacteria growth inhibition by antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement hip spacers were studied. the cement used was palacos r, and it was loaded with either one antibiotic powder (gentamicin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, or synercid) [monoantibiotic case] or two antibiotic powders (gentamicin + vancomycin or gentamicin + teicoplanin) [biantibiotic case] and then tested against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). antibiotic elution and bacteria growth were measured every 24 h simultaneously by fluorescence polarization immunoassay and photometrically, respectively. the gentamicin + vancomycin combination achieved the longest growth inhibition on s.  epidermidis and mrsa (mean of 20 and 14 days, respectively). gentamicin + teicoplanin-loaded spacers were capable of inhibiting growth on e. faecalis and s. aureus for the longest period (11 and 16 days, respectively). the highest concentrations of gentamicin and vancomycin could be assayed during the first 4 days. teicoplanin concentrations could be detected only during the first 72 h, synercid was not detected at all, possibly because of the limitation of the detection technique used. a greater percentage of the gentamicin was released than of the vancomycin. the aminoglycosid-glycopeptid combination showed a synergistic effect on the release of gentamicin, but not on vancomycin or teicoplanin. biantibiotic-impregnated hip spacers proved to be superior to monoantibiotic ones. because of important differences between the conditions used for the present tests and the in vivo environment, any recommendation with regard to the use of monoantibiotic- and biantibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement spacers must await the results of further investigations.

TI  == in vitro exposure of bacteria to antimicrobial impregnated-central venous catheters does not directly lead to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == objective: use of central venous catheters (cvcs) impregnated with minocycline and rifampin reduces the density of bacterial growth on catheters and decreases the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections. questions have been raised over the possibility that the use of these catheters will lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. in this study, we sought to determine if in vitro exposure of four test organisms to catheter segments impregnated with minocycline and rifampin would lead to the development of antibiotic resistance. methods: catheter segments (1.0 cm) were placed on the surface of agar plates previously inoculated with bacterial suspensions, such that a subconfluent lawn of colony growth would be apparent after 24 h incubation at 35 degrees c in air. test organisms included american type culture collection  strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. zones of inhibition of colony growth surrounding catheters were measured at 24-h intervals up to 7 days  (two catheter segments per test). colonies on agar surfaces located at varying distances from catheter segments were examined for minocycline and rifampin resistance following various periods of exposure (six catheter segments per test). in addition, selected colonies were subsequently exposed to minocycline and rifampin in broth and examined for selection of minocycline and rifampin resistance (> 28 colonies per selection test). results: inhibitory zones of 14 to 47 mm were observed with s aureus, s epidermidis, e faecalis, and e coli. growth  of p aeruginosa was not inhibited by cvc segments. testing of colonies of the first four organisms at various distances from cvc segments after varying periods of exposure revealed only a single instance of the emergence of resistance (eg, s aureus vs rifampin). recovery of resistant clones was enhanced with minocycline and rifampin broth selection; however, a direct link between cvc exposure and the emergence of resistance was not established. conclusions: our in vitro data suggest that the exposure of gram-positive cocci to either rifampin or minocycline can lead to the development of resistance. however, exposure of bacteria to these antibiotics in combination does not directly lead to resistance. clinical investigations will be required to determine the true risk and implications of the development of resistance.

TI  == [prevalence of aa(6')-aph(2")ia gene among high-level aminoglycoside resistant enterococci and staphylococci].
AB  == according to new reports the aac (6')-aph (2")ia gene is no longer the only gene  encoding resistance to gentamycin in gram-positive cocci and therefore the current method for predicting synergism aminoglycosides with bacterial cell wall  active agents in this bacteria may need revision. to further our knowledge of aminoglycoside resistance mechanism in gram-positive cocci in gdansk region we tested presence of aac (6')-aph (2")ia gene among 22 enterococcal (e. faecalis) and 41 staphylococcal (s. haemolyticus, s. aureus, s. epidermidis) gentamycin-resistant isolates. presence of aac (6')-aph (2")ia gene varied from 50% (n = 6) in gentamycin-resistant s. epidermidis, 80% (n = 10) in gentamycin resistant s. haemolyticus 88% in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n = 25). in enterococcus faecalis this gene was noticed only in 59% (n =  22) of gentamycin-resistant isolates. these results suggest that spread of resistance gene among different species is limited and aac (6')-aph (2")ia mediated gentamycin-resistance mechanism is more common among mrsa and staphylococcus haemolyticus.

TI  == [composition of ame encoding gene in gram positive cocci--study on spread of aminoglycoside resistance].
AB  == aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (ames) are major factors which confer aminoglycoside resistance on bacteria. composition of six genes encoding ames (including lately described aph 2"-genes) was investigated by pcr for 16 clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis, 16 clinical isolates of coagulase-positive (s. aureus) and 13 clinical isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci (s. haemolyticus, s. epidermidis) collected in gdansk region (northern poland) in the years 1998-2001. diversity of ame encoding gene profiles (composition) was used to analyze spread of ame encoding gene among and within studied group of cocci. according to presence of particular genes we distinguish eleven different ame encoding gene profiles: seven profiles were unique for particular species while the most common was shared among s. aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and  enterococci. regarding profile frequency statistical analysis (fstat, amova, cluster analysis upgma) shows: the difference between s. aureus and enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci, lack of difference between enterococci and  coagulase-negative staphylococci, higher variability within than between studied  species and presence of multispecies cluster. on the basis of the reports about ability of staphylococci to synthesis enterococcal pheromones, this finding lets  assume that spread of aminoglycoside resistance gene among gram (+) cocci is limited only by the ability of stains to synthesis or induction of synthesis conjugation protein.

TI  == algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time lightcycler polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  == we developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including staphylococcus spp., s. epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of e. faecalis and e. faecium), streptococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, enterobacteriaceae, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter spp., bacteroides spp., haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. a total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific pcr algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the pcr results were compared to the culture results. apart from-cross reactions between e. coli and chryseomonas luteola and enterococcus faecium and e. durans, the pcr assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the pcr algorithm within a few hours. however, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. the pcr algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in  positive blood cultures.

TI  == [nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
AB  == the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this  drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria  were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis  and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of  glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities  of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we  conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

TI  == intestinal microflora in early infancy: composition and development.
AB  == the neonatal intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem composed of numerous genera, species and strains of bacteria. this enormous cell mass performs a variety of unique activities that affect both the colonic and systemic physiology. its primary activities include nutritive, metabolic, immunological and protective functions. most studies of infants have been based on faecal samples using the classical plating techniques with culturing on specific media.  the limitations of these methods must be taken into account when evaluating the varying results of the different studies. the establishment of the gut microbial  population is not strictly a succession in the ecological sense; it is rather a complex process influenced by microbial and host interactions and by external and internal factors. the climax intestinal flora is attained in successive stages. the foetal intestine is sterile and bathed in swallowed amniotic fluid. following delivery, multiple different antigens challenge the intestine of the newborn. the maternal intestinal flora is a source of bacteria for the neonatal gut. the bacterial flora is usually heterogeneous during the first few days of life, independently of feeding habits. after the first week of life, a stable bacterial flora is usually established. in full-term infants a diet of breast milk induces  the development of a flora rich in bifidobacterium spp. other obligate anaerobes, such as clostridium spp. and bacteroides spp., are more rarely isolated and also  enterobacteria and enterococci are relatively few. during the corresponding period, formula-fed babies are often colonized by other anaerobes in addition to  bifidobacteria and by facultatively anaerobic bacteria; the development of a "bifidus flora" is unusual. in other studies the presence of a consistent number  of bifidobacteria in infants delivered in large urban hospitals has not been demonstrated, whether the babies were bottle fed or exclusively breastfed. the predominant faecal bacteria were coliforms and bacteroides. according to these studies, environmental factors may be more important than breastfeeding in gut colonization after delivery. environmental factors are indeed extremely important for the intestinal colonization of infants born by caesarean section. in these infants, the establishment of a stable flora characterized by a low incidence of  bacteroides spp. and by the isolation of few other bacteria is consistently delayed. in extremely low-birthweight infants, hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units, characterized by prolonged antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, delayed oral feedings and intubation seems to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota. the gut is colonized by a small number of bacterial species; lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp. are seldom, if ever, identified. according to the few studies so far performed, the predominant species are enterococcus faecalis, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. hygienic conditions and antimicrobial procedures strongly influence the intestinal colonization pattern.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa),  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases  in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.

TI  == establishment of an arbitrary pcr for rapid identification of tn917 insertion sites in staphylococcus epidermidis: characterization of biofilm-negative and nonmucoid mutants.
AB  == transposon mutagenesis with the enterococcus faecalis transposon tn917 is a genetic approach frequently used to identify genes related with specific phenotypes in gram-positive bacteria. we established an arbitrary pcr for the rapid and easy identification of tn917 insertion sites in staphylococcus epidermidis with six independent, well-characterized biofilm-negative tn917 transposon mutants, which were clustered in the icaadbc gene locus or harbor tn917 in the regulatory gene rsbu. for all six of these mutants, short chromosomal dna fragments flanking both transposon ends could be amplified. all fragments were sufficient to correctly identify the tn917 insertion sites in the  published s. epidermidis genomes. by using this technique, the tn917 insertion sites of three not-yet-characterized biofilm-negative or nonmucoid mutants were identified. in the biofilm-negative and nonmucoid mutant m12, tn917 is inserted into a gene homologous to the regulatory gene purr of bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. the tn917 insertions of the nonmucoid but biofilm-positive mutants m16 and m20 are located in genes homologous to components of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) of b. subtilis, s. aureus, and staphylococcus carnosus, indicating an influence of the pts on the mucoid phenotype in s. epidermidis.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of urinary catheters impregnated with antiseptics in an in vitro urinary tract model.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and interference of tobramycin and chloramphenicol on bacterial adhesion to intraocular lenses.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of tobramycin and chloramphenicol were evaluated by  determining minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, group a, group b and group g streptococci, klebsiella spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ciprofloxacin-resistant and -susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa,  as well as by evaluating interference on adhesion of slime producer strains of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa to intraocular lens from tobramycin and chloramphenicol  pharmaceutical products by scanning electron microscopy. chloramphenicol was more active against gram-positive bacteria than was tobramycin, which instead showed higher activity against ciprofloxacin-susceptible p. aeruginosa. treatment of lenses with the antimicrobial products eradicated the bacterial biofilm, which was already notably reduced after 5 min. this activity was more pronounced for chloramphenicol against s. aureus and for tobramycin against p. aeruginosa. bacterial adhesion was also significantly reduced when lenses colonized by p. aeruginosa were treated with chloramphenicol, even if they were resistant to this drug. in conclusion, the tested drugs showed marked antibacterial activity, particularly by interfering with bacterial biofilms. the data obtained in this study suggest a specific use of chloramphenicol in topical prophylaxis aimed at avoiding bacterial contaminations. however, further specific in vivo studies are  needed to confirm these data.

TI  == multiplex pcr for simultaneous detection of enterococcal genes vana and vanb and  staphylococcal genes meca, iles-2 and femb.
AB  == the experimental transfer of the vana gene cluster from enterococcus faecalis to  staphylococcus aureus has raised fears about the occurrence of such genetic transfer in clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. recently, infections by a s. aureus strain carrying the enterococcal vancomycin resistance  vana gene cluster were reported. the possible emergence and dissemination of these strains is a serious health threat and makes optimization of prevention strategies and fast detection methods absolutely necessary. in the present study, we developed a pcr protocol for simultaneous detection of enterococcal vana and vanb genes, the staphylococcal methicillin and mupirocin resistance markers meca  and iles-2, and identification of s. aureus. as no vancomycin-resistant s. aureus isolates were available for our study, we used mixtures of enterococcal and staphylococcal colonies that harbored the different resistance markers to show that these genes could be detected simultaneously. this protocol could be used to facilitate the detection and identification of predictable s. aureus or methicillin-resistant strains carrying vana or vanb.

TI  == antimicrobial proficiency testing of national nosocomial infections surveillance  system hospital laboratories.
AB  == objective: the national nosocomial infections surveillance (nnis) system personnel report trends in antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. to validate select  antimicrobial susceptibility testing results and to identify test methods that tend to produce errors, we conducted proficiency testing among nnis system hospital laboratories. setting: nnis system hospital laboratories in the united states. methods: each laboratory received five organisms (ie, an imipenem-resistant serratia marcescens, an oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, a vancomycin-intermediate staphylococcus epidermidis, and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbetal)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae). testing results were compared with reference testing results from the centers for disease control and prevention. results: of 138 laboratories testing imipenem against the serratia marcescens strain, 110 (80%) correctly reported minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) or  zone sizes in the resistant range. all 193 participating laboratories correctly reported the staphylococcus aureus strain as oxacillin resistant of the 193 laboratories, 169 (88%) reported correct mics or zone sizes for the vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. one hundred sixty-two (84%) of 193 laboratories demonstrated the ability to detect a vancomycin-intermediate strain  of staphylococcus epidermidis, however, disk diffusion performed poorly when testing both staphylococci and enterococci with vancomycin. although laboratory personnel correctly reported nonsusceptible extended-spectrum cephalosporins and  aztreonam results for k. pneumoniae, only 98 (51%) of 193 correctly reported this organism as an esbetal producer. conclusion: overall, nnis system hospital laboratory personnel detected most emerging resistance patterns. disk diffusion continues to be unreliable for vancomycin testing of staphylococci and must be used cautiously for enterococci. further education on the processing of esbetal-producing organisms is warranted.

TI  == linezolid resistance since 2001: sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == background: the oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials has demonstrated remarkable activity against gram-positive cocci. linezolid has proven to be a first-line therapeutic option for vancomycin-resistant strains. linezolid clinical trial results and subsequent published case reports cite rare resistance emerging in patients receiving prolonged therapy. objective: to report the initial linezolid-resistant organisms from cases obtained through the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, after screening >40,000 gram-positive cocci without resistance between 1998 and 2000. methods: during 2001-2002, 8 resistant  strains (from 8 different patients) located in 6 states from 7 different participating sentry institutions in the us were identified among bloodstream, respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infection isolates of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus oralis. resistance was detected by reference broth microdilution methods and confirmed by identical results using etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and the standardized disk diffusion method. results: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and disk diffusion tests showed elevated mics (> or =8 microg/ml) and small inhibitory zone diameters (< or =15 mm) for all strains to both linezolid and the investigational oxazolidinone azd2563. vancomycin resistance was detected in 2 of the 8 linezolid-resistant strains. all enterococci and the viridans-group streptococcus (s. oralis) strain showed resistance to erythromycin. e. faecium strains were resistant to penicillins, but susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. only 3 of the patients had previously received the drug. conclusions: linezolid resistance remains rare, with only 8 isolates among 9833 (0.08%) monitored isolates identified between january 1, 2001, and june 30, 2002. resistance, however, was no longer limited to enterococci. clinical laboratories should test linezolid more widely to detect emerging resistance, especially for patients receiving oxazolidinone therapy. longitudinal surveillance programs are warranted to detect a trend in the development of resistance, determine the molecular mechanism of resistance, and recommend alternative therapies or epidemiologic interventions.

TI  == comparative studies on the activity of basil--an essential oil from ocimum basilicum l.--against multidrug resistant clinical isolates of the genera staphylococcus, enterococcus and pseudomonas by using different test methods.
AB  == the essential oil basil is obtained from the aerial parts of ocimum basilicum l.  after gas chromatographic separation, the following components were identified: linalol (54.95%), methylchavikol (11.98%), methylcinnamat (7.24%) and linolen (0.14%). the activity of basil against multidrug resistant clinical isolates from the genera staphylococcus, enterococcus and pseudomonas has been studied. for this purpose, standard and modified broth macrodilution methods were used and time kill kinetic of basil was studied. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were reported between 0.0030% and 0.0007% (v/v). these concentrations were compared with the inhibitory concentrations (ics) and the logs of the bacterial counts reduction both obtained by basil diluted in 1% tween (tw) 80, saline test  solution (sts) and spiritus vini (sv) 95 degrees instead in a broth. the data, obtained after application of different methods of investigation and validated with membrane filtration, showed a strong inhibitory effect of basil on the test  bacteria. the chosen bacteria are widespread and pose serious therapeutic difficulties because of their high level of resistance. for this reason, the results obtained were considered encouraging.

TI  == comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29  species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general,  displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.

TI  == epidural catheter colonization is not associated with infection.
AB  == background: epidural anesthesia is one of the most common types of regional anesthesia. although retrospective reviews suggest that the incidence of infection from short-term epidural catheter use is exceedingly low in patients undergoing surgery, the correlation between epidural catheter cultures and infection has not been well defined. the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial colonization of epidural catheters in adult patients undergoing surgery under epidural anesthesia, as well as the correlation between  epidural catheter cultures and infection. methods: a prospective nonrandomized study was conducted over a period of 28 months. the incidence of bacterial contamination after epidural catheterization and the correlation between epidural catheter cultures and infection was investigated for 245 adult asa i, ii patients undergoing surgery under lumbar epidural anesthesia. catheters were removed when  epidural analgesia was no longer required, or if clinical signs of infection or catheter malfunction were present. all epidural catheters were cultured upon withdrawal. results: epidural catheters were kept in place for 2.3 +/- 0.2 days (range 0.1-12 days). bacteriological analysis of the 245 epidural catheters yielded 28% positive cultures. the most prevalent microorganism was staphylococcus epidermidis (58%). in obstetric operations a frequency of 32% positive cultures was observed. neither central nervous system nor systemic infections occurred during the study. no correlations were found among the type of surgery, the type of antibiotic administration, the sex or age of the patients, the duration of catheter placement, the maximum body temperature, and the frequency of positive epidural catheter cultures. there was no correlation between epidural catheter colonization and infection. conclusion: the contamination of epidural catheters was found to be independent of the administered antimicrobial agents prior to surgery, the duration of catheter placement, and the presence of fever. except for perioperative prophylaxis, therapeutic use of antibiotics for short-term epidural catheters is not recommended.

TI  == development of broad-range polymerase chain reaction (pcr) bacterial identification in diagnosis of infective endocarditis.
AB  == background and aims of the study: the study aim was to identify the value of broad-range bacterial pcr in infective endocarditis (ie) of bacterial etiology, and to determine its specificity and sensitivity. methods: thirty blood samples were taken for analysis from patients with ie (diagnosed according to duke criteria) and acquired valvular heart disease. two control groups of patients with (n = 10) or without (n = 15) urinary tract infection were defined. dna was isolated, and three different primer pairs for the region of the gene coding for  16s rrna were tested, to determine the most specific pair. amplification products were analyzed with gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and located under uv light. results: positive blood cultures were found in 25 patients with ie. a typical echocardiography picture with bacterial vegetations was found in all patients with sterile blood cultures, and in 20 patients with positive blood cultures. the highest specificity was found for forward/reverse (f/r) primers, as the relevant amplified pcr product was present in all blood samples with ie, and in four of 10 patients with urinary tract infection. conclusion: broad-range pcr in bacterial endocarditis is a rapid, sensitive and inexpensive technique for the detection of bacteria, but is far more prone to contamination than species-specific pcr. however, under controlled conditions, broad-range pcr may be valuable for the identification of non-specific infection, permitting a more rapid clinical diagnosis of endocarditis.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == discovery of a novel and potent class of fabi-directed antibacterial agents.
AB  == bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein (acp) reductase (fabi) catalyzes the final step in each elongation cycle of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of new antibacterial agents. high-throughput screening of the staphylococcus aureus fabi enzyme identified a novel, weak inhibitor with no detectable antibacterial activity against s. aureus. iterative medicinal chemistry and x-ray crystal structure-based design led to the identification of compound 4 [(e)-n-methyl-n-(2-methyl-1h-indol-3-ylmethyl)-3-(7-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,8-na phthyridin-3-yl)acrylamide], which is 350-fold more potent than the original lead compound obtained by high-throughput screening in the fabi inhibition assay. compound 4 has exquisite antistaphylococci activity, achieving mics at which 90%  of isolates are inhibited more than 500 times lower than those of nine currently  available antibiotics against a panel of multidrug-resistant strains of s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. furthermore, compound 4 exhibits excellent in vivo efficacy in an s. aureus infection model in rats. biochemical and genetic approaches have confirmed that the mode of antibacterial action of compound 4 and related compounds is via inhibition of fabi. compound 4 also exhibits weak fabk inhibitory activity, which may explain its antibacterial activity against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, which depend on fabk and both fabk and fabi, respectively, for their enoyl-acp reductase function. these results show that compound 4 is representative of a new, totally synthetic series of antibacterial agents that has the potential to provide novel alternatives for  the treatment of s. aureus infections that are resistant to our present armory of antibiotics.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from  patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cutis) between 1988 and 2000. imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting gram-negative rods. resistant strains (mic>16 mg/l) were observed in staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), enterococcus faecalis (4%), enterococcus avium (8%), serratia marcescens (5%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over  the period. resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. these results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.

TI  == in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and cefepime, alone and in combination with various antimicrobials, against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  == use of combinations of antimicrobials that together achieve synergistic activities against targeted microorganisms is one potential strategy for overcoming bacterial resistance. as the incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci increases, the importance of devising additional synergistic drug combinations for these bacteria is magnified. we evaluated a number of antimicrobial combinations, with a focus on quinupristin-dalfopristin (q-d), cefepime, and linezolid, using a previously described in vitro pharmacodynamic model. the combination of q-d with either linezolid or vancomycin, as well as the combination of cefepime-vancomycin, resulted in enhanced killing (> or =2-log(10) increase in killing versus the most-active single agent) against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 494. an improved effect (<2 log(10) kill increase in kill) against mrsa 494 was noted for cefepime plus either q-d or linezolid, as well as linezolid-vancomycin. similar relationships were observed for a methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolate (isolate 1199). against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis r444, enhanced killing was achieved with the combination of cefepime-linezolid, while improvement was noted for vancomycin with either cefepime or linezolid. the combination of cefepime and vancomycin also achieved enhanced killing against a glycopeptide-intermediate-susceptible s. aureus isolate (isolate 992). the combination of linezolid and doxycycline achieved an enhanced effect against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vrefc) and e. faecium. q-d plus ampicillin or linezolid resulted in similar enhancement of activity against the vrefc isolate. the results of this study suggest a number of novel antimicrobial combinations that may be useful against staphylococci and enterococci. combination regimens including cefepime, q-d, and/or linezolid warrant further investigation for the treatment of refractive infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == remarkable substituent effects on antimicrobial activities of 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium salts.
AB  == in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of a series of 25 diazolidinium  salts, 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium (1), together with 1,3-dialkylpyrimidinium (2), were evaluated against standard strains: escherichia coli (atcc 25922), staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 12228), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), enterobacter cloacae (atcc 13047), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853) and candida albicans (atcc 10239). selective  and effective antibacterial activity against one gram-negative (p. aeruginosa) and two gram-positive (e. faecalis and s. aureus) bacteria were found in salts 1a, 1i and 1j, in contrast to modest to poor activity observed in the rest of the salts. the enhanced antibacterial activity is clearly linked to the introduction  of two bulky mesityl or mesitylbenzyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms of the imidazoline skeleton, while the side chain of the backbone of the molecule has no influence.

TI  == comparative activity of linezolid against staphylococci and enterococci isolated  in italy.
AB  == the activity of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, was tested against 862 gram-positive cocci isolated in italy and compared with the activities of 12 antibiotics. overall, mic90s for linezolid (2-4 mg/l) indicated an in vitro activity comparable to that of vancomycin in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (4 mg/l), s. epidermidis (2 mg/l) and methicillin-susceptible strains. enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to linezolid (mic90 2-4 mg/l), glycopeptides and beta-lactams. in e. faecium, only glycopeptides (mic90 2 mg/l)  and linezolid (mic90 2 mg/l) were active. linezolid was the only drug active against two strains of enterococcus showing a vana phenotype. owing to its antibacterial profile, linezolid represents a promising drug for the treatment of gram-positive infections.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.

TI  == identification and characterization of genes encoding sex pheromone cam373 activity in enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the sex pheromone cam373 of enterococcus faecalis and the related staph-cam373 of staphylococcus aureus were found to correspond to heptapeptides located within the c-termini of the signal sequences of putative prelipoproteins. the deduced mature forms of the lipoproteins share no detectable homology and presumably serve unrelated functions in the cells. the chromosomally encoded genetic determinants for production of the pheromones have been identified and designated came (encoding cam373) and cams (encoding staph-cam373). truncated and full-length clones of came were generated in escherichia coli, in which cam373 activity was expressed. in e. faecalis, insertional inactivation in the middle of came had no detectable phenotypic effects on the pheromone system. establishment  of an in frame translation stop codon within the signal sequence resulted in reduction of cam373 activity to 3% of normal levels. the cams determinant has homologues in staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis and listeria monocytogenes; however, corresponding heptapeptides present within those sequences do not resemble staph-cam373 closely. the particular significance of staph-cam373 as a potential intergeneric inducer of transfer-proficient genetic elements is discussed.

TI  == antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

TI  == evaluation of the vitek 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == a study was conducted to evaluate the new vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (n = 100), enterococcus spp. (n = 89), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the id-gpc identification card and with the ast-p515 (for staphylococci), ast-p516 (for enterococci and s. agalactiae) and ast-p506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. the identification comparison methods were the api staph for staphylococci and the api 20 strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) was used. the vitek 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of s. aureus, 96.5% of s. agalactiae, 96.9% of s. pneumoniae, 92.7% of enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). more than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. according to the nccls breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the vitek 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for s. aureus, from 90 to 100% for cns, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for s. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for s. pneumoniae. microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were cns-erythromycin, cns-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. major errors were observed for cns-oxacillin and s. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. in conclusion the results of this study indicate that the vitek 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial sensitivity for czop were  also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen  species (1,913 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 178), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse; n = 98), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse; n = 164), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), enterococcus faecium (n  = 91), enterococcus avium (n = 72), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp; n = 100), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 29), streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). czop possessed comparable antibacterial activities against mssa and msse to other cephems, and was also effective on mrse but not on mrsa. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. czop, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. an antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (cpr) and higher than other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, just like other drugs. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (ctm), cefepime (cfpm) and cpr, and that against s. agalactiae was also preferable. czop and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against s. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. an antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, ctm and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint mic of czop was 96.5% in mrsa, 93.1% in prsp, 60.0% in  pisp, 40.3% in s. haemolyticus, 22.3% in e. faecalis, and 15.9% in mrse. those resistance ratios were similar to those for cfpm, but e. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. in conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria was observed. the sensitivities of pisp and prsp to czop, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == [can we rely on the results of urine microscopy and culture when tests are performed in general practice?].
AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant  bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). a microbiological diagnosis can be made  by examination of a urine sample, and in danish family practice the diagnosis of  uti is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. these methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. the aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria  by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. material and methods: urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent  to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. no prior instruction in testing procedure was given. as the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the department of microbiology, university of southern denmark, were used. results: significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. the corresponding figures for urine  culture were 95% and 96%. the morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified  correctly in terms of their motility. discussion: the results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. amikacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance  to ss-lactam antibiotics. only 1% of the escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. this rate was higher for other enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for p. aeruginosa. the cross-resistance of oxacillin with other  antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. cross-resistance was only a minor problem in h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis. cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

TI  == antibacterial activity of leaf essential oils and their constituents from cinnamomum osmophloeum.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of the essential oils from leaves of two cinnamomum  osmophloeum clones (a and b) and their chemical constituents were investigated in this study. the nine strains of bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella sp., and vibrio parahemolyticus, were used in the antibacterial tests. results from the antibacterial tests demonstrated that the indigenous cinnamon b leaf essential oils had an excellent inhibitory effect. the mics (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of the b leaf oil were 500 microg/ml against both k. pneumoniae and salmonella sp. and 250 microg/ml against the other seven strains of bacteria. cinnamaldehyde possessed the strongest antibacterial activity compared to the other constituents of the essential oils. the mics of cinnamaldehyde against the e. coli, p. aeruginosa, e. faecalis, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, mrsa, k. pneumoniae, salmonella sp., and v. parahemolyticus were 500, 1000, 250, 250, 250, 250, 1000, 500, and 250 microg/ml, respectively. these  results suggest that c. osmophloeum leaf essential oil and cinnamaldehyde are beneficial to human health, having the potential to be used for medical purposes  and to be utilized as anti-bacterial additives in making paper products.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  == this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were  susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was  statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the  presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.

TI  == resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  == we studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. no spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for streptococcus pneumoniae). population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. stable s. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. the daptomycin mics for these isolates  were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. many mutants with high mics (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of s. aureus small colony variants. the voltage component (delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. in vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. for other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. these results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.

TI  == microbial analysis of bone collected during implant surgery: a clinical and laboratory study.
AB  == dental implant surgery produces bone debris which can be used to correct bone defects in the "simultaneous-augmentation" technique. however, this debris is potentially contaminated with oral bacteria. therefore, this study examined bone  debris collected during dental implant surgery in order 1) to identify the microbial contaminants and 2) to compare the effects of two different aspiration  protocols on the levels of microbial contamination. twenty-four partially dentate patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups and underwent bone collection using the frios bone collector during surgery to insert two endosseous dental implants. in group s (using a stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection occurred within the surgical site only. in group ns (utilizing a non-stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection and tissue fluid control was  achieved using the same suction tip. bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilized for identification of the isolated microbes. twenty-eight species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis as well as the anaerobes actinomyces odontolyticus, eubacterium sp., prevotella intermedia, propionibacterium propionicum and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. in group s (stringent aspiration protocol), significantly fewer organisms were found than in group ns, the non-stringent aspiration protocol (p=0.001). gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. it is concluded that if bone debris is collected for implantation around dental implants, it should be collected with a stringent aspiration protocol (within the surgical site only) to minimize bacterial contaminants.

TI  == determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  == there are many skin antiseptics commercially available. although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. to date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. an 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems.  freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. a bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. several micro-organisms were investigated: - staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant ent. faecium (vre), s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (pcmx, active compound of dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained  in suspension and glass-carrier tests. the bactericidal activity of the biocides  depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. all biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against ent. faecalis and vre. the antibacterial activity  of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the  suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. in the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of p. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). pcmx, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. chlorhexidine tested against p. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. these results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ  efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of meropenem versus other extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents against 2,085 clinical isolates tested in 13 brazilian centers.
AB  == meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibacterial agent with a very broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it is the second agent of its class to become available in brazil. the in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem was compared with imipenem and four other antimicrobial agents in a multicenter study. this study involved 13 clinical microbiology laboratories, 10 of which came from 8 brazilian states. a total of 2,085 clinical isolates consecutively collected between december 1995 and march 1996 were susceptibility tested using the etest and following the nccls procedures. meropenem inhibited more than 90% of isolates of enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 microg/ml, except for citrobacter sp. (1 microg/ml). generally, meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem against gram-negative organisms and its spectrum of antimicrobial activity was broader than those of all other drugs tested. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem (mic50, 0.38 microg/ml) was approximately 8-fold more active than imipenem (mic 50,3 microg/ml). imipenem was two-to eight-fold more active than meropenem against some gram-positive specees oxacillin, including enterococcus faecalis (mic 50 of 0.75 microg/ml and 2 microg/ml respectively), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic 50 of 0.47 &mul;g/ml and 0.094 microg/ml), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (mic 50 of 0.064 microg/ml and 0.5mg/ml). against streptococcus sp. meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem (mic 50, 0.016 microg/ml). the results of this study may be used to guide empiric therapy in brazil and indicates that meropenem may have an important role in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant strains of bacteria.

AB  == two mammalian antimicrobial peptides, fa-ll-37 and cecropin p1, were tested for activity against six uropathogens and five lactobacillus strains by broth microdilution assay. both peptides inhibited escherichia coli at 25 microm (fa-ll-39), and 1.56 microm (cecropin p1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 microm, and 25 microm), and klebsiella pneumoniae, (50 microm, and 1.56 microm), but not  enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis. fa-ll-37 acted bacteriocidally against e. coli and bacteriostatically against the other two gram-negative organisms. cecropin p1 was bacteriocidal to all susceptible bacteria. lactobacilli were resistant to both peptides, with the exception of poultry isolate lactobacillus fermentum b-54, which was susceptible to fa-ll-37 at 100 microm. the differential activities of these peptides toward gram-negative uropathogens versus urogenital lactobacilli demonstrate their potential as a topical treatment for urinary tract infections. in addition, production of such peptides in vivo could be a natural mechanism to aid in the maintenance of the lactobacilli-dominated urogenital flora at the expense of pathogens.

TI  == mediastinitis after cardiac transplantation.
AB  == objective: assessment of incidence and behavior of mediastinitis after cardiac transplantation. methods: from 1985 to 1999, 214 cardiac transplantations were performed, 12 (5.6%) of the transplanted patients developed confirmed mediastinitis. patient's ages ranged from 42 to 66 years (mean of 52.3 +/- 10.0 years) and 10 (83.3%) patients were males. seven (58.3%) patients showed sternal  stability on palpation, 4 (33.3%) patients had pleural empyema, and 2 (16.7%) patients did not show purulent secretion draining through the wound. results: staphylococcus aureus was the infectious agent identified in the wound secretion  or in the mediastinum, or both, in 8 (66.7%) patients. staphylococcus epidermidis was identified in 2 (16.7%) patients, enterococcus faecalis in 1 (8.3%) patient,  and the cause of mediastinitis could not be determined in 1 (8.3%) patient. surgical treatment was performed on an emergency basis, and the extension of the  debridement varied with local conditions. in 2 (16.7%) patients, we chose to leave the surgical wound open and performed daily dressings with granulated sugar. total sternal resection was performed in only 1 (8.3%) patient. out of this series, 5 (41.7%) patients died, and the causes of death were related to the infection. autopsy revealed persistence of mediastinitis in 1 (8.3%) patient. conclusion: promptness in diagnosing mediastinitis and precocious surgical drainage have changed the natural evolution of this disease. nevertheless, observance of the basic precepts of prophylaxis of infection is still the best way to treat mediastinitis.

TI  == evaluation of gemifloxacin (sb-265805, lb20304a): in vitro activity against over  6000 gram-positive pathogens from diverse geographic areas.
AB  == gemifloxacin (gemi), formerly sb-265805 and lb20304, is a newer fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum activity against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens. the present investigation extended earlier observations by sampling an additional 6790 gram-positive organisms from more than 50 medical centres on three continents. the reference broth microdilution method with recommended medium supplements was used throughout. selected results (number strains tested; mic90 for gemi/trovafloxacin in mg/l; % < or = 1 mg/l for gemi/trovafloxacin) were: staphylococcus aureus (3672; 2/2; 86/85), s. epidermidis (404; 1/>4; 92/71), enterococcus faecalis (630; 4/>4; 76/66), e. faecium (216; > 4/>4; 15/11), streptococcus pneumoniae (300; 0.06/0.25; 100/97), beta-haemolytic streptococci (150; 0.06/0.25; 100/100) and viridans group streptococci (150; 0.12/0.25; 99/97). gemifloxacin appeared equal or superior to trovafloxacin in its overall gram-positive spectrum of activity pending a choice of the susceptible breakpoint concentration. continued in vitro, pharmacodynamic and clinical investigations of gemifloxacin appear warranted.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of bacteria and hiv in buffy-coat-derived platelet concentrates under conditions that preserve in vitro platelet function.
AB  == background and objectives: a photochemical process has been tested for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates  (bc pcs). materials and methods: bc pcs in 35% cpd plasma and 65% platelet-additive solution (pas iii) were exposed to photochemical treatment (pct) with 150 microm of the psoralen s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva, 320-400 nm). platelet function was evaluated following pct using a panel of in vitro assays. results: this pct process was highly effective at inactivating gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens). no viable bacteria were detected following pct and 7 days of platelet storage while bacterial growth was detected in paired untreated control  bc pcs. complete inactivation of the gram-positive bacillus cereus was achieved only in one of two replicate experiments with bc pcs. pct was also highly effective for inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 in bc pcs inoculated with approximately 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter (tcid(50)/ml) of cell-associated hiv-1. rapid inactivation was observed with increasing uva doses: with 150 microm s-59 and a 1 j/cm(2) treatment of uva, a reduction of 5.6+/-0.5 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved, and a reduction of >6.4 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment of uva. no physiologically relevant differences in platelet functions were found between the test and the control bc pcs during 7 days of storage. conclusion: pct with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) uva treatment does  not adversely affect in vitro properties of bc pcs stored at 22 degrees c for 7 days. the pct process inactivated bacteria and hiv-1 inoculated into the bc pcs.  these results extend the earlier reported efficacy of pct apheresis pcs to bc pcs.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of peptide deformylase inhibitors.
AB  == peptide deformylase catalyzes the removal of the n-terminal formyl group from newly synthesized polypeptides in eubacteria. its essential character in bacterial cells makes it an attractive target for antibacterial drug design. in this work, we have rationally designed and synthesized a series of peptide thiols that act as potent, reversible inhibitors of purified recombinant peptide deformylase from escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. the most potent inhibitor has a k(i) value of 11 nm toward the b. subtilis enzyme. these inhibitors showed antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) as low as 5  microm ( approximately 2 microg/ml). the pdf inhibitors induce bacterial cell lysis and are bactericidal toward all four bacterial strains that have been tested, b. subtilis, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and e. coli. resistance evaluation of one of the inhibitors (1b) against b. subtilis showed that no resistant clone could be found from >1 x 10(9) cells. quantitative analysis using a set of inhibitors designed to possess varying potencies against  the deformylase enzyme revealed a linear correlation between the mic values and the k(i) values. these results suggest that peptide deformylase is the likely molecular target responsible for the antibacterial activity of these inhibitors and is therefore a viable target for antibacterial drug design.

AB  == in this study, urine was collected from groups of volunteers following the consumption of water, ascorbic acid, or cranberry supplements. only ascorbic acid intake consistently produced acidic urine. photospectroscopy data indicated that  increased water consumption produced urine with lower protein content. surface tension measurements of the collected urine showed that both water and cranberry  supplementation consistently produced urine with surface tensions higher than the control or urine collected following ascorbic acid intake. these urine samples were also employed to study uropathogen adhesion to silicone rubber in a parallel plate flow chamber. urine obtained after ascorbic acid or cranberry supplementation reduced the initial deposition rates and numbers of adherent escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, or candida albicans. conversely, urine obtained from  subjects with increased water intake vastly increased the initial deposition rates and numbers of adherent e. coli and e. faecalis (p < 0.05).

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == antiseptic-bonded central venous catheters and bacterial colonisation.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of chlorhexidine/silver sulphadiazine-bonded catheters on the incidence of colonisation and catheter-related sepsis in critically ill patients. threehundred and fifty-one catheters were inserted into 228 patients during the study period, 174chlorhexidine/silver sulphadiazine-bonded catheters and 177 standard catheters. indications for catheter removal were: death, clinical redundancy and  clinical evidence of local or systemic infection. all catheter tips were sent to  the microbiology laboratory for semiquantitative analysis of bacterial colony count. seventy-one (40.2%) of the standard catheters and 47 (27.2%) of the antiseptic-bonded catheters were found to be colonised on removal (p < 0.01). eight cases (4.7%) of catheter-related sepsis were associated with standard catheters and three cases (1.7%) with antiseptic-bonded catheters, however, this  reduction was not statistically significant. our results indicate that the use of antiseptic-bonded catheters in critically ill patients significantly reduces the  incidence of bacterial colonisation.

TI  == a comparison of the antibacterial activity of levobupivacaine vs. bupivacaine: an in vitro study with bacteria implicated in epidural infection.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to compare the antibacterial activity of bupivacaine with levobupivacaine against a range of bacteria implicated in epidural infection to determine whether any differences existed between the two drugs. concentrations of 0.125%, 0.25% and 0.5% bupivacaine and levobupivacaine were inoculated with suspensions of either staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus  aureus or enterococcus faecalis. after incubation, the mixtures were plated onto  blood agar and colony counts were recorded after a further period of incubation.  the minimum bactericidal concentration of local anaesthetic against the three bacteria studied was found to be 0.25% for bupivacaine and 0.5% for levobupivacaine showing racemic bupivacaine to have a more potent antibacterial action than levobupivacaine. this finding suggests that the dextrobupivacaine isomer of racemic bupivacaine has a more potent antibacterial action than the levobupivacaine isomer.

TI  == the ex vivo antimicrobial activity and colonization rate of two antimicrobial-bonded central venous catheters.
AB  == objective: catheter-related sepsis is an important complication associated with the use of central venous catheters. recent studies have suggested that antimicrobial-bonded catheters may reduce catheter colonization and catheter-related sepsis. the aim of this study was to determine the relationship  between the antimicrobial activity and the colonization rate of two commercially  available antimicrobial-bonded central venous catheters. design: prospective, randomized, controlled, nonblinded study. setting: medical intensive care unit of a university-affiliated teaching hospital. patients: one hundred twenty consecutive medical intensive care unit patients requiring new central venous catheters (fresh stick). interventions: patients were randomized to receive a) a  standard arrow; b) an arrowgard; or c) a cook bio-guard spectrum central venous catheter. central venous catheters were removed when they were no longer required or when catheter-related sepsis was suspected. under aseptic conditions, the distal 12 cm of the removed catheters were cut into six 2-cm segments. semiquantitative culture was performed (by roll technique) on the distal segment. colonization was defined as >15 colony-forming units. using a modified kirby-bauer technique, the zone of inhibition of the remaining five segments was  determined against the following organisms: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter baumannii, and candida albicans catheters that were removed within 24 hrs of insertion were excluded from the analysis. measurements and main results: seven patients were not assessable. the baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were similar among the three groups of patients. eleven standard  arrow (28%), seven arrowgard (19%), and four bio-guard (11%) catheters were colonized (p = .05 for bio-guard vs. control). staphylococci were the most common colonizing organisms. two patients with standard arrow catheters (5%) and one patient with an arrowgard catheter (3%) developed catheter-related sepsis. antibiotic-coated catheters significantly inhibited the growth of all test organisms except c. albicans (p < or = .05). zones of inhibition were significantly larger for the bio-guard compared with the arrowgard catheter when  tested against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and e. faecalis (p < or = .002). conclusion: the bio-guard central venous catheter had greater ex vivo antimicrobial activity  against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and e. faecalis compared with the arrowgard catheter, and this was associated with a significantly lower rate of catheter colonization.

AB  == the mics of quinupristin/dalfopristin against common gram-positive bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens at a university hospital in taiwan were  determined by the agar dilution method. the tested bacteria included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (msse), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. with the exception of e. faecalis all bacteria were susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. the mic50 and mic90 were, respectively, 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml for both mrsa and mssa; 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml for mrse; 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.25 microgram/ml for msse; 0.125 microgram/ml and 0.125 microgram/ml for s.  pyogenes; and < or = 0.03 microgram/ml and 0.25 microgram/ml for s. pneumoniae. eighty-two percent of the tested e. faecalis isolates were intermediately resistant or resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, with an mic50 of 2 micrograms/ml and an mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. quinupristin/dalfopristin seems to be a promising antimicrobial agent against common gram-positive bacteria other than e. faecalis in taiwan.

TI  == stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  == aim: to serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. methods: stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. quantitative aerobic and anaerobic  cultures were performed. results: by day 30, predominant species were enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterbacter  cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. in breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (se 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. on day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. conclusions: the gut of extremely low birthweight infants  is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.

AB  == the results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk  of the fetus intranatal infection. during the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), staphylococcus epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. on the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the p. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin b, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. the s.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. when the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently  available antibiotics. because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.

TI  == [bacterial strains isolated from neutropenic patients and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  == background: although gram negative as well as gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of  gram positive bacteria is increasing. the objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. methods and results: the presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the haematological clinic in 1995. haemocultures (apparatus bact/alert 120, cultivation media organon-teknika) and urine were examined. the sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. in blood most frequently staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis and staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). in urine the following were detected: staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), enterococcus sp. (14.5%), escherichia coli (13.1%), enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). in all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. conclusions: investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.

TI  == in-vitro selection of resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis compared with staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == clinical isolates of enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis were studied for their ability to develop resistance by two selection methods, one in broth and one on agar. the mics for enterococci  after exposure to vancomycin ranged from 0.5 mg/l to 4 mg/l, and those after exposure to teicoplanin ranged from 0.25 mg/l to 1 mg/l. no significant increases occurred for e. faecalis, whilst two isolates of e. faecium showed increases of up to eight-fold (from 0.125 mg/l to 1 mg/l). vancomycin mics ranged from 1 mg/l  to 4 mg/l and teicoplanin mics reached 32 mg/l for s. epidermidis. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of smai-digested whole chromosomal dna was performed to compare the genomic dna of glycopeptide-exposed and wild-type strains. in-vitro exposure to vancomycin did not alter mics significantly except in one s. epidermidis isolate for which the mic reached 4 mg/l, whereas the teicoplanin-exposed cultures of s. epidermidis showed increases of up to 64 times the original mic. comparable results were achieved with the two selection methods.

TI  == isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii.
AB  == an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii has been isolated and partially characterized. the antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. the activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. purification techniques included chromatography on amberlite xad-2, deae sephadex and sp sephadex in addition to c18 hplc with an average yield of 75%. this antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of s. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect s. griseus, s. venezuelae, actinomyces bovis, nocardia asteroides, clostridium perfringens, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. the antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic ph but is very labile at alkaline ph conditions.

TI  == [comparative antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

AB  == new pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. these fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). variations at the c-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. the activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the c-8 substituent was in the order f (c5-nh2) > f (c5-h) > naphthyridine > cl = ome = h against gram-positive organisms. in the case of gram-negative strains, activity was in the order f (c5-nh2) > naphthyridine = f (c5-h) > h > cl > ome. the advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. in addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. among these compounds, compound 20 (lb20304) showed the best in vivo  efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. the mics (microgram/ml) of lb20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: s. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), streptococcus epidermidis 887e (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), escherichia coli 3190y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), enterobacter cloacae p99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). on the basis of these promising results, lb20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.

TI  == a review of the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparative antimicrobial agents tested against 30,254 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated world wide.
AB  == the in vitro activity of meropenem (formerly sm-7738), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and five other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) against 30,254 clinically significant pathogens isolated in nine countries worldwide. overall, the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, were the most active drugs. meropenem was four- to 64-fold more active than imipenem against gram-negative bacteria, including the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. meropenem was also quite active against ceftazidime-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 87.5 to 100% at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. in contrast, imipenem was four- to eight-fold more active than meropenem against  gram-positive species, including methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. among the anaerobes, strains resistant to meropenem or imipenem were encountered very rarely. these extensive data provide additional in vitro support for the clinical use of meropenem as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent active against key pathogenic species of bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

AB  == purpose: to determine whether microorganisms are able to survive in a solution of 50 mg/ml of 5-fluorouracil (5-fu) and, therefore, whether there is a risk of vial contamination with multiple use. methods: ten common nosocomial pathogens were tested. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5-fu were determined for each organism. organisms were then inoculated into 1 ml of 5-fu (50 mg/ml) and, after  timed periods of exposure, were plated onto blood agar and incubated at 37 degrees c. plates were checked daily for the presence or absence of growth. results: the mics of klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas cepacia were within one log unit of the 10 mg/ml concentration of 5-fu used by some clinics. after incubation in 5-fu for 1 h, all species survived; after 24 h of exposure, five of the 10 species-staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, k. pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis-were still viable. conclusion: 5-fu has limited bactericidal activity, and there is a risk of contamination if 5-fu vials are used in multiple dose fashion.

TI  == semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of nine antistaphylococcal agents against 275 recent isolates of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the in vitro activities of 9 antistaphylococcal agents including teicoplanin (tei) against 275 non-repetitive  clinical strains representing 15 species of staphylococci and 27 strains of enterococcus (e.) faecalis, isolated from various specimens between 1991-1992 at  a canadian teaching hospital. the nccls agar dilution method was used (10(4) colonyforming units/spot). in terms of mic(90), tei and vancomycin (van) appeared to be the most potent antibiotics against all staphylococci tested (tei: 2.0-4.0  mug/ml; van: 1.0-2.0 mug/ml; ciprofloxacin (cpf): 0.25-32 mug/ml; cefazolin (cef): 8.0-256 mug/ml; methicillin (met): 2.0->256 mug/ml; imipenem (imp): 1.0-32 mug/ml; erythromycin (ert): 16->256 mug/ml; ampicillin (amp): 16-128 mug/ml; fusidic acid (fsa): 0.5-16 mug/ml). multiple resistant strains, including met-resistant staphylococcus (staph.) aureus and staph. epidermidis, were susceptible to tei and van with respective mics of 2-4 mug/ml and 1-2 mug/ml regardless of specimen type. moreover, tei was highly active against e. faecalis  (mic(90) for tei and van: 0.5 and 4.0 mug/ml, respectively).

TI  == emergence of teicoplanin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci.
AB  == over a period of 5 years we have recovered 32 clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) exhibiting either decreased levels of susceptibility or true resistance to teicoplanin (mics, 16 to 128 micrograms/ml); these isolates make up 0.55% of the total cons isolated by us. twenty-nine of the strains were also methicillin resistant, and all were susceptible to vancomycin.  fourteen of the strains were staphylococcus epidermidis, fourteen were staphylococcus haemolyticus, and four were staphylococcus hominis. in one case, a strain of s. haemolyticus was isolated with a vancomycin-resistant, teicoplanin-resistant enterococcus faecalis strain. all strains were nosocomially acquired and were isolated from 17 different wards. teicoplanin resistance occurred as a sporadic phenomenon, and none of the isolates were epidemiologically related. the isolates were from 30 patients, 13 of whom presented with true infections (43%). five (38%) of the 13 patients with true infections had been previously treated with vancomycin. none of the infected patients were previously treated with teicoplanin. the in vivo development of resistance to teicoplanin among cons strains limits the therapy of infections by  these microorganisms. there is a need for surveillance of nosocomial isolates of  cons to determine resistance to glycopeptides.

AB  == the upjohn oxazolidinones, u-100592 and u-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. in several mouse models of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection, u-100592 and u-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ed50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ed50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. similarly, both compounds were active versus a staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. u-100592 and u-100766 effectively cured an enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ed50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with ed50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. in soft tissue infection models with s. aureus and e. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. u-100766 was also very active versus the bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ed50 = 46.3 mg/kg).  in combination-therapy studies, both u-100592 and u-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic s. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic s. aureus-escherichia coli infection. u-100592 and u-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.

TI  == confirmation of the safety of central venous catheterisation in critically ill infants and children--the baragwanath experience.
AB  == objective: to evaluate, in critically ill children, the safety and effectiveness  of routine central venous catheterisations (cvcs) performed by residents from all disciplines. design: prospective audit of all cvcs over a 24-month period. setting: multidisciplinary intensive care unit at baragwanath hospital, soweto. patients: all critically ill patients 12 years of age or younger requiring cvc. all percutaneous sites (subclavian, internal jugular and femoral) were used; these were selected by the attending doctor and not influenced by the audit. results: there were 272 catheterisation attempts, of which 241 (88.6%) were successful. patient age and size but not disease severity influenced incidences of both catheterisation failure and minor bleeding. the latter was the commonest  early complication, occurring in 63 (23.2%) successful catheterisations. there were 7 major complications-3 pneumothoraces, 2 tachyarrhythmias and 2 major bleeds, all with subclavian vein catheterisation. catheter-related infections (cris) occurred in 85 (51.2%) of 166 lines and catheter-related septicaemia (crs) in 10 (5.7%) of 175 lines where there were sufficient data for evaluation. no patient or line factor, including duration of insertion, influenced cri or crs. in cri, staphylococcus epidermidis was the commonest organism. other common cri isolates were enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella spp. and candida albicans. six different organisms were implicated in crs. conclusions: cvc is a safe procedure  with a high success rate. the femoral vein is the recommended percutaneous site of choice as it carries no great risk of sepsis and does not expose the patient to the hazard of intrathoracic complications.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of polyurethane and silicone catheters containing low concentrations of silver: a new perspective in prevention of polymer-associated foreign-body-infections.
AB  == in modern medicine, infection is one of the most serious complications of implanted plastic devices. the host is not able to overcome this special type of  opportunistic infection despite having a normal immune response and a low virulence of most of the bacteria involved. antimicrobial therapy alone generally cannot cure the infection and the removal of catheters often remains the only choice of therapy. bacterial adhesion to the polymer surface of the catheter, be  it luminal or external, is an important step in the pathogenesis of catheter-associated infections. in this report, we describe new approaches to the prevention of infections by impregnation of polyurethane and silicone with silver by two different methods. the antimicrobial activity of these silver-impregnated  catheters is more than 10 fold higher for coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns)  compared to catheters without silver. similar results are obtained with other microbial organisms like staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the new polymers show no cytotoxic or thrombogenic side effects in vitro.

AB  == fractures of the pubic rami are almost invariably associated with fractures of the posterior arch of the pelvic ring. two women, aged 50 and 67 years, with septic arthritis of the symphysis pubis attended by severe low back pain, were followed with ct and mr imaging of the pelvis, as well as bond scintigraphy in one patient. in the first patient sacral fractures with severe displacement were  revealed, prompting stabilizing symphysiodesis. in the second patient an undisplaced fatigue fracture was confirmed in the right half of the sacrum. in patients with pelvic laxity following arthritis of the symphysis and post-traumatic osteolysis associated with low back pain, displaced or occult fractures of the bones adjacent to the sacroiliac joints should be considered.

TI  == antibiotics and prevention of microbial colonization of catheters.
AB  == slime-producing staphylococci frequently colonize catheters, and when they are embedded in biofilm, they become resistant to various antibiotics. in the study that is described, the comparative efficacies of vancomycin, clindamycin, novobiocin, and minocycline, alone or in combination with rifampin, were tested in an in vitro model of colonization. the model consisted of the modified robbins device with antibiotic-impregnated cement filling the lumen of catheter segments. the synergistic combination of minocycline and rifampin was the most efficacious  in preventing bacterial colonization of slime-producing strains of staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus to catheter surfaces. a similar trend was observed when the inhibitory activities of polyurethane catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin were compared with the inhibitory activities of catheters coated with other antimicrobial agents. the inhibitory activities of catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin against s. epidermidis, s. aureus, and enterococcus faecalis strains, for example, were significantly better than those of catheters coated with vancomycin (p < 0.05). the inhibitory activities of catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin against gram-negative bacilli and candida albicans were comparable to those of catheters coated with ceftazidime and amphotericin b, respectively. we found that the combination of minocycline and rifampin is unique and highly effective in preventing the colonization of catheters with slime-producing staphylococci and that it also displays a broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against gram-negative bacteria and  yeast cells.

TI  == susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to glycopeptides comparison of 3  test methods.
AB  == the significance of grampositive bacteria, especially staphylococci and enterococci, as nosocomial pathogens has increased in the last decade. furthermore, resistance to commonly used antibiotics like beta-lactams has also become more common and even resistance to glycopeptides has been observed. we evaluated the susceptibility of 150 staphylococcal clinical isolates (52 s. epidermidis, 52 s. haemolyticus, 10 s. saprophyticus, 10 s. hominis, 4 s. warneri, 4 s. simulans, 4 s. capitis and 14 s. aureus) and of 50 enterococci (49  e. faecalis, 1 e. faecium) to the glycopeptides, vancomycin and teicoplanin. the  data from the agar dilution test used as reference method were compared with the  results from the e test and the agar disk diffusion test. concerning vancomycin,  no resistance among all the staphylococcal isolates was observed whereas one single enterococcal strain (e. faecium) proved to be resistant. the overall resistance of staphylococcal isolates against teicoplanin was about 10.7% (15 s.  haemolyticus, 1 s. epidermidis) being mainly due to the high proportion of s. haemolyticus strains (52 out of 150) among the staphylococcal isolates. teicoplanin resistance among the enterococci was not detected. for vancomycin, a  very close correlation between the mics from the agar dilution test and the e test was noticed. as concerns teicoplanin, the mics from the e-test were usually  somewhat lower than those obtained by the agar dilution test. no correlation was  found between the mics of resistant and intermediate staphylococcal strains and the results from the teicoplanin agar disk diffusion test. for routine teicoplanin susceptibility testing of staphylococci, the determination of the mic (e.g., by the e test) is much more reliable for detecting resistant strains than  the agar disk diffusion test.

TI  == nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. design: a multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. setting: animal research laboratory of a university medical center. subjects: one hundred sixty-five balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. interventions: nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, or candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms e. coli lipopolysaccharide o26:b6. one week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed e. coli/bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. in parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. measurements and main results: the three gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. these effects were not seen with the gram-positive cocci or with c. albicans. pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone  did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. conclusions: sublethal exposure to some gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. in the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. the presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.

TI  == evaluation of s1 chromogenic cephalosporin beta-lactamase disk assay tested against gram-positive anaerobes, coagulase-negative staphylococci, prevotella spp. and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the efficacy of three rapid colorimetric disk assays to detect beta-lactamase production in 60 clinical isolates was evaluated. two chromogenic cephalosporin substrates (s1 and nitrocefin) and an acidimetric test were in complete agreement when tested against enterococcus spp. (20 strains, not enterococcus faecalis), prevotella spp. (10 strains) and gram-positive anaerobic cocci (10 strains). however, the acidimetric test produced documented false-negative results in detecting the beta-lactamases from coagulase-negative staphylococci (two of 20 strains tested). the time required to produce a positive result for the discordant staphylococcus epidermidis isolate favored s1 compared with nitrocefin. these studies indicate that the acidimetric test was less sensitive than the chromogenic cephalosporin substrates and that nitrocefin and s1 could be used to screen for beta-lactamase production in these tested species.

TI  == development of wound infection or separation after cesarean delivery. prospective evaluation of 2,431 cases.
AB  == wound infections are a common surgical complication, often requiring a prolonged  hospital stay and leading to increased costs. over a one-year period, 2,431 patients were followed after cesarean delivery with prompt evaluation and culture of all suspicious wounds. seventy subjects (2.8%) developed confirmed wound infection, and 42 (1.7%) developed noninfected open surgical wounds. seven (0.3%) fascial dehiscences were diagnosed, requiring surgical repair. forty of 63 (64%)  infected wounds had positive bacterial cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis  (29%), enterococcus faecalis (17%), staphylococcus aureus (17%), escherichia coli (11%) and proteus mirabilis (10%) the most frequent isolates. only 7 of 42 (17%)  noninfected wounds had positive cultures, with only s aureus, s epidermidis and corynebacterium species isolated. ninety-five percent of the noninfected wounds had blood or serous collections present. rupture of membranes lasting longer than six hours, emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity were associated with a  statistically increased likelihood of the development of infected wounds. emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity, but not prolonged rupture of membranes, were associated with an increased likelihood of the development of noninfected wounds. therefore, it appears that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the development of postcesarean open wounds: (1) increased amniotic fluid and wound colonization due to prolonged rupture of membranes, resulting in a wound infection containing one or more bacterial species derived from the cervicovaginal flora, and (2) increased exogenous bacterial contamination and flora consistent with skin species or breaks in sterile technique, often accompanying difficult or emergency surgery.

AB  == mechanisms of resistance of strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, neisseria meningitidis and mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics are presented and discussed. the resistance to methicillin-oxacillin in s. aureus and s. epidermidis is chromosomally-mediated by sequence of dna, namely by gene meca. this gene codes altered pbp-2a protein. strains of s.pneumoniae contain pbp-1a, pbp-2b and pbp-2x proteins. they cause resistance to many beta-lactam antibiotics. resistance to vankomycin, respectively to teikoplanin in strains of  e. faecalis and e. faecium is coded by transferable vana and vanb genes. strains  of n. meningitidis produce mostly the altered pbp-2 protein. the increase of resistance in strains of m. tuberculosis is also significant.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of everninomicin (sch) 27899) in comparison with two glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) and six beta-lactam agents was evaluated  against recent clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria. everninomicin showed  the highest activity against the species tested and mics90% of everninomicin against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis,  enterococcus faecium and clostridium difficile were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively. mics90% of everninomicin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) were 0.78 microgram/ml. laboratory induced resistance to everninomicin in  strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis occurred in a stepwise manner and at a very  slow rate. post-antibiotic effect against strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis were 1.8 and 2.6 h, respectively, and a little longer than that of vancomycin. adherence to glass surface of an mrsa strain was strongly repressed by the addition of sub mic of everninomicin in combination with fosfomycin.

TI  == glycopeptides in the treatment of staphylococcal infections.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria are rapidly becoming the most important pathogens in nosocomial infections. in recent years, attention and concern have been focused on the gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis  and enterococcus faecalis. these microorganisms are well equipped to exert their  pathogenic effects and to display virulence. treatment of severe infections caused by gram-positive bacteria remains difficult because of the increase in infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and this has renewed interest in the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. according to national nosocomial infection surveillance study data, in 1989, 60% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 22% of staphylococcus aureus strains showed  methicillin resistance. among other factors, successful antimicrobial therapy depends on rapid and reliable antibiotic delivery to the infection site at a concentration adequate to inhibit the majority of infecting organisms. glycopeptides may be important in the therapy of catheter-related infections, which are mainly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == treatment of cerebrospinal fluid shunt infections with teicoplanin.
AB  == intraventricular teicoplanin 10-15 mg was administered daily to three patients with cerebrospinal fluid (csf) shunt infections due to staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. teicoplanin concentrations in csf 24 h after intrathecal injection of the drug exceeded four- to eight-fold the mics for the infecting microorganisms. csf cultures rapidly became negative and shunt devices  were withdrawn and replaced in the same operative procedure. intraventricular teicoplanin was well tolerated. no relapses occurred. teicoplanin may be an alternative to vancomycin for the antimicrobial therapy of csf shunt infections.

TI  == differential elimination of enteric bacteria by protists in a freshwater system.
AB  == the short-term (1 h) and long-term (3 d) elimination of low and high densities of five enteric bacteria, klebsiella pneumoniae, aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis, by flagellate and ciliate protists were measured in a freshwater system. in addition, the two processes, ingestion and digestion, which cause the disappearance of those enteric bacteria as time passes, were quantified. the results showed that the elimination of these enteric bacteria by protists depends on their initial density, which confirms that the lower the bacterial density the more difficult is their elimination. on the other hand, the short-term and long-term elimination rates of each enteric bacteria were different, and moreover, the order of priority for elimination in the two cases was not the same. escherichia coli showed the highest elimination rate in short-term experiments, while aer. hydrophila disappeared at highest rates in long-term experiments. this different  order of priority in the elimination rates and the different digestion rates on the five enteric bacteria by phagotrophic protists indicated that the elimination in time is very much influenced by the digestive capacity on each enteric bacteria of those protists. thus, the low digestion rates of ent. faecalis and staph. epidermidis by flagellates and ciliates as well as their low disappearance percentages in the long-term experiments confirm that enteric gram-positive bacteria are eliminated from the aquatic systems at lower rates, because their digestion is difficult.

TI  == pacemaker endocarditis. report of 44 cases and review of the literature.
AB  == we conducted a retrospective study to characterize the clinical course, microbiologic spectrum, and risk factors for endocarditis and for associated mortality in a large series of patients with documented pacemaker endocarditis. using a computerized search through the medical records of 10 major hospitals in  israel from 1982 to 1992, and carefully reviewing the charts, we identified 44 patients with pacemaker endocarditis. the cases were categorized as definite (n = 25), probable (n = 12), or possible (n = 7) infective endocarditis based on strict case definition. fever and chills were the most common symptoms. increased esr, leukocytosis, microscopic hematuria, and anemia were the most common laboratory findings. a relatively high proportion of the patients were diabetic.  the most common source of endocarditis was infection acquired by the placement procedure or infection of the pacemaker pouch. demographic, clinical, and laboratory features were similar to those of endocarditis patients of a similar age range without pacemakers, although the frequency of fever and chills was higher in our patients than in those patients and splenomegaly, vascular embolic  phenomena, and new or changing murmurs were rare in our patients. the major pathogens were staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, similar to other series of pacemaker-associated bacteremia and similar to the microbiologic  findings of early prosthetic-valve endocarditis. however, this microbiologic profile is different from that of native-valve endocarditis. although the present series did not show a statistically significant advantage to electrode removal over conservative treatment, when analyzed together with pooled data from other studies, it suggests that the surgical approach is preferable.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the role of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infection (uti) was studied with a view to the possibility that such bacteria are an etiological  factor in the development of bladder cancer. the bacterial strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis, isolated from patients with uti at the kyushu university hospital, were tested for their nitrate-reducing activity after 1 hr of incubation with sodium nitrate (3.57 mm) in a growth medium (ph 7.2) at 37 degrees c. of 35 strains tested, 27 strains (77%) showed the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite with yields ranging from 2 to 310 microm no2-/hr/10(7) bacterial cells, but in 8 strains (23%) including all the 7 strains of e. faecalis no elevated activity (0.0-0.3 microm) could be detected. various kinetic profiles were observed for the nitrate-reducing bacteria, at various rate ranging from rapidly to slowly, during 5 hr of incubation. the effect of nitrate-reducing bacteria on mutagen formation in the human urine was examined. the mutagenic activity of smokers' or non-smokers' urine incubated with or without bacteria for 72 hr at 37 degrees c was assayed by the ames salmonella/microsome test (using ta100 or ta98 with s9-mix). the mutagenic activity increased in urine incubated with the nitrate-reducing s. marcescens or  p. aeruginosa, compared to controls which were incubated without bacteria. potent mutagenic activity could be induced when the urine concentrate prepared from smokers' urine with an xad-2 resin column was incubated with sodium nitrite (40 mm) at ph 3 for 4 hrs. the potent mutagenic activity observed here seems to be due to the class of direct-acting mutagen(s), because no metabolic activation was required. the mutagen formation at an optimal ph 4 proceeded rapidly during 4 hrs of incubation, but decreased thereafter. it was noted that even at a physiological ph 6 of human urine, a lower but significant level of mutagenic activity could still be detected. the mutagenic activity of individual urine concentrate from 14 male smokers and from 6 male non-smokers was assayed after 30 min of incubation with or without sodium nitrite (40 mm) at ph 6. mutagenic activity increased in most of these urine concentrates incubated with sodium nitrite. the levels were variable between individuals with a 1.3- to 53-fold increase compared with the controls incubated without sodium nitrite.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == igg antibody response in bacterial endocarditis using elisa with multiple antigens.
AB  == by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) the antibody responses were detected in sera from normal persons (n = 275), patients with various types  of bacteremia (n = 137), and patients with endocarditis (n = 28). four elisas were evaluated. as antigens ultrasonic extracts of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and nonhemolytic streptococci  were used. the antibody levels against s. aureus increased with age, while antibodies against the other bacteria showed no age variation. the different elisa systems showed many serological cross-reactions. the elisa in this limited  material was 72% successful in identifying cases of bacterial endocarditis caused by s. aureus (diagnostic sensitivity 84%; diagnostic specificity 89%), while in other cases of bacterial endocarditis it was less successful.

TI  == childhood bacteremia in israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  == to delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. some organisms (e.g., h. influenzae,  streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while klebsiella sp., enterococcus faecalis, and acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic  children. a source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing  childhood bacteremia. each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. in each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should  be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.

AB  == recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high  incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. at first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of dna extraction. n-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract  dna from e. faecalis, e. faecium and s. aureus, respectively. after achromopeptidase extraction, the meca gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in clinically isolated mrsa (95 strains), mssa (66), mrse (methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 37), msse (methicillin-sensitive s. epidermidis, 1), s haemolyticus(5), s.hominis(1) and others (enterococcus, pseudomonas, and streptococcus, total 45). pcr products were analyzed by agarose  gel electrophoresis. the positive rates were 95% (mrsa), 1.5% (mssa), and 97% (mrse). the meca gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant s.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive s.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.hominis. the meca gene was not detected in 45 non-staphylococcal strains. meca and fema gene by pcr and pbp 2' by irma were further detected in newly isolated mrsa (20 strains), mssa(20), mrse(14), msse(1) and s.simulans(2). complete correlation between mpipc susceptibility and meca were found. the fema gene was positive in 39/40 of s. aureus, and 0/14 of s.epidermidis, 2/3 of s.simulans. pbp2' were positive in 20/20 of mrsa, 0/20 of mssa, 14/14 of mrse, 0/1 of msse, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive s.simulans. in conclusion, diagnoses of mrsa by simultaneous detection of meca and fema gene as well as pbp2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.

AB  == magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, er, was evaluated. the magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. the optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mm nacl and 5 mm ercl(3) solution. three gram-positive bacteria,  staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. qualitative analysis consisted of gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. the  magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of e. coli down to the concentration of 10 cfu ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. on average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms  was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. the thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.

AB  == antisecretory factor (asf) is a regulatory peptide which counteracts diarrhoea in the pig; asf is rapidly absorbed from the pig intestine, and significantly reduces the incidence of neonatal diarrhoea in the suckling offspring. asf is synthesized in the central nervous system, and released to the blood stream via the pituitary gland. in two different experiments (n = 8 and n = 4), the blood concentration of asf was followed in 5-weeks old piglets from day 7 before weaning up to day 12 days after weaning. in both experiments asf concentrations were significantly (p < 0.01) lower on day three post-weaning, than either before weaning or on days 7 and 12 post-weaning. in another experiment, where plasma asf activity was determined in relation to clinical signs of diarrhoea seven days post-weaning, it was found to be 0.87 +/- 0.08 units/ml (mean +/- sem) in healthy weaners (n = 15), but only 0.22 +/- 0.05 units/ml in piglets suffering from diarrhoea (n = 15), the difference being significant. the faecal flora both of healthy weaners and of their matched controls suffering from diarrhoea were subjected to bacteriological examination before and after weaning, and found to be similar in both groups, namely a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic gram negative rods, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus/epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis. no particular pathogen was predominant in any of the diseased animals.

TI  == trends in gram-positive bloodstream organism resistance: a seven-year audit of five glycopeptides and other drugs at a large university hospital.
AB  == gram-positive pathogens (n = 525) isolated from bloodstream infections were tested by a reference broth microdilution method to establish antibiotic susceptibility trends (1985 to 1991). cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, novobiocin, oxacillin, rifampin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, daptomycin and two investigational glycopeptides (ly264826 and mdl62873) were investigated. strains were selected without bias (first two isolates each month/species; no patient duplicates) as follows: 132 staphylococcus aureus, 129 staphylococcus epidermidis, 72 staphylococcus haemolyticus, 130 enterococcus faecalis and 62 other enterococci. all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin except for staphylococcus haemolyticus which had a resistant teicoplanin mic90 of 64 micrograms/ml. the susceptibilities to vancomycin and teicoplanin were unchanged over the monitored  period. daptomycin, ly264826 and mdl62873 also demonstrated consistent activity;  mdl62873 being superior with a mic90 of 0.12 micrograms/ml. in 1990-1991 a significantly increased resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed among oxacillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. our data suggest that the emergence of invasive vancomycin-resistant strains in gram-positive isolates remains a rare phenomenon. however, we have experienced an emergence of numerous ciprofloxacin-resistant strains among staphylococci that precludes its empirical  use at our institution.

TI  == construction of a slime negative transposon mutant in staphylococcus epidermidis  using the enterococcus faecalis transposon tn917.
AB  == the slime-producing staphylococcus epidermidis strain sensu strictu cns23 was transformed by protoplast transformation with the plasmid ptv1 which carries transposon tn 917. using this transposon mutagenesis system we obtained the tn917-inserted mutant ct512, which has lost the ability to produce slime. a single insertion of the transposon tn917 into the chromosome of ct512 could be detected by southern hybridization. this mutant showed a significantly higher stability concerning its slime-negative phenotype compared with spontaneous slime-negative mutants of s. epidermidis strain cns23. in slime-elisa no slime-associated antigen could be detected in extracts of the transposon mutant.  compared to slime-positive s. epidermidis strains, ct512 lacked in accumulative growth in microtiter tube test.

TI  == microbial adhesion and biofilm formation on ureteral stents in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == thirty ureteral stents, inserted for 5 to 128 days following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, were examined for the presence of bacterial biofilms. of these, 90% had adherent pathogens (44% mixed organisms) on the stents, 45% of which were present in low numbers (10(1)-10(2) per 1 cm3 section) and 55% were in small and  large microcolony biofilms (> 2 x 10(2)-10(7)). the organisms were recovered from the stents even though urine culture was only positive in 27% of patients. of the organisms isolated, 77% were gram positive cocci, 15% gram negative rods and 8% candida. no blockage of the stents occurred. all of the patients had received antimicrobial therapy post-insertion, and in 15 cases biofilms were found while on treatment. none of the patients received therapy for urinary tract infections  while the stent remained in place. in vitro experiments demonstrated the ability  of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis uropathogens to adhere and form biofilms on ureteral stents within 24 hours. clearly, bacterial biofilms do occur on ureteral stents and urinary culture may not detect their presence. the high recovery rate of gram positive organisms may indicate a preferential adhesion to the biomaterial surface. the findings also indicate that unlike biofilm formation on many other prosthetic implants, colonization with gram positive organisms on ureteral stents does not necessarily coincide with the development symptomatic infection.

TI  == comparison of the gentamicin resistance transposon tn5281 with regions encoding gentamicin resistance in enterococcus faecalis isolates from diverse geographic locations.
AB  == the genetic determinant encoding gentamicin resistance (gmr) on the beta-lactamase encoding plasmid pbem10 of enterococcus faecalis hh22 is carried on a transposon, termed tn5281, that is highly related to the staphylococcal gmr  transposons tn4001 found in australian isolates of staphylococcus aureus and tn4031 found in united states isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis. we have now studied plasmid dna from gmr strains of e. faecalis isolated from diverse geographical locations (houston, pennsylvania, thailand, and chile) by using restriction endonuclease analysis and dna-dna hybridization to determine whether  other gmr e. faecalis carry tn5281 or a similar type of element. we also compared these enterococci to several united states isolates of staphylococcus aureus with nonmobile gmr determinants. three e. faecalis isolates (from houston and chile) carried tn5281-like elements, whereas two isolates (from houston and pennsylvania) had restriction endonuclease and dna-dna hybridization patterns more similar to those of the tn4001-is257 hybrid found in the nonmobile gmr determinants in united states isolates of s. aureus. a strain from thailand had a third pattern unrelated to either tn5281 or the nonmobile gmr determinants present in united states isolates of s. aureus. our results demonstrate that there is both similarity and diversity between the gmr determinant of strains of  e. faecalis isolated in diverse geographic locations.

AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

TI  == a novel electrical method for the prevention of microbial colonization of intravascular cannulae.
AB  == an electrical device designed to prevent microbial attachment to plastic intravascular cannulae is described. the device produced an electrical current (10 microa) in both carbon-impregnated and 'hydrocath' cannulae. in-vitro models  were utilized to demonstrate that the current can block several mechanisms by which microorganisms gain initial access to intravascular devices, including extra- and intra-luminal routes. the electrical system prevented organisms from traversing along both the external and internal surfaces of the cannulae. effective prevention of cannula colonization was demonstrated subsequent to challenge with staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the findings suggest that the electrical device may offer in-vivo cannula protection  from microbial attachment and colonization, thereby reducing the potential for infection.

AB  == bay y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as bacteriodes fragilis and clostridium perfringens. mic90s for s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. faecalis, and s. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant s. aureus, mic50 levels of bay y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. the potency of bay y3118 against all members of the enterobacteriaceae generally  was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. bay y3118 was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on mic determinations. the drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference mbcs and time-kill curves. from the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.

TI  == effect of nacl-induced osmotic stress on intracellular concentrations of glycine  betaine and potassium in escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococci.
AB  == staphylococci are more salt tolerant than are enterococci or escherichia coli. they have a more rigid cell wall and higher internal turgor pressure. the mechanisms of nacl-induced osmotic tolerance among these bacteria were examined by determining the generation of osmoprotective activity of cellular extracts and intracellular concentrations of glycine betaine and potassium (k+) in response to graded amounts of nacl. staphylococci as well as e. coli were shown to require choline or glycine betaine to achieve maximal salt tolerance. in response to 0.9  mol/l nacl, e. coli exhibited a marked increase in osmoprotective activity, a 168-fold rise in glycine betaine, and a 2.3-fold rise in k+. enterococcus faealis exhibited a small increase in osmoprotective activity, a 9.3-fold increase in glycine betaine, and a twofold increase in k+. in contrast, strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. saprophyticus were found to have considerably greater osmoprotective activity, glycine betaine, and k+ than other  organisms, even in the absence of external osmotic stress. glycine betaine rose in some strains, but k+ remained virtually unchanged as the concentration of nacl was increased. the high concentrations of glycine betaine and k+ in staphylococci, even in the absence of osmotic stress, may explain in part their remarkable salt tolerance and high turgor pressure.

TI  == bacteriology of the anal wound after open hemorrhoidectomy. qualitative and quantitative analysis.
AB  == the purpose of this study is to analyze the size of the bacterial colonies in anal wounds after open hemorrhoidectomy. twenty patients were studied during predetermined postoperative time periods. material was collected from the surface and from within the tissue of each patient's three open wounds, intraoperatively, on the 6th, 13th and 20th postoperative days for bacteriologic examination in aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic media. the bacterium most commonly identified was escherichia coli, followed by staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and proteus mirabilis were also identified. critical indexes of colonization were present since the intraoperative stage (greater than 10(5) bacteria/g of tissue and greater than 10(6) bacteria/ml); obligate anaerobic bacteria were not identified; neither the  species nor the number of bacteria, even when critical indexes were present, prevented proper healing. the same bacteria were not necessarily present on the surface and in the tissue; the bacterial load observed among the three wounds (left lateral, right posterior, and right anterior), was the same.

TI  == the fluoroquinolones exert a reduced rate of kill against enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the bactericidal activities of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and dr-3355 have been investigated against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis over 24 h. the three fluoroquinolones were found to be rapidly bactericidal against the staphylococci, killing over 99% of the bacteria  during the first 3 h of exposure with a further reduction in viability of approximately one logarithm occurring over the next 21 h. in contrast, the fluoroquinolones displayed a much slower rate of kill against e. faecalis, as little or no bactericidal activity was detected over the first 3 h for both e. faecalis atcc19433 and a clinical isolate. at 6 h all three of the drugs were bactericidal against the enterococci although the amount of kill was not as great as against the staphylococci. however, at 24 h the amount of kill obtained with all three drugs was similar to that obtained for staphylococci exposed to these drugs. ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and dr-3355 were not active against e. faecalis atcc19433 in phosphate buffered saline and therefore require cell division for their bactericidal activity against this species.

AB  == seventy three adults underwent orthotopic liver transplantations between february 1987 and november 1989 and were followed (54 retrospectively and 19 in a prospective study) with the aim of establishing the incidence of deep mycoses (3  disseminated candidiasis due to c. albicans, 1 invasive aspergillosis due to a. fumigatus and 1 invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to a. niger and a. fumigatus). 4/5 of these infections occurred in the first month after transplantation. all the patients were associated with the following clinical risk factors: previous use of wide spectrum antibiotics (5/5); more than 1 abdominal laparotomy (4/5), due to primary failure of the graft (3/4) and thrombosis of the hepatic artery (1/4). two of the three patients [corrected] with invasive candidiasis had previous episodes of documented fungemia. 24 patients of the group who didn't show mip had some risk factor which in all of them was the previous use of high dose steroids and/or of wide spectrum antibiotics, in addition to the used in surgical prophylaxis. in our series, the  one risk factor associated with mip was more than one previous laparotomy (p less than 0.001). other significant associated infections were 3 bacterial sepsis (2 due to enterococcus faecalis and 1 due to staphylococcus epidermidis) and one viral (cytomegalovirus viremia). the mortality rate was 100%, however the cause of death was multifactorial.

TI  == characterization of the gentamicin resistance transposon tn5281 from enterococcus faecalis and comparison to staphylococcal transposons tn4001 and tn4031.
AB  == in enterococcus faecalis, the genetic determinant encoding gentamicin resistance  (gmr) on the conjugative plasmid pbem10 previously has been shown to be on a mobile element. in the current study, this element, termed tn5281, was shown to relocate in the absence of homologous recombination in e. faecalis uv202. on the  basis of restriction endonuclease analysis and dna-dna hybridization studies, tn5281 was shown to be similar, if not identical, to the gmr transposons tn4001 found in australian isolates of staphylococcus aureus and tn4031 found in u.s. isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, since all three of these transposons have symmetrically located hindiii (2.5 kb apart), clai (slightly more than 2.5 kb apart), and haeiii (3.9 kb apart) sites. restriction endonuclease digestion patterns of tn5281 generated with hincii, scai, and alui were also consistent with tn4001 and tn4031. by using a probe specific for the external portion of the terminal inverted repeat of tn4031, it was determined that each terminus of tn5281 contained a 0.35-kb haeiii fragment and a 0.7-kb hindiii-haeiii fragment.  the sizes of these fragments are identical to those found in the staphylococcal transposons, which is a further indication that inverted repeats like is256 are present in tn5281. a 1-kb haeiii fragment in pbem10 also hybridized with this probe, which indicates that tn5281 in pbem10 contains a double copy of the inverted repeat at one end.

TI  == aztreonam versus gentamicin for short-term prophylaxis in biliary and gastric surgery.
AB  == short-term antibiotic prophylaxis was studied in 80 patients undergoing biliary or gastric surgery. the patients were randomized to receive 1 g of aztreonam or 80 mg of gentamicin intravenously 30 minutes before surgery and 8 and 16 hours after surgery. of samples taken from the abdominal cavity for bacteriologic study, 53% were culture positive. wound infections developed in two (4.5%) of 44  patients receiving aztreonam and in seven (19.4%) of 36 patients treated with gentamicin. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterobacter species were isolated from sites of wound infection in the aztreonam group; escherichia coli (two isolates), pseudomonas aeruginosa (two isolates), enterobacter species, klebsiella species, enterococcus faecalis, and aeromonas hydrophila were isolated from the gentamicin group. our data indicate that aztreonam is safe and effective for the prevention of infections following biliary and gastric surgery.

TI  == susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  == fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. two hundred thirty-one  patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90%  of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of enterococcus faecalis were  4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates  of escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of proteus mirabilis 0.25  and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. in summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety  of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.

TI  == penetration into tissues of various drugs active against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria are the most important pathogens causing hospital- and community-acquired infections. we therefore reviewed the penetration of various antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus into tissues, where staphylococcal infections are common. rifampicin reaches heart valve concentrations of 65% of the simultaneous serum levels. at 8 h after administration blood and tissues concentrations of rifampicin exceeded the mic90 values for s. aureus as well as for s. epidermidis. after a 2-g intravenous bolus injection of flucloxacillin heart valve concentrations exceeded mic values for staphylococci for more than 8 h whereas subcutaneous and muscle concentrations declined within the same time to undetectable levels. the mic90 values of vancomycin for s. epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis are 2.0 and 4.0 mg/l respectively and for s. aureus 1.0 mg/l. this concentration is reached in subcutaneous tissue, heart valves and muscle for at least 4-6 h after administration of 15 mg/kg, however the corresponding value for enterococcus faecalis in heart valve is maintained only for 3-4 h. after two and three dose regimens of teicoplanin serum and bone levels were significantly higher than fat levels, exceeding the mic90 values for s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the ratio of tissue concentration of teicoplanin to serum concentrations was 11% for fat and 65% for bone.

AB  == the in-vitro inactivation of metronidazole by different clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis was investigated by means of association experiments in which ent. faecalis strains and bacteroides fragilis group strains were cultured  in the same liquid medium. all of the tested ent. faecalis strains (20 isolates)  were able to protect the b. fragilis group strains against the killing effect of  metronidazole at a concentration four or eight times higher than the normal mic.  different strains of streptococcus (14), staphylococcus aureus (10), staph, epidermidis (10) and escherichia coli (8) failed to exhibit the same effect. when ent. faecalis strains were cultured anaerobically for 24 h in the presence of 4 mg metronidazole/l, either alone or together with different b. fragilis group strains, no metronidazole could be detected subsequently in the culture supernatants by hplc. concomitantly an increase of four or five logs in the viable counts of the co-cultured bacteroides strains was observed compared with bacteroides strains cultured alone. sonicated cell extracts of ent. faecalis cultured either aerobically or anaerobically were found to inactivate metronidazole to the same extent, whereas the culture supernatants had no such effect.

AB  == win 57273 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent in vitro activity versus gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and gentamicin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis. we compared the microdilution mics and mbcs of this compound to those of other antimicrobial agents for more than 30 clinical isolates of each of these groups of organisms and found that with few exceptions, it was at least 10 times more active than all other drugs tested. selection for resistance to ciprofloxacin (greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/ml) or win 57273 (greater than or equal to 0.16 microgram/ml) by the gradient plate method produced mutants with diminished susceptibility to the other fluoroquinolone; however, the mics and mbcs of win 57273 for such strains were still quite low and remained below the preliminary susceptibility breakpoint (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). spontaneous mutations conferring resistance to two and five times the win 57273 mic were detectable at low frequencies for s. aureus and s. epidermidis; such mutations were virtually undetectable for e. faecalis. further  testing is necessary to establish if the effectiveness of win 57273 is maintained in vivo, first in animals and then in humans with infections caused by methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus and s. epidermidis or gentamicin-susceptible and -resistant strains of e. faecalis.

AB  == the bactericidal activity of daptomycin and vancomycin alone in cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broth and in human serum against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis was evaluated by exposing replicating microorganisms to concentrations ranging from 2 to 128 micrograms/ml for 24 hr. in addition, the possibility of emergence of resistance, the stability of each agent in the respective medium, and the percent of protein binding by human serum for each agent was evaluated. we found that a concentration of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml of daptomycin was sufficient to achieve bactericidal activity (greater than or equal to 99.9% killing of the inoculum) in cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broth for all staphylococcal isolates tested; a concentration of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml of daptomycin was required for bactericidal activity in cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broth for enterococcal isolates. in human serum, comparable bactericidal activity with daptomycin was achieved only with concentrations 8-16 times higher. a similar but less pronounced effect in human serum was seen for vancomycin. neither daptomycin nor vancomycin was appreciably  degraded in human serum over a 24-hr period. it is likely that the clinical efficacy of daptomycin in humans would be enhanced by higher dosing than has been studied to date.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin-metronidazole combinations against mixed bacterial cultures: reduced activity of metronidazole against bacteroides species in the presence of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin-metronidazole combinations against mixed cultures of gram-positive facultative cocci and strains of the bacteroides fragilis group was investigated. metronidazole did not influence the high activity of daptomycin against strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis in the absence or presence of the co-cultured bacteroides strains. in contrast, the enterococcus faecalis isolates  protected the co-cultured bacteroides strains against the killing effect of metronidazole, even at a concentration four- or eightfold the mic of metronidazole. killing curve experiments confirmed this protective effect of different isolates of enterococcus faecalis.

TI  == recurrent postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  == we treated five patients for postoperative endophthalmitis who demonstrated an initially good response to intravitreal management of their infection and then suffered a later recurrence. four of the five patients received a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics as the only intravitreal therapy, and the fifth patient received a single antibiotic injection in addition to a partial vitrectomy. all recurrent infections occurred between 10 and 21 days after the original intravitreal injection of antibiotics. at the time of the recurrence, all five patients remained culture positive with the same organism that was initially isolated. the bacterial species isolated were s. epidermidis, group d streptococcus, p. acnes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa. all patients were ultimately sterilized with repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, vitrectomy, and/or intraocular lens removal. factors that were related to recurrent infection were marginal susceptibility of the organism to the originally injected antibiotics, infection with a slowly replicating organism, and infection with a gram-negative bacillus. a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics may only partially treat bacterial endophthalmitis. patients should be observed for at least 3 weeks following treatment of endophthalmitis for recurrence of their infection, and aggressive management, including vitrectomy and repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, should be used to treat recurrent infections.

TI  == abnormal maxillary sinus radiographs in children: do they represent bacterial infection?
AB  == thirty-three children with chronic tonsillitis and/or adenoid enlargement and without previous diagnosis of sinusitis were studied regarding the bacterial flora of their maxillary sinuses. puncture of maxillary sinus was performed at surgery (adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy) and aspirates were cultured. streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 8 of 12 (66.7%) patients whose x-rays  showed completely opacified maxillary sinus. streptococcus viridans, streptococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis were recovered from 6 (28.6%) of the 21 patients with normal maxillary sinus radiographs. bacterial titers were greater than 10(4) colonies/ml in all but one of the positive cultures. no anaerobic bacteria were isolated. history of bronchial asthma, presence of nasal purulent secretion, elevated blood eosinophils, and elevated serum ige were found more frequently in children with complete opacification of maxillary sinus. serum levels of igg2 were low in 29% of the children, but no correlation was found between low igg2 levels and positive cultures from maxillary sinus aspirates. we concluded that children with complete radiologic opacification of maxillary sinus had bacterial infection in almost 70% of the cases with symptoms that did not prompt their physicians to consider the diagnosis of sinusitis.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the fosb gene conferring fosfomycin resistance in staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  == we have determined the nucleotide sequence of gene fosb of plasmid pip1842, which confers resistant to fosfomycin in staphylococcus epidermidis bm2641. the resistance gene was identified as a coding sequence of 417 bases pairs corresponding to a protein with a calculated mw of 16,345 daltons. this value is  in good agreement with that of 15,000, estimated by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of a bacterial cell-free coupled transcription-translation system. the fosb gene product exhibits 48% sequence homology with the fosfomycin  resistance protein fosa of enterobacteriaceae. the substitutions are scattered throughout indicating that the two corresponding genes have diverged from a common ancestor. downstream from fosb is located an open reading frame that was partially sequenced. the deduced amino-acid sequence was 50% homologous to rep alpha 1, a protein involved in the replication of the enterococcus faecalis plasmid pam alpha 1.

TI  == catheter-related right-sided endocarditis in bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == bone marrow transplant recipients are at increased risk of severe central venous  catheter-related septicemias that may be complicated by endocardial infection. in view of this, we prospectively evaluated 141 consecutive patients receiving allogeneic or autologous bone marrow infusion. seven (5%) of 141 patients developed eight episodes of a clinical syndrome compatible with catheter-related  right-sided infective endocarditis; this diagnosis was confirmed at autopsy in two patients who died. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent isolate (four cases). other offending pathogens were, in one case each, enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium jeikeium, pseudomonas alcaligenes, and achromobacter xylosoxidans plus candida species. three- to 7-week courses of antibacterial therapy were associated with a favorable outcome in six of the seven cases. infective endocarditis may be a complication of the use of central venous catheters and should be actively sought in septicemic bone marrow transplant recipients.

TI  == immune response in patients with intraabdominal infections treated with imipenem. swedish study group.
AB  == in the present investigation the humoral immune response against isolated microorganisms in patients treated with imipenem was studied. sixty-six patients  (34 men and 32 women, 18-86 years of age) with suspicion of intraabdominal infections entered the study. five patients were excluded for various reasons and the remaining 61 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin 0.5-1.0 g t.i.d.  for 5-29 days (median nine days). three serum samples were taken from each patient, the first sample at admission, the second between three and seven days after the first dose of imipenem/cilastatin and the third between 14 and 31 days  after the first dose. one third of the patients had a malignant disease and the verified intraabdominal infections were judged to be severe in 23 and moderately  severe in 33 of the patients. fifty-six patients (92%) were cured and five patients (8%) were considered improved after the treatment. the immune response against isolated microorganisms was measured in the three serum samples by indirect immunofluorescence tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. among the aerobic microorganisms isolated escherichia coli (46 strains) staphylococcus  epidermidis (22 strains), streptococcus milleri (15 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (11 strains) dominated and among the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis (39 strains). thirty-two patients had significant immune responses against one or more of the isolated microorganisms. e. coli and b. fragilis gave  rises in antibody titers in 13 and 20 cases respectively, while significant titers against s. epidermidis were noticed in only three cases, against s. milleri in two cases and against e. faecalis in three cases.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

AB  == we made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (cmz) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with  the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. determination of bacteriological efficacy while 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. isolates obtained  were: 5 strains of enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 2  strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of neisseria sp., pseudomonas maltophilia, enterobacter sp., alpha-streptococcus, beta-streptococcus and gram-positive cocci. causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the  15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. e. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. as for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. while  an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of cmz administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == intra-abdominal sepsis after hepatic resection.
AB  == one hundred and thirty hepatic resections performed over an 8-year period were reviewed for evidence of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis. of 126 patients who survived for more than 24 hours after operation, 36 developed culture positive intra-abdominal collections (28.6%). significant independent variables associated with the development of intra-abdominal sepsis were diagnoses of trauma or cholangiocarcinoma, and the need for reoperation to control hemorrhage  during the postoperative period. before 1984, infected fluid collections were treated predominantly by operative drainage, but this has largely been replaced by percutaneous methods, which have proven effective in most cases. eighteen (50%) of the infections were caused by a mixed bacterial culture, with streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli being the most common isolates. six patients with clinical signs of sepsis had a sterile fluid collection drained with complete relief of symptoms. this review suggests that intra-abdominal sepsis is a frequent complication after hepatic resection, and can often be managed successfully by nonoperative percutaneous drainage.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == streptococcus faecalis susceptibility to amiloride depends on medium ph.
AB  == amiloride is one of the major molecular probes in basic and applied investigations on the physiology of cation transport in animal cells. in these cells the drug also exerts growth inhibitory activity. recently, we discovered that amiloride causes growth inhibition also on bacterial cells. in this paper we report that medium ph influences amiloride activity on streptococcus faecalis. the lowering of external ph causes a drop in the susceptibility of this bacterium to amiloride up to an almost complete resistance. this finding, constitutes a novel aspect of the in vitro experimental pharmacology of this diuretic potentially useful also in clinical pharmacology and in animal cell investigations.

TI  == structural relationships between senfolomycins and paulomycins.
AB  == senfolomycins a and b (antimicrob. agents chemother.-1965: 828-831, 1966) are two antibacterial agents with physico-chemical and biological properties similar to those of paulomycin. recent studies indicate that senfolomycin a (c29h36n2o16s, mw 700) has molecular composition and fast atom bombardment ms fragmentation pattern identical to those of paulomycin e. extensive nmr work indicates that the two antibiotics, which have been separated by hplc and tlc, differ only in the stereochemistry of the och3 group present in their respective sugar moieties. indirect evident suggests that senfolomycin b is dihydrosenfolomycin a (c29h38n2o16s, mw 702) and in this respect it is related to paulomycin f. the proposed structures for senfolomycins a and b are discussed.

AB  == experimental models of polymicrobial osteomyelitis were prepared using clinical isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis as aerobes and bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides bivius as anaerobes. these pathogens were used because of their opportunistic properties. two 8 mm long silk threads with the microorganism were inserted into the bone marrow of a rat. the microorganism  inoculated was about 10(5) c.f.u. for aerobes and 10(6) c.f.u. for anaerobes. infected parts observed in the roentgenograms, histopathological changes, and bacterial counts all showed the evolution of osteomyelitis. it was found that our models caused osteomyelitis both when each of s. epidermidis, e. faecalis, b. fragilis, and b. bivius was implanted individually and in their combinations. the patterns of the radiological and the histological observations were almost similar in all cases examined, but their characteristics differed depending on the kinds and combinations of the pathogens.

TI  == thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension during three types of gram-positive bacteremia in piglets.
AB  == thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in animals during intravenous infusion of group b streptococcus (gbs), a gram-positive neonatal pathogen. we postulated that other gram-positive neonatal pathogens, such as streptococcus fecalis (ent) and staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epi) would also induce increased thromboxane synthesis and pulmonary hypertension when infused into piglets. we observed similar hemodynamic and gas exchange abnormalities during stepwise increases in the dose of gbs, ent, and s. epi (n = 3, 4, and 4 piglets receiving each bacteria, respectively). pulmonary vascular resistance increased significantly in the absence of acidosis or reduced arterial or mixed venous po2 at a dose of 2.5 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for ent and s. epi. in 14 additional piglets, pulmonary vascular resistance increased markedly after 60 min of intravenous infusion of 4 +/- 1 x 10(8) cfu/kg/h for each organism (p less than 0.05, gbs: 11.7 +/- 1.8 to 75.6 +/- 18.4 mm hg/liter/min, ent: 12.7 +/- 1.7 to 64.9 +/- 10.6 mm hg/liter/min, s. epi: 10.5 +/- 0.8 to 56.9 +/- 6.0 mm hg/liter/min), and blood thromboxane b2 levels increased (p less than 0.05, gbs:  30 +/- 10 to 1830 +/- 330 pg/ml, ent: 20 +/- 7 to 1110 +/- 300 pg/ml, s. epi: 31  +/- 9 to 1260 +/- 350 pg/ml). this dose of each bacteria caused a similar degree  of mild arterial hypoxemia (57-66 mm hg). the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, dazmegrel, completely reversed pulmonary hypertension, reduced txb2 levels to near baseline values, and partially reversed arterial hypoxemia despite ongoing bacterial infusion. we conclude that thromboxane-associated pulmonary hypertension occurs in piglets during infusion of different gram-positive neonatal pathogens.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == use of a glycopeptide antibiotic, teicoplanin, in the treatment of septicaemia caused by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == teicoplanin, a recently introduced glycopeptide antibiotic, has been used, in combination with other antibiotics, to treat 31 episodes of septicaemia caused by gram-positive organisms. teicoplanin has double the activity of vancomycin against many gram-positive bacteria, but allergic reactions and toxicity appear to be infrequent. a single daily dose is sufficient to maintain therapeutic levels, which is an advantage in conditions requiring long-term treatment. of the 31 episodes treated, 16 were associated with infective endocarditis, 11 with hickman catheter infection, two with bone and joint infection, and two with infection of other indwelling prosthetic devices. staphylococcus epidermidis was  isolated in 18 infections, of which seven treatment courses were unsuccessful. one death occurred from an uncontrolled infection, three deaths from underlying disease (one of which had relapsed twice), and one after withdrawal of treatment  following febrile reaction. eleven episodes were cured. six episodes of staphylococcus aureus septicaemia were treated, of which two failed to respond, two relapsed, one improved and one was cured. the remaining seven episodes were caused by streptococci (including streptococcus faecalis), and in all of them cure was achieved despite the lack of consistent serum bactericidal activity in vitro.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1985). ii. background of patients].
AB  == we have investigated relationships between patients' backgrounds and isolates from urinary tract infections in reference to various conditions, such as sexes,  age distribution by sex, species of causative organisms by sex, age distribution  according to species and types of infections, species and infections before and after treatment with antibacterial agents, and species and detected places. as for the relationship between sexes and types of infections, although simple urinary tract infections were consistently found at about 20% in men and at about 80% in women between 1981 and 1983, these infections were seen at 24.4% in men and at 75.6% in women in 1984, and at 26.6% and at 73.4% in 1985, indicating slight decreases in the ratio of women. by contrast, complex urinary tract infections were found in men at about 60-70% from 1981 up to 1985, regardless of  the presence or absence of indwelling catheter. there were no noticeable changes  according to age during this 5-year period in incidences of infections including  simple urinary tract infection and complex urinary tract infection with or without indwelling catheter. thus, backgrounds of patients with urinary tract infections, including sex, age and simple or complex infections, were fairly consistent throughout this period, while there were relatively large changes in species of isolates. enterococcus faecalis was isolated at about 8% of both men and women in 1982 and 1983, but its isolation rates were increased to 22.5% of men and 17.9% of women in 1984. in 1985 this species was isolated in 14.9% of men and 7.6% of women, and in 11.2% of all patients. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. were detected at rates of 3.2%, 8.1%, 0.7% and 1.0%, respectively, and 24.2% of isolated strains were gram-positive organisms. when species of isolates before treatment with antibacterial agents and their isolation rates were analyzed, it was found that the isolation rate of e. faecalis increased dramatically in 1983,  and that this tendency was still seen in 1984. the isolation rate of gram-positive organisms was 25% in 1984 and 24.3% in 1985. escherichia coli was consistently isolated at about 40%, but, as far as simple urinary tract infections are concerned, its isolation rate decreased by about 10% in 1985, compared to 1982 and 1983. these results suggested that causative organisms for simple urinary tract infections became similar to those for complex urinary tract infections. in other words, isolates obtained from complex urinary tract infections before treatment were similar to those of simple infections.(abstract  truncated at 400 words)

AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == we present two cases illustrating a surgical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of infectious endophthalmitis following extracapsular cataract extraction with insertion of a posterior chamber lens. in both cases, a vitrectomy was initiated through a limbal approach after clearing the anterior chamber, thus allowing improved visualization of the vitreous cavity. the vitrectomy probe was then passed through a peripheral iridotomy, the peripheral posterior capsule and/or zonules, and into the anterior vitreous. the peripheral  iridotomy allowed access to the vitreous cavity for an anterior vitrectomy. the entire anterior chamber and vitreous aspirate was then analyzed for culture and sensitivity. this technique minimizes the risks of pars plana vitrectomy for endophthalmitis by improving visualization and possibly decreasing the risk of retinal detachment.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cefpirome (hr 810), a new cephalosporin antibiotic having a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain, was compared with in vitro activities of 5 other cephalosporins. hr 810 showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria when tested using 71 standard strains and 876 clinical isolates. hr 810  inhibited 70% of the clinically isolated staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains when used at 0.59-0.84 microgram/ml, 2- to 25-fold lower than values of reference antibiotics, and the compound was also highly effective against enterococcus faecalis which is relatively resistant to most of the existing cephem antibiotics. the activity of hr 810 against enterobacteriaceae members (11 species), based on its minimal inhibitory concentrations inhibiting 90% of bacterial growth (mic90s), was the highest among the cephalosporins used.  especially against enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii, the mic90s of the compound were 4- to 64-fold lower than the values of the other antibiotics. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, hr 810 was as active as cefoperazone, an antipseudomonal agent. the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of hr 810 were equal to or only 2-fold greater than the mics for most of 12 standard strains tested. the compound markedly decreased viable bacterial counts at its mics, thus showing strong bactericidal activities. the in vitro activity of hr 810 was not affected by ph or human serum content of agar media, but the activity against gram-negative bacteria was lowered as the inoculum size increased.

TI  == human choriogonadotropin-like material in bacteria of different species: electron microscopy and immunocytochemical studies with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.
AB  == immunocytochemical studies using antisera to whole human choriogonadotropin (hcg), to its alpha- and beta-subunits and to the cooh-terminal peptide of hcg beta, and two monoclonal antibodies to hcg beta, demonstrated expression of hcg-like material, its individual subunits and/or fragments in nine bacterial strains. seven of these were isolated from patients with cancer and were definitely identified as streptococcus faecalis (three strains), staphylococcus haemolyticus (two strains) and staphylococcus epidermidis and escherichia coli (single strains). the other two strains were cell-wall-deficient (cwd) variants,  one identified as streptococcus bovis, isolated from the blood of a patient with  a fever of unknown origin and a possible brain abscess. the other was a gram-negative diphtheroid isolated from the urine of a pregnant woman, which during the period of study reverted to a gram-positive corynebacterium identified as a 'c. ulcerans' strain and expressed the hcg-like factor only during its phase as gram-negative diphtheroid. electron microscopy of these nine strains (including negative controls of strains of the same species subjected to the same immunocytochemical analyses and under identical cultural conditions) revealed morphological alterations in the bacterial cell walls and cytoplasmic material and/or bizarre forms of reproduction in six of the nine strains expressing hcg-like material including the two cwd variants. collectively, these results provided evidence that (1) hcg-producing bacteria isolated from patients with overt cancer are not a new and unique species as claimed by others, and (2) there is a close resemblance between the bacterial protein and the human trophoblastic  hormone, based on immunochemical recognition of different parts of the hcg molecule.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. observation from mic and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of ceftizoxime (czx) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. czx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 0.20 microgram/ml. it was also active against serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes with mic85 of  3.13 micrograms/ml. czx was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml.  czx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. the  reliability of czx disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter  discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of czx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the czx disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of czx, except against p. aeruginosa and e.  faecalis. for the interpretation of czx disc tests, a 3 category system has been  used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows: resistant (r) mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (ms) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == studies of various models of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. a limited number of studies carried out in models of klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. the efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections  has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. most studies of combined therapy in  gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. experiments in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. the enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. with p. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. for both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. these in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.

TI  == in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  == pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. a comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (escherichia coli, indole + proteus spp., enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (klebsiella pneumoniae). pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 100 staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). it was markedly less active against streptococcus faecalis and str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the mic90 being 4 mg/l against both species. overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against p. aeruginosa, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. against e. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. a paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. an optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in  blood of patients treated with this drug.

TI  == bacterial colonization of hemasite access devices.
AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

TI  == infection control during parenteral nutrition therapy.
AB  == parenteral nutrition therapy can achieve an anabolic state in patients who are unable to maintain normal nitrogen balance; however, it may be associated with infectious complications. infections may be related to contamination of the cannula and the cannula wound, of the infusate, or of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. a variety of microorganisms has been associated with these infections. the exact mechanisms that initiate cannula-related infection are poorly understood. susceptibility of the host, the method and site of cannula insertion, colonization of parenteral nutrition cannulas, use of parenteral nutrition systems for multiple purposes, cannula material, and other factors may  all play some role. controlling infections depend on many factors, including quality control processes to ensure sterility of parenteral nutrition solutions,  attention to aseptic technique during cannula insertion, procedures to prevent in-use contamination, proper care of the cannula insertion site, and proper management of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. in addition, infectious complications appear to be reduced by an organized team that follows infection control protocols. many facets of parenteral nutrition therapy are based on data from uncontrolled clinical investigations. well-designed, controlled clinical trials may provide data that will further minimize the risks  associated with parenteral nutrition therapy.

AB  == the growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (hydrodictyon reticulatum, chlorella vulgaris, aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species  of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and  candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators e. coli (faecal indicator), streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). it was found that --hydrodictyon reticulatum and aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in  the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. with respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.

TI  == [causes of the antibacterial action of amniotic fluid (author's transl)].
AB  == the activity of e. coli, group b streptococci, strept. faecalis, stap. epidermidis and staph. aureus in human amniotic fluid was studied. in comparison  to standard i broth an inhibited growth of test organisms was observed. the bacteriostatic effect of amniotic fluid was most significant with staph. epidermidis. we further investigated the causes for this bacterial growth inhibition with staph. epidermidis. we showed that it is independent from the initial number of bacteria as well as from zinc and phosphate content, the phosphate-to-zinc ratio and from the protein content in amniotic fluid samples. it could neither be influenced by heating nor by autoclaving, but was immediately lost by adding standard i both to amniotic fluid samples. in the concentrations we investigated the bacteriostatic effect was independent from the influence of steroid hormones.

TI  == in vitro activity of a new semisynthetic cephalosporin: cefoperazone.
AB  == cefoperazone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with excellent antibacterial activity. this study included more than 1,500 clinical isolates whose susceptibility to cefoperazone was determined by minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc). cefoperazone was highly active against enterobacteriaceae including indolepositive proteus, serratia and  enterobacter sp. particularly noteworthy was the high activity of cefoperazone against pseudomonas and acinetobacter strains, which are usually resistant to first- and second-generation cephalosporins. the activity of cefoperazone against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group d streptococci and haemophilus was also determined. in general, the differences between mic and mbc  were minimal. additional studies were carried out to determine the effect of inoculum size on cefoperazone activity.

TI  == attachment of bacteria to exfoliated cells from the urogenital tract.
AB  == to establish urogenital infections, organisms must adhere to the mucosal lining.  a differential adherence capacity among various bacterial species was observed when exfoliated urethral and urothelial cells were tested in an in vitro system.  no difference in the adherence capacity of a particular species was observed when tested with exfoliated cells obtained from voided urine from different healthy individuals of the same sex. escherichia coli harvested directly from urine specimens of patients with significant bacteriuria showed a significantly higher  capacity to adhere than when obtained from the primary isolation plate. staphylococcus saprophyticus adhered significantly better to urothelial cells than did staphylococcus epidermidis. adherence did not differ when the tests were performed in ultrafiltrated, infected and noninfected urine. variations of the osmolality did not influence the adherence rate of e. coli. gonococci showed an increased capacity to adhere when tested in urine of increasing acidity. gonococci producing t1 colonies adhered by significantly higher numbers per cell  than such bacteria producing t4 colonies.

TI  == iron requirement and chelator production of staphylococci, streptococcus faecalis and enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the effect of iron deprivation on growth of 101 aerobic strains of gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria was studied on agar media in the presence of various concentrations of the synthetic iron chelator ethylene diamine diorthohydroxyphenyl acetic acid (edda) and the iron binding protein transferrin. growth of staphylococcus epidermidis was inhibited by 15 mm edda and 1.5 mm transferrin. staphylococcus aureus was only inhibited by 44 mm edda and not by transferrin. none of the strains of s. faecalis was inhibited. the majority of the enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, salmonella spp, klebsiella spp) was inhibited by 44 mm edda and 1.5 mm transferrin. the relation between susceptibility and concentration of edda and transferrin was expressed as s-value for each species.  iron supply with various iron compounds could restore the effects of inhibition.  in all species except in s. faecalis iron chelator production could be demonstrated, using indicator plates of media containing edda and flooded with 10(4)--10(5) colony forming units of indicator organisms. the iron chelator of both s. epidermidis and s. aureus could stimulate growth of s. epidermidis, but not that of enterobacteriaceae. iron chelators from all gram-negative bacteria were functionally interchangeable, but did not stimulate growth of gram-positive  bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial systems of the surgical wound. ii. detection of antimicrobial protein in cell-free wound fluid.
AB  == human wound fluid contains heat-stable proteins with moderate antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, and different heat-labile proteins with antibacterial activity against e coli. blood serum also contains heat-labile antibacterial substances, but little heat-stable activity against staphylococcus aureus. both blood serum and wound fluid have bacteriostatic activity against s epidermidis, and early growth of streptococcus  fecalis occurs in serum and wound fluids. the concentration or activity of antimicrobial proteins increases during the first week in the fresh wound and then decreases as the wound matures.

TI  == a simplified method using commercial milk powder for hand-rearing of the caesarean-derived infant rabbits (author's transl).
AB  == an efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. the caesarean-derived infant dutch or japanese-white rabbits and their hybrids (f1; japanese-white female x dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, a and b, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (table 2) and  administered intragastrically once a day through a nelaton's catheter. bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. on the third day, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus, and bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. the weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. there was, however, no significant difference milk diet a and b on the weaning rate.

TI  == [bacterial endocarditis: clinical and bacteriological aspects and prognostic factors].
AB  == the microbiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of all (71) cases of bacterial endocarditis admitted to the hopital cantonal, geneva, between august 1970 and october 1974 were reviewed: there was a definite trend towards higher prevalence of acute cases compared to subacute cases. the pathogenic role of s. epidermidis, mostly in cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis, could be demonstrated in several cases. when defined initially by microbiological criteria only, acute endocarditis were characterized by rapid evolution, destruction of the valvular structures (especially aortic valve), and by further evolution under adequate antibiotic therapy: thus, 10/25 patients with acute endocarditis died, whereas the mortality rate in the subacute cases was only 10/46. many cases in our series showed one or more often frequent embolic phenomena: 70% of the cured  cases and 80% of the patients with a fatal outcome. an unfavorable evolution could be correlated with neurologic involvement, cardiac rhythm or conduction disturbances, and/or heart failure; indeed, heart failure due to various mechanisms was the single most frequent cause of death and is presently the main  therapeutic problem. thus, acute infection leading to destruction of the aortic valve and to heart failure still carries a bad prognosis, even if emergency valve replacement is attempted. finally, 22/30 patients who developed a bacterial endocarditis after oral or urological procedures knew about a heart murmur, but did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. this clearly shows that emphasis should be put on the elaboration and diffusion of adequate prophylactic regimens.

TI  == [gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  == we studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing  with other antibiotics. beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci  are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. staph, aureus and staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin,  and no resistant strain to this drug was found. haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, serratia and five species of proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. a few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in e. coli, citrobacerr, serratia, pr. morganii and pr. rettgeri. pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of proteus. antibacterial activity of gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. gentamicin-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.

TI  == relationship of bacterial infection in urine and calculi to canine urolithiasis.
AB  == in 26 dogs treated surgically for urolithiasis, bacteriological examination of the urine and the interior of calculi showed that infection was present in both materials in 14 cases. infection with phosphate calculi, present in 13 of these 14 dogs, was associated with a variety of bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, staph epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and proteus spp. in a follow-up examination of 16 dogs, organisms different from the original isolates were recovered from some cases. the significance of the persistence of viable bacteria within canine bladder calculi is discussed.

TI  == effect of sodium cyanate upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclaer leukocytes.
AB  == sodium cyanate, a drug that prevents sickling of hemoglobin s by virtue of its irreversible carbamylation of the n-terminal amino group of valine, was studied for its effect upon the function of normal human polymorphonuclear luekocytes. in concentrations of 500 and 100 mug/ml, sodium cyanate was found to inhibit killing by neutrophils of staphylococcus epidermidis and eschierichia coli but not of streptococcus faecalis. viability of cells and phagocytosis were not affected by  cyanate; however, production of [14-c] carbon dioxide from [1-14-c] glucose and the iodination of 125-i during phagocytosis were significantly impaired. cyanate  is thought to inbibit the bacterixidal activity of neutrophils by interfering with the oxidative metabolism of gluxose via the hexose monophosphate shunt (theraby decreasing production of h-2-o-2) and by inbibiting iodination of ingested bacteria (either by competing with iodide as the oxidizable cofactor or  by inhibiting myeloperoxidase). since these effects of cyanate were all reversible by washing the nurtrophils free of the drug, it is unlikely that they  are due to amino carbamylation.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that  female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s.  aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective  effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.
