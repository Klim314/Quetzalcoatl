TI  == dynamics, diversity and function of endophytic siderophore-producing bacteria in  rice.
AB  == siderophore production confers to bacteria competitive advantages to colonize plant tissues and to exclude other microorganisms from the same ecological niche. this work shows that the community of endophytic siderophore-producing bacteria (spb) associated to oryza sativa cultivated in uruguayan soils is dynamic and diverse. these bacteria were present in grains, roots, and leaves, and their density fluctuated between log(10) 3.44 and log(10) 5.52 cfu g(-1) fresh weight (fw) during the plant growth. less than 10% of the heterotrophic bacteria produced siderophores in roots and leaves of young plants, but most of the heterotrophic bacteria were siderophore-producers in mature plants. according to  their amplified restriction dna ribosomal analysis (ardra) pattern, 54 of the 109 endophytic spb isolated from different plant tissues or growth stages from replicate plots, were unique. bacteria belonging to the genera sphingomonas, pseudomonas, burkholderia, and enterobacter alternated during plant growth, but the genus pantoea was predominant in roots at tillering and in leaves at subsequent stages. pantoea ananatis was the spb permanently associated to any of  the plant tissues, but the genetic diversity within this species-revealed by box-pcr fingerprinting- showed that different strains were randomly distributed along time and plant tissue, suggesting that a common trait of the species p. ananatis determined the interaction with the rice plant. several isolates were stronger iaa producers than azospirillum brasilense or herbaspirillum seropedicae. in vitro inhibition assays showed that spb of the genus burkholderia were good antagonists of pathogenic fungi and that only one spb isolate of the genus pseudomonas was able to inhibit a. brasilense and h. seropedicae. these results denoted that spb were selected into the rice plant. p. ananatis was the permanent and dominant associated species which was unable to inhibit two of the  relevant plant growth-promoting bacteria.
