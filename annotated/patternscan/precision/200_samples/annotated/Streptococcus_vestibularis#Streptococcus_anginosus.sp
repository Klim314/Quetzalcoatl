TI == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime, with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI == viridans streptococci isolated by culture from blood of cancer patients: clinical and microbiologic analysis of 50 cases.
AB == clinical and microbiologic studies of 50 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients were performed. the bacteria were identified to species level by sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. at least nine streptococcus spp. were found, including s. mitis (25 strains, 50.0% of 50); currently unnamed streptococcus spp. (11 strains); s. parasanguis (five strains); s. anginosus (three strains); s. salivarius (two strains); and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, and s. vestibularis. there were no s. oralis strains. among 11 antibiotics of nine classes tested, no resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, or quinupristin-dalfopristin was seen. resistance to penicillin (mic, 4 to 12 mug/ml) was noted only among s. mitis strains (28.0%, 7/25) and not non-s. mitis strains (0/25) (p = 0.004). significantly more s. mitis strains than non-s. mitis strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones and to > or =3 classes of antibiotics. isolation of quinolone-resistant organisms was associated with the prior usage of quinolones (p = 0.002). quantitative blood cultures showed that the strains resistant to levofloxacin or gatifloxacin were associated with higher colony counts than were their corresponding nonresistant strains. the young and elderly patients also had higher levels of bacteremia caused predominantly by s. mitis. septic shock was present in 17 (34.0% of 50) patients, and 13 of those cases were caused by s. mitis (p = 0.007). these results suggest that s. mitis is the most common cause of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients and is more resistant to antibiotics than other species.

TI == strain-related acid production by oral streptococci.
AB == acid production, in particular at low ph, is thought to be an important ecological determinant in dental caries. the aim of the present study was to determine the acid producing capability at different ph levels of 47 streptococcal strains, representing 9 species, isolated from human dental plaque. the bacteria were grown until mid log-phase under anaerobic conditions and acid production was measured in a ph-stat system at ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0. at all ph values, the mean velocity of acid production (v(ap)) by streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus was significantly higher (p<0.01; anova) than that of the other oral streptococci, including s. mitis, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. intermedius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, and s. vestibularis. however, the v(ap) of some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis, particularly at ph values of 7.0 and 6.0, exceeded that of some strains of s. mutans. the v(ap) decreased with ph for all strains, but some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and strains of the mutans streptococci maintained a relatively high rate of acid production. the results suggest that some strains of s. mitis biovar 1 and s. oralis may play an important role in caries development by modifying the environment in dental plaque to become favourable for the succession of aciduric species. the study furthermore emphasises the need for detailed species and biovar identification of oral streptococci and for recognition of the significant physiological differences that occur within single species.

TI == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15 species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

TI == effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB == it was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  n-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. the ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. when saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with n-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. growth in n-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. no effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. in contrast to what observed with s. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. these results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting s. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.

TI == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s. anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int) fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI == distribution and isolation frequency of eight streptococcal species in saliva from predentate and dentate children and adults.
AB == the isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. the effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups: (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. mutans, and s. gordonii. the mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (cfu) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. streptococci were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal cfu and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. there was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. in contrast to studies using older classifications, s. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). s. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. s. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. s. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI == a scheme for the identification of viridans streptococci.
AB == a collection of strains representing all the currently recognised species of oral or viridans streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, s. parasanguis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. vestibularis, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, s. mutans and s. sobrinus) were tested for the production of a range of glycosidase activities with 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked fluorogenic substrates, and for reactions in a range of conventional fermentation and hydrolytic tests. the resulting biochemical scheme, consisting of 14 tests, enabled the differentiation of all these species and distinguished three biotypes within s. sanguis. the scheme reported here represents an improvement over currently available schemes for the identification of viridans streptococci.

TI == ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase discriminates certain viridans group streptococcal species.
AB == a collection of 144 viridans group streptococcal strains recently characterized as part of a taxonomic study was examined for the ability to bind salivary alpha-amylase. this property was found in most strains of streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis and in occasional strains of streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus salivarius. in contrast, all strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus vestibularis, and streptococcus mutans lacked alpha-amylase-binding capacity. a rapid and easy assay described in this paper may be an important supplementary test for identification of oral streptococci.

TI == sialidase activity of the "streptococcus milleri group" and other viridans group  streptococci.
AB == viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. sialidase was produced by all strains of streptococcus oralis and s. intermedius and by a majority of s. mitis strains. s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, "s. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.
