TI  == infectious granulomatous dermatitis associated with rothia mucilaginosa bacteremia: a case report.
AB  == infections with rare pathogens are being recognized with increasing frequency in  severely immunocompromised patients. as a result of these patients' underlying compromised defenses and susceptibility to atypical organisms, tissue biopsies from patients within this population may demonstrate nonclassical histopathological findings. here, we describe an unusual granulomatous reaction to gram-positive cocci in the skin of a 52-year-old man undergoing salvage chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. the patient presented with a papular eruption on the arms, trunk, and face and fever; concomitant blood cultures were  positive for rothia mucilaginosa and streptococcus salivarius. histologic evaluation revealed a granulomatous dermatitis associated with numerous small, round, predominantly intracellular bacteria. classically, cutaneous infiltrates associated with coccoid bacterial infections are suppurative and not granulomatous. the intracellular organisms stained positive for gram, periodic acid-schiff, and grocott methenamine silver stains, suggestive of r. mucilaginosa. rothia mucilaginosa, a component of the oral flora, was first reported as a human pathogen in 1978. although the majority of cases in the literature have described r. mucilaginosa bacteremia, other reported manifestations include meningitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and peritonitis. to our knowledge, however, only 1 prior report has described a cutaneous manifestation of r. mucilaginosa septicemia, which occurred in a patient with neutropenia. this is the second reported case of an infectious granulomatous dermatitis associated with r. mucilaginosa bacteremia and raises awareness of this unusual histopathological presentation in the setting of a bacterial infection affecting the skin.

TI  == diversity of bacterial populations on the tongue dorsa of patients with halitosis and healthy patients.
AB  == the primary purpose of the present study was to compare the microbial profiles of the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects and subjects with halitosis by using culture-independent molecular methods. our overall goal was to determine the bacterial diversity on the surface of the tongue dorsum as part of our ongoing efforts to identify all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species of the oral cavity. tongue dorsum scrapings were analyzed from healthy subjects with no complaints of halitosis and subjects with halitosis, defined as an organoleptic score of 2 or more and volatile sulfur compound levels greater than 200 ppb. 16s  rrna genes from dna isolated from tongue dorsum scrapings were amplified by pcr with universally conserved bacterial primers and cloned into escherichia coli. typically, 50 to 100 clones were analyzed from each subject. fifty-one strains isolated from the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects were also analyzed. partial sequences of approximately 500 bases of cloned inserts from the 16s rrna genes of isolates were compared with sequences of known species or phylotypes to determine species identity or closest relatives. nearly complete sequences of about 1,500 bases were obtained for potentially novel species or phylotypes. in an analysis of approximately 750 clones, 92 different bacterial species were identified. about half of the clones were identified as phylotypes, of which 29 were novel to the tongue microbiota. fifty-one of the 92 species or phylotypes were detected in more than one subject. those species most associated with healthy subjects were streptococcus salivarius, rothia mucilaginosa, and an uncharacterized species of  eubacterium (strain ftb41). streptococcus salivarius was the predominant species  in healthy subjects, as it represented 12 to 40% of the total clones analyzed from each healthy subject. overall, the predominant microbiota on the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects was different from that on the tongue dorsa of subjects with halitosis. those species most associated with halitosis were atopobium parvulum, a phylotype (clone bs095) of dialister, eubacterium sulci, a phylotype  (clone dr034) of the uncultivated phylum tm7, solobacterium moorei, and a phylotype (clone bw009) of streptococcus: on the basis of our ongoing efforts to  obtain full 16s rrna sequences for all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species  that colonize the oral cavity, there are now over 600 species.
