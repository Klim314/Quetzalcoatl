TI  - Efficacy and safety of intravenous azithromycin followed by oral azithromycin for the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and perihepatitis in Japanese women.
AB  - Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is mainly caused by ascending infection from the vaginal flora including the sexually transmitted organisms, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, and lower genital tract endogenous anaerobes, leading to serious consequences including infertility and ectopic pregnancy. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of azithromycin in the treatment of PID that requires initial intravenous therapy, we conducted a multicenter, unblinded, non-comparative phase 3 trial. Intravenous azithromycin (500 mg, once daily) for 1 or 2 days followed by oral azithromycin (250 mg once daily) to complete a total of 7 days treatment was administered to 60 Japanese women with acute PID. The clinical and bacteriological responses were assessed at the end of treatment, and on Days 15 and 29. The most commonly detected baseline causative pathogens were C. trachomatis (12 strains), Prevotella bivia (10 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (7 strains), N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6 strains each). The clinical success rate on Day 15 was 94.1% (48/51 subjects including perihepatitis). The clinical efficacy and bacterial eradication rates against C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae (including 2 quinolone-resistant strains) were both 100%. Common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea, injection site pain, and nausea. All adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Azithromycin intravenous-to-oral switch therapy demonstrated excellent clinical and bacteriological effects for PID caused by various etiologic agents including quinolone-resistant strains and strains with low susceptibility to azithromycin at in vitro testing. The therapy was well tolerated in the treatment of PID in Japanese women. REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00871494.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of L-cladinose and a C(11)-C(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. We evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. METHODS: In the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against 180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), Finegoldia magna (n = 20), Bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and Prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin A, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. In the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by B. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). RESULTS: In the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of S. agalactiae, E. faecalis, N. gonorrhoeae, P. anaerobius, F. magna, B. fragilis and P. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. Telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. In the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Use of modified norleucine-tyrosine broth in identification of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatography was employed to analyze the volatile and nonvolatile acids produced in modified norleucine-tyrosine (MNT) broth by various gram-positive cocci. The MNT broth consists of 0.5% Trypticase (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), 0.2% L-norleucine, and 0.1% L-tyrosine. The microorganisms included reference strains and clinical isolates of Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. indolicus, P. magnus, and P. prevotii), Staphylococcus spp. (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saccharolyticus), and Streptococcus spp. (S. agalactiae, S. intermedius, S. mutans, S. sanguis I, and S. sanguis II). Only Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strains produced caproic and valeric acids in MNT broth cultures. All 11 P. anaerobius strains produced valeric acid in MNT broth, and only 1 strain failed to produce caproic acid in the medium. This unique feature aids in rapid, reliable identification of P. anaerobius with a minimum number of tests.
