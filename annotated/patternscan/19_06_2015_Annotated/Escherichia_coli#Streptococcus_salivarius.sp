TI  == infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking: a systematic review of reported cases: management, visual outcome, and treatment proposed.
AB  == abstract aim: to describe the infectious complications and the group of pathogens involved in the infection following corneal crosslinking, the visual outcome, and the treatment proposed. methods: a medline (national library of medicine, bethesda, md, usa) search from october 2000 to october 2013 was performed to identify all articles describing infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking treatment. nineteen articles were selected. ten articles reported infectious complications of corneal crosslinking treatment were included. nine articles were excluded, because seven described sterile keratitis, one article was in german, and one reported general complication without describing the infection complication. results: a total number of infections reported included 10 eyes. the infectious keratitis was associated with bacteria in five eyes (50%): gram-positive bacteria in three eyes (30%) (staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus and streptococcus salivarius plus s. oralis, respectively) and gram-negative bacteria in two eyes (20%) (e. coli; p. aeruginosa); there was herpes virus in two eyes, fungus in two eyes (fusarium and microsporidia) (20%),  and acanthamoeba in one eye (10%). conclusions: only 10 cases of infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking are published. the most virulent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa and acanthamoeba. less virulent organisms were escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. two cases of herpes keratitis were described, suggesting the possibility of systemic antiviral prophylaxis before corneal crosslinking treatment. the most common risk factor of infections identified was postoperative incorrect patient behavior.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 during manufacture and storage of white brined cheese.
AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 is a major foodborne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. survival of e. coli o157:h7 during processing and storage of white brined cheese was investigated. cheeses were prepared using pasteurized milk inoculated with a 4 strain e. coli o157:h7 cocktail (7 log(10) cfu/g) with or without yogurt starter culture (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) and stored in 10% or 15% nacl brine at 10 and 21 masculinec for 28 d. nacl concentration, water activity (a(w)), ph,  and numbers of e. coli o157:h7 and lactic acid bacteria (lab) were determined in  cheese and brine. e. coli o157:h7 was able to survive in cheese stored in both brines at 10 and 21 masculinec regardless of the presence of starter lab, although the latter significantly enhanced e. coli o157:h7 reduction in cheese or its brine at 10 masculinec. e. coli o157:h7 numbers were reduced by 2.6 and 3.4 log(10) cfu/g in cheese stored in 10% and 15% nacl brine, respectively, in the presence of starter lab and by 1.4 and 2.3 log(10) cfu/g, respectively, in the absence of starter lab at 10 masculinec. the pathogen survived, but at lower numbers in the brines. the salt concentration of cheese stored in 10% brine remained about 5% during ripening, but in 15% brine, the nacl level increased 1.6% to 8.1% (w/w) by 28 d. values of ph and a(w) slightly decreased 1 d after exposure to brine and reached 5.5 to 6.6 and 0.88 to 0.94, respectively, in all treatments.

TI  == using color histograms and spa-lda to classify bacteria.
AB  == in this work, a new approach is proposed to verify the differentiating characteristics of five bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, and staphylococcus aureus) by using digital images obtained with a simple webcam and variable selection by the  successive projections algorithm associated with linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda). in this sense, color histograms in the red-green-blue (rgb), hue-saturation-value (hsv), and grayscale channels and their combinations were used as input data, and statistically evaluated by using different multivariate classifiers (soft independent modeling by class analogy (simca), principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (pca-lda), partial least squares  discriminant analysis (pls-da) and successive projections algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda)). the bacteria strains were cultivated in a nutritive blood agar base layer for 24 h by following the brazilian pharmacopoeia, maintaining the status of cell growth and the nature of nutrient solutions under the same conditions. the best result in classification was obtained by using rgb and spa-lda, which reached 94 and 100 % of classification accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. this result is extremely positive from the viewpoint of routine clinical analyses, because it avoids bacterial identification based on phenotypic identification of the causative organism using gram staining, culture, and biochemical proofs. therefore, the proposed method presents inherent advantages, promoting a simpler, faster, and low-cost alternative for bacterial identification.

TI  == poultry farm hygiene: microbiological quality assessment of drinking water used in layer chickens managed under the battery cage and deep litter systems at three poultry farms in southwestern nigeria.
AB  == water troughs from deep litter and caged chicken water troughs (drinkers) fixed to each of the different 3-tier cages containing layer chickens in farms a, b and c were subjected to a 7-day study which involved the monitoring of poultry farm hygiene. drinkers were washed before filling with water on day 1. for days 3, 5 and 7 water was served without prior washing. the occurrence and characterization of the bacteria isolates were investigated and data obtained were analyzed and compared. for the bacterial count on day 1, for layer chickens on cage system, no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the farms and between the farms tier interactions. on day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. on day 5, there was significant difference (p<0.05) among the farms and on day 7, there was high significant difference (p < 0.01) among the farms. on days 5 and 7, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) among the tiers nor between the interactions of the farms and tiers. the bacterial count in water troughs of layer chickens in deep litter system, on day 1, had no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. on day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. on days 5 and 7, there were significant difference (p<0.05) and a high significant difference (p < 0.01) between the farms respectively. on days 5 and 7, no significant differences between the water troughs and between the interaction of  the farms and the water troughs. farm a isolates contained staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermis, klebsiella sp., salmonella sp., bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus salivarius and corynebacterium sp. farm b had staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermis, bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis and klebsiella sp. while for farm c, apart from the prevalent bacteria isolates obtained in farms a and b, additional 2 bacterial isolates, lactobacillus salivarius and pseudomonas aeuriginosa were found. in conclusion, water troughs when cleaned on daily basis carry minimum bacterial load. those left for 3, 5 and 7 days uncleaned had progressively high bacterial loads, suggesting that the flock of birds and the consumers of the eggs and meat  from the chickens are at risk of bacterial infection unless strict farm hygiene is ensured through regular monitoring.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == [relationship between ureolytic activity expression of streptococcus salivarius urease genes ureiabcefgd in escherichia coli and nickel ions].
AB  == purpose: to obtain the clone of streptococcus salivarius 57.i urease genes ureiabcefgd and investigate the relationship between ureolytic activity expression of this clone in escherichia coli and nickel ions. methods: the target gene was cloned by polymerase chain reaction in 2 parts separately. then, 2 plasmids were digested by specific restriction enzymes and ligated together. the  obtained plasmids were subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis and transformed  into e.coli tg-1. the recombinant e.coli was added without or with different level of nicl2. the amount of ammonia generated by ureolytic activity of each sample was measured by nessler's assay. spss 17.0 software package was used for correlation analysis. results: the clone of urease genes ureiabcefgd was proved by sequence analysis and blast search. the amount of ammonia generated by the recombinant strain had a positive correlation with the level of nicl2(r=0.9714,p<0.01). when the level of nicl2 was 50 mumol/l, the amount of ammonia reached maximum and would have little variance despite the increase of nicl2 level. conclusions: ureolytic activity expression of ureiabcefgd has a positive correlation with the level of added nicl2 not exceeding 50 mumol/l. the  present clone can be used to further investigate the regulation of the ureolytic  activity expression of streptococcus salivarius urease gene. supported by natural science foundation of shanghai municipality(08zr1416800) and research fund of science and technology committee of shanghai municipality(11411950900).

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == inhibition of candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  == xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of candida albicans. the aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. water extract from the herbaceous plant solidago virgaurea  (goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in s. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and s. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. c. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of c. albicans (four strains), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius or enterococcus faecalis. when inocula were incubated with solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in candida yeast-hyphal transition. candida biofilms were then prepared  in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm  formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. in conclusion, the s. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of c. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.

TI  == discovery of a linear cyclotide from the bracelet subfamily and its disulfide mapping by top-down mass spectrometry.
AB  == cyclotides are heat-stable macrocyclic peptides from plants that display a wide range of biological activities. they can be divided into two subfamilies: mobius  or bracelet, based on the presence or absence of a cis-proline residue in loop 5, respectively. currently, over 150 cyclotides have been discovered, but only four  linear variants of the mobius subfamily have been hitherto isolated. in this study, we report the discovery of two novel cyclotides, hedyotide b1 and hedyotide b2, from the aerial parts of hedyotis biflora. hedyotide b1 has a cyclic cystine knot structure typical of cyclotides. interestingly, hedyotide b2  possesses a linear backbone and is the first linear representative of the bracelet subfamily. disulfide mapping of hedyotide b2 by a top-down ms/ms approach showed that it shares the same knotted disulfide arrangement as conventional cyclotides. its unfolding pathway also showed that the penetrating disulfide bond cys iii-vi is the most stable disulfide linkage. cloning of the gene encoding hedyotide b2 revealed a nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon at the conserved asn residue position, which is essential for an end-to-end backbone ligation. biophysical characterization showed that hedyotide b2 was more susceptible to exopeptidase degradation as compared with hedyotide b1. hedyotide b2 was also inactive against all four tested bacterial strains, whereas hedyotide b1 was bactericidal to escherichia coli and streptococcus salivarius at low micromolar concentration. our results provide a deeper understanding of the structures, functions, and biosynthetic processing of cyclotides and uncyclotides in plants.

TI  == analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  == intramammary infection (imi), also known as mastitis, is the most frequently occurring and economically the most important infectious disease in dairy cattle. this study provides a validation of the analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time pcr-based assay that identifies 11 major pathogen species or species  groups responsible for imi, and a gene coding for staphylococcal beta-lactamase production (penicillin resistance). altogether, 643 culture isolates originating  from clinical bovine mastitis, human, and companion animal samples were analyzed  using the assay. the isolates represented 83 different species, groups, or families, and originated from 6 countries in europe and north america. the analytical specificity and sensitivity of the assay was 100% in bacterial and beta-lactamase identification across all isolates originating from bovine mastitis (n = 454). when considering the entire culture collection (including also the isolates originating from human and companion animal samples), 4 streptococcus pyogenes, 1 streptococcus salivarius, and 1 streptococcus sanguis strain of human origin were identified as streptococcus uberis, and 3 shigella spp. strains were identified as escherichia coli, decreasing specificity to 99% in strep. uberis and to 99.5% in e. coli. these false-positive results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. specificity and sensitivity remained at 100% for all other bacterial targets across the entire culture collection. in conclusion, the real-time pcr assay shows excellent analytical accuracy and holds much promise for use in routine bovine imi testing programs. this study provides the basis for evaluating the assay's diagnostic performance against the conventional bacterial culture method in clinical field trials using  mastitis milk samples.

TI  == reduction in bacterial contamination of toothbrushes using the violight ultraviolet light activated toothbrush sanitizer.
AB  == purpose: this two armed, self-controlled, investigator blinded, clinical study tested the efficacy of an ultraviolet (uv) light toothbrush holder (violight) to  decrease toothbrush bacterial contamination. methods: 25 subjects were randomly assigned to control or experimental groups and received two toothbrushes for home use on either even or odd days. the control group rinsed both toothbrushes after  use in cold tap water with no mechanical manipulation. the experimental group rinsed one toothbrush in cold running water while storing the other toothbrush in the violight toothbrush holder after use. the toothbrushes were returned after 2  weeks use in sealed plastic bags and were analyzed for the number of colony forming units (cfu) of s. mutans, s. salivarius, lactobacilli, e. coli, and other coliforms, and total bacterial counts by culture. an additional analysis of the total bacterial profile was performed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). results: the violight toothbrush holder reduced total cfu by an average of 86% (ancova, p = 0.037). in addition, a tendency was noted for a reduction in total bacterial population as detected by dgge.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == identification of commensal bacterial strains that modulate yersinia enterocolitica and dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory responses: implications for the development of probiotics.
AB  == an increasing body of evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria are effective in  the treatment of enteric infections, although the molecular basis of this activity remains elusive. to identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of yersinia-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis in mice. the commensal bacteria escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, and streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity for host epithelial cells (ec), and the strains were tested for their ability to  inhibit y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation. additionally, b. adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with y. enterocolitica and  to mice with mucosae impaired by dss treatment. none of the commensal bacteria tested was toxic for or invaded the ec. b. adolescentis, b. distasonis, b. vulgatus, and s. salivarius inhibited the y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation and interleukin-8 production in ec. in line with these findings, b. adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mrna expression, and  loss of body weight upon oral infection with y. enterocolitica. in addition, the  administration of b. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon dss treatment in  mice. we suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == probiotic therapy of intestinal inflammation and infections.
AB  == purpose of review: the author presents evidence published during the past year regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and infections by probiotic agents. recent findings: normal commensal bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal inflammation, particularly crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. combinations of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation, whereas escherichia coli nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis. several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. use of probiotics in crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. animal models demonstrate marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. probiotics have multiple  mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth, binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). although multiple probiotic  species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro, their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. summary: probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger, controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses; combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic  conditions.

AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == biochemical and molecular characterization of a levansucrase from lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 employs a fructosyltransferase (ftf) to synthesize a fructose polymer [a fructan of the levan type, with beta(2-->6) linkages] from sucrose or raffinose. purification of this ftf (a levansucrase), and identification of peptide amino acid sequences, allowed isolation of the first lactobacillus levansucrase gene (lev), encoding a protein (lev) consisting  of 804 amino acids. lev showed highest similarity with an inulosucrase of l. reuteri 121 [inu; producing an inulin polymer with beta(2-->1)-linked fructosyl units] and with ftfs from streptococci. expression of lev in escherichia coli resulted in an active ftf (lev delta 773his) that produced the same levan polymer [with only 2-3 % beta(2-->1-->6) branching points] as l. reuteri 121 cells grown  on raffinose. the low degree of branching of the l. reuteri levan is very different from bacterial levans known up to now, such as that of streptococcus salivarius, having up to 30 % branches. although lev is unusual in showing a higher hydrolysis than transferase activity, significant amounts of levan polymer are produced both in vivo and in vitro. lev is strongly dependent on ca(2+) ions  for activity. unique properties of l. reuteri lev together with inu are: (i) the  presence of a c-terminal cell-wall-anchoring motif causing similar expression problems in escherichia coli, (ii) a relatively high optimum temperature for activity for ftf enzymes, and (iii) at 50 degrees c, kinetics that are best described by the hill equation.

TI  == the csp operon of streptococcus salivarius encodes two predicted cell-surface proteins, one of which, cspb, is associated with the fimbriae.
AB  == a tn917 mutant library was generated to identify genes involved in the biogenesis of streptococcus salivarius fimbriae. a fimbria-deficient mutant was isolated by  negative selection using an immunomagnetic separation technique with specific anti-fimbriae polyclonal antibodies (pabs). the transposon was inserted in an orf, called orf176, which encoded a protein of unknown function. the transposon prevented the transcription of orf176 as well as two genes located downstream, which are designated cspa and cspb and which form the csp operon. sequence analyses of cspa and cspb revealed that both proteins possessed the classic cell-wall-anchoring motif (lpxtg) of gram-positive bacterial surface proteins. recombinant cspa (rcspa) and cspb (rcspb) proteins were generated in escherichia  coli and used to produce pabs. immunolocalization experiments showed that anti-rcspb, but not anti-rcspa antibodies specifically recognized s. salivarius fimbriae. our results suggested that the csp operon encoded predicted cell-surface proteins, one of which, cspb, was associated with the fimbriae.

AB  == streptococcus salivarius methionine aminopeptidase (metap) was purified from a recombinant escherichia coli strain containing the s. salivarius map gene, which  codes for metap. s. salivarius map coded for a protein of 286 amino acids with a  calculated molecular mass of 31,723 da and a pi of 4.6. the native enzyme eluted  from a superdex column as a protein with a molecular mass of 30.6 kda and cleaved n-terminal met of peptide only when the penultimate amino acid was gly, ala, ser, val, pro, or thr. the enzyme was more active against tetrapeptides than tripeptides and did not recognize dipeptides. it required the presence of a metal cation for activity, with a preference for co(2+) over mn(2+). s. salivarius metap has a ph optimum of 8.0 and an optimal temperature at 50 degrees c. the s.  salivarius protein had an extra sequence of 24 amino acids between two conserved  aspartate residues involved in the coordination of the metal ion. a similar extra sequence is present in metap from other streptococci and from lactococcus lactis, but not from other bacteria or eukaryotes.

TI  == viridans streptococcus bacteremia in children on chemotherapy for cancer: an underestimated problem.
AB  == the authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. they retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between october 1995 and january 1999. viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. the majority of the isolates were streptococcus mitis (55%). others were s. sanguis (25%), s. oralis (12.5%), s. salivarius (5%), and s. acidominimus (2.5%). twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest x-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. this study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

TI  == phosphorylation of streptococcus salivarius lactose permease (lacs) by hpr(his ~  p) and hpr(ser-p)(his ~ p) and effects on growth.
AB  == the oral bacterium streptococcus salivarius takes up lactose via a transporter called lacs that shares 95% identity with the lacs from streptococcus thermophilus, a phylogenetically closely related organism. s. thermophilus releases galactose into the medium during growth on lactose. expulsion of galactose is mediated via lacs and stimulated by phosphorylation of the transporter by hpr(his approximately p), a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (pts). unlike s. thermophilus, s. salivarius grew on lactose without expelling galactose and took  up galactose and lactose concomitantly when it is grown in a medium containing both sugars. analysis of the c-terminal end of s. salivarius lacs revealed a iia-like domain (iia(lacs)) almost identical to the iia domain of s. thermophilus lacs. experiments performed with purified proteins showed that s. salivarius iia(lacs) was reversibly phosphorylated on a histidine residue at position 552 not only by hpr(his approximately p) but also by hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p), a doubly phosphorylated form of hpr present in large amounts in rapidly growing s. salivarius cells. two other major s. salivarius pts proteins, iiab(l)(man) and iiab(h)(man), were unable to phosphorylate iia(lacs). the effect of lacs phosphorylation on growth was studied with strain g71, an s. salivarius enzyme i-negative mutant that cannot synthesize hpr(his approximately p) or hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p). these results indicated that (i) the wild-type and mutant strains had identical generation times on lactose, (ii) neither strain expelled galactose during growth on lactose, (iii) both strains metabolized lactose and galactose concomitantly when grown in a medium containing both sugars, and (iv) the growth of the mutant was slightly reduced on galactose.

TI  == inhibition of adhesion of yeasts and bacteria by poly(ethylene oxide)-brushes on  glass in a parallel plate flow chamber.
AB  == poly(ethylene oxide) (peo)-brushes are generally recognized as protein-repellent  surfaces, and although a role in discouraging microbial adhesion has been established for some strains and species, no study exists on the effects of peo-brushes on a large variety of bacterial and yeast strains. in this paper, a peo-brush has been covalently attached to glass and silica by reaction in a polymer melt. subsequently, the presence of a peo-brush was demonstrated using contact angle measurements, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry. for five bacterial (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two yeast strains (candida albicans and candida tropicalis), adhesion to peo-brushes  was compared with adhesion to bare glass in a parallel plate flow chamber. the initial deposition rates of sta. epidermidis, sta. aureus and str. salivarius to  glass were relatively high, between 2400 and 2600 cm(-2) s(-1), while e. coli and p. aeruginosa deposited much more slowly. the initial deposition rates of the yeasts to glass were 144 and 444 cm(-2) s(-1) for c. albicans gb 1/2 and c. tropicalis gb 9/9, respectively. coating of the glass surface with a peo-brush yielded more than 98 % reduction in bacterial adhesion, although for the more hydrophobic p. aeruginosa a smaller reduction was observed. for both yeast species adhesion suppression was less effective than for the bacteria and here too the more hydrophobic c. tropicalis showed less reduction than the more hydrophilic c. albicans. the peo-brush had a thickness of 22 nm in water, as inferred from ellipsometry. assuming that on bare glass the adhered micro-organisms are positioned only a few nanometers away from the surface and that the brush keeps them at a distance of 22 nm, it is calculated that the brush yields a sevenfold attenuation of the lifshitz-van der waals attraction to the surface between the micro-organisms and the surface. decreased lifshitz-van der waals attraction may be responsible for the suppression of the microbial adhesion observed.

TI  == palmitoleic acid isomer (c16:1delta6) in human skin sebum is effective against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the percent lipid composition of pooled human sebum analyzed by thin-layer chromatography was: ceramides (13%), fatty acid (47%), cholesterol (7%), cholesterol esters (2%), squalene (11%), triglycerides (3%), and wax esters (17%). total sebum lipids (2- 4 mg/ml), sonicated into bacterial culture medium,  caused 4- to 5-fold log reduction in growth of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius and the anaerobe fusobacterium nucleatum, but was ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. fractionation of the sebum lipids showed that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contained the bulk of the antimicrobial activity. lauric acid (c12:0) was the most active saturated fatty acid. the unsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (c16:1delta6, cpa) was both the most predominant monoene and the most active antimicrobial fatty acid. purified cpa (>99%) yielded typical minimal inhibitory  concentration (mic) values of 10-20 microg/ml against gram-positive bacteria. organically synthesized cpa isomer gave mic values comparable to the natural material. both natural and synthetic cpa were found to be the most active sebum lipid fraction in blocking the adherence of a pathogenic strain of candida albicans to porcine stratum corneum. ethanol in combination with cpa exerts a synergistic bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and  several methacillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. palmitoleic acid may be useful in topical formulations for treatment of secondary gram-positive bacterial infections, as a gram-positive bacteria antimicrobial in wound dressings, and as  a natural gram-positive antimicrobial preservative in skin and hair care products.

TI  == diversity of bacterial populations on the tongue dorsa of patients with halitosis and healthy patients.
AB  == the primary purpose of the present study was to compare the microbial profiles of the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects and subjects with halitosis by using culture-independent molecular methods. our overall goal was to determine the bacterial diversity on the surface of the tongue dorsum as part of our ongoing efforts to identify all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species of the oral cavity. tongue dorsum scrapings were analyzed from healthy subjects with no complaints of halitosis and subjects with halitosis, defined as an organoleptic score of 2 or more and volatile sulfur compound levels greater than 200 ppb. 16s  rrna genes from dna isolated from tongue dorsum scrapings were amplified by pcr with universally conserved bacterial primers and cloned into escherichia coli. typically, 50 to 100 clones were analyzed from each subject. fifty-one strains isolated from the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects were also analyzed. partial sequences of approximately 500 bases of cloned inserts from the 16s rrna genes of isolates were compared with sequences of known species or phylotypes to determine species identity or closest relatives. nearly complete sequences of about 1,500 bases were obtained for potentially novel species or phylotypes. in an analysis of approximately 750 clones, 92 different bacterial species were identified. about half of the clones were identified as phylotypes, of which 29 were novel to the tongue microbiota. fifty-one of the 92 species or phylotypes were detected in more than one subject. those species most associated with healthy subjects were streptococcus salivarius, rothia mucilaginosa, and an uncharacterized species of  eubacterium (strain ftb41). streptococcus salivarius was the predominant species  in healthy subjects, as it represented 12 to 40% of the total clones analyzed from each healthy subject. overall, the predominant microbiota on the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects was different from that on the tongue dorsa of subjects with halitosis. those species most associated with halitosis were atopobium parvulum, a phylotype (clone bs095) of dialister, eubacterium sulci, a phylotype  (clone dr034) of the uncultivated phylum tm7, solobacterium moorei, and a phylotype (clone bw009) of streptococcus: on the basis of our ongoing efforts to  obtain full 16s rrna sequences for all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species  that colonize the oral cavity, there are now over 600 species.

AB  == growth and survival of a nontoxigenic strain of escherichia coli o157:h7 (atcc 43888) was determined in traditionally fermented pasteurized milk. preheated milk was inoculated with 1% (v/v) of a mixed culture of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (ncimb 11778) and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (ncimb 110368) and incubated at 25, 30, 37 or 43 degrees c for 24 h. e. coli o157:h7 (10(5) cfu/ml) were introduced into the milk pre- and post-fermentation. fermented milk samples were subsequently stored at either 4 degrees c (refrigerator temperature) or 25 degrees c (to mimic african ambient temperature) for 5 days. after 24 h of fermentation, the ph of the samples fermented at the higher temperatures of 37-43 degrees c decreased from 6.8 to 4.4-4.0 ( +/- 0.2) whereas at the lower temperature of 25 degrees c, the ph decreased to ph 5.0 +/-  0.1. during this period, viable counts for e. coli o157:h7 increased from 10(5) to 10(8) - 10(9) cfu/ml except in milk fermented at 43 degrees c wherein viability declined to 10(4) cfu/ml. in fermented (25-30 degrees c) milk stored at 4 degrees c for 5 days, e. coli o157:h7 viability decreased from 10(8-9) to 10(6-7) cfu/ml whereas milk fermented at 43 degrees c resulted in loss of detectable cells. in contrast, storage of fermented milk samples at 25 degrees c  for 5 days eventually resulted in complete loss of viability irrespective of fermentation temperature. stationary phase e. coli o157:h7 inoculated post-fermentation (25 and 43 degrees c) survived during 4 degrees c storage, but  not 25 degrees c storage. fermentation temperature and subsequent storage temperature are critical to the growth and survival of e. coli o157:h7 in traditional fermented products involving yoghurt starter cultures.

TI  == prevalent bacterial species and novel phylotypes in advanced noma lesions.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16s ribosomal dna bacterial genes from dna isolated from advanced noma lesions of four nigerian children were pcr amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into escherichia coli. partial 16s rrna sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine  species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. a total of 67 bacterial  species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including propionibacterium acnes,  staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. other known species that were detected included achromobacter spp., afipia spp., brevundimonas diminuta, capnocytophaga spp., cardiobacterium sp., eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium spp., gemella haemoylsans, and neisseria spp. phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera eubacterium, flavobacterium, kocuria, microbacterium, and porphyromonas and the related streptococcus salivarius and genera sphingomonas and treponema: since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. however, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.

TI  == role of the c-terminal yg repeats of the primer-dependent streptococcal glucosyltransferase, gtfj, in binding to dextran and mutan.
AB  == the recombinant primer-dependent glucosyltransferase gtfj of streptococcus salivarius possesses a c-terminal glucan-binding domain composed of eighteen 21 aa yg repeats. by engineering a series of c-terminal truncated proteins, the position at which truncation prevented further mutan synthesis was defined to a region of 43 aa, confirming that not all of the yg motifs were required for the formation of mutan by gtfj. the role of the yg repeats in glucan binding was investigated in detail. three proteins consisting of 3.8, 7.2 or 11.0 c-terminal  yg repeats were expressed in escherichia coli. each of the three purified proteins bound to both the 1,6-alpha-linked glucose residues of dextran and the 1,3-alpha-linked glucose residues of mutan, indicating that a protein consisting  of nothing but 3.8 yg repeats could attach to either substrate. secondary structure predictions of the primary amino acid sequence suggested that 37% of the amino acids were capable of forming a structure such that five regions of beta-sheet were separated by regions capable of forming beta-turns and random coils. cd spectral analysis showed that the purified 3.8 yg protein possessed an  unordered secondary structure with some evidence of possible beta-sheet formation and that the protein maintained this relatively unordered structure on binding to dextran.

TI  == galactose and lactose genes from the galactose-positive bacterium streptococcus salivarius and the phylogenetically related galactose-negative bacterium streptococcus thermophilus: organization, sequence, transcription, and activity of the gal gene products.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is a lactose- and galactose-positive bacterium that is phylogenetically closely related to streptococcus thermophilus, a bacterium that  metabolizes lactose but not galactose. in this paper, we report a comparative characterization of the s. salivarius and s. thermophilus gal-lac gene clusters.  the clusters have the same organization with the order galr (codes for a transcriptional regulator and is transcribed in the opposite direction), galk (galactokinase), galt (galactose-1-p uridylyltransferase), gale (udp-glucose 4-epimerase), galm (galactose mutarotase), lacs (lactose transporter), and lacz (beta-galactosidase). an analysis of the nucleotide sequence as well as northern  blotting and primer extension experiments revealed the presence of four promoters located upstream from galr, the gal operon, galm, and the lac operon of s. salivarius. putative promoters with virtually identical nucleotide sequences were found at the same positions in the s. thermophilus gal-lac gene cluster. an additional putative internal promoter at the 3' end of galt was found in s. thermophilus but not in s. salivarius. the results clearly indicated that the gal-lac gene cluster was efficiently transcribed in both species. the shine-dalgarno sequences of galt and gale were identical in both species, whereas the ribosome binding site of s. thermophilus galk differed from that of s. salivarius by two nucleotides, suggesting that the s. thermophilus galk gene might be poorly translated. this was confirmed by measurements of enzyme activities.

AB  == background and objective: biomaterials that come into contact with microorganisms in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses should be tested before clinical application. thus, it is necessary to test the influence exerted on bacterial growth by biomaterials used as bone substitutes in head and neck surgery before implantation. patients and methods: in this study, bioverit, al2o3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and candida albicans. results: in the suspension test, all gram-negative species were inhibited, but gram-positive microorganisms and candida albicans were not affected. the al2o3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. streptococcus  pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. in contrast, bioverit and al2o3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. conclusions: in conclusion, we think that bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.

TI  == regulation of the pts operon in low g+c gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the sugar transport system called phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase (pts) is widespread among eubacteria. its is generally composed of two cytoplasmic proteins, hpr and el, which are found in all bacteria possessing a pts, and a family of ells whose number, specificity, and molecular structure in terms of domain arrangement vary from species to species. in low g+c gram-positive bacteria, the genes coding for the general proteins hpr and el, designated ptsh and ptsl respectively, are organized into the pts operon. in this paper, we summarize current knowledge about the regulation of the pts operon in low g+c gram-positive bacteria. physiological data indicate that el and most particularly hpr make up a substantial proportion of cellular proteins. their synthesis is not coordinated and is influenced by environmental factors. the principal dna cis-elements involved in the regulation of pts operon transcription are a strong promoter whose sequence and structure are very similar to those of the canonical promoter recognized by the escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis major rna polymerases, a 5'-untranslated region, a rho-dependent terminator located at the 5' end of ptsl, and an intrinsic terminator located downstream from ptsl. analysis of ptsh and ptsl shine-dalgarno sequences as well as experimental results obtained with a streptococcus salivarius mutant suggest that the expression of hpr and el is also controlled at the translation level.

TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == the gene encoding iiab(man)l in streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-pts (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic iiab protein, called iiab(man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. this paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the  specific components of the mannose-pts of streptococcus salivarius. the man operon was composed of four genes, manl, manm, mann and mano. these genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mrna that contained a 5'-utr (untranslated region). the predicted manl gene product encoded a 35.5 kda protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the iia and  iib phosphorylation sites already determined from purified s. salivarius iiab(man)l. expression of manl in escherichia coli generated a 35 kda protein that reacted with anti-iiab(man)l antibodies. the predicted manm protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kda. manm had similarity with iic domains of the mannose-eii family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-iic proteins from gram-negative bacteria. from multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified iic(man) signature is proposed: gx3g[dnh]x3g[livm]2xg2[stl][lt][eq]. the deduced product of mann was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kda. the mann protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the iid domains of the mannose-eii family. mano encoded a 13.7 kda protein. this gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mrna from a promoter located in the mann-mano intergenic region. a search of current databases revealed the presence of iiab(man)l, manm, mann and mano orthologues in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. this work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose pts in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (mano) within the man operon.

TI  == mutation of aspartic acid residues in the fructosyltransferase of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975.
AB  == the site-directed mutated fructosyltransferases (ftfs) of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975, d312e, d312s, d312n and d312k were all active at 37 degrees c, indicating that asp-312 present in the 'sucrose box' was not the nucleophilic asp residue responsible for the formation of a covalent fructosyl-enzyme intermediate required for enzyme activity. analysis of the kinetic constants of the purified mutated forms of the enzyme showed that asp-312 was most likely an essential amino acid involved in determining acceptor recognition and/or stabilizing a beta-turn in the protein. in contrast, when the  asp-397 of the ftf present in the conserved triplet rdp motif of all 60 bacterial and plant family-32 glycosylhydrolases was mutated to a ser residue, both sucrose hydrolysis and polymerization ceased. tryptophan emission spectra confirmed that  this mutation did not alter protein structure. comparison of published data from  other site-directed mutated enzymes implicated the asp residue in the rdp motif as the one that may form a transient covalent fructosyl intermediate during the catalysis of sucrose by the ftf of s. salivarius.

TI  == purification and enzymic properties of the fructosyltransferase of streptococcus  salivarius atcc 25975.
AB  == the recombinant fructosyltransferase (ftf) of streptococcus salivarius was expressed in escherichia coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity after a combination of adsorption, ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. the n-terminal signal sequence of the ftf was removed by e. coli at the same site as  in its natural host. the purified ftf exhibited maximum activity at ph 6.0 and 37 degrees c, was activated by ca2+, but inhibited by the metal ions cu2+, zn2+, hg2+ and fe3+. the enzyme catalysed the transfer of the fructosyl moiety of sucrose to a number of acceptors, including water, glucose and sucrose via a ping pong mechanism involving a fructosyl-enzyme intermediate. while this mechanism of catalysis is utilized by the levansucrases of bacillus subtilis and acetobacter diazotrophicus and the values of the kinetic constants for the three enzymes are  similar, sucrose was a far more efficient fructosyl-acceptor for the ftf of s. salivarius than for the two other enzymes.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of various endodontic irrigants on selected microorganisms.
AB  == aim: this study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial effect of various endodontic irrigants against six selected microorganisms. methodology: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, str. pyogenes, escherichia coli and candida albicans were included in the study. pre-sterilized whatman paper discs, 6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar petri plates.  each plate was incubated aerobically. a zone of inhibition was recorded for each  plate and the results were analysed statistically. results: 5.25% naocl was effective against all test microorganisms with a substantial zone of inhibition.  saline was always ineffective. decreased concentration of naocl significantly reduced its antimicrobial effect. cresophene showed a significantly larger (p < 0.05) average zone of inhibition compared to the other experimental irrigants. alcohol had smaller but not significantly different zones of inhibition than chlorhexidine. conclusions: 5.25% naocl was superior in its antimicrobial abilities compared with other irrigants used. a reduced concentration of naocl (0.5%) resulted in significantly decreased antimicrobial effects. when compared with 21% alcohol, 0.5% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine, paramonochlorophenol (cresophene) showed a greater antimicrobial effect.

TI  == cell wall anchoring of the streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. based on the observation that the c-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (lab). the emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing lactobacillus fermentum strain,  lactobacillus sake, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. the m6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. in lactobacilli, essentially all detectable m6 protein was cell wall associated. these results suggest the feasibility of using the c-terminal anchor moiety of m6 for protein surface display in lab.

AB  == the effect of streptococcus sanguis, s. salivarius, escherichia coli and porphyromonas gingivalis on the adhesion of candida albicans and c. krusei to human buccal epithelial cells (bec) was investigated with a modified membrane filter system. the filters (12 microns diameter pores) acted as a support for the bec which were pre-exposed to known concentrations of bacterial suspensions (for  45 min-1 h), and then re-incubated with standardised concentrations of yeast suspensions for various periods. the bec with adherent yeasts were then transferred on to a glass slide, gram-stained and counted by light microscopy. three of the four bacterial species significantly suppressed adhesion of c. albicans to bec; s. sanguis had no effect. both s. sanguis and s. salivarius suppressed adhesion of c. krusei to bec pre-exposed to three different bacterial  concentrations, although variable results were obtained with p. gingivalis and e. coli. significant differences in the relative adhesion of c. albicans and c. krusei to bec were also recorded. these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to bec is modulated both by the composition and the quantity of the pre-existing bacterial flora on the bec.

AB  == the effect of four different species of oral bacteria (streptococci (x 2); escherichia; porphyromonas) on the adhesion of candida albicans and candida krusei to denture acrylic surfaces was studied using a previously described in vitro adhesion assay. clear acrylic strips immersed in known concentrations of bacterial suspensions and incubated for 45 min to 1 h, at 37 degrees c, were transferred to yeast suspensions of known concentrations and incubated for a similar period, and the adherent yeasts were quantified using an image analysis system. pre-exposure to different bacterial concentrations resulted in suppression of candidal adhesion to varying degrees. of three selected concentrations, exposure to the highest bacterial concentration (10(6) organisms/ml) resulted in a consistent reduction in candidal adhesion, except for e. coli-c. albicans and s. salivarius-c. albicans combinations. candidal adhesion was significantly reduced on pre-exposure to s. sanguis and p. gingivalis, but not e. coli. there were also significant differences in relative adhesion between c. albicans and c. krusei. taken together, these results indicate that the adhesion of yeasts to acrylic strips is modulated both by the quantity and the quality of pre-existing bacterial flora on acrylic surfaces.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius urease: genetic and biochemical characterization and expression in a dental plaque streptococcus.
AB  == the hydrolysis of urea by urease enzyme of oral bacteria is believed to have a major impact on oral microbial ecology and to be intimately involved in oral health and diseases. to begin to understand the biochemistry and genetics of oral ureolysis, a study of the urease of streptococcus salivarius, a highly ureolytic  organism which is present in large numbers on the soft tissues of the oral cavity, has been initiated. by using as a probe a 0.6-kpb internal fragment of the s. salivarius 57.i urec gene, two clones from subgenomic libraries of s. salivarius 57.i in an escherichia coli plasmid vector were identified. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of one partial and six complete open reading frames which were most homologous to ureiab-cefgd of other ureolytic bacteria. plasmid clones were generated to construct a complete gene cluster and  used to transform e. coli and streptococcus gordonii dl1, a nonureolytic, dental  plaque microorganism. the recombinant organisms expressed high levels of urease activity when the growth medium was supplemented with nicl2. the urease enzyme was purified from e. coli, and its biochemical properties were compared with those of the urease produced by s. salivarius and those of the urease produced by s. gordonii carrying the plasmid-borne ure genes. in all cases, the enzyme had a  km of 3.5 to 4.1 mm, a ph optimum near 7.0, and a temperature optimum near 60 degrees c. s. gordonii carrying the urease genes was then demonstrated to have a  significant capacity to temper glycolytic acidification in vitro in the presence  of concentrations of urea commonly found in the oral cavity. the ability to genetically engineer plaque bacteria that can modulate environmental ph through ureolysis will open the way to using recombinant ureolytic organisms to test hypotheses regarding the role of oral ureolysis in dental caries, calculus formation, and periodontal diseases. such recombinant organisms may eventually prove useful for controlling dental caries by replacement therapy.

AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the four recombinant glucosyltransferases (gtfs), gtfj, gtfk, gtfl and gtfm, that had previously been cloned from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975, were individually expressed in escherichia coli and their glucan products and kinetic  properties were analysed. gtfj was a primer-dependent gtf which synthesized an insoluble glucan composed mainly of alpha-(1-->3)-linked glucosyl residues in the presence of dextran t-10. gtfk was primer-stimulated, and produced a linear soluble dextran without any detectable branch points both in the absence and in the presence of dextran t-10. gtfl was primer-independent and produced a mixed-linkage insoluble glucan composed of approximately equal proportions of alpha-(1-->3)- and alpha-(1-->6)-linked glucosyl residues. gtfl was inhibited by  dextran t-10. gtfm was primer-independent and produced a soluble dextran with approximately 5% alpha-(1-->3)-linked glucosyl residues. gtfm was essentially unaffected by the presence of dextran t-10. the results confirmed that each enzyme represented one of the four possible combinations of primer-dependency and product solubility and that each possessed unique biosynthetic properties. the soluble dextrans formed by gtfk and gtfm, as well as the mixed-linkage insoluble  glucan formed by gtfl, were also capable of acting as primers for the primer-dependent gtfj and the primer-stimulated gtfk. unexpectedly, the linear dextran produced by gtfk was by far the least effective either at priming itself  or at activating and priming the primer-dependent gtfj.

AB  == we report the sequencing of a 2,019-bp region of the streptococcus mutans ng5 genome which contains a 1,428-bp open reading frame (orf) whose putative translation product had 50% identity to the amino acid sequences of the nonphosphorylating, nadp-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (gapn) from maize and pea. this orf is located approximately 200 bp downstream of the ptsi gene coding for enzyme i of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system. mutant bch150, in which the putative gapn gene had been inactivated, lacked gapn activity that was present in the wild-type strain, thus positively identifying the orf as the s. mutans gapn gene. another strain of s. mutans, dc10, which contains an insertionally inactivated ptsi gene, still possessed gapn activity, as did s. salivarius atcc 25975, which contains an insertion element between the ptsi and gapn genes. since the wild-type s. mutans  ng5 lacks both glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and nadh:nadp oxidoreductase activities, the nadp-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is important as a means of generating nadph for biosynthetic reactions.

TI  == distribution of proteins similar to iiimanh and iiimanl of the streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins ei and hpr, the specific membrane-bound iiiman, and two  forms of a protein called iiiman, with molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and  35,200 (iiimanl), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the  membrane. several lines of evidence suggest that iiimanh and/or iiimanl are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. to determine whether other bacteria  possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. three approaches were used to determine whether the iiiman proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-iiimanh and anti-iiimanh rabbit  polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of pep-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-iiiman antibodies of the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. only the species s. salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of iiiman. fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. in the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of pep. no such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. a iii(man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in lactobacillus casei by western blot experiments as well as by pep-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-iii(man) antibodies was detected in lactococcus lactis. in several cases, the involvement  of these putative iii(man) proteins in the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-iii(man) antibodies. no proteins cross-reacting with anti-iii(man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and e. coli. in s. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. this protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of pep.

TI  == identification of intracellular amylase activity in streptococcus bovis and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis has been demonstrated to produce an extracellular amylase activity. we previously reported on the cloning of a gene from s. bovis encoding for what was initially believed to be the extracellular amylase. dna sequence analyses indicated that the amylase produced by the cloned  gene did not match the n-terminus amino acid sequence of the purified extracellular amylase and contained no apparent leader sequence for secretion. analyses of crude extracts demonstrated the presence of an intracellular amylase  in s. bovis jb1 that differed in molecular weight (56,000) from that of the extracellular amylase (70,000). the 56,000 molecular weight amylase was identical to the amylase produced by escherichia coli containing the cloned amylase gene. low levels of intracellular amylase activity were also detected in other strains  of s. bovis and also streptococcus salivarius. introduction of the plasmid pva838 containing the cloned amylase gene into s. bovis and s. sanguis resulted in enhanced intracellular amylase production by both organisms. the amylase gene has been sequenced, and analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence for the amylase indicates a high degree of similarity with secreted amylases from bacillus species.

TI  == direct screening of recombinants in gram-positive bacteria using the secreted staphylococcal nuclease as a reporter.
AB  == a system for direct screening of recombinant clones in lactococcus lactis, based  on secretion of the staphylococcal nuclease (snase) in the organism, was developed. the nuc gene (encoding snase) was cloned on both rolling-circle and theta-replicating plasmids. l. lactis strains containing these nuc+ plasmids secrete snase and are readily detectable by a simple plate test. a multicloning site (mcs) was introduced just after the cleavage site between leader peptide and the mature snase, without affecting nuclease activity. cloning foreign dna fragments into any site of the mcs interrupts nuc and thus results in nuc mutant  clones which are easily distinguished fron nuc+ clones on plates. the utility of  this system for l. lactis was demonstrated by cloning an antibiotic resistance marker and escherichia coli chromosomal dna fragments into the mcs of the nucmcs  cassette. both cloning vectors containing the nucmcs cassette were also introduced into streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, in which direct screening of nuc mutant recombinant clones was also achieved. the potential uses  of nuc as a secretion reporter system are discussed.

TI  == sequence and expression of the genes for hpr (ptsh) and enzyme i (ptsi) of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase transport system from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == we report the sequencing of a 2,242-bp region of the streptococcus mutants ng5 genome containing the genes for ptsh and ptsi, which encode hpr and enzyme i (ei), respectively, of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase transport system. the sequence was obtained from two cloned overlapping genomic fragments; one expresses hpr and a truncated ei, while the other expresses a full-length ei in escherichia coli, as determined by western immunoblotting. the  ptsi gene appeared to be expressed from a region located in the ptsh gene. the s. mutans ng5 pts operon does not appear to be linked to other phosphotransferase transport system proteins as has been found in other bacteria. a positive fermentation pattern on macconkey-glucose plates by an e. coli ptsi mutant harboring the s. mutans ng5 ptsi gene on a plasmid indicated that the s. mutans ng5 ei can complement a defect in the e. coli gene. this was confirmed by protein phosphorylation experiments with 32p-labeled phosphoenolpyruvate indicating phosphotransfer from the s. mutans ng5 ei to the e. coli hpr. two forms of the cloned ei, both truncated to varying degrees in the c-terminal region, were inefficiently phosphorylated and unable to complement fully the ptsi defect in the e. coli mutant. the deduced amino acid sequence of hpr shows a high degree of homology, particularly around the active site, to the same protein from other gram-positive bacteria, notably, s. salivarius, and to a lesser extent with those of gram-negative bacteria. the deduced amino acid sequence of s. mutans ng5 ei also shares several regions of homology with other sequenced eis, notably, with the region around the active site, a region that contains the only conserved cystidyl residue among the various proteins and which may be involved in substrate binding.

AB  == tachyplesin i, a polycationic antimicrobial peptide isolated from hemocytes of horseshoe crabs, kills bacteria by disrupting the membrane potential of the cytoplasmic membrane. the present study shows that, among 36 oral streptococcal strains, 12 of 21 streptococcus sanguis, 3 streptococcus mutans, 9 streptococcus  salivarius and 3 streptococcus milleri strains were susceptible to tachyplesin i, whereas 9 s. sanguis strains were resistant. interestingly, these resistant strains include the clinical isolates from both kawasaki disease and behcet patients. according to the time-kill study, tachyplesin i inhibited irreversibly  the growth of s. sanguis, s. mutans and s. salivarius strains within 20 min and an s. milleri strain within 80 min. although it has been suggested that escherichia coli cultured in rich media were more susceptible to tachyplesin i, the present results show that only 3 s. milleri strains were more sensitized to tachyplesin i in a glucose-supplemented medium, and other tested strains were not. similarly, only 4 strains were more resistant to tachyplesin i in saline than these were in a rich medium.

TI  == phosphotransferase system of streptococcus salivarius: characterization of the ptsh gene and its product.
AB  == the streptococcus salivarius ptsh gene encoding histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (hpr) of the phosphotransferase system (pts) has been cloned, sequenced, and found to be part of a ptsh, ptsi operon. upstream from ptsh, putative -35 and -10 boxes and a shine-dalgarno sequence highly similar to  the escherichia coli consensus regulatory elements were identified. a second promoter, located in the ptsh coding sequence was also observed and is sufficient for the expression of the s. salivarius ptsi gene, encoding enzyme i of the pts in e. coli [gagnon et al., gene 121 (1992) 71-78]. the amino acid sequence of s.  salivarius hpr, inferred from the ptsh sequence, shared identity varying between  37 and 76% with known hpr from other bacteria. moreover, the s. salivarius hpr shared 78% identity with an hpr-like protein of aspergillus fumigatus, a eukaroytic mold that does not possess a functional pts. expression analysis of s. salivarius hpr in e. coli demonstrated that (i) s. salivarius ptsh is expressed in e. coli under the control of its own promoter, (ii) s. salivarius hpr synthesized by e. coli is completely processed by methionine aminopeptidase, and  (iii) s. salivarius hpr is phosphorylated in vivo by e. coli enzyme i. it was also observed that, in e. coli, the copy number of puc18 bearing s. salivarius ptsh was reduced more than 25-fold, as compared to puc18 without an insertion.

TI  == glucose stimulates camp accumulation in the oral bacterium actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == actinomyces viscosus t14v, a gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 u) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl camp. glucose, on the other hand, stimulated camp accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. fructose  and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on camp accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were  without effect. glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate camp accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. glucose did not stimulate camp levels  in other gram-positive bacteria including streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis and s. salivarius but did cause camp accumulation in other strains of a. viscosus. the results suggest that glucose effects on camp metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the a. viscosus bacteria. the results  also suggest that glucose stimulates camp accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.

TI  == the ftf gene encoding the cell-bound fructosyltransferase of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 is preceded by an insertion sequence and followed by fur1 and clpp homologues.
AB  == analysis of the region downstream of the ftf gene of streptococcus salivarius led to the detection of two open reading frames (orfs). the deduced amino acid sequences of these orfs were homologous to proteins encoded by genes not previously described and/or sequenced in gram-positive bacteria. the deduced amino acid sequence of the first of these (orf2) showed strong homology to the product of the fur1 gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae, which codes for a uracil phosphoribosyltransferase. the over-expression of the product of this gene appeared to be the source of the detrimental effect observed with phagemids carrying orf2 in escherichia coli hosts. the deduced amino acid sequence of the second orf (orf3) was homologous to the clpp family of proteases. examination of  the upstream region of the ftf gene led to the discovery of a new insertion sequence-like element which has been designated is1161.

TI  == cloning, sequencing and expression in escherichia coli of the ptsi gene encoding  enzyme i of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system from streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == we present the cloning and sequencing of the ptsi gene, encoding enzyme i (ei) of the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep): sugar phosphotransferase (pts) transport system from streptococcus salivarius. the ptsi gene corresponds to an open reading frame of 1731 nucleotides, which translates into a putative 577-amino acid (aa) protein with a m(r) of 62,948 and a pi of 4.49. the ei was produced in escherichia coli under the control of its own promoter located immediately upstream of ptsi, a situation never previously reported for any other gene coding for an ei. the deduced aa sequence of the s. salivarius ei shows a high degree of similarity with the e. coli ei and the ei moiety of the multiphosphoryl transfer protein from rhodobacter capsulatus. the s. salivarius ei also shares a highly conserved  aa cluster with a non-pts protein, the maize pyruvate:orthophosphate dikinase. the conserved cluster is located in a domain which is hypothesized to be the pep-binding site.

AB  == the streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase (gtf) genes gtfb and gtfc were ligated into escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle plasmids and introduced into  streptococcus milleri. gtfb transformant ksb8 formed an s. mutans-like rough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed an extracellular gtf-i, of 158 kda, and two cell-bound gtf-is, of 158 and 135 kda. gtfc transformant ksc43 formed a semirough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed primarily an extracellular gtf-si, of 146 kda, and two cell-bound gtf-sis, of 146 and 152 kda. the extracellular gtfs from ksb8 and ksc43 were purified and characterized. the two types of gtf also reacted specifically with monoclonal antibodies directed against each enzyme. both enzymes synthesized significant amounts of oligosaccharides, consisting primarily of alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages, as well  as water-insoluble glucans, containing alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkages. insoluble-glucan-synthesizing activities of both enzymes were stimulated (three-  to sixfold) by the addition of dextran t10 and were inhibited in the presence of  1.5 m ammonium sulfate. the km(s) for sucrose and the optimal phs were also similar for both enzymes. however, when the transformants were grown in todd-hewitt broth supplemented with sucrose, ksc43 cells, expressing gtf-si activity, adhered to glass surfaces in vitro, while ksb8 cells, expressing gtf-i  activity, did not. these results are discussed relative to the potential role of  the gtfb and gftc genes in s. mutans cariogenicity.

AB  == the article deals with interactions between bio-vitro-materials and bacteria species in vitro. the growth of s. aureus, sc. salivarius, e. coli and ps. aeruginosa in a salt solution with and without addition of biomaterials was examined until the day 60 in a static culture. by counting the cfu/ml and determination the relative change of germ capacity the results were compared. the data of such series obtained with working materials of similar chemical composition were collected and evaluated. we found, that ps. aeruginosa was promoted in growth by all materials, especially those, which contained carbon. the same can be said about the last materials and e. coli. in contrast as well ca- and p-containing as--free biomaterials reduced the numbers of germs. changes  of multiplying of s. aureus and sc. salivarius seldom were observed. it ist apparent, that the biomaterials tested are not indifferent against a few germs, which may cause infections, but they promote the growth of a few species in vitro. this may favour an infection, if such materials should be implanted. it is proposed to test biomaterials microbiologically before clinical application. materials with indifferent behavior or low anti-microbiological effect have to be favoured.

AB  == the radiofrequency-stimulated argon gas plasma (glow discharge) technique, already well-known for surface cleaning and activation of adhesion, was investigated for determination of its separate potential for rapid disinfection of dental operative instruments. disinfection effectiveness was judged from diminished post-treatment recovery of viable organisms from the instruments agitated in saline. streptococcus salivarius, bacillus stearothermophilus, and escherichia coli were used as primary contaminant organisms, dried from gelatin-thickened laboratory cultures onto the instruments and not subjected to any preliminary cleaning steps. significant disinfection was obtained, with no sensible temperature increases, in under 10 minutes in laboratory apparatus consuming fewer than 5 watts of power per cycle. also, clinically used and deliberately-saliva-contaminated high-speed handpieces were gas-discharge-treated, with their resultant rapid disinfection noted by complete  suppression of the viability of any transferred natural contaminant organisms within two minutes. with regard to preservation of instrument quality, it was also shown that this low-temperature gas-discharge method provides the noted substantial disinfection without deterioration of sharp edges. work now in progress suggests that the method can provide cool, rapid, and complete sterilization when hydrogen peroxide vapors are present in the gas plasma used for treatment of instruments first given the normally recommended thorough pre-cleaning.

(l. gauthier, d. mayrand, and c. vadeboncoeur, j. bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. enzyme i was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. the protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. the subunit molecular weight of enzyme i determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. in gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees c, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme i is a dimer. in double  immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against hpr reacted with several oral streptococci, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus faecium, and lactobacillus casei, but not with bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. antibodies against enzyme i of s. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme i  from all the other oral streptococci tested. no cross-reaction was observed with  other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the levels of enzyme i and hpr determined by rocket electrophoresis in s. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. glucose-grown cells of other s. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme i and hpr which were similar to those found in s. mutans 27352.

TI  == purification of proteins similar to hpr and enzyme i from the oral bacterium streptococcus salivarius. biochemical and immunochemical properties.
AB  == the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) is made of several  proteins. two of them are designated general proteins because they are required for the transport and phosphorylation of all sugars of the pts. these two proteins are found in the soluble fraction of cellular extracts and are termed hpr and enzyme i (ei). we reported in this work the purification and the characterization of these two proteins from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975.  hpr was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, molecular sieving on ultrogel  aca44, and carboxymethylcellulose chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in the presence of urea revealed a single band with a molecular weight of 6700. the protein contained no tryptophan and had a pi of 4.8. the purification scheme of ei was as follows: deae-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, deae-sephadex a-50 chromatography, preparative electrophoresis, and molecular sieving on ultrogel aca34. the five-step purification for ei produced a 199-fold purified preparation with a specific activity of 530 mumol of hpr phosphorylated per minute per milligram of protein at 37 degrees c. the fraction obtained after filtration on ultrogel aca34 gave one band (68 000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the molecular weight of the native enzyme determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees c was 135 000, suggesting that it was a dimer. enzyme i had a pi of 4.2,  a ph optimum of 6.7, a km for hpr of about 27 microm, a km for phosphoenolpyruvate of 0.48 mm, and kinetics that were consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. evidence had been obtained which indicated that s. salivarius enzyme i was antigenically very similar to enzyme i from various strains of streptococcus mutans, but not to the enzyme from bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and escherichia coli.

TI  == influence of dietary lactose on the gut flora of chicks.
AB  == 1. the gut microflora of chicks fed on a purified diet containing 300 g lactose plus 300 g starch/kg was compared with that of control birds receiving a diet containing 600 g starch/kg. 2. in 14-d-old conventional chicks, lactose in the diet decreased the incidence of lactobacilli and clostridia in the caecal contents, although when presenting lactose-fed chicks the counts of lactobacilli  exceeded those of control chicks. 3. high counts of proteus sp. were present in the caeca of control birds but they were completely suppressed in conventional birds fed on the lactose diet. in vitro tests showed that this inhibition was partially due to escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis. 4. the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus was inhibited by lactose when gnotobiotic chicks were monoassociated but not when polyassociated. the protective effect was shown in vitro to be due to l. salivarius. 5. the ph was markedly lowered in the caecum of conventional and polyassociated chicks receiving dietary lactose. of the strains  used in gnotobiotic experiments e. coli, s. faecalis and l. salivarius produced the lowest ph values in the caeca.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == the bacterial flora of neonates with congenital abnormalities of the gastro-intestinal tract.
AB  == the development of the bacterial flora of neonates with congenital abnormalities  of the gastro-intestinal tract was studied in 31 infants during the first 10 days of life. specimens were collected from the umbilicus, mouth and gastro-intestinal tract on the pre-operative day, at operation and on post-operative days 1, 2, 3,  5, 7 and 10. bacteria were isolated semi-quantitatively on a variety of plain and selective media and identified by conventional methods.staphylococcus albus was the predominant species isolated from the umbilicus; it was recovered from 24 of  the 31 babies. the viridans group of streptococci and streptococcus salivarius were the commonest species isolated from the mouth; there were no differences between the babies with different abnormalities and treatment with antibiotics had no effect on the bacterial flora. ten babies were colonized by each species on the pre-operative day, and 25 and 19 respectively by the tenth post-operative  day. anaerobic gram-positive cocci were the predominant oral anaerobes. bacteria  were not isolated from the rectal swabs of babies with tracheo-oesophageal fistula (tof) or small bowel atresia on the pre-operative days. post-operatively  the predominant faecal isolates from babies with tof were str. faecalis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens. about 80% of the babies with small  bowel atresia were colonized by str. faecalis and bacteroides vulgatus, 60% each  by e. coli, klebsiella aerogenes and str. faecium. the five babies with necrotizing enterocolitis were colonized by str. faecalis, e. coli, cl. perfringens and cl. difficile; bacteroides spp. were not recovered from any of them. the commonest facultative species recovered from babies with large bowel obstruction were str. faecalis and e. coli. b. vulgatus, cl. perfringens and bifidobacterium spp. were the commonest anaerobes and anaerobes outnumbered aerobes. no significant isolates were recovered from the wound swabs and none of  the babies developed post-surgical sepsis.

TI  == the development of the bacterial flora in normal neonates.
AB  == the development of the bacterial flora of neonates during the first week of life  was studied in 23 babies. specimens of meconium or faeces were collected and swabs taken from the umbilicus and mouth on days, 1, 2, 3 and 6. the bacteria present were isolated on a variety of plain and selective media. the predominant  faecal organisms by the end of the first week were anaerobes. bifidobacteria were isolated from all the neonates and bacteroides and clostridia were isolated from  78.3%. bifidobacteria and bacteroides were present in large numbers; other species were isolated in smaller numbers. enterococci were isolated from all neonates, enterobacteria from 82.6%, anaerobic cocci from 52.2%, and streptococci and staphylococci from 34.8% each. staphylococcus aureus was the predominant species isolated from the umbilicus; it was isolated from 21.7% of neonates on the first day rising to 87.0% by the sixth day and represented 49% of isolates from this site. s. albus, streptococci, enterococci and escherichia coli were each isolated from a few neonates. viridans streptococci (31.4% of isolates) and  streptococcus salivarius (25.1%) were the commonest species recovered from the mouth. they were present from 8 h after birth; s. albus and neisseria spp. were isolated later on the first day, and anaerobic species of veillonella and bifidobacterium appeared on the second day.

TI  == changes in the microflora and physiology of the anterior intestinal tract of pigs weaned at 2 days, with special reference to the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
AB  == the gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. although there was a significantly higher count of escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. there were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. lactobacillus fermentum, l. acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius, s. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. l. fermentum  and s. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. the weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there  may be gastric stasis. the gastric ph was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of  age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. in weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between ph and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and  also a positive correlation between ph and number of e. coli. these correlations  suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in  the regulation of gastric ph in weaned pigs. three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting hcl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, ph  < 3.5). in sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. in weaned scouring pigs there was  a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. there was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.

TI  == determinants of the developing oral flora in normal newborns.
AB  == the ability of streptococcus species to selectively adhere to the oral epithelial cells of newborns was studied in vitro. on day 1 of life, mucosal cells from normal infants demonstrated selective attraction for the natural distribution of  streptococci that would soon colonize these surfaces. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis adhered well in vitro to scraped cells from cheek and tongue surfaces. streptococcus mutans, on the other hand, exhibited feeble or no  adherence to cheek or tongue cells. adherence of escherichia coli to oral epithelial cells was also studied. the ability of strains of e. coli to adhere to cheek and tongue cells correlated solely with the presence of cell surface substances, probably pili. these observations, made on infants at the critical moment of their developing flora, strengthen the hypothesis that the ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is an important determinant of their ecological place in the oral microflora.

TI  == [studies on the relationship of temperent phages and bacteriocines of streptococcus faecium (author's transl)].
AB  == two bacteriocins (enterocin e1a and e1b) as well as a complete bacteriophage (pe1) were produced by streptococcus faecium strain e1. although the phage could  be demonstrated by electron microscopy it was not possible to observe phages or phage-like particles in the purified preparation of the large enterocin e1b. phage pe1 had a much smaller activity spectrum than that of enterocin e1a and e1b, inhibiting only one strain of streptococcus faecium and one strain of streptococcus salivarius. the enterocins were not neutralized by antiphage sera,  thereby suggesting that the enterocins and the phage are chemically unrelated.

TI  == parameters affecting the adherence and tissue tropisms of streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == virulent m protein-containing strains of streptococcus pyogenes were found to adhere well to human pharyngeal cells in vitro. in contrast, an avirulent m - strain and an enteropathogenic escherichia coli strain adhered feebly. when various rat tissues were exposed to mixtures of a virulent s. pyogenes strain and an enteropathogenic e. coli strain, the relative proportions of the two pathogenic strains recovered from mucosal surfaces differed among the sites studied. s. pyogenes cells were found to adhere in higher proportions than enteropathogenic e. coli cells to the mucosal surfaces of rat tongues, whereas on surfaces of the urinary bladder, their affinities were reversed. the data indicate that bacterial adherence is influenced by the specificity of both the bacterial and epithelial surfaces, and they suggest that adherence may influence  the tissue tropisms of pathogens. early stationary-phase cells of s. pyogenes attached better to epithelial cells than did bacteria in other growth phases. the adherence of s. pyogenes cells was impaired by pretreatment with trypsin, wheat germ lipase, tween 80, triton x-100, sodium lauryl sulfate, heat at 56 c, anti-group a antiserum, the presence of phospholipids, and preincubation of the epithelial cells with streptococcus salivarius cell walls. altering the ph or treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid had no effect on the ability of s. pyogenes cells to adhere.

TI  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. four of six different strains, including the propagating s. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. all six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. in contrast to sensitive s. aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella montevideo, s. zymogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. among gram-positive bacteria, only d. pneumoniae inhibited s. aureus bacteriostasis. agglutinins of s. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, c-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for s. aureus serum bacteriostasis. after diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins a, g, and m appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. it is suggested that s. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions  with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.
