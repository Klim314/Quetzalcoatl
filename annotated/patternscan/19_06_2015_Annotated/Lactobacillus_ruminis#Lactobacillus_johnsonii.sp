TI  == identification and characterization of intestinal lactobacilli strains capable of degrading immunotoxic peptides present in gluten.
AB  == aim: identify and characterize bacteria from the proximal gastrointestinal tract  of pigs capable of degrading immunogenic gluten peptides. methods and results: bacteria were cultured from the small intestine of pigs fed a 20% gluten diet and from an enrichment media with the 18-mer peptide lqlqpfpqpqlpypqpql. isolates were screened for the production of specialized proteolytic enzymes and the ability to degrade and remove metastable peptides from alpha-gliadin (16-mer and  33-mer) and omega-gliadin (17-mer), with established roles in the aetiology of coeliac disease. degradation was determined by elisa and mass spectrometry (uhplc-ms/ms in mrm mode), and hydrolysis fragments were characterized by lc-ms/ms. four strains from the species lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus amylovorus and lactobacillus salivarius showed the highest peptide-degrading activities. strains displayed different degradation rates and cleavage patterns that resulted in reduction but not complete removal of immunotoxic epitopes. conclusions: we employed a unique enrichment process to  select for bacteria adapted to the conditions of the proximal gastrointestinal tract with the ability to partially detoxify well-characterized peptides involved in coeliac disease. significance and impact of the study: this study provides a basis for the selection of lactobacillus strains for probiotic applications aimed to reduce epitope-containing gluten peptides before reaching the epithelium of the small intestine of patients with coeliac disease.

TI  == anti-inflammatory and intestinal barrier-protective activities of commensal lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in thoroughbreds: role of probiotics in diarrhea  prevention in neonatal thoroughbreds.
AB  == we previously isolated the commensal bacteria lactobacilli and bifidobacteria from the thoroughbred intestine and prepared the horse probiotics lacfi(tm), consisting of lactobacillus ruminis kk14, l. equi kk 15, l. reuteri kk18, l. johnsonii kk21, and bifidobacterium boum hu. here, we found that the five lacfi(tm) constituent strains remarkably suppressed pro-inflammatory interleukin-17 production in mouse splenocytes stimulated with interleukin-6 and  transforming growth factor-beta. the protective effects of the probiotic on impaired intestinal barrier function were evaluated in caco-2 cells treated with  tumor necrosis factor-alpha. evaluation of transepithelial resistance showed that all the strains exhibited intestinal barrier protective activity, with significant suppression of barrier impairment by l. reuteri kk18. the lacfi(tm) constituent strains were detected in neonatal lacfi(tm)-administered thoroughbred feces using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and culture methods. these five strains were found to be the predominant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the intestinal microbiota of lacfi(tm)-administered thoroughbreds. administration of lacfi(tm) to neonatal thoroughbreds decreased diarrhea incidence from 75.9% in the control group (n=29 neonatal thoroughbreds)  to 30.7% in the lacfi(tm)-administered group (n=101 neonatal thoroughbreds) immediately after birth to 20 weeks after birth. lacfi(tm) treatment also prevented diarrhea especially at and around 4 weeks and from 10 to 16 weeks. the  duration of diarrhea was also shorter in the probiotics-administered group (7.4 +/- 0.8 days) than in the control group (14.0 +/- 3.2 days). these results indicate that the lacfi(tm) probiotics regulates intestinal function and contributes to diarrhea prevention.
