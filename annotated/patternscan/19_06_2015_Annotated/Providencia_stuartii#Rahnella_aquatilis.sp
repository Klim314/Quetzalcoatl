TI  == occurrence of gram-negative bacteria in hens' eggs depending on their source and  storage conditions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the qualitative composition of gram-negative microbes, mainly of the family enterobacteriaceae, including pathogenic bacteria  such as salmonella, in the albumens and yolks and on the shells of hens' eggs, depending on their source and on the temperature and duration of their storage. a total of 375 table eggs were studied, from a large-scale poultry farm, a small-scale poultry farm and a supermarket. each group was divided into 5 subgroups according to the temperature and duration of their storage during the study. two serotypes of bacteria of the genus salmonella were identified: s. enteritidis and s. arizonae. strains of salmonella spp. were also isolated. apart from salmonella and escherichia coli, among the most frequently isolated bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae were enterobacter spp., klebsiella spp. and citrobacter freundii. qualitative analysis of the bacterial microflora of the eggs also showed the presence of other gram negative bacteria, including acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas spp., tatumella ptyseos, providencia stuartii, serratia liquefaciens, flavimonas oryzihabitans, vibrio metschnikovii, leclercia  adecarboxylata, kluyvera spp., rahnella aquatilis, proteus mirabilis, and achromobacter spp. the study demonstrated that the conditions applied, i.e., the  temperature and duration of storage, did not significantly influence the prevalence of particular species of gram-negative bacteria in the eggs. however,  based on the analysis of contamination of eggs with salmonella depending on their source, it can be concluded that the system in which the hens are housed affects  the risk of contamination of eggs with these pathogens.

TI  == production of biogenic amines "in vitro" in relation to the growth phase by enterobacteriaceae species isolated from traditional sausages.
AB  == histidine, lysine, ornithine and tyrosine decarboxylase activities were tested in 79 strains of enterobacteriaceae (41 of hafnia alvei, 17 of serratia liquefaciens, 5 of enterobacter cloacae, 4 of citrobacter braakii, 2 of proteus vulgaris, 2 of proteus mirabilis, 2 of providencia stuartii, 2 of klebsiella terrigena, 1 of rahnella aquatilis, 1 of salmonella arizonae, 1 of citrobacter youngae and 1 of escherichia coli) isolated from botillo, a spanish traditional sausage. in general, the strains were positive for all four activities, with the  exception of two strains of h. alvei and the e. coli strain, which did not display histidine decarboxylase activity. the strains of p. mirabilis and p. stuartii did not exhibit any of the four activities tested. accumulation of putrescine and cadaverine was studied throughout growth of the 75 strains that displayed ornithine and lysine decarboxylase activities. biogenic amines were produced particularly in the exponential phase, with maximum accumulation occurring after between 12 to 72 h, depending on the biogenic amine and microbial species considered. maximum accumulation of putrescine varied greatly between species and within the same species, and ranged from 18 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 7325 mg/l in a h. alvei strain. maximum accumulation of cadaverine varied less than that of putrescine, and ranged from 30 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 1935 mg/l in a s. liquefaciens strain.
