TI  - Anaerobic bacteria cultured from the tongue dorsum of subjects with oral malodor.
AB  - The bacteria on the dorsum of the tongue are the most frequent cause of oral malodor; however, the bacterial flora of the tongue has not been well defined. Although recent studies have used DNA probes to detect the presence of certain periodontal pathogens, cultural studies have been limited because of the complexity of the flora of the tongue dorsum. The purpose of this study was to grow and to identify maximum numbers of capnophylic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic micro-organisms by culturing tongue samples on to several selective and non-selective media. The most frequently isolated species included Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Collinsella aerofaciens, Eubacterium group, Actinomyces spp., Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented Prevotella spp. and Selenomonas spp. Reported for the first time are Actinomyces turicensis, Collinsella aerofaciens, Eubacterium saburreum, E. timidum, Prevotella tannerae, Campylobacter concisus, Campylobacter mucosalis, Leptotrichia buccalis, Selenomonas flueggei, and Centipeda periodontii. Species not previously reported in studies that used only molecular techniques were identified in the present study.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
