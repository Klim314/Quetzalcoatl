TI  - The ClosTron: a universal gene knock-out system for the genus Clostridium.
AB  - Progress in exploiting clostridial genome information has been severely impeded by a general lack of effective methods for the directed inactivation of specific genes. Those few mutants that have been generated have been almost exclusively derived by single crossover integration of a replication-deficient or defective plasmid by homologous recombination. The mutants created are therefore unstable. Here we have adapted a mutagenesis system based on the mobile group II intron from the ltrB gene of Lactococcus lactis (Ll.ltrB) to function in clostridial hosts. Integrants are readily selected on the basis of acquisition of resistance to erythromycin, and are generated from start to finish in as little as 10 to 14 days. Unlike single crossover plasmid integrants, the mutants are extremely stable. The system has been used to make 6 mutants of Clostridium acetobutylicum and 5 of Clostridium difficile, exceeding the number of published mutants ever generated in these species. Genes have also been inactivated for the first time in Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium sporogenes, suggesting the system will be universally applicable to the genus. The procedure is highly efficient and reproducible, and should revolutionize functional genomic studies in clostridia.
TI  - Analysis of orthologous hrcA genes in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The hrcA gene codes for a transcriptional repressor protein interacting with the  CIRCE operator thereby reducing expression of the groE operon of more than 120 bacterial species. At least in Bacillus subtilis, the activity of the HrcA protein is modulated by the GroE chaperonin system. We amplified the hrcA gene from five different bacterial species and analyzed its activity in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. While those from Clostridium acetobutylicum and Staphylococcus aureus turned out to be active, those of Helicobacter pylori, Lactococcus lactis and Thermotoga maritima were inactive in E. coli, but that of T. maritima turned out to repress expression of the reporter gene in B. subtilis. All these results strongly suggest to us a specific recognition of HrcA by the GroE chaperonin system.
TI  - Comparative analysis of gene expression among low G+C gram-positive genomes.
AB  - We present a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed (PHX) genes in the low G+C Gram-positive genomes of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus halodurans, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Clostridium perfringens. Most enzymes acting in glycolysis and fermentation pathways are PHX in these genomes, but not those involved in the TCA cycle and respiration, suggesting that these organisms have predominantly adapted to grow rapidly in an anaerobic environment. Only B. subtilis and B. halodurans have several TCA cycle PHX genes, whereas the TCA pathway is entirely missing from the metabolic repertoire of the two Streptococcus species and is incomplete in Listeria, Lactococcus, and Clostridium. Pyruvate-formate lyase, an enzyme critical in mixed acid fermentation, is among the highest PHX genes in all these genomes except for C. acetobutylicum (not PHX), and B. subtilis, and B. halodurans (missing). Pyruvate-formate lyase is also prominently PHX in enteric gamma-proteobacteria, but not in other prokaryotes. Phosphotransferase system genes are generally PHX with selection of different substrates in different genomes. The various substrate specificities among phosphotransferase systems in different genomes apparently reflect on differences in habitat, lifestyle, and nutrient sources.
TI  - The ald gene, encoding a coenzyme A-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase, distinguishes Clostridium beijerinckii and two other solvent-producing clostridia from Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The coenzyme A (CoA)-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) catalyzes a key reaction in the acetone- and butanol (solvent)-producing clostridia. It reduces acetyl-CoA and butyryl-CoA to the corresponding aldehydes, which are then reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to form ethanol and 1-butanol. The ALDH of Clostridium beijerinckii NRRL B593 was purified. It had no ADH activity, was NAD(H) specific, and was more active with butyraldehyde than with acetaldehyde. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified ALDH was determined. The open reading frame preceding the ctfA gene (encoding a subunit of the solvent-forming CoA transferase) of C. beijerinckii NRRL B593 was identified as the structural gene (ald) for the ALDH. The ald gene encodes a polypeptide of 468 amino acid residues with a calculated M(r) of 51, 353. The position of the ald gene in C. beijerinckii NRRL B593 corresponded to that of the aad/adhE gene (encoding an aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase) of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and DSM 792. In Southern analyses, a probe derived from the C. acetobutylicum aad/adhE gene did not hybridize to restriction fragments of the genomic DNAs of C. beijerinckii and two other species of solvent-producing clostridia. In contrast, a probe derived from the C. beijerinckii ald gene hybridized to restriction fragments of the genomic DNA of three solvent-producing species but not to those of C. acetobutylicum, indicating a key difference among the solvent-producing clostridia. The amino acid sequence of the ALDH of C. beijerinckii NRRL B593 was most similar (41% identity) to those of the eutE gene products (CoA-acylating ALDHs) of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, whereas it was about 26% identical to the ALDH domain of the aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenases of C. acetobutylicum, E. coli, Lactococcus lactis, and amitochondriate protozoa. The predicted secondary structure of the C. beijerinckii ALDH suggests the presence of an atypical Rossmann fold for NAD(+) binding. A comparison of the proposed catalytic pockets of the CoA-dependent and CoA-independent ALDHs identified 6 amino acids that may contribute to interaction with CoA.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - The pneumococcal cell wall degrading enzymes: a modular design to create new lysins?
AB  - Autolysins are enzymes that degrade different bonds in the peptidoglycan and, eventually, cause the lysis and death of the cell. Streptococcus pneumoniae contains a powerful autolytic enzyme that has been characterized as an N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase. We have cloned the lytA gene coding for this amidase and studied in depth the genetics and expression of this gene, which represented the first molecular analysis of a bacterial autolysin. Two observations have been fundamental in revealing further knowledge on the lytic systems of pneumococcus: (a) The well-documented dependence of the pneumococcal autolysin on the presence of choline in the cell wall for activity, and (b) the early observation that most pneumococcal phages also required the presence of this amino-alcohol in the growth medium to achieve a successful liberation of the phage progeny. We concluded that choline would serve as an element of strong selective pressure to preserve certain structures of the host and phage lytic enzymes which should lead to sequence homologies. We constructed active chimeras between the lytic enzymes of S. pneumoniae and its bacteriophages using genes that share sequence homology as well as genes that completely lack homologous regions. In this way, we demonstrated that the pneumococcal lytic enzymes are the result of the fusion of two independent functional modules where the carboxy-terminal domain might be responsible for the specific recognition of choline-containing cell walls whereas the active center of these enzymes should be localized in the N-terminal part of the protein. The modular design postulated for the pneumococcal lysins seems to be a widespread model for many types of microbial proteins and the construction of functional chimeric proteins between the lytic enzymes of pneumococcus and those of several gram-positive microorganisms, like Clostridium acetobutylicum or Lactococcus lactis, provided interesting clues on the modular evolution of proteins. The study of several genes coding for the lytic enzymes of temperate phages of pneumococcus also highlighted on some evolutionary relationships between microorganisms. We suggest that lysogenic relationships may represent a common mechanism by which pathogenic organisms like pneumococcus should undergo a rapid adaptation to an evolving environment.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of the dnaK gene region of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  - A 5.4 kb HindIII fragment of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was identified using a homologous dnaK probe generated by PCR and cloned in Escherichia coli. Upstream sequences were generated by inverse PCR. The two cloned fragments partially overlapped, and sequencing of 5915 bp revealed the presence of four open reading frames in the order orf1-grpE-dnaK-orf4. orf1 encodes a 39 kDa protein of unknown function which shows considerable sequence homology with the Orf39 and Orfa proteins of Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium acetobutylicum, respectively. The downstream ORFs showed high homology to the grpE and dnaK genes of other prokaryotes. The DnaK protein has a characteristic 24-amino-acid deletion exhibited by all the known DnaK proteins of Gram-positive species. In many bacteria the dnaK and dnaJ genes are found as part of the same operon. The L. lactis dnaK operon is unusual in that the dnaK gene is followed by a putative transcription terminator and a fourth large ORF which shares no homology with the dnaJ genes of other bacteria but has a small degree of homology with various membrane proteins. Vegetative promoter sequences are found upstream of both orf1 and orf4. A 12 bp inverted repeat is found upstream of the putative promoter of orf1 and an 8 bp inverted repeat is found between this promoter and the orf1 initiation codon. These repeats are thought to be involved in regulation of the heat-shock genes. The DnaK homologue is induced approximately 3-fold on heat shock at 42 degrees C.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and regulatory analysis of the Lactococcus lactis dnaJ gene.
AB  - The dnaJ gene of Lactococcus lactis was isolated from a genomic library of L. lactis NIZO R5 and cloned into pUC19. Nucleotide sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 1,137 bp in length, encoding a protein of 379 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence showed homology to the DnaJ proteins of Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus subtilis, and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The level of the dnaJ monocistronic mRNA increased approximately threefold after heat shock. The transcription initiation site of the dnaJ gene was determined and appeared to be preceded by a typical gram-positive vegetative promoter sequence (TTGCCA-17 bp-TAAAAT). Upstream of the promoter region, an inverted repeat is located that is identical to those detected upstream of heat shock genes of other gram-positive organisms. A transcriptional fusion between the dnaJ expression signals and a usp45-amyS secretion cassette caused a significant increase in alpha-amylase activity after heat shock induction. Deletion mutagenesis showed that the inverted repeat is involved in heat shock regulation of the dnaJ gene. The conservation of this palindromic sequence in gram-positive heat shock genes suggests a common regulatory pathway distinct from the system used in gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The bacteriocin lactococcin A specifically increases permeability of lactococcal  cytoplasmic membranes in a voltage-independent, protein-mediated manner.
AB  - Lactococcin A is a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis. Its structural gene has recently been cloned and sequenced (M. J. van Belkum, B. J. Hayema, R. E. Jeeninga, J. Kok, and G. Venema, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 57:492-498, 1991). Purified lactococcin A increased the permeability of the cytoplasmic membrane of L. lactis and dissipated the membrane potential. A significantly higher concentration of lactococcin A was needed to dissipate the membrane potential in an immune strain of L. lactis. Lactococcin A at low concentrations (0.029 microgram/mg of protein) inhibited secondary and phosphate-bond driven transport of amino acids in sensitive cells and caused efflux of preaccumulated amino acids. Accumulation of amino acids by immune cells was not affected by this concentration of lactococcin A. Lactococcin A also inhibited proton motive force-driven leucine uptake and leucine counterflow in membrane vesicles of the sensitive strain but not in membrane vesicles of the immune strain. These observations indicate that lactococcin A makes the membrane permeable for leucine in the presence or absence of a proton motive force and that the immunity factor(s) is membrane linked. Membrane vesicles of Clostridium acetobutylicum, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli were not affected by lactococcin A, nor were liposomes derived from phospholipids of L. lactis. These results indicate that lactococcin A acts on the cytoplasmic membrane and is very specific towards lactococci. The combined results obtained with cells, vesicles, and liposomes suggest that the specificity of lactococcin A may be mediated by a receptor protein associated with the cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - Expression of a beta-galactosidase gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum in Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  - A beta-galactosidase gene from Clostridium acetobutylicum NCIB 2951 was expressed after cloning into pSA3 and electroporation into derivatives of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains H1 and 7962. When the clostridial gene was introduced into a plasmid-free derivative of the starter-type Lact. lactis subsp. lactis strain H1, the resulting construct had high beta-galactosidase activity but utilized lactose only slightly faster than the recipient. beta-galactosidase activity in the construct decreased by over 50% if the 63 kb Lac plasmid pDI21 was also present with the beta-galactosidase gene. Growth rates of Lac+ H1 and 7962 derivatives were not affected after introduction of the clostridial beta-galactosidase, even though beta-galactosidase activity in a 7962 construct was more than double that of the wild-type strain. When pDI21 was electroporated into a plasmid-free variant of strain 7962, the recombinant had high phospho-beta-galactosidase activity and a growth rate equal to that of the H1 wild-type strain. The H1 plasmid-free strain grew slowly in T5 complex medium, utilized lactose and contained low phospho-beta-galactosidase activity. We suggest that beta-galactosidase expression can be regulated by the lactose phosphotransferase system-tagatose pathway and that Lact. lactis subsp. lactis strain H1 has an inefficient permease for lactose and contains chromosomally-encoded phospho-beta-galactosidase genes.
TI  - Natural transfer of conjugative transposon Tn916 between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The conjugative streptococcal transposon Tn916 was found to transfer naturally between a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative eubacteria. Enterococcus faecalis hosting the transposon could serve as a donor for Alcaligenes eutrophus, Citrobacter freundii, and Escherichia coli at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-8). No transfer was observed with several phototrophic species. Mating of an E. coli strain carrying Tn916 yielded transconjugants with Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis at frequencies of 10(-4) to 10(-6). Acetobacterium woodii was the only gram-positive organism tested that did not accept the transposon from a gram-negative donor. The results prove the ability of conjugative transposable elements such as Tn916 for natural cross-species gene transfer, thus potentially contributing to bacterial evolution.
