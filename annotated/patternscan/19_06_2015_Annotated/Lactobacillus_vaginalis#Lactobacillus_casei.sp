TI  == probiotic and technological properties of lactobacillus spp. strains from the human stomach in the search for potential candidates against gastric microbial dysbiosis.
AB  == this work characterizes a set of lactobacilli strains isolated from the stomach of healthy humans that might serve as probiotic cultures. ten different strains were recognized by rep-pcr and pfge fingerprinting among 19 isolates from gastric biopsies and stomach juice samples. these strains belonged to five species, lactobacillus gasseri (3), lactobacillus reuteri (2), lactobacillus vaginalis (2), lactobacillus fermentum (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). all ten strains were subjected to a series of in vitro tests to assess their functional and technological properties, including acid resistance, bile tolerance, adhesion to  epithelial gastric cells, production of antimicrobial compounds, inhibition of helicobacter pylori, antioxidative activity, antibiotic resistance, carbohydrate  fermentation, glycosidic activities, and ability to grow in milk. as expected, given their origin, all strains showed good resistance to low ph (3.0), with small reductions in counts after 90 min exposition to this ph. species- and strain-specific differences were detected in terms of the production of antimicrobials, antagonistic effects toward h. pylori, antioxidative activity and adhesion to gastric epithelial cells. none of the strains showed atypical resistance to a series of 16 antibiotics of clinical and veterinary importance. two l. reuteri strains were deemed as the most appropriate candidates to be used  as potential probiotics against microbial gastric disorders; these showed good survival under gastrointestinal conditions reproduced in vitro, along with strong anti-helicobacter and antioxidative activities. the two l. reuteri strains further displayed appropriated technological traits for their inclusion as adjunct functional cultures in fermented dairy products.

TI  == [gynophilus--a winning relay].
AB  == the vagina is a complex biocenosis where many micro-organisms coexist and colonize it. the dominant colonizing bacteria of a healthy individual is of the genus "lactobacillus". it is also called doderlein's bacillus and determines the  vaginal microbial balance through the production of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, biosurfactants, bacteriocines and modify the competition of pathogens for adhesion to the vaginal epithelial cells. through these mechanisms the lactobacilli block the growth and development of other vaginal pathogenic microbial species and also inhibit the colonization of some other microorganisms  imported from outside. because of these potential therapeutic properties, the lactobacilli are used as effective medical agents for prophylaxys and therapy to  restore the physiological balance in the vaginal eco-system. according to our studies and gained clinical experience the etiological antibacterial treatment is not always sufficient to restore the normal vaginal flora. the complete recovery  of the vaginal flora could be reached using probiotics that are applied locally and per os. gynophilus is a new vaginal probiotic product containing one type of  the genus "lactobacillus": lactobacillus casei var rhamnosus. gynophilus restores the physiological balance of the vaginal flora and reduces the risk of recurrent  infection. the product is applied intravaginal and interacts locally, inhibits the growth of the most common vaginal pathogens: gardnerella vaginalis u candida  albicans.

TI  == acid production and growth by oral lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  == aim: to analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral lactobacillus species. methods: thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of lactobacillus, representing nine species, including lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de man, rogosa,  and sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (ph 7.0). acid production and growth were  measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. results: lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species.  they also produced more acid than the others. lactobacillus vaginalis showed the  lowest rate of growth and acid production. these findings demonstrated that the different species of lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. conclusion: there was variation in acid production and growth between the lactobacillus species. the strongest acid producers were lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. it seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.

TI  == effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  == food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. this study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape  seed extract (gse) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a gse fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (gse-m). on the other hand, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the gse fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (gse-o) fraction. within bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium lactis bb12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas bifidobacterium breve 26m2  and bifidobacterium bifidum hdd541 reached maximum growth in presence of gse-o and gse-m fractions. metabolism of flavan-3-ols by lab and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. the results revealed that only l. plantarum ifpl935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that  led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. an unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also  detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in l. plantarum ifpl935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == growth characterization of individual rye sourdough bacteria by isothermal microcalorimetry.
AB  == aims: the present work tests the feasibility of the isothermal microcalorimetry method to study the performance of individual lactic acid bacteria during solid-state fermentation in rye sourdough. another aim was to elucidate the key factors leading to the formation of different microbial consortia in laboratory and industrial sourdough during continuous backslopping propagation. methods and  results: strains of the individual lab isolated from industrial and laboratory sourdough cycle were grown in 10 kgy irradiated rye dough in vials of an isothermal calorimeter and the power-time curves were obtained. sugars, organic acids and free amino acids in the sourdough were measured. the od-time curves of  the lab strains during growth in flour extract or mrs (de man, rogosa and sharpe) broth were also determined. the maximum specific growth rates of lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus and leuconostoc citreum strains that dominated in backslopped laboratory sourdough were higher than those of lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus panis, lactobacillus vaginalis, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus pontis strains originating from industrial  sourdough. industrial strains had higher specific growth rates below ph 4.8. it was supposed that during long-run industrial backslopping processes, the oxygen sensitive species start to dominate because of the o(2) protective effect of rye  sourdough. conclusions: measurements of the power-time curves revealed that the lab strains dominating in the industrial sourdough cycle had better acid tolerance but lower maximum growth rate and oxygen tolerance than species isolated from a laboratory sourdough cycle. significance and impact of the study: isothermal microcalorimetry combined with chemical analysis is a powerful method  for characterization of sourdough fermentation process and determination of growth characteristics of individual bacteria in sourdough.

TI  == diversity of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. these species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for potential probiotic use  in iberian dry fermented sausages.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select lactic acid bacteria and bifibobacteria strains as potential probiotic cultures during the processing of iberian dry fermented sausages. a total of 1000 strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages (363), and human (337) and pig faeces (300) in different culture media. around 30% of these strains, mainly isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages in lamvab agar, were pre-selected for testing as potential probiotics by their ability to grow adequately at the ph values and nacl concentrations of these meat products during the ripening process. of the in vitro investigations used to predict the survival of a strain in conditions present in the gastro intestinal tract, exposure to ph 2.5 showed itself to be a  highly discriminating factor with only 51 out of 312 pre-selected strains resisting adequately after 1.5h of exposure. all acid-resistant isolates identified as lactobacilli originated from human faeces (lactobacillus casei and  lactobacillus fermentum) and pig faeces (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus animalis, lactobacillus murinus, and lactobacillus vaginalis). pediococcus acidilactici strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages and pig faeces, whereas the greatest number of enterococcus strains were identified as enterococcus faecium, with this species being isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages, and human and pig faeces. most of these strains are promising probiotic meat culture candidates suitable for iberian dry fermented sausages.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == in vitro adherence of lactobacillus species to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == because of the reported use of yogurt douches for the treatment of vaginitis, the adherence of lactobacillus species to normal human vaginal epithelial cells was tested by in vitro methods. l. acidophilus and l. bulgaricus isolated from three  commercial yogurts were compared to l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. cellobiosus, and l. casei isolated from clinical specimens and from american type culture collection cultures. l. acidophilus isolated from lactinex tablets was also tested. no significant difference was found among the 19 clinical isolates, the american type culture collection cultures, and the lactinex isolate, but all showed significantly higher (p less than 0.01) adherence than any lactobacillus isolated from yogurt. the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, which adheres strongly to vaginal epithelial cells, was found to interfere with the adherence of lactobacilli from all sources studied.
