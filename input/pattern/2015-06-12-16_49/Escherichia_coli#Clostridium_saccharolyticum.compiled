TI  - Cofactor specificity of the bifunctional alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase (AdhE) in wild-type and mutants of Clostridium thermocellum and Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum.
AB  - Clostridium thermocellum and Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum are thermophilic bacteria that have been engineered to produce ethanol from the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of biomass respectively. Although engineered strains of T. saccharolyticum produce ethanol with a yield of 90% of the theoretical maximum, engineered strains of C. thermocellum produce ethanol at lower yields ( approximately 50% of theoretical maximum). In the course of engineering these strains, a number of mutations have been discovered in their adhE genes, which encode both alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymes. To understand the effect of these mutations, the adhE genes from six strains of C. thermocellum and T. saccharolyticum were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, followed by purification by affinity chromatography and enzyme activity measurement. In wild type strains of both organisms, NADH was the preferred cofactor for both ALDH and ADH activity. In high ethanol-producing ("ethanologen") strains of T. saccharolyticum, both ALDH and ADH activities showed increased NADPH-linked activity. Interestingly, the ethanologenic strain of C. thermocellum, AdhE has acquired high NADPH-linked ADH activity while maintaining NADH-linked ALDH and ADH activity at wild-type levels. When single amino acid mutations in AdhE, that caused increased NADPH-linked ADH activity, were introduced into C. thermocellum and T. saccharolyticum, ethanol production increased in both organisms. Structural analysis was performed for the wild-type and mutant AdhE proteins to provide explanations for the cofactor specificity change on a molecular level. IMPORTANCE: This work describes the characterization of the AdhE enzyme from different strains of C. thermocellum and T. saccharolyticum. C. thermocellum and T. saccharolyticum are thermophilic anaerobes that have been engineered to make high yields of ethanol and can solubilize components of plant biomass and ferment the sugars to ethanol. In the course of engineering these strains, several mutations arose in the bifunctional alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase AdhE, changing both enzyme activity and cofactor specificity. We show that changing AdhE cofactor specificity from mostly NADH-linked to mostly NADPH-linked resulted in higher ethanol production in C. thermocellum and T. saccharolyticum.
TI  - Molecular cloning, expression and characterization of a novel feruloyl esterase enzyme from the symbionts of termite(Coptotermes formosanus) gut.
AB  - Termites play an important role in the degradation of dead plant materials and have acquired endogenous and symbiotic cellulose digestion capabilities. The feruloyl esterase enzyme (FAE) gene amplified from the metagenomic DNA of Coptotermes formosanus gut was cloned in the TA cloning vector and subcloned into a pET32a expression vector. The Ft3-7 gene has 84% sequence identity with Clostridium saccharolyticum and shows amino acid sequence identity with predicted xylanase/chitin deacetylase and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase. The sequence analysis reveals that probably Ft3-7 could be a new gene and that its molecular mass was 18.5 kDa. The activity of the recombinant enzyme (Ft3-7) produced in Escherichia coli (E.coli) was 21.4 U with substrate ethyl ferulate and its specific activity was 24.6 U/mg protein. The optimum pH and temperature for enzyme activity were 7.0 and 37oC, respectively. The substrate utilization preferences and sequence similarity of the Ft3-7 place it in the type-D sub-class of FAE.
TI  - A new tetracycline efflux gene, tet(40), is located in tandem with tet(O/32/O) in a human gut firmicute bacterium and in metagenomic library clones.
AB  - The bacterium Clostridium saccharolyticum K10, isolated from a fecal sample obtained from a healthy donor who had received long-term tetracycline therapy, was found to carry three tetracycline resistance genes: tet(W) and the mosaic tet(O/32/O), both conferring ribosome protection-type resistance, and a novel, closely linked efflux-type resistance gene designated tet(40). tet(40) encodes a predicted membrane-associated protein with 42% amino acid identity to tetA(P). Tetracycline did not accumulate in Escherichia coli cells expressing the Tet(40) efflux protein, and resistance to tetracycline was reduced when cells were incubated with an efflux pump inhibitor. E. coli cells carrying tet(40) had a 50% inhibitory concentration of tetracycline of 60 microg/ml. Analysis of a transconjugant from a mating between donor strain C. saccharolyticum K10 and the recipient human gut commensal bacterium Roseburia inulinivorans suggested that tet(O/32/O) and tet(40) were cotransferred on a mobile element. Sequence analysis of a 37-kb insert identified on the basis of tetracycline resistance from a metagenomic fosmid library again revealed a tandem arrangement of tet(O/32/O) and tet(40), flanked by regions with homology to parts of the VanG operon previously identified in Enterococcus faecalis. At least 10 of the metagenomic inserts that carried tet(O/32/O) also carried tet(40), suggesting that tet(40), although previously undetected, may be an abundant efflux gene.
TI  - Role of spontaneous current oscillations during high-efficiency electrotransformation of thermophilic anaerobes.
AB  - Current oscillations at about 24 MHz were observed during electrotransformation (ET) of the thermophilic anaerobes Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405, C. thermocellum DSM 1313, and Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum YS 485, using a pulse gated by a square signal generated by a custom generator. In experiments in which only the field strength was varied, all three of these strains resulted in a one-to-one correspondence between the appearance of current oscillations and successful ET. Oscillations accompanied ET of both C. thermocellum strains only at field strengths of > or =12 kV/cm, and ET was only observed above the same threshold. Similarly, for T. saccharolyticum, oscillations were only observed at field strengths of > or =10 kV/cm, and ET was only observed above the same threshold. When a passive electrical filter consisting of an inductor and resistor in parallel was added to the system to prevent the development of oscillations, ET efficiencies were reduced dramatically for all three strains at all field strengths tested. The maximum tested field strength, 25 kV/cm, resulted in the maximum measured transformation efficiency for all three strains. At this field strength, the efficiency of ET in the absence of oscillations was decreased compared to that observed in the presence of oscillations by 500-fold for C. thermocellum ATCC 27405, 2,500-fold for C. thermocellum DSM 1313, and 280-fold for T. saccharolyticum. Controls using the same apparatus with Escherichia coli cells or a resistor with a value representative of the direct current resistance of typical cell samples did not develop oscillations, and ET efficiencies obtained with E. coli were the same with or without the electrical filter included in the pulse generator circuit. The results are interpreted to indicate that spontaneously arising oscillations have a large beneficial effect on transformation efficiency in the system employed here and that the development of oscillations in this system is affected by the cell species present.
TI  - [Replication protein RepN encoded by the RC plasmid of thermophilic bacterium Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum: mutational analysis and deletion mapping of domains responsible for its lethal effect].
AB  - Amino acid sequence analysis of the product encoded by repN of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum (Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum) pNB2, which is capable of rolling-circle (RC) replication, revealed all known motifs conserved among replication (Rep) proteins that initiate RC replication of plasmids related to pC194/pUB110. Using the T7 expression system in Escherichia coli, RepN was identified as a 35K protein. Its lethal effect on bacterial cells was unusually high for a protein of the kind. Mutation analysis of the potential active centers (Y85F and Y211F) showed that the lethal effect of RepN is not associated with its putative topoisomerase (relaxase) activity. On evidence of deletion mapping, the lethal effect was attributed to the N- and C-terminal domains, each accounting for about 30% of the total protein. The RepN fragments essential for the lethal effect were found to share a motif, which showed no appreciable homology to known conserved motifs. The high lethal effect of RepN was assumed to result from duplication of the motif and to play an adaptive role, providing for the stable maintenance of the AT-rich plasmid in thermophilic bacterial cells.
TI  - Advances in development of a genetic system for Thermoanaerobacterium spp.: expression of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes, development of a second shuttle vector, and integration of genes into the chromosome.
AB  - Despite recent success in transforming various thermophilic gram-type-positive anaerobes with plasmid DNA, use of shuttle vectors for the expression of genes other than antibiotic resistance markers has not previously been described. We constructed new vectors in order to express heterologous hydrolytic enzymes in our model system, Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum JW/SL-YS485. Transformed Thermoanaerobacterium expressed active enzyme, indicating that this system may function as an alternate expression host, especially for genes with a thermophilic origin. To develop further the genetic system for T. saccharolyticum JW/SL-YS485, two improved Escherichia coli-Thermoanaerobacterium shuttle vectors, pRKM1 and pRUKM, were constructed. Furthermore, the kanamycin resistance cassette alone and the kanamycin resistance cassette plus the cellobiohydrolase gene (cbhA) from Clostridium thermocellum JW20 were integrated into the xylanase gene (xynA) region of the Thermoanaerobacterium chromosome via homologous recombination using pUC-based suicide vectors pUXK and pUXKC.
TI  - Evidence for a general role for non-catalytic thermostabilizing domains in xylanases from thermophilic bacteria.
AB  - A genomic library of Clostridium thermocellum DNA constructed in lambda ZAPII was screened for xylanase-expressing clones. Cross-hybridization experiments revealed a new xylanase gene isolated from the gene library, which was designated xyn Y. The encoded enzyme, xylanase Y (XYLY), displayed features characteristic of an endo-beta1,4-xylanase: the enzyme rapidly hydrolysed oat spelt, wheat and rye arabinoxylans and was active against methyl-umbelliferyl-beta-D-cellobioside, but did not hydrolyse any cellulosic substrates. The pH and temperature optima of the enzyme were 6.8 and 75 degrees C respectively, and the recombinant XYLY, expressed by Escherichia coli had a maximum Mr of 116000. The nucleotide sequence of xyn Y contained an open reading frame of 3228 bp encoding a protein of predicted Mr 120 105. The encoded enzyme contained a typical N-terminal 26-residue signal peptide, followed by a 164 amino acid sequence, designated domain A, that was not essential for catalytic activity. Downstream of domain A was a 351-residue xylanase Family F catalytic domain, followed by a 180-residue sequence that exhibited 28% sequence identity with a thermostable domain of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum xylanase A. The C-terminal portion of XYLY comprised the 23-residue duplicated docking sequence found in all other C. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases that are constituents of the bacterium's multienzyme complex, termed the cellulosome, followed by a 286-residue domain which exhibited 32% sequence identity with the N-terminal region of C. thermocellum xylanase Z. The enzyme did not contain linker sequences found in other C. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases. Analysis of truncated forms of XYLY and hybrid proteins, comprising segments of XYLY fused to the E. coli maltose binding domain, confirmed that XYLY contained a central catalytic domain and an adjacent thermostable domain. The C-terminal domain did not bind to cellulose or xylan. Western blot analysis using antiserum raised against XYLY showed that the xylanase was located in the cellulosome and did not appear to be extensively glycosylated. The non-catalytic domains of XYLY are discussed in relation to the general stability of thermophilic xylanases.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum B6A-RI apu gene and purification and characterization of the amylopullulanase from Escherichia coli.
AB  - The amylopullulanase gene (apu) of the thermophilic anaerobic bacterium Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum B6A-RI was cloned into Escherichia coli. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined. It encoded a protein consisting of 1,288 amino acids with a signal peptide of 35 amino acids. The enzyme purified from E. coli was a monomer with an M(r) of 142,000 +/- 2,000 and had same the catalytic and thermal characteristics as the native glycoprotein from T. saccharolyticum B6A. Linear alignment and the hydrophobic cluster analysis were used to compare this amylopullulanase with other amylolytic enzymes. Both methods revealed strictly conserved amino acid residues among these enzymes, and it is proposed that Asp-594, Asp-700, and Glu-623 are a putative catalytic triad of the T. saccharolyticum B6A-RI amylopullulanase.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and biochemical characterization of xylose isomerase from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum strain B6A-RI.
AB  - The xylose isomerase gene from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum strain B6A-RI was cloned by complementation using Escherichia coli xyl-5 mutant strain HB101. One positive clone was detected and the recombinant plasmid, pZX16, was isolated. The clone contained the vector pUC18 and an insert fragment of 4.5 kb. The cloned xylose isomerase gene (xylA) was expressed constitutively in E. coli. The gene contained one open reading frame (ORF) of 1317 bp, which corresponds to 439 amino acid residues. The molecular mass of the gene product was calculated to be 50474 Da from the deduced amino acid sequence. A putative promoter region (Pribnow box), TATAATATATAAT, which repeated twice at the -10 region in E. coli, was found 25 bp upstream of the ribosomal binding site. The deduced amino acid sequence of T. saccharolyticum strain B6A-RI xylose isomerase exhibited very high homology to those from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosulfurigenes 4B (formerly Clostridium thermosulfurogenes 4B) and Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus 39E (formerly Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum 39E). Codon usage in xynA, xynB and xylA showed a clear propensity for AT-containing isocodons. The native molecular mass of the purified recombinant thermostable xylose isomerase was 200 kDa, and the enzyme was a tetramer comprised of identical subunits. The apparent temperature and pH optima for activity of the cloned xylose isomerase were 80 degrees C and 7.0 to 7.5, respectively.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the Clostridium stercorarium celZ gene encoding a thermoactive cellulase (Avicelase I): identification of catalytic and cellulose-binding domains.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the celZ gene coding for a thermostable endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (Avicelase I) of Clostridium stercorarium was determined. The structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 2958 bp which encodes a preprotein of 986 amino acids with an Mr of 109,000. The signal peptide cleavage site was identified by comparison with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of Avicelase I purified from C. stercorarium culture supernatants. The recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli is proteolytically cleaved into catalytic and cellulose-binding fragments of about 50 kDa each. Sequence comparison revealed that the N-terminal half of Avicelase I is closely related to avocado (Persea americana) cellulase. Homology is also observed with Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase D and Pseudomonas fluorescens cellulase. The cellulose-binding region was located in the C-terminal half of Avicelase I. It consists of a reiterated domain of 88 amino acids flanked by a repeated sequence about 140 amino acids in length. The C-terminal flanking sequence is highly homologous to the non-catalytic domain of Bacillus subtilis endoglucanase and Caldocellum saccharolyticum endoglucanase B. It is proposed that the enhanced cellulolytic activity of Avicelase I is due to the presence of multiple cellulose-binding sites.
