TI  - A derivative of the thiopeptide GE2270A highly selective against Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - A chemical derivative of the thiopeptide GE2270A, designated NAI003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few Gram-positive bacteria. In particular, NAI003 retained low MICs against all tested isolates of Propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against Enterococcus faecalis. Furthermore, NAI003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive P. acnes isolate. Gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, NAI003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (EF) Tu derived from Escherichia coli, E. faecalis or P. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. In contrast, EF-Tu's derived from the NAI003-insenstitive Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. These results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that NAI003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the P. acnes EF-Tu. P. acnes mutants resistant to NAI003 were isolated by direct plating. With one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding EF-Tu. Because of its selective effect on P. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, NAI003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a Phase 1 clinical study.
TI  - The culturome of the human nose habitats reveals individual bacterial fingerprint patterns.
AB  - The complex anatomy of the human nose might offer distinct microbial niches. Microbiota composition may affect nose inflammatory diseases and Staphylococcus aureus carriage. Considering different nasal cavity locations, microbial colonization was analysed across individuals exhibiting chronic nasal inflammatory diseases (n = 18) and those without local inflammation signs (n = 16). Samples were collected systematically during surgery and examined by an extensive culture-based approach and, for a subset, by 16S rRNA gene community profiling. Cultivation yielded 141 taxa with members of Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium as most common isolates comprising the nasal core culturome together with Finegoldia magna. Staphylococcus aureus was most frequently found in association with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes, and the posterior vestibules were redefined as S. aureus' principle habitat. Culturome analysis revealed host-specific bacterial 'fingerprints' irrespective of host-driven factors or intranasal sites. Comparisons between cultivable and molecular fingerprints demonstrated that only a small fraction of phylotypes (6.2%) was correlated. While the total number of different phylotypes was higher in the molecular dataset, the total number of identifications down to the species level was higher in the culturomic approach. To determine host-specific microbiomes, the advantages of molecular approaches should be combined with the resolution and reliability of species identification by culturomic analyses.
TI  - The microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of France.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast implant infections are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. METHODS: Thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from January 2008 to June 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. RESULTS: The prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). Of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. S. aureus was identified in 18 cases, Gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. In addition to Propionibacterium acnes and Actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Corynebacterium simulans, Dermabacter hominis, Finegoldia magna, and Peptoniphilus harei. Seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. All cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of MALDI-TOF MS and molecular identification for diagnosis.
TI  - The cutaneous bacterial microflora of the bodybuilders using anabolic-androgenic  steroids.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) abuse by the athletes has dramatically increased during the recent decades. These substances might increase the skin lipids and enhance the cutaneous microbial proliferation. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to investigate the potential side effects of AAS on the bacterial microflora colonization of the bodybuilders` skin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The skin samples of 94 male bodybuilders (71 AAS users, 23 non-AAS users) and 46 subjects of the control group, with similar gender and age, were cultured and incubated in both aerobic condition to isolate Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic condition for Propionibacterium acnes. The isolated bacteria were identified by standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: The skin lesions were more frequent in the body builders than the controls. Moreover, statistically significant differences were also observed in skin lesions among the AAS users and the non-AAS user athletes. The prevalence of S. aureus and P. acnes in the athletes was higher than that of the control group. In addition, there was a significant difference in distribution of P. acnes between the bodybuilders who used AAS and those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: A higher number of bacterial flora was found in the bodybuilders particularly those using AAS in comparison to the controls, which might be due to the influence of these AAS on the skin microflora and transmission of the bacteria through the direct contact of the naked skin with the exercise instruments.
TI  - Palmitoleic acid calcium salt: a lubricant and bactericidal powder from natural lipids.
AB  - Palmitoleic acid is a promising bactericidal agent for cleansing products with alternative bactericidal abilities. In this study, we focus on the physical and biological activity of palmitoleic acid calcium salt (C16:1 fatty acid Ca salt) because it forms via an ion-exchange reaction between palmitoleic acid and Ca ions in tap water, and remains on the skin surface during the cleansing process. Here, we prepared C16:1 fatty acid Ca salt to investigate its crystal structure and physical and bactericidal properties. The Ca salt was a plate-shaped lamellar crystalline powder with a particle diameter of several micrometers to several tens of micrometers; it exhibited significant lubricity and alternative bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). We also examined other fatty acid Ca salts prepared from lauric acid (C12:0 fatty acid), palmitic acid (C16:0 fatty acid), and oleic acid (C18:1 fatty acid). The bactericidal activities and lubricity of the fatty acid Ca salts changed with the alkyl chain length and the degree of unsaturation. The C16:1 fatty acid Ca salt exhibited the strongest selective bactericidal ability among the four investigated fatty acid Ca salts. These findings suggest that C16:1 fatty acid and its Ca salt have potential applications in cleansing and cosmetic products.
TI  - Reduced Expression of Dermcidin, a Peptide Active Against Propionibacterium acnes, in Sweat of Patients with Acne Vulgaris.
AB  - Dermcidin (DCD), an antimicrobial peptide with a broad spectrum of activity against bacteria such as Propionibacterum acnes, is expressed constitutively in sweat in the absence of stimulation due to injury or inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between DCD expression and acne vulgaris associated with P. acnes. The antimicrobial activity of recombinant full-length DCD (50 mug/ml) was 97% against Escherichia coli and 100% against Staphylococcus aureus. Antimicrobial activity against P. acnes ranged from 68% at 50 mug/ml DCD to 83% at 270 mug/ml DCD. DCD concentration in sweat from patients with acne vulgaris (median 9.8 mug/ml, range 6.9-95.3 mug/ml) was significantly lower than in healthy subjects (median 136.7 mug/ml, range 45.4-201.6 mug/ml) (p = 0.001). DCD demonstrated concentration-dependent, but partial, microbicidal activity against P. acnes. These results suggest that reduced DCD concentration in sweat in patients with inflammatory acne may permit proliferation of P. acnes in pilosebaceous units, resulting in progression of inflammatory acne.
TI  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and  diagnostic testing for prosthetic joint infection in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
AB  - Identification of pathogen(s) associated with prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is critical for patient management. Historically, many laboratories have not routinely identified organisms such as coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. The advent of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has enhanced clinical laboratory capacity for accurate species-level identification. The aim of this study was to describe the species-level identification of microorganisms isolated from periprosthetic tissue and fluid specimens using MALDI-TOF MS alongside other rapid identification tests in a clinical microbiology laboratory. Results of rapid identification of bacteria isolated from periprosthetic joint fluid and/or tissue specimens were correlated with clinical findings at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, between May 2012 and May 2013. There were 178 PJI and 82 aseptic failure (AF) cases analyzed, yielding 770 organisms (median, 3/subject; range, 1-19/subject). MALDI-TOF MS was employed for the identification of 455 organisms (59%) in 197 subjects (123 PJIs and 74 AFs), with 89% identified to the species level using this technique. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 68% and 93% of isolates in PJI and AF, respectively. However, the profile of species associated with infection compared to specimen contamination differed. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus caprae were always associated with infection, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus lugdunensis were equally likely to be a pathogen or a contaminant, whereas the other coagulase-negative staphylococci were more frequently contaminants. Most streptococcal and Corynebacterium isolates were pathogens. The likelihood that an organism was a pathogen or contaminant differed with the prosthetic joint location, particularly in the case of Propionibacterium acnes. MALDI-TOF MS is a valuable tool for the identification of bacteria isolated from patients with prosthetic joints, providing species-level identification that may inform culture interpretation of pathogens versus contaminants.
TI  - Infection of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices: detection with sonication, swab cultures, and blood cultures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) is increasing. The purpose of this study was to compare three methods (sonication, swab cultures, and blood cultures) to detect bacteria in infections of CIEDs. METHODS: Patients with pocket infection of CIEDs and/or CIED-associated infective endocarditis were prospectively included. Generators and leads were sonicated together. Swab cultures of the generator pocket and blood cultures were performed. RESULTS: Between January 2009 and September 2012, 18 patients with a CIED infection were recorded, including two definite and four possible CIED-IEs. In 17 patients, blood cultures were performed and the device was analyzed by sonication. A swab culture from the device pocket was performed in 16 cases. Ten (59%) patients received antibiotic therapy before the device was removed. In 15 of 16 cases (94%), bacteria were detected by sonication, while bacteria were detected in only nine (56%) and seven (41%) cases by swab-and blood cultures, respectively. In four cases (24%), sonication was the only method that detected bacteria. The following bacteria were detected by sonication: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 6), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS; n = 3), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 2), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (n = 1), MSSA/Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1),Bacillus cereus (n = 1), MSSA/P. acnes (n = 1), andP. acnes/CNS (n = 1). All positive swab cultures and all positive blood cultures but one grew the same bacteria as sonication fluid cultures. CONCLUSION: Sonication can be more sensitive than swab cultures or blood cultures in detecting bacteria in infections of CIEDs.
TI  - [Advances in the research on bactericidal effect of blue light and its mechanism].
AB  - Blue light is commonly used to kill Propionibacterium acnes in clinic. Furthermore, blue light exhibits a good bactericidal effect against Helicobacter pylori, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and many oral bacteria in laboratory studies. The bactericidal mechanism of blue light as commonly accepted consists photo-excitation of intracellular porphyrins resulting in production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species which can inactivate bacteria. Blue light can kill bacteria without additional exogenous photosensitizers. In addition, it produces little harm to mammalian cells. Therefore, as the increasing emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms, blue light might be a good antibacterial tool.
TI  - Fusidic acid in skin infections and infected atopic eczema.
AB  - Skin infections represent an important public health issue and cost-driver. Additionally, chronic skin lesions are sometimes colonized by Gram-negative species. Topical therapies are a key component in the management of mild-to-moderate skin infections. In such cases, topical antibiotics may be preferable to systemic treatment, since they maximize the effective doses at the site of infection while minimizing the systemic side effects of the drugs. However, the prevalence of resistant strains is steadily increasing and cases of sensitization are not uncommon. As a consequence, the ideal topical antibiotic should be selective (thus, minimizing cross-resistance), have weak sensitization potential, penetrate the skin efficiently, reach adequate local doses at the site of infection, and finally be available in different formulations matching patients' preferences and needs. Fusidic acid (FA) is a selective antibiotic available in several topical formulations. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that, contrary to other topical antibiotics such as gentamicin or mupirocin, FA reaches high antimicrobial concentration at deep skin layers after topical application either on intact or damaged epidermis. Several randomized controlled trials demonstrated that FA, in its various topical formulations, is very effective in treating skin infections, given its high bactericidal activity against S. aureus (including strains resistant to penicillin, methicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin), S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corinebatteria, Clostridia. Additionally, FA presents a low risk of resistance even in methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, a common pathogen implied in the etiology of skin infections and infected atopic eczema. Such feature makes FA particularly useful in the management of these medical conditions. Finally, possibly due to its large steric effect, FA has proved a very low risk of contact sensitization. Overall, data on FA efficacy, safety, sensitization potential, resistance profile and spectrum selectivity make it a first-choice option in the treatment of primary and secondary skin infection.
TI  - Management of deep postoperative shoulder infections: is there a role for open biopsy during staged treatment?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the gold standard treatment of 2-stage exchange arthroplasty, reinfection after periprosthetic shoulder infections and periarticular osteomyelitis can be as high as 37%. This study describes a protocol to detect persistent deep shoulder infection before revision arthroplasty. METHODS: Patients who presented with periprosthetic shoulder infections and osteomyelitis after previous surgery were treated with a standardized protocol of irrigation and debridement (I&D), removal of implants, antibiotic cement spacer placement, and pathogen-directed antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks. After completion of antibiotics and resolution of clinical symptoms, specimens were obtained from an open biopsy performed in the operating room, followed by revision arthroplasty at a later date if final cultures were without evidence of infection. If evidence of infection persisted, then another course of I&D and antibiotic treatment was performed. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon scores were used to evaluate clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included between 2005 and 2012. The most common pathogens isolated were Propionibacterium acnes (44%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (39%), and S aureus (22%). Four patients (22%) had evidence of persistent infection on specimens from open biopsy and required subsequent rounds of I&D before replantation. The infecting pathogen in 75% of patients with persistent infection was P acnes, and 38% of patients with P acnes infection had recurrence. Mean follow-up of 24 months showed no signs of recurrent infection in any patient and an average American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon score of 71. CONCLUSION: Despite prior staged treatment for deep postoperative shoulder infections, specimens obtained from open biopsy before replantation detected a persistent infection rate of 22% in all patients and 38% in patients with P acnes infection, which may indicate a role for this procedure in the prevention of recurrent infections.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the anti-bacterial effect of two preparations of platelet  rich plasma compared with cefazolin and whole blood.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigates the antibacterial properties of two different platelet-rich plasma (PRP) platelet concentration preparations (PRPLP and PRPHP) through a time-kill assay. METHODS: Two different PRP preparations - a single spin process yielding lower white blood cells and platelet concentration (PRPLP) and one yielding high platelet and white blood cell concentration (PRPHP) - were obtained from 2 individuals. PRPLP, PRPHP, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), whole blood and Cefazolin were added to experimental reaction tubes, each containing a single bacterial inoculum of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epi), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes). Two dilutions (1:1,000, and 1:10,000) were plated in duplicate tubes, along with positive (blood and PBS) and negative (Cefazolin) controls and assessed at five time points (0, 1, 4, 8 and 24 hours). RESULTS: After centrifugation, platelet count of PRPLP was 386 +/- 65.5 x 103/?L and PRPHP was 867 +/- 234.4 x 103/?L. Both PRP products showed a significant decrease (p<0.05) in bacterial growth at 8 hours compared to whole blood. CONCLUSION: The application of PRPLP and PRPHP showed a significant decrease in bacterial growth after 8 hours for S. aureus, S. epi, MRSA and P. acnes compared to the whole blood control group. S.epi, MRSA, and P. acnes also showed a significant decrease in bacterial growth after 24 hours. Despite differences in platelet concentration and WBC concentration, no difference in antibacterial activity was seen between the two preparations.
TI  - Safety of topical vancomycin for pediatric spinal deformity: nontoxic serum levels with supratherapeutic drain levels.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. OBJECTIVE: To establish if drain levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentrations for common pathogens (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes-2 mug/mL; Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis-4 mug/mL). Evaluate the safety of topical vancomycin in pediatric patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery and determine if postoperative serum levels approach toxicity (25 mug/mL). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The application of topical vancomycin powder has decreased postoperative wound infections in retrospective analyses in the adult population with minimal local and systemic risks. The safety and efficacy of vancomycin powder has not been completely evaluated in the pediatric population after deformity surgery. METHODS: Topical vancomycin powder (1 g) was applied during wound closure after instrumented posterior spinal fusion. All patients received intravenous perioperative antibiotics and a subfascial drain was used. Serum and drain vancomycin levels were collected immediately postoperatively and during the first 2 postoperative days (PODs). Complications were recorded. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 25 patients with a mean age of 13.5 years (9.5-17.1 yr) and mean +/- standard deviation body weight of 44.5 +/- 18 kg. Underlying diagnoses included: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (12), neuromuscular scoliosis (10), and kyphosis (3). Mean serum vancomycin levels trended downward from 2.5 mug/mL (POD 0) to 1.9 mug/mL (POD 1) to 1.1 mug/mL (POD 2). Mean drain levels also trended downward from 403 mug/mL (POD 0) to 251 mug/mL (POD 1) to 115 mug/mL (POD 2). No vancomycin toxicity or deep wound infections were observed. One patient with neuromuscular scoliosis developed a superficial wound dehiscence that was managed with dressing changes. CONCLUSION: Topical application of vancomycin powder in pediatric spinal deformity surgery produced local levels well above the minimum inhibitory concentration for common pathogens and serum levels below the toxicity threshold (25 mug/mL). There were no deep wound or antibiotic related complications. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.
TI  - Infectious prosthetic hip joint loosening: bacterial species involved in its aetiology and their antibiotic resistance profiles against antibiotics recommended for the therapy of implant-associated infections.
AB  - Reliable microbiological diagnosis along with surgery and prolonged antibiotic therapy are key elements in the management of prosthetic-joint infections (PJIs). The purpose of this study was to characterize antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria involved in the aetiology of PJIs. A total of 33 bacterial isolates cultured from 31 patients undergoing exchange of total hip prostheses were analyzed. The diagnostic approach toward isolation of prosthesis- associated microorganisms included sonication of retrieved implants and conventional cultures of periprosthetic tissues and synovial fluid. The in vitro resistance profiles of bacterial isolates were determined in relation to antibiotics recommended for the therapy of PJIs using the disc diffusion method, E-tests((R)) and broth microdilution system. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were predominant microorganisms followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus mitis, and Propionibacterium acnes. Twenty out of 30 and 12 out of 30 staphylococcal isolates were methicillin- and multi-drug resistant, respectively. Only two isolates were rifampicinresistant. All staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides and linezolid. This paper stresses the pathogenic role of staphylococci in patients suffering from implant loosening and reports high methicillin- and multidrug-resistance rates in these bacteria. Hence, antimicrobial susceptibility tests of individual bacterial isolates must always be performed to guide selection of the optimal therapeutic option.
TI  - Development and characterization of a novel antiacne niosomal gel of rosmarinic acid.
AB  - Abstract The antibacterial and anti-inflammatory potential of rosemarinic acid (ROA), a naturally occurring ester of caffeic acid has been well reported. Antibacterial effect of ROA is attributed to nucleoid damage with an increase in spatial division and condensation of genetic material. ROA has been found dynamic against many human pathogenic bacterial strains but its inhibitory prospective has never been established against skin inflammations caused by Propionibacterium acne. The skin surface in acne prone areas is colonized with Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes which contribute to inflammation and acne. Resistance to current antimicrobial therapies suggested the need to explore new antimicrobial agents against acne. Present work included the preparation of ROA-loaded niosomes and their in vitro antimicrobial evaluation against P. acne and S. aureus. This work also included the development of niosomal gel of rosmarinic acid for sustained delivery to bacteria infected cells. Niosomes of rosmarinic acid were formulated by reverse phase evaporation method using different ratio of span 85 and cholesterol. The prepared formulations were evaluated for its vesicle size, entrapment efficiency, in vitro release study and antibacterial activity. In vivo study of developed formulation was conducted on Swiss albino mice in comparison with solution of plain drug and a marketed formulation of benzoyl peroxide. It was evident that niosomes are novel carrier for delivery of naturally occurring antimicrobial agents, in deeper tissues of skin. The results showed that drug-loaded niosomes dispersed in the gelling agent are an effective delivery system for treatment of acne vulgaris.
TI  - Lower complication rates for cranioplasty with peri-operative bundle.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The overall benefits of craniectomy must include procedural risks from cranioplasty. Cranioplasty carries a high risk of surgical site infections (SSI) particularly with antibiotic resistant bacteria. The goal of this study was to measure the effect of a cranioplasty bundle on peri-operative complications. METHODS: The authors queried a prospective, inpatient neurosurgery database at Kaiser Sacramento Medical Center for craniectomy and cranioplasty over a 7 year period. 57 patients who underwent cranioplasties were identified. A retrospective chart review was completed for complications, including surgical complications such as SSI, wound dehiscence, and re-do cranioplasty. We measured cranioplasty complication rates before and after implementation of a peri-operative bundle, which consisted of peri-operative vancomycin (4 doses), a barrier dressing through post-operative day (POD) 3, and de-colonization of the surgical incision using topical chlorhexidine from POD 4 to 7. RESULTS: The rate of MRSA colonization in cranioplasty patients is three times higher than the average seen on ICU admission screening (19% vs. 6%). The cranioplasty surgical complication rate was 22.8% and SSI rate was 10.5%. The concurrent SSI rate for craniectomy was 1.9%. Organisms isolated were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (4), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (1), Propionibacterium acnes (1), and Escherichia coli (1). Factors associated with SSI were peri-operative vancomycin (68.6% vs. 16.7%, p=0.0217). Complication rates without (n=21) and with (n=36) the bundle were: SSI (23.8% vs. 2.8%, p=0.0217) and redo cranioplasty (19% vs. 0%, p=0.0152). Bundle use did not affect rates for superficial wound dehiscence, seizures, or hydrocephalus. CONCLUSIONS: The cranioplasty bundle was associated with reduced SSI rates and the need for re-do cranioplasties.
TI  - Poor utility of serum interleukin-6 levels to predict indolent periprosthetic shoulder infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection after shoulder arthroplasty can present a diagnostic challenge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in diagnosis of periprosthetic infection in patients undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 69 patients who underwent revision shoulder arthroplasty at one institution. All patients underwent a standard preoperative and intraoperative workup for infection, which included shoulder aspirate culture, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, tissue culture, and frozen section analysis. In addition, serum levels of IL-6 were measured preoperatively in all patients. Infection classification was divided into 4 groups, (1) definite, (2) probable, (3) possible, and (4) no infection, on the basis of previously reported criteria using intraoperative cultures and preoperative and intraoperative findings of infections. RESULTS: Of the 69 patients, 24 were classified as having a definite or probable infection. Propionibacterium acnes was the offending organism for the majority of these cases (20 of 24, 83%). IL-6 was not a sensitive marker of infection for these patients (sensitivity: 3 of 24, 12%; specificity: 3 of 45, 93%). The sensitivity of serum IL-6 was lower compared with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sensitivity: 10 of 24, 42%; specificity: 37 of 45, 82%) and C-reactive protein level (sensitivity: 11 of 24, 46%; specificity: 42 of 45, 93%). For the non-P. acnes cases (1 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Enterobacter cloacae, 2 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species), the sensitivity of IL-6 was 25% (1 of 4). CONCLUSION: Serum IL-6 is not an effective marker for diagnosis of infection in shoulder arthroplasty. On the basis of this large prospective study, we do not recommend its use as a preoperative diagnostic test in patients undergoing revision shoulder arthroplasty.
TI  - Propionic acid and its esterified derivative suppress the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus USA300.
AB  - Previously, we demonstrated that Propionibacterium acnes, a human skin commensal  bacterium, ferments glycerol into short-chain fatty acids, including propionic acid. Propionic acid suppressed the growth of Staphylococcus aureus USA300, a community-acquired methicillin-resistant bacterium, in vitro and in vivo. In this study, it is demonstrated that the anti-USA300 activity of propionic acid persisted after buffering the acid with 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1- piperazineethanesulfonic acid. This suggests that the growth suppression of USA300 mainly resulted from the antimicrobial activity of propionic acid per se and not from the acidity of the medium. In addition, proprionic acid significantly reduced the intracellular pH of USA300 and exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. P. acnes showed a higher tolerance to propionic acid. Next, an esterified derivative of propionic acid was synthesised. Propionic acid and the esterified derivative were equivalent in their efficacy to suppress the growth of USA300 in vitro. The esterified derivative thus provides an alternative to propionic acid as an antimicrobial agent against S. aureus.
TI  - An exploratory study of microbial diversity in sinus infections of cystic fibrosis patients by molecular methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For the first time microorganisms in CF sinuses are investigated by molecular methods in response to an absence of anaerobes in CF sinus samples during a two-year period at the Copenhagen CF center. METHODS: Endoscopic sinus surgery was performed in 19 CF patients. DNA from intact bacterial cells was investigated by 16S rRNA gene analysis and quantitative PCR. Results were compared to culture-dependent routine diagnosis. RESULTS: Molecular methods showed a large microbial diversity, which included undetected anaerobes that may play a pathogenic role. Importantly, the culture methods did not always detect known CF pathogens. Quantitative PCR showed generally a higher abundance of classic CF pathogens e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus compared with the anaerobe Propionibacterium acnes. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the culture methods in some cases may not be suitable as stand-alone method for this patient group, as diversity may be underestimated and important species undetected.
TI  - Influence of different additives and their concentrations on corneal toxicity and antimicrobial effect of benzalkonium chloride.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the ophthalmic additives responsible for modulating acute corneal epithelial toxicity induced by benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and investigate the ability of polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 40 (HCO-40) and polysorbate 80 (PS-80) to reduce the corneal toxicity and antimicrobial effects of BAC. METHODS: Cytotoxicity of the additives, which included glycerin, polyvinyl alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and PS-80, on rabbit corneal epithelial cells was examined using the cell proliferation assay in the presence and absence of 0.02% BAC. The corneal transepithelial electrical resistance change after a 60-second exposure to HCO-40 or PS-80 mixed with 0.02% BAC was measured in living rabbits. Corneal damage was examined using scanning electron microscopy. The antimicrobial activities of HCO-40 and PS-80 with 0.02% BAC against Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were assessed. RESULTS: Of all the tested additives, only PS-80 could prevent the BAC-induced cytotoxicity. Corneal epithelial barrier function disorder caused by 0.02% BAC was significantly alleviated by either PS-80 or HCO-40 in a concentration-dependent manner. Scanning electron microscopy images showed an improvement of BAC-induced corneal epithelial toxicity after the addition of HCO-40 or PS-80. The antimicrobial effect of the BAC against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. pneumoniae was reduced after adding HCO-40 or PS-80. CONCLUSIONS: HCO-40 and PS-80 reduce acute corneal toxicity and the antimicrobial effect of BAC. Possible interactions between BAC and other additives should be taken into consideration when evaluating the toxicity and antibacterial properties of BAC.
TI  - A preliminary report on the use of antibiotic-impregnated methyl methacrylate in  salvage cranioplasty.
AB  - In the setting of recurrent infection and multiple failed reconstruction attempts, the choice of the ideal reconstructive material for salvage cranioplasty remains a source of controversy in the literature. The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and utility of antibiotic-impregnated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) for salvage cranioplasty.A prospectively maintained database of all patients who underwent salvage cranioplasty using vancomycin and tobramycin-impregnated methyl methacrylate from January 2011 to July 2013 was reviewed. Vancomycin and tobramycin were mixed in PMMA, which was then applied to a rigidly fixed titanium mesh for reconstruction. Patients' demographics, indications, and outcomes of this technique were evaluated.Nine patients (mean age: 47 years) underwent vancomycin and tobramycin-impregnated PMMA reconstruction with a mean follow-up of 9.3 months (range 3.5-23 months). On average, these patients underwent 4 procedures (range: 1-15), which included repeat craniotomy, debridement for infection, and failed reconstructions over the course of 3.6 years (range: 7 months to 14 years) before salvage cranioplasty. All patients required salvage cranioplasty due to infection, with the most common bacteria isolated in culture being Propionibacterium acnes (n = 3), multiresistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (n = 3), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), and Enterobacter (n = 2). The average size of the craniectomy defect was 130 cm(2), and there were no incidences of postoperative infection, postoperative complications, or need for revisions.To conclude, in short-term follow-up, vancomycin and tobramycin-impregnated PMMA reconstruction appears safe and effective in salvage cranioplasty. Our early report represents a proof of concept--the true test is whether these short-term successes translate to stable long-term results.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of various fractions of longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.  Fen Ke) seed extract.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour. Fen ke) seed extracts were investigated using a disc diffusion method and also determining the minimal inhibitory concentration. The DL-P01-SI01 fraction showed that the strongest activity against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus at MIC 64 mug/mL, which was found to be due to the phenolic compounds. The HPLC analysis showed that the major phenolic compounds are gallic acid, corilagin, ethyl gallate and ellagic acid.
TI  - Outcome and treatment of postoperative spine surgical site infections: predictors of treatment success and failure.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI) is an important complication after spine surgery. The management of SSI is characterized by significant variability, and there is little guidance regarding an evidence-based approach. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors associated with treatment failure of SSI after spine surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 225 consecutive patients with SSI after spine surgery between July 2005 and July 2010 were studied retrospectively. Patients were treated with aggressive surgical debridement and prolonged antibiotic therapy. Outcome and risk factors were analyzed in 197 patients having 1 year of follow-up. Treatment success was defined as resolution within 90 days. RESULTS: A total of 126 (76 %) cases were treated with retention of implants. Forty-three (22 %) cases had treatment failure with five (2.5 %) cases resulting in death. Lower rates of treatment success were observed with late infection (38 %), fusion with fixation to the ilium (67 %), Propionibacterium acnes (43 %), poly microbial infection (68 %), >6 operated spinal levels (67 %), and instrumented cases (73 %). Higher rates of early resolution were observed with superficial infection (93 %), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (95 %), and <3 operated spinal levels (88 %). Multivariate logistic regression revealed late infection was the most significant independent risk factor associated with treatment failure. Superficial infection and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus were predictors of early resolution. CONCLUSION: Postoperative spine infections were treated with aggressive surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy. High rates of treatment failure occurred in cases with late infection, long instrumented fusions, polymicrobial infections, and Propionibacterium acnes. Removal of implants and direct or staged re-implantation may be a useful strategy in cases with high risk of treatment failure.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of plumbagin derivative-rich Plumbago indica root extracts and chemical stability.
AB  - The extraction studies and a one-step purification of the crude extract of Plumbago indica using silica-gel vacuum chromatography provided a plumbagin derivative-rich P. indica root extract (PPE). The PPE was standardised to contain total plumbagin derivatives not less than 13% w/w. Antibacterial activities of the standardised PPE and three naphthoquinones, plumbagin, elliptinone and 3,3'-biplumbagin, against Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were evaluated by using the microdilution assay. The bactericidal activities of the PPE against these bacteria were much stronger than those of elliptinone and 3,3'-biplumbagin and almost equal to those of plumbagin. Stability of the PPE was determined under various conditions through a period of four months. The PPE was stable over a period of four months when stored as a dried powder but only in a well-closed container protected from light under 4 +/- 2 degrees C.
TI  - Microbiology of hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa): a histological study of  27 patients.
AB  - Hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inverse) (HS) is a chronic skin disease primarily  affecting hair follicles. The aetiology of HS is unknown, but infection is believed to play some role. This retrospective study investigated the microbial colonization directly in skin appendices in HS skin samples. Archival samples from 27 patients with HS were screened by immunofluorescence labelling with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against Gram-positive bacteria, Propionibacterium acnes and Propionibacterium granulosum. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used for further species identification of Staphylococcus spp. Overall, 17 patients (63%) were found positive for bacterial colonization. Of these, 15 showed colonization in hair follicles and/or sinus tracts. The most commonly identified bacteria were DAPI labelled coccoids that were seen in 71% of the positive patients in the form of biofilms and microcolonies. P. acnes was found as biofilms in hair follicles of two patients. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were not detected in any sample. The results of this study indicate a common bacterial presence in HS skin lesions. Bacterial biofilms are not uncommon and their pathogenic role needs further evaluation.
TI  - The microbiome of the middle meatus in healthy adults.
AB  - Rhinitis and rhinosinusitis are multifactorial disease processes in which bacteria may play a role either in infection or stimulation of the inflammatory process. Rhinosinusitis has been historically studied with culture-based techniques, which have implicated several common pathogens in disease states. More recently, the NIH Human Microbiome Project has examined the microbiome at a number of accessible body sites, and demonstrated differences among healthy and diseased patients. Recent DNA-based sinus studies have suggested that healthy sinuses are not sterile, as was previously believed, but the normal sinonasal microbiome has yet to be thoroughly examined. Middle meatus swab specimens were collected from 28 consecutive patients presenting with no signs or symptoms of rhinosinusitis. Bacterial colonization was assessed in these specimens using quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. All subjects were positive for bacterial colonization of the middle meatus. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes were the most prevalent and abundant microorganisms detected. Rich and diverse bacterial assemblages are present in the sinonasal cavity in the normal state, including opportunistic pathogens typically found in the nasopharynx. This work helps establish a baseline for understanding how the sinonasal microbiome may impact diseases of the upper airways.
TI  - The role of the skin barrier in modulating the effects of common skin microbial species on the inflammation, differentiation and proliferation status of epidermal keratinocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin resident microbial species are often thought of either as pathogenic or commensal. However, little is known about the role of the skin barrier in modulating their potential for causing disease. To investigate this question we measured the effects of three microbial species commonly found on the skin (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes) on a reconstructed human epidermal model by either applying the bacteria on the model surface (intact barrier) or adding them to the culture medium (simulating barrier breach). RESULTS: When added to the medium, all of the tested species induced inflammatory responses and keratinocyte cell death with species-specific potency. P. acnes and S. epidermidis induced specific alterations in the expression of keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation markers, suggesting a barrier reparation response. S. aureus induced complete keratinocyte cell death. On the contrary, topically applied S. epidermidis and P. acnes caused no inflammatory response even when tested at high concentrations, while topical S. aureus induced a weak reaction. None of the tested species were able to alter the expression of keratinocyte differentiation or expression markers, when applied topically. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the skin barrier prevents the effects of common skin bacteria on epidermal keratinocyte inflammation, differentiation and proliferation and highlight the importance of skin barrier in defending against the pathogenic effects of common skin bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids against Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - New compounds are needed to treat acne and superficial infections caused by Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus due to the reduced effectiveness of agents used at present. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) are attracting attention as potential new topical treatments for Gram-positive infections due to their antimicrobial potency and anti-inflammatory properties. This present study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial effects of six LC-PUFAs against P. acnes and S. aureus to evaluate their potential to treat infections caused by these pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined against P. acnes and S. aureus, and the LC-PUFAs were found to inhibit bacterial growth at 32-1024 mg/L. Generally, P. acnes was more susceptible to the growth inhibitory actions of LC-PUFAs, but these compounds were bactericidal only for S. aureus. This is the first report of antibacterial activity attributed to 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (15-OHEPA) and 15-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (HETrE), while the anti-P. acnes effects of the six LC-PUFAs used herein are novel observations. During exposure to the LC-PUFAs, S. aureus cells were killed within 15-30 min. Checkerboard assays demonstrated that the LC-PUFAs did not antagonise the antimicrobial potency of clinical agents used presently against P. acnes and S. aureus. However, importantly, synergistic interactions against S. aureus were detected for combinations of benzoyl peroxide with 15-OHEPA, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and HETrE; and neomycin with 15-OHEPA, DGLA, eicosapentaenoic acid, gamma-linolenic acid and HETrE. In conclusion, LC-PUFAs warrant further evaluation as possible new agents to treat skin infections caused by P. acnes and S. aureus, especially in synergistic combinations with antimicrobial agents already used clinically.
TI  - Effect of introduction of antibiotic-impregnated shunt catheters on cerebrospinal fluid shunt infection in children: a large single-center retrospective study.
AB  - OBJECT: Infection after both primary and revision shunt surgeries remains a major problem in pediatric neurosurgical practice. Antibiotic-impregnated shunt (AIS) tubing has been proposed to reduce infection rates. The authors report their experience with AIS catheters in their large pediatric neurosurgery department. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective case review of consecutive shunt operations performed before (1993-2003) and after (2005-2009) introduction of AIS tubing, with analysis of shunt infection rates and causative organisms identified. RESULTS: The historical control group consisted of 1592 consecutive shunt operations (657 primary insertions), and the AIS study group consisted of 500 consecutive shunt operations (184 primary insertions). Patients ranged in age from 0-17 years. In the historical group, 135 infections were identified (8.4%). In the AIS study group, 25 infections were identified (5%), representing a significant reduction (p < 0.005). The latency to diagnosis of infection was 23 days in the historical group and 139 days in the AIS study group. The infection rates in infants 0-6 months of age were 12.2% (historical group) and 6.7% (AIS group, p < 0.005), and in infants 7-12 months of age the rates were 7.9% (historical group) and 2.7% (AIS group, p < 0.005). In the historical control group, the frequency rank order of causative organisms was coagulase-negative staphylococcus (51.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (31.6%), streptococcus or enterococcus spp. (8.8%), gram-negative organisms (4.4%), and Propionibacterium acnes (2.2%). Organisms responsible for infections in AIS were S. aureus (40%), followed by streptococcus or enterococcus spp. (20%), P. acnes and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (both 16%), and gram-negative organisms (4%). No unusually antibiotic-resistant bacteria were identified in either group. The authors further subdivided the AIS group into those undergoing primary AIS insertion (Subgroup 1), those undergoing revision of non-AIS systems using AIS components (Subgroup 2), and those undergoing revision of AIS systems using AIS components (Subgroup 3). Infection rates were 1.6% in Subgroup 1, 2.5% in Subgroup 2, and 11.7% in Subgroup 3. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism identified in infections of the Subgroups 2 and 3. CONCLUSIONS: Use of AIS tubing significantly improves shunt infection rates in both general pediatric and infant populations with no evidence of increased antibiotic resistance, which is in agreement with previous studies. However, the increased infection rate in revision surgery in children with AIS catheters in situ raises questions about their long-term application.
TI  - Prospective clinical evaluation of 1.5% levofloxacin ophthalmic solution in ophthalmic perioperative disinfection.
AB  - PURPOSE: Gram-positive cocci and Propionibacterium acnes are widely reported agents of infectious postoperative endophthalmitis. This multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the eradication effectiveness and safety profile of levofloxacin 1.5% ophthalmic solution (LVFX 1.5%) for use in perioperative disinfection. METHODS: Patients who were scheduled for cataract surgery were enrolled. The perioperative regimen of LVFX 1.5% was administered 3 times daily as follows: preoperative 3 days; the day of surgery (in the morning, 1 h before surgery, and immediately after surgery); and postoperative 2 weeks. Conjunctival sac scrapings were collected 3 times in the observation period; before preoperative administration, before iodine eyewash on the day of surgery, and after completion of postoperative administration. Isolated and identified microbial strains were assessed for antibacterial susceptibility. RESULTS: One hundred patients were enrolled and data obtained from 96 patients (mean age, 72.7 +/- 8.9 years). The preoperative eradication rate was 86.7% in total microbes. In the case of gram-positive cocci, the preoperative eradication rate was 100%, even though there were LVFX-registrant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which had a high minimum inhibitory concentration against LVFX, such as 32 mug/mL. On the other hand, that of P. acnes was 78.3%. No acquired drug resistance was suspected in all strains. Adverse drug reactions occurred in 4.2% patients, and all were slight. CONCLUSIONS: For ophthalmic perioperative disinfection, the LVFX 1.5% ophthalmic solution showed a good safety profile, and critical eradication of gram-positive cocci, including the fluoroquinolone-resistant strains.
TI  - Rapid systemic and local treatments with the antibacterial peptide dimer A3-APO and its monomeric metabolite eliminate bacteria and reduce inflammation in intradermal lesions infected with Propionibacterium acnes and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - When administered intramuscularly, the designer antibacterial peptide dimer A3-APO is highly efficacious in mouse models of Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus burn infections. Here we compared the efficacy of A3-APO and its monomeric metabolite in mouse models of S. aureus and Propionibacterium acnes intradermal infections following administration as intramuscular (i.m.) or topical treatments. In the animal models, either (i) the ears of CD-1 mice were infected with P. acnes or (ii) S. aureus was injected into burn wounds inflicted to the back. A3-APO or the monomer were injected intramuscularly at 5 mg/kg one to three times or were applied three times as 1% local treatment in phosphate-buffered saline or Vaseline((R)). Despite being inactive against the strains in vitro, in vivo the skin conditions of the mice were dramatically improved upon peptide treatment regardless of dosing frequency, administration mode or drug valency. In the P. acnes study, A3-APO statistically significantly reduced ear thickness and ear bacterial counts. The amount of ear connective tissue and epithelial macrophages correlated with therapeutic success. Bacterial load in the lesions was more representative of physical improvement than ear dimensions. In the S. aureus model, both peptides eliminated wound bacteria from >10(7) CFU/mg to almost background levels, with monomer treatment being somewhat more successful. In conclusion, A3-APO and its monomeric metabolite very efficiently ameliorate resistant aerobic and anaerobic intradermal infections, but the protection is apparently not due to direct bacterial killing. Immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory actions are likely involved. Nevertheless, topical and i.m. administrations are equally effective.
TI  - Role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. Following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285((R)) and Lactobacillus casei LBC80R((R)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical MRSA isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of S. aureus infection. As summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of S. aureus and clinical isolates of MRSA in vitro. The most active strains were Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, Propionibacterium acnes, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. acidophilus, L. casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactococcus lactis. Their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. L. acidophilus also inhibited S. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. In vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. S. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to L. acidophilus, whilst in vivo Bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. On the other hand, L. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against S. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with S. aureus in mice. Very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and MRSA, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of MRSA colonisation with probiotic use.
TI  - Bacteriological features of infectious spondylodiscitis at Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital of Rabat.
AB  - To review the bacteriological features of infectious spondylodiscitis and provide recommendations for the initial therapy which remains empirical in our context. Retrospective study including patients diagnosed with spondylodiscitis over a period of 4 years (2006-2009) at the Rabat Military Teaching Hospital. During the study period, we analysed 30 cases: the mean age was 49.9 years and 21 cases (70%) were male. The patients were predominantly hospitalized in neurosurgery department (15/30) followed by rheumatology department (10/30). The site of infection was lumbar in 21 cases (21/30), dorsal in 7 cases (7/30). 26 cultures were positive of which 19 (19/26) were monomicrobial. Tuberculosis (TB) was implicated in 10 cases (10/30) including 4 cases in association with common organisms (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium species). Brucella melitensis was isolated in 1 case. Infections caused by pyogenic bacteria were isolated in 15 cases of which 12 (12/15) revealed simple organisms including Gram-positive cocci in 9 cases (9/12) with 3 cases of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacilli in 3 cases (3/12) with 2 cases of P. aeruginosa. Blood cultures carried out for 16 patients were positive in 7 cases. The anatomopathologic exams carried out for 20 patients found in 6 cases epithelioid granulomata and giants cells with caseous necrosis in total concordance with TB culture. TB is the most frequent cause of spondylodiscitis in Morocco. Our study found the same frequency for non-specific and specific germs. Empirical treatment must take into account S. aureus and M. tuberculosis.
TI  - Primary cervical osteomyelitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical osteomyelitis accounts for only 3-11% of all cases of spinal osteomyelitis, and the diagnosis may be delayed. The characteristics of different pathogens causing cervical osteomyelitis are not fully understood, and there are few established guidelines for treatment. METHODS: The cases of six patients who presented with primary cervical osteomyelitis in the orthopedic department between January 2002 and March 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had been treated with anterior decompression, instrumentation, and autograft fusion. Data about preoperative and postoperative symptoms, neurological function, pain, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and the results of plain film and magnetic resonance imaging were reviewed. RESULTS: Intraoperative cultures revealed Staphylococcus aureus in three patients, Propionibacterium acnes in two, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one. The mean duration between symptoms and diagnosis was 7.2 weeks (range, 3-12 weeks). Three patients with S. aureus infections had relatively higher preoperative CRP levels (mean, 173 mg/L) than did the patients with P. acnes infections or tuberculosis (mean, 5.5 mg/L). However, bony destruction was less severe in patients with S. aureus infections than in those patients with P. acnes and tuberculosis. All CRP levels returned to normal in 12 weeks, and all six patients had a final stable cervical alignment and fusion. Ultimately, neurological function and pain score improved in all patients. CONCLUSION: Cervical osteomyelitis caused by S. aureus has an acute onset, higher CRP level, shorter duration from onset to diagnosis and thus causes less bony destruction. By contrast, cervical osteomyelitis caused by P. acnes and tuberculosis has an indolent course, a low or even normal CRP level, a longer duration from onset to diagnosis, and produces more severe bony destruction. Anterior decompression, instrumentation, and autograft fusion can be successfully used to treat primary cervical osteomyelitis. However, a mesh cage can also be a good alternative to an autograft.
TI  - A small peptide with therapeutic potential for inflammatory acne vulgaris.
AB  - A designed peptide named LZ1 with 15 amino acid residues containing strong antimicrobial activity against bacteria pathogens of acne vulgaris including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus. Especially, it exerted strong anti-P. acnes ability. The minimal inhibitory concentration against three strains of P. acnes was only 0.6 microg/ml, which is 4 times lower than that of clindamycin. In experimental mice skin colonization model, LZ1 significantly reduced the number of P. acnes colonized on the ear, P. acnes-induced ear swelling, and inflammatory cell infiltration. It ameliorated inflammation induced by P. acnes by inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-1beta. LZ1 showed little cytotoxicity on human keratinocyte and hemolytic activity on human blood red cells. Furthermore, LZ1 was very stable in human plasma. Combined with its potential bactericidal and anti-inflammatory properties, simple structure and high stability, LZ1 might be an ideal candidate for the treatment of acne.
TI  - Bacterial epidemiology of osteoarticular infections in a referent center: 10-year study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Management of osteoarticular infections combines surgical treatment with antibiotic therapy. For some teams the immediate postoperative regimen requires at least partly wide-spectrum probabilistic treatment while waiting for the microbiological results. This protocol exposes the patient to the selection of resistant bacteria and the hospital unit to a modification of its bacterial ecology. The objective of this study was to retrospectively describe the microbial epidemiology of the Traumatology and Orthopaedics Department of the Lille University Hospital over 10 years (2002-2011). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The bacterial species isolated in culture of osteoarticular samples were listed, after removing any duplicates. The antibiotics retained for follow-up were those used in treatment of these infections as well as those recognized as markers of resistance. For Gram-positive species, the antibiotics considered were methicillin, rifampicin, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, and linezolid; for the Gram-negative species, cefotaxime, cefepime, imipenem, and fluoroquinolones were considered. RESULTS: Of the 5006 strains isolated between 2002 and 2011, Gram-positive cocci accounted for more than 71%; Staphylococcus aureus 27%, and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) 54%. Contrary to S. aureus, resistance to methicillin, fluoroquinolones, and teicoplanin significantly increased in CoNS, reaching 44%, 34%, and 22%, respectively, of the strains in 2011. The proportion of streptococcal and enterococcal infections remained stable, a mean 7.4% and 5.3%, respectively, per year. Enterobacteria (12.5% of the isolates) were producers of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in 7.8% of the cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was involved in 3.6% of the infections, and 12% of the strains remained resistant to ceftazidime. Propionibacterium acnes accounted for 5.8% of the bacteria isolated and showed few antibiotic resistance problems. DISCUSSION: Stability in the distribution and the susceptibility of different bacterial species was noted over this 10-year period. Although the evolution of S. aureus resistance was favourable, the resistance of CoNS specially to methicillin and glycopeptides increased. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV. Retrospective cohort study.
TI  - Microbial flora of cochlear implants by gene pyrosequencing.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the microbial flora associated with cochlear implants (CIs) removed for infectious and noninfectious indications. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, controlled. SETTING: Academic, tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: All patients undergoing CI removal. INTERVENTION: CIs were removed with aseptic technique and processed for microbial identification. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: CI microbes were identified with routine culture and speciation and 16s deoxyribonucleic acid 454-pyrosequencing. RESULTS: All CIs had evidence of microbes. Propionibacterium acnes and Acidovorax facilis were more common on noninfected CIs (p = 0.005, 0.031). Staphylococcus aureus was more common on infected CIs (p = 0.003). The microbial profiles associated with CI infection were different from, but overlapped with those of noninfected CIs. Microbial culture with selective media identified pathogens not identified on pyrosequencing. CONCLUSION: Bacteria are present on all CIs, both with and without evidence of clinical infection, but species differ with clinical status. Empiric therapy for CI infections should include coverage for S. aureus. Gene pyrosequencing and selective culture techniques may yield complementary results that may impact the management of CI infections.
TI  - Periprosthetic shoulder infection.
AB  - Shoulder arthroplasty is considered the most effective surgical procedure for endstage shoulder pain from different causes including osteoarthritis, cuff-tear arthropathy, trauma, and tumors. Although uncommon and less frequent than knee or hip periprosthetic infection, periprosthetic shoulder infection represents a devastating complication and, despite treatment, is associated with unsatisfactory results. The most commonly identified microorganisms in periprosthetic shoulder infections are Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Propionibacterium acnes. Diagnosis is not always easy and mainly derives from the integration of clinical symptoms, laboratory exams, radiological studies and microbiological swabs. Different options are available for treatment, including antibiotic therapy, lavage and debridement with retention of the prosthesis, one-stage reimplantation, two-stage reimplantation with antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer and resection arthroplasty. The aim of this review is to describe the current knowledge regarding risk factors, etiology, diagnosis and treatment of periprosthetic shoulder infection.
TI  - Antityrosinase and antimicrobial activities from Thai medicinal plants.
AB  - Various dermatological disorders and microbial skin infection can cause hyperpigmentation. Therefore, screenings for whitening and antimicrobial agents from Thai medicinal plants have been of research interest. Seventy-seven ethanol plant extracts were investigated for antityrosinase activity, eleven samples showed the tyrosinase inhibition more than 50 % were further preliminary screening for antimicrobial activity by agar disc diffusion and broth micro-dilution methods. Artocarpus integer (Thunb.) Merr. (Moraceae) root extract, which showed the potential of tyrosinase inhibition with 90.57 +/- 2.93 % and antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes and Trichophyton mentagophytes with inhibition zone as 9.10 +/- 0.00, 10.67 +/- 0.09, 15.25 +/- 0.05 and 6.60 +/- 0.17 mm, respectively was selected for phytochemical investigation. Three pure compounds were isolated as artocarpin, cudraflavone C and artocarpanone. And artocarpanone exhibited anti-tyrosinase effect; artocarpin and cudraflavone C also showed the potential of antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. acnes with MIC at 2, 4 and 2 mug/ml, respectively and MBC at 32 mug/ml for these bacteria. So, these pure compounds are interesting for further study in order to provide possibilities of new whitening and antibacterial development. This will be the first report of phytochemical investigation of A. integer root.
TI  - Chitosan against cutaneous pathogens.
AB  - Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus are cutaneous pathogens that have become increasingly resistant to antibiotics. We sought to determine if chitosan, a polymer of deacetylated chitin, could be used as a potential treatment against these bacteria. We found that higher molecular weight chitosan had superior antimicrobial properties compared to lower molecular weights, and that this activity occurred in a pH dependent manner. Electron and fluorescence microscopy revealed that chitosan forms aggregates and binds to the surface of bacteria, causing shrinkage of the bacterial membrane from the cell wall. Of special relevance, clinical isolates of P. acnes were vulnerable to chitosan, which could be combined with benzoyl peroxide for additive antibacterial effect. Chitosan also demonstrated significantly less cytotoxicity to monocytes than benzoyl peroxide. Overall, chitosan demonstrates many promising qualities for treatment of cutaneous pathogens.
TI  - The microbiome of chronic rhinosinusitis: culture, molecular diagnostics and biofilm detection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria and fungi are believed to influence mucosal inflammation in  chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). However their presence and relationship to disease is debated. This study used multiple detection methods to compare microbial diversity and microbial abundance in healthy and diseased sinonasal mucosa. The utility of contemporary detection methods is also examined. METHODS: Sinonasal mucosa was analyzed from 38 CRS and 6 controls. Bacterial and fungal analysis was performed using conventional culture, molecular diagnostics (polymerase chain reaction coupled with electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) and fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Microbes were detected in all samples, including controls, and were often polymicrobial. 33 different bacterial species were detected in CRS, 5 in control patients, with frequent recovery of anaerobes. Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes were the most common organisms in CRS and controls, respectively. Using a model organism, FISH had a sensitivity of 78%, and a specificity of 93%. Many species were detected in both CRS and controls however, microbial abundance was associated with disease manifestation. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights some cornerstones of microbial variations in healthy and diseased paranasal sinuses. Whilst the healthy sinus is clearly not sterile, it appears prevalence and abundance of organisms is critical in determining disease. Evidence from high-sensitivity techniques, limits the role of fungi in CRS to a small group of patients. Comparison with molecular analysis suggests that the detection threshold of FISH and culture is related to organism abundance and, furthermore, culture tends to select for rapidly growing organisms.
TI  - The oral cavity is not a primary source for implantable pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillator infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To test the hypothesis that the oral cavity is a potential source for implantable pacemaker and cardioverter defibrillators infections, the bacterial diversity on explanted rhythm heart management devices was investigated and compared to the oral microbiome. METHODS: A metagenomic approach was used to analyze the bacterial diversity on the surfaces of non-infected and infected pacemakers. The DNA from surfaces swaps of 24 non-infected and 23 infected pacemaker were isolated and subjected to bacterial-specific DNA amplification, single strand conformation polymorphism- (SSCP) and sequencing analysis. Species-specific primer sets were used to analyze for any correlation between bacterial diversity on pacemakers and in the oral cavity. RESULTS: DNA of bacterial origin was detected in 21 cases on infected pacemakers and assigned to the bacterial phylotypes Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus schleiferi and Stapyhlococcus. In 17 cases bacterial DNA was found on pacemakers with no clinical signs of infections. On the basis of the obtained sequence data, the phylotypes Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus and an uncultured bacterium were identified. Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the only bacteria detected in pacemeaker (n = 25) and oral samples (n = 11). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of the coincidental detection of bacteria on infected devices and in the oral cavity is low and the detected bacteria are highly abundant colonizers of non-oral human niches.The transmission of oral bacteria to the lead or device of implantable pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillators is unlikely relevant for the pathogenesis of pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillators infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of southern African medicinal plants with dermatological relevance: From an ethnopharmacological screening approach, to combination studies and the isolation of a bioactive compound.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ethnobotanical reports on more than 100 southern  African medicinal plants with dermatological relevance have been highlighted, yet there is still limited scientific data to support claims for their antimicrobial effectiveness against skin pathogens. Guided by ethnobotanical data, this paper explores the antimicrobial efficacies of southern African medicinal plants used to treat skin ailments. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the antimicrobial properties of southern African medicinal plants against dermatologically relevant pathogens. The study also aimed at providing a scientific rationale for the traditional use of plant combinations to treat skin diseases and the isolation of the bio-active compound from the most active species, Aristea ecklonii (Iridaceae). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Organic and aqueous extracts (132) were prepared from 47 plant species and screened for antimicrobial properties against dermatologically relevant pathogens using the micro-titre plate dilution method. Four different plant combinations were investigated for interactive properties and the sum of the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) calculated. Isobolograms were used to further investigate the antimicrobial interactive properties of Pentanisia prunelloides combined with Elephantorrhiza elephantina at varied ratios. A bioactivity-guided fractionation process was adopted to fractionate the organic leaf extract of Aristea ecklonii. RESULTS: Plants demonstrating notable broad-spectrum activities (MIC values </=1.00mg/ml) against the tested pathogens included extracts from Aristea ecklonii, Chenopodium ambrosioides, Diospyros mespiliformis, Elephantorrhiza elephantina, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Gunnera perpensa, Harpephyllum caffrum, Hypericum perforatum, Melianthus comosus, Terminalia sericea and Warburgia salutaris. The organic extract of Elephantorrhiza elephantina, a plant reportedly used to treat acne vulgaris, demonstrated noteworthy antimicrobial activity (MIC value of 0.05mg/ml) against Propionibacterium acnes. Similarly, Diospyros mespiliformis reported for its traditional use to treat ringworm, also displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes (MIC 0.10mg/ml) and Microsporum canis (MIC 0.50mg/ml). The aqueous root extracts of Pentanisia prunelloides combined (1:1) with Elephantorrhiza elephantina displayed synergistic interactions (FIC values 0.31-0.38) against Staphylococcus aureus, gentamycin-methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans. Fractionation of Aristea ecklonii resulted in the isolation of the known bio-active compound, plumbagin, displaying noteworthy antimicrobial activity (MIC range between 2.00mug/ml and 16.00mug/ml). CONCLUSION: Most of the plant extracts demonstrated pathogen specific antimicrobial effects with a few exhibiting broad-spectrum activities. Positive antimicrobial effects noted for plants such as Elephantorrhiza elephantina and Diospyros mespiliformis used for acne vulgaris and ringworm infections, respectively, give some validation to their reported traditiona l uses. Synergistic interactions noted for Pentanisia prunelloides combined with Elephantorrhiza elephantina validate an enhanced antimicrobial effect when used in combination. Noteworthy antimicrobial activities (MIC range between 2.00mug/ml and 16.00mug/ml) were observed for plumbagin isolated from Aristea ecklonii.
TI  - Endophthalmitis isolates and antibiotic susceptibilities: a 10-year review of culture-proven cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the spectrum of organisms causing culture-proven endophthalmitis and their susceptibilities to commonly used antimicrobial agents over 10 years. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed of all cases with culture-proven endophthalmitis at a single institution from 2002 through 2011. The outcome measures included all intravitreal isolates identified as well as antibiotic susceptibilities. RESULTS: A total of 448 organisms were isolated during the study interval. The most common organisms identified were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 30.1% (135/448), Streptococcus viridians group in 10.9% (49/448), Staphylococcus aureus in 7.8% (35/448), Candida albicans in 5.8% (26/443), other coagulase-negative staphylococci in 6.0% (27/448), Propionibacterium acnes in 4.7% (21/448), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3.1% (14/448). Overall, 327 (72.9%) of 448 isolates were gram-positive organisms, 48 (10.7%) of 448 isolates were gram-negative organisms, 71 (15.8%) of 448 isolates were fungi, and 2 (0.4%) of 448 isolates were viruses. For gram-positive organisms, susceptibilities were the following: vancomycin, 100%; gentamicin, 88.0%; sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 77.5%; levofloxacin, 58.5%; oxacillin, 54.7%; ciprofloxacin, 51.0%; gatifloxacin, 51.0%; and moxifloxacin, 47.0%. For gram-negative organisms, susceptibilities were the following: ceftazidime, 100%; levofloxacin, 100%; ciprofloxacin, 95.0%; tobramycin, 90.6%; gentamicin, 80.6%; and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 59.4%. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, no single antibiotic provided coverage for all of the microbes isolated from eyes with endophthalmitis. Combination therapy generally is the recommendation as the initial empiric treatment of suspected bacterial endophthalmitis. Appropriate history and characteristic clinical features may guide the use of initial antifungal agents.
TI  - PCR-electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry: a new tool for the  diagnosis of infective endocarditis from heart valves.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction with an injection of the amplicons in an electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI-MS) technique was evaluated for the diagnosis of bacterial and yeast pathogens on 13 cardiac valves with suspected endocarditis. At the moment of surgery, 3/13 PCR-ESI-MS results matched with microbiological documentation. Nine PCR-ESI-MS results correlated with Duke's criteria, leukocytes, C-reactive protein and blood cultures before surgery. The PCR-ESI-MS result of the last valve failed to confirm the blood culture result obtained fifteen days before. With speed and accuracy, this method may be useful to assert microbiological identification and adapt treatment.
TI  - Sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: AABB Standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) products for microbial contamination. To date, there is no automated blood culture system cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for this application. Our objective was to validate the VersaTREK system (TREK Diagnostic Systems) for sterility testing of apheresis HPC products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four aerobic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, and Bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (Fusobacterium necrophorum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella loescheii, and Propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (Candida albicans) were spiked into apheresis HPC products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. Aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. DNA was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. RESULTS: All aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (TTP) was significantly shorter with aerobic bottles. C. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. Anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. No bacteria were detected by using 16S rRNA gene amplification at 10(4) CFUs/mL. CONCLUSION: Compared to culture, 16S rRNA gene amplification of HPCs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for HPC sterility testing. The VersaTREK system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of apheresis HPC products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 CFUs/mL. Inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest TTP for all species tested.
TI  - Fermentation of Propionibacterium acnes, a commensal bacterium in the human skin  microbiome, as skin probiotics against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Bacterial interference creates an ecological competition between commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Through fermentation of milk with gut-friendly bacteria, yogurt is an excellent aid to balance the bacteriological ecosystem in the human intestine. Here, we demonstrate that fermentation of glycerol with Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), a skin commensal bacterium, can function as a skin probiotic for in vitro and in vivo growth suppression of USA300, the most prevalent community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). We also promote the notion that inappropriate use of antibiotics may eliminate the skin commensals, making it more difficult to fight pathogen infection. This study warrants further investigation to better understand the role of fermentation of skin commensals in infectious disease and the importance of the human skin microbiome in skin health.
TI  - Percutaneous absorption and antibacterial activities of lipid nanocarriers loaded with dual drugs for acne treatment.
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop lipid nanocarriers that combine tretinoin and tetracycline for the efficient topical delivery to treat acne vulgaris. Two different nanocarriers, nanoemulsions (NEs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs), were prepared, and we examined their average size, zeta potential, drug encapsulation percentage, and drug permeation via the skin. The antibacterial activities of the nanosystems against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Propionibacterium acnes were evaluated by an agar diffusion assay and the amount of total protein. A ca. 200-nm particle size was achieved with the prepared nanoparticles. The size increased when incorporating a cationic surfactant. Dual-drug loading did not largely affect the size of negatively charged nanoparticles, but significantly reduced the particle size of positively charged nanocarriers. NEs and NLCs exhibited high entrapment of tretinoin which ranged 60-100%. Tetracycline mainly resided in the aqueous phase, with ca. 10% of molecules located at the particulate interface. An in vitro skin permeation study showed that NLCs enhanced tetracycline flux by about 2-times over the control solution. Tretinoin permeation was generally unaffected after nanoparticulate encapsulation. There was no significant difference in tretinoin delivery before or after tetracycline incorporation, while tetracycline permeation significantly decreased by 2-fold in the dual-drug system. Nanoparticulate loading mostly maintained the antibacterial activity of tetracycline. Negatively charged NEs and NLCs even strengthened the antibacterial ability against S. aureus compared to the control solution. This is the first report examining skin permeation and antibacterial activities of dual-drug nanocarriers for acne treatment.
TI  - Suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppuration (SUP) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. The aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with SUP in patients with chronic (CP) and aggressive (AgP) periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 156 patients with CP and 66 with AgP were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). The counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. Comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. Associations between frequency of SUP and bacterial species were analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of SUP in patients with CP was 24.4%, and in patients with AgP it was 30.3%, and the percentage of SUP sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (P >0.05). SUP sites from patients with CP had significantly higher counts of Veillonella parvula, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella nigrescens than SUP sites from patients with AgP (P <0.005). Significant positive correlations between high frequency of SUP and high levels of Actinomyces spp, Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with CP (P <0.05). In patients with AgP, Actinomyces oris, Propionibacterium acnes, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with SUP, whereas Prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with SUP (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SUP sites from patients with CP harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than SUP sites from patients with AgP. Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, T. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with SUP.
TI  - Successful clinical use of daptomycin-impregnated bone cement in two-stage revision hip surgery for prosthetic joint infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the safe and successful use of daptomycin-impregnated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement in the treatment of a case of recurrent prosthetic joint infection in a patient with multiple antibiotic allergies and past colonization with multiply antibiotic-resistant organisms. CASE SUMMARY: A 79-year-old female had a history of chronic recurrent left prosthetic hip infection. The patient had confirmed allergies to multiple antibiotics and a past history of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. At first-stage revision surgery, the infected prosthesis was removed and samples were sent for microbiologic culture. A spacer device was fashioned, with incorporation of daptomycin and gentamicin into the PMMA bone cement at a concentration of 5% w/w for each antibiotic. Systemic daptomycin and gentamicin were administered postoperatively for 14 days. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated from deep-tissue specimens. The patient made excellent postoperative progress and was discharged after 2 weeks. Second-stage revision surgery was performed at 6 months, with no signs of persistent infection. She remained well, pain free, and mobilizing independently 2 years later. DISCUSSION: Daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic, is approved for systemic treatment of endocarditis and skin and soft tissue infections. In vitro data demonstrate acceptable drug elution from and tensile strength of daptomycin-impregnated PMMA bone cement; however, clinical data are lacking. In our patient's case, the cement formulation was well tolerated, with no adverse effects detected, and demonstrated adequate mechanical strength in vivo. Infection with P. acnes, an unusual pathogen, was successfully treated. Further clinical studies are required to assess the efficacy of daptomycin-impregnated cement in infection with more typical pathogens, such as S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin impregnation of PMMA bone cement may be an option in cases in which patient or pathogen factors preclude use of routinely incorporated agents.
TI  - Trends of SAPHO therapy: should we be content?
AB  - The interventional studies with bone biopsy of the SAPHO lesions and microbiological investigation are a significant addition to a long range of publications showing an association of SAPHO with Propionibacterium acnes. Infectious agents isolated from SAPHO patients have merited special attention for many years. Their possible etiological role is supported by the pathogen isolation from different sites: anterior chest wall, spine, synovial fluid, bone tissue, and skin pustules. A range of pathogens have been found, including Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilusparainfluenzae, actinomyces, and even Treponemapallidum. P. acnes is a much more frequent pathogen and plays a particular role. The article focus is to emphasize limited use of interventional method to verify infection ethology of SAPHO in publications last two years. Successful therapy may be really effective and eradicative on a basis of the pathogen identification.Randomized control studies are needed to confirm the effects of antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Study of the vulvar skin in healthy Japanese women: components of the stratum corneum and microbes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the physiological conditions of vulvar skin in Caucasian populations have been characterized, little is known about these conditions in Japanese women. METHODS: Skin of the labia, groin, mons pubis, and inner thigh was examined in 40 healthy Japanese women outwith their menstrual period. Skin moisture, skin pH, ceramide content and inflammatory cytokine proteins of the stratum corneum, and bacterial flora were assessed. RESULTS: Skin moisture was found to be significantly lower in the labia than at the other three sites examined. No differences were found in skin pH. A significant difference in ceramide content was observed between the groin and inner thigh. The ratio of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) and interleukin-1alpha receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) was significantly higher in the labia than in the other sites. Numbers of total bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Lactobacillus spp. were greater in the labia and mons pubis sites compared with the inner thigh. Prevotella spp. were found only in the labia. CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese women, the skin at the labia is drier and more inflammatory than the skin at the groin, mons pubis, and inner thigh; this cannot be explained by the ceramide content and/or pH of the stratum corneum. Prevotella spp. may perform a key role in the vulvar skin of Japanese women.
TI  - In vitro emergence of rifampicin resistance in Propionibacterium acnes and molecular characterization of mutations in the rpoB gene.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Activity of rifampicin against Propionibacterium acnes biofilms was recently demonstrated, but rifampicin resistance has not yet been described in this organism. We investigated the in vitro emergence of rifampicin resistance in P. acnes and characterized its molecular background. METHODS: P. acnes ATCC 11827 was used (MIC 0.007 mg/L). The mutation rate was determined by inoculation of 10(9) cfu of P. acnes on rifampicin-containing agar plates incubated anaerobically for 7 days. Progressive emergence of resistance was studied by serial exposure to increasing concentrations of rifampicin in 72 h cycles using a low (10(6) cfu/mL) and high (10(8) cfu/mL) inoculum. The stability of resistance was determined after three subcultures of rifampicin-resistant isolates on rifampicin-free agar. For resistant mutants, the whole rpoB gene was amplified, sequenced and compared with a P. acnes reference sequence (NC006085). RESULTS: P. acnes growth was observed on rifampicin-containing plates with mutation rates of 2 +/- 1 cfu x 10(-9) (4096x MIC) and 12 +/- 5 cfu x 10(-9) (4 x MIC). High-level rifampicin resistance emerged progressively after 4 (high inoculum) and 13 (low inoculum) cycles. In rifampicin-resistant isolates, the MIC remained >32 mg/L after three subcultures. Mutations were detected in clusters I (amino acids 418-444) and II (amino acids 471-486) of the rpoB gene after sequence alignment with a Staphylococcus aureus reference sequence (CAA45512). The five following substitutions were found: His-437 --> Tyr, Ser-442 --> Leu, Leu-444 --> Ser, Ile-483 --> Val and Ser-485 --> Leu. CONCLUSION: The rifampicin MIC increased from highly susceptible to highly resistant values. The resistance remained stable and was associated with mutations in the rpoB gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the emergence of rifampicin resistance in P. acnes.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of a novel series of 17-azapentacyclo [6.6.5.0(2.7).0(9.14).0(15,19)]nonadeca-2,4,6,9,11,13-hexaen-16,18-dione derivatives.
AB  - In the search for novel antimicrobial agents, a series of new derivatives - N-substituted imides were prepared. All of the compounds were characterized by 'H NMR and ESI MS spectra. These derivatives were tested for antimicrobial activity. Microorganisms used in this study included aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and obligatory anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Propionibacterium acnes. Moreover, Candida albicans yeast was used. For representatives of all species the MICs of the investigated compounds were determined. Most of investigated derivatives had no antimicrobial activity (MIC > 512 mg/L) except the derivative 22 which showed slight activity against Gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial activities of vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in Thailand.
AB  - The vegetables and fruits commonly consumed in Thailand have been suggested as rich sources of beneficial phytochemicals. In this study, vegetables and fruits native to the Northeast region of Thailand were evaluated for antioxidant and antibacterial activities. For vegetables, the extracts of Limnophila aromatica (Lamk.) Merr. (extracted by 80% ethanol) and Sauropus androgynus (Linn.) Merr. (extracted by distilled water) were found to have significant levels of antioxidant activities measured by DPPH scavenging (IC5o at 4.92+/-0.01 and 4.71+/-0.01 mg mL-1, respectively) and FRAP antioxidant assays (74.38+/-0.25 and 74.00+/-0.04 mmol FeSO4 g-' of dry weight of vegetable, respectively) and also total phenolic compounds (10.96+/-0.02 and 10.34+/-0.01 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of dry weight of vegetable). For fruits, the extracts derived from Terminalia chebula Retz. when using distilled water and 80% ethanol as solvents were shown to have significantly high levels of DPPH scavenging (IC50 at 3.73+/-0.01 and 3.81+/-0.01 mg mL-1, respectively), FRAP antioxidant activities (80.85+/-0.10 and 65.93+/-0.11 mmol FeSO4 g-1of dry weight of fruit, respectively) and total phenolic compounds (13.10+/-0.06 and 10.66+/-0.02 mg gallic acid eq g-1 of dry weight of fruit, respectively). The antibacterial assays showed that Moringa oleifera Lam., Limnophila aromatica (Lamk.) Merr., Terminalia chebula Retz. and Phyllanthus emblica Linn. that were extracted using 80% ethanol as solvent were found to have antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Straphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Propionibacterium acnes. The results in this study may be useful for future application of edible plants that are native to Thailand to be used as cosmetic or therapqutic products.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antibacterial activities and anti-inflammatory effects of  Bifidobacterium spp. addressing acne vulgaris.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effect of Bifidobacterium spp. In the first part of the study, the antibacterial activities of live and sonicated cells, from a total of 23 Bifidobacterium species, on the growth of 5 different strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Six strains, of sonicated Bifidobacterium, exhibited antibacterial activity against staphylococci samples, and seven Bifidobacterium strains exhibited antibacterial activity on the growth of S. aureus S.P.-N2. In the second part of the study, we tested the antimicrobial activity, of Bifidobacterium against Propionibacterium acne KCTC3320, using the co-culture method. The loss of P. acnes viability, caused by B. adolescentis SPM0308 and B. longum SPM1207, was 84% and 75%, respectively (*p < 0.05). In the third part of the study, the anti-inflammatory activity of B. adolescentis SPM0308 and B. longum SPM1207 were assessed; nitric oxide (NO), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), production were tested using the murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line. Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells, with Bifidobacterium, decreased production of NO and TNF-alpha rather than LPS (100 ng/mL) treatment. The results suggest that B. adolescentis SPM0308 could be used as an effective control for P. acnes KCTC3320, and S. aureus, and reduce the risk of acne vulgaris development. We suggest that B. adolescentis SPM0308 may be a useful probiotic microorganism, for prevention of acne vulgaris, without adverse effects.
TI  - Blue light for infectious diseases: Propionibacterium acnes, Helicobacter pylori, and beyond?
AB  - Blue light, particularly in the wavelength range of 405-470 nm, has attracted increasing attention due to its intrinsic antimicrobial effect without the addition of exogenous photosensitizers. In addition, it is commonly accepted that blue light is much less detrimental to mammalian cells than ultraviolet irradiation, which is another light-based antimicrobial approach being investigated. In this review, we discussed the blue light sensing systems in microbial cells, antimicrobial efficacy of blue light, the mechanism of antimicrobial effect of blue light, the effects of blue light on mammalian cells, and the effects of blue light on wound healing. It has been reported that blue light can regulate multi-cellular behavior involving cell-to-cell communication via blue light receptors in bacteria, and inhibit biofilm formation and subsequently potentiate light inactivation. At higher radiant exposures, blue light exhibits a broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Blue light therapy is a clinically accepted approach for Propionibacterium acnes infections. Clinical trials have also been conducted to investigate the use of blue light for Helicobacter pylori stomach infections and have shown promising results. Studies on blue light inactivation of important wound pathogenic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have also been reported. The mechanism of blue light inactivation of P. acnes, H. pylori, and some oral bacteria is proved to be the photo-excitation of intracellular porphyrins and the subsequent production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. Although it may be the case that the mechanism of blue light inactivation of wound pathogens (e.g., S. aureus, P. aeruginosa) is the same as that of P. acnes, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested. Limited and discordant results have been reported regarding the effects of blue light on mammalian cells and wound healing. Under certain wavelengths and radiant exposures, blue light may cause cell dysfunction by the photo-excitation of blue light sensitizing chromophores, including flavins and cytochromes, within mitochondria or/and peroxisomes. Further studies should be performed to optimize the optical parameters (e.g., wavelength, radiant exposure) to ensure effective and safe blue light therapies for infectious disease. In addition, studies are also needed to verify the lack of development of microbial resistance to blue light.
TI  - Syk/Src pathway-targeted inhibition of skin inflammatory responses by carnosic acid.
AB  - Carnosic acid (CA) is a diterpene compound exhibiting antioxidative, anticancer,  anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, anti-metabolic disorder, and hepatoprotective and neuroprotective activities. In this study, the effect of CA on various skin inflammatory responses and its inhibitory mechanism were examined. CA strongly suppressed the production of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 from keratinocyte HaCaT cells stimulated with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and retinoic acid (RA). In addition, CA blocked the release of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) from RAW264.7 cells activated by the toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 ligands, Gram-positive bacterium-derived peptidoglycan (PGN) and pam3CSK, and the TLR4 ligand, Gram-negative bacterium-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). CA arrested the growth of dermatitis-inducing Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms such Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. CA also blocked the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and its upstream signaling including Syk/Src, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, inhibitor of kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha) kinase (IKK), and IkappaBalpha for NF-kappaB activation. Kinase assays revealed that Syk could be direct enzymatic target of CA in its anti-inflammatory action. Therefore, our data strongly suggest the potential of CA as an anti-inflammatory drug against skin inflammatory responses with Src/NF-kappaB inhibitory properties.
TI  - Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) resistance and antibiotic use in patients attending Australian general practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic resistance in the community, including transfer between bacteria, is a growing concern for clinicians. Acne is commonly treated in general practice, sometimes with antibiotics. The aim of this study is to measure the rate of carriage of antibiotic resistant Propionibacterium acnes 10 years apart in general practice and the relationship of resistance to type of treatment, as well potential effects on other flora. METHODS: Patients (N = 215) with acne presenting to Australian Capital Territory and south-eastern New South Wales general practices were swabbed for P. acnes in 1997-1998 and 2007. Clinical details were collected with questionnaires. In 2007 swabs were also taken for Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. GP's diagnostic classification of acne was tested using a set of standard photographs. RESULTS: Resistant P. acnes was isolated from 20 patients (9%) and the proportion that was resistant was the same in 1997-1998 and in 2007. Antibiotic use, particularly topical, was associated with P. acnes resistance. Resistance rates declined with the time elapsed since ceasing antibiotics. Use of retinoids was associated with a decreased chance of growing P. acnes (P = 0.008) but not with decreased resistance. Simultaneous resistance with S. aureus was not detected, but only in 30 patients was S. aureus isolated. CONCLUSIONS: P. acnes resistance was similar in 1997-1998 and in 2007.The chance of a patient carrying a resistant strain of P. acnes is significantly greater with recent exposure to antibiotics, and clinicians should limit prescribing where possible. Resistance disappears rapidly after ceasing antibiotics. Cross resistance with other organisms was not detected in this study.
TI  - Microbial spectrum and resistance patterns in endophthalmitis: a 21-year (1988-2008) review in northeast United States.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the microbial spectrum and antibacterial susceptibility of vitreous cultures in a tertiary referral center in Northeast United States. METHODS: All vitreous samples sent to the microbiology laboratory at a tertiary referral center from January 1988 to December 2008 were included in the study. The distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of all isolates from culture-positive samples were compared across 3 equal time periods 1988-1994, 1995-2001, and 2002-2008. RESULTS: One hundred forty-three positive cultures, where 11.9% (n=17) were polymicrobial, yielded a total of 160 isolates that consisted of 80.6% (n=129) gram-positive isolates, 12.5% (n=20) gram-negative isolates, and 6.9% (n=11) fungal isolates. The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (37.5%, n=60), Viridans Streptococcus (11.3%, n=18), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.9%, n=11). Other common gram-positive isolates include Propionibacterium acnes (5.6%, n=9), other Streptococcus species (4.4%, n=7), Staphylococcus aureus (4.4%, n=7), and Enterococcus faecalis (3.8%, n=6). The most common gram-negative isolates were Klebsiella species (3.1%, n=5), Moraxella species (3.1%, n=5), and Haemophilus species (2.5%, n=4). Vancomycin was effective against all CoNS, Sta. aureus, Viridans Streptococcus, and E. faecalis tested, and all Sta. aureus isolates were oxacillin sensitive. Of all CoNS isolates, 83.3% during 1988-1994, 73.1% during 1995-2001, and 100% during 2002-2008 were resistant to at least 1 of the antibiotics tested in the study with the last time period showing an increase in resistance (P=0.021, adjusted standard residual=2.0). CoNS showed a decreasing resistance over time to chloramphenicol and gentamicin (P=0.010, P=0.007, respectively) and an increase in resistance to penicillin and tetracycline during 2002-2008 (P=0.003, P=0.040, respectively). Susceptibility to other antibiotics did not show significant dependence on time. CONCLUSION: Bacteria causing endophthalmitis showed variable resistance to antibiotics over time. The importance of adequately treating endophthalmitis in the setting of these resistance pattern changes stresses the importance of periodic evaluation of causative organisms to ensure appropriate empiric treatment.
TI  - Cardiovascular implantable electronic device endocarditis treated with daptomycin with or without transvenous removal.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Nine patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic  device (CIED) endocarditis were treated with daptomycin after the failure of previous treatment. The blood and CIED lead cultures of 1 patient were negative. In the other 8 patients, we observed 6 monomicrobic infections and 2 polymicrobic infections. Overall, 10 strains were isolated in these patients: 4 methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2 methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 1 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus hominis, and 1 Propionibacterium acnes. The CIED was removed transvenously in 7 patients. Two patients were too sick for the removal of their CIED, and were cured with 6 mg/kg of daptomycin for 60 and 110 days, respectively, without adverse events. RESULTS: One patient died 4 days after the removal of his CIED because of a complicated abdominal aortic aneurysm. The other 8 patients were cured, with a mean follow-up of 17 +/- 8 months. The removed leads were negative, after daptomycin therapy, in 4 cases out of 7. The mean ratio between peak daptomycin concentration and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the causative strains was 38.3 +/- 18.5. For patients whose data were available, the ratio between peak daptomycin concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was 13.2 +/- 3.2. CONCLUSION: Daptomycin monotherapy may be a useful therapeutic tool in difficult-to-treat CIED endocarditis, resulting in a high rate of cures and sterilized leads removed. The ratio between peak daptomycin concentration and MIC or MBC may be useful as predictive tool for treatment success.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profiles of generalized aggressive and chronic periodontal  diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to distinguish between generalized aggressive (GAgP) and chronic periodontitis (CP) based on the subgingival microbial profiles predominant in these diseases. METHODS: Two-hundred and sixty subjects, 75 with GAgP and 185 with CP were recruited. Full-mouth clinical measurements were recorded. Individual subgingival plaque samples were taken from 7 sites per subject and analyzed for the prevalence and levels of 51 species by chequerboard. Differences between groups were examined by the Mann-Whitney test. Associations between bacterial species and GAgP were examined by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Actinomyces gerensceriae, Actinomyces israelli, Eubacterium nodatum and Propionibacterium acnes were detected in significantly greater counts in GAgP, whereas Capnocytophaga ochracea, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Staphylococcus aureus and Veillonella parvula were more predominant in CP patients (adjusted p < 0.001). E. nodatum (at mean levels >/=4 x 10(5)) increased significantly the probability of a subject being diagnosed with GAgP than CP (OR 2.44 [0.96-6.20]), whereas P. gingivalis (OR 0.34 [0.11-0.93]) and T. denticola (OR 0.35 [0.11-0.94]) were associated with CP. CONCLUSIONS: Very few subgingival species differed in prevalence and/or levels between GAgP and CP in this sample population. In particular, E. nodatum was strongly related to GAgP, whereas P. gingivalis and T. denticola were associated with CP.
TI  - Microbiome complexity and Staphylococcus aureus in chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to compare microbiological culture-based and culture-independent (16S rRNA gene sequencing) methodologies for pathogen identification in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients. We hypothesized that bacterial culture and DNA sequencing would yield largely concurrent results, although sequencing would detect greater bacterial diversity, and the sinonasal microbiomes of CRS patients would differ in composition and diversity compared with non-CRS controls. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. METHODS: Middle meatus swabs from CRS patients collected during endoscopic sinus surgery were analyzed by both clinical culture and broad-range analysis of 16S rRNA gene pyrosequences. RESULTS: A total of 21 swab samples from 15 CRS patients and five non-CRS controls were analyzed. One CRS patient was also swabbed 3 weeks postoperatively due to evidence of purulence during a clinical visit. All subjects had positive bacterial cultures, with a mean of 2.8 isolates per subject. The most prevalent cultivars were coagulase-negative staphylococci (15/20 specimens, 75%), Staphylococcus aureus (10/20, 50%), and Propionibacterium acnes (6/20, 30%). Among 57,407 pyrosequences generated, the most prevalent were from coagulase-negative staphylococci (21/21 specimens, 100%), Corynebacterium spp (18/21, 85.7%), P acnes (16/21, 76.2%), and S aureus (14/21, 66.7%). Bacterial diversity correlated with recent antibiotic use, asthma, prior sinus surgery, and relative abundance of S aureus. CONCLUSIONS: DNA pyrosequencing revealed greater biodiversity than culture, although in most cases culture results represented a subset of the abundant DNA sequence types. CRS patients were characterized by altered microbial composition (P = .02) and greater abundance of S aureus (P = .03).
TI  - Chitosan-solid lipid nanoparticles as carriers for topical delivery of tretinoin.
AB  - Tretinoin (TRE) or all-trans retinoic acid is employed in the topical treatment of various skin diseases including acne and psoriasis. However, its use is strongly limited by side effects and high chemical instability. TRE encapsulation in nanostructured systems reduces these problems. Chitosan is a biopolymer that exhibits a number of interesting properties such as bioadhesion and antibacterial activity. The aim of this work was to prepare and characterize solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) containing TRE, with and without addition of chitosan, to assess their in vitro cytotoxicity in keratinocytes and to evaluate their antibacterial activity against bacteria related to acne. SLN without (SLN-TRE) and with (SLN-chitosan-TRE) chitosan were prepared by hot high pressure homogenization. The hydrodynamic mean diameter and zeta potential were 162.7+/-1.4 nm and -31.9+/-2.0 mV for SLN-TRE, and 284.8+/-15.0 nm and 55.9+/-3.1 mV for SLN-chitosan-TRE. The SLN-chitosan-TRE exhibited high encapsulation efficiency, high physical stability in the tested period (one year), were not cytotoxic to keratinocytes and showed high antibacterial activity against P. acnes and S. aureus. Therefore chitosan-SLN can be good candidates to encapsulate TRE and to increase its therapeutic efficacy in the topical treatment of acne.
TI  - Periprosthetic infections after shoulder hemiarthroplasty.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To examine the rates and predictors of deep periprosthetic infections after shoulder hemiarthroplasty. METHODS: We used prospectively collected institutional registry data on all primary shoulder hemiarthroplasty patients from 1976-2008. We estimated survival free of deep periprosthetic infections using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Using univariate Cox regression analyses, we examined the association of patient-related factors (age, sex, body mass index), comorbidity (Deyo-Charlson index), American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, underlying diagnosis, and implant fixation with the risk of infection. RESULTS: A total of 1,349 patients, with a mean age of 63 years (SD, 16 years), 63% of whom were women, underwent 1,431 primary shoulder hemiarthroplasties. Mean follow-up was 8 years (SD, 7 years). Fourteen deep periprosthetic infections occurred during the follow-up, confirmed by medical record review. The most common organisms were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes, each accounting for 3 cases (21% each). The 5-, 10-, and 20-year prosthetic infection-free rates were 98.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 98.3%-99.5%), 98.7% (95% CI, 98.1%-99.4%), and 98.7% (95% CI, 98.1%-99.4%), respectively. None of the factors evaluated were significantly associated with risk of prosthetic infection after primary shoulder hemiarthroplasty, except that an underlying diagnosis of trauma was associated with a significantly higher hazard ratio of 3.18 (95% CI, 1.06-9.56) for infection compared with all other diagnoses (P = .04). A higher body mass index showed a non-statistically significant trend toward an association with higher hazard (P = .13). CONCLUSION: The periprosthetic infection rate after shoulder hemiarthroplasty was low, estimated at 1.3% at 20-year follow-up. An underlying diagnosis of trauma was associated with a higher risk of periprosthetic infection. These patients should be observed closely for development of infection.
TI  - Progression of cerebrospinal fluid cell count and differential over a treatment course of shunt infection.
AB  - OBJECT: The physiological reaction of CSF white blood cells (WBCs) over the course of treating a shunt infection is undefined. The authors speculated that the CSF WBC count varies with different infecting organisms in peak level and differential percentage of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. The authors hope to identify clinically useful trends in the progression of CSF WBCs by analyzing a large group of patients with successfully treated shunt infections. METHODS: The authors reviewed 105 successfully treated cases of shunt infections at Riley Hospital for Children. The study dates ranged from 2000 to 2004; this represented a period prior to the routine use of antibiotic-impregnated shunt catheters. They analyzed the following organisms: coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, Streptococcal species, and gram-negative organisms. The initial CSF sample at diagnosis was analyzed, as were levels over 14 days of treatment. Model fitting was performed to generate curves for the expected progression of the WBC counts and the differential PMN leukocytes, lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil percentages. RESULTS: Gram-negative organisms resulted in a higher initial (p = 0.03) and peak WBC count with a greater differential of PMN leukocytes compared with other organisms. Propionibacterium acnes infections were associated with a significantly lower WBC count and PMN leukocytes percentage (p = 0.02) and higher eosinophil percentage (p = 0.002) than other organisms. The pattern progression of the CSF WBC count and differential percentages was consistent for all infections. There was an initial predominance of PMN leukocytes, followed by a delayed peak of lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils over a 14-day course. All values trended toward zero over the treatment course. CONCLUSIONS: The initial and peak levels of CSF WBCs vary with the infecting organisms. The CSF cell counts showed a predictable pattern during the treatment of shunt infection. These trends may be useful to the physician in clinical decision making, although there is a wide range of variability.
TI  - [Determination of causative agents in ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments--multicenter study of causative agents and drug sensitivity of ocular infection by the Japanese Association for Ocular Infection part I].
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the causative agents of ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments due to selected criteria. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between September 22, 2007 and August 25, 2008, 890 bacterial strains were collected from 476 patients in 18 facilities nationwide participating in the Drug Sensitivity for Ocular Infection Study Group. Usual aerobic and anaerobic cultures, enrichment cultures, smears, and measurements of bacterial quantity were performed and the determination of causative agents was made from the results of smears and culture, the presence of polymorphonuclear cells and bacterial quantity. The selection was divided into two categories, causative agents and presumed causative agents. Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella bacilli, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were distinctively considered as specified bacteria. RESULTS: Among 890 strains, 18.8% were determined to be causative agents, and 15.1% were determined to be presumed causative agents. Among the bacteria detected in normal flora, 2.0% of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.6% of Propionibacterium acnes, and 38.3% of Corynebacterium spp. were determined to be causative agents. CONCLUSION: To determine the causative agents, the results of smears and bacterial quantity should be considered together with culture results. Bacteria constituting normal flora have the potential of becoming causative agents.
TI  - Facial nerve palsy caused by parotid gland abscess.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We present the first report of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes parotid abscesses complicated by facial nerve palsy. Facial nerve palsy secondary to parotid gland abscess is rare, with only eight previously reported cases. METHOD: Case reports and literature review concerning parotid abscess and facial nerve palsy presentation and management. CASE REPORTS: Within two months, two female patients presented with parotid gland abscess complicated by unilateral facial paralysis. Both were treated with intravenous antibiotics and surgery. In the first case, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultivated, in the other, Propionibacterium acnes was found. In the first case, facial nerve function did not recover. CONCLUSION: Parotid gland abscess can lead to facial paralysis. Both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes may be involved. Ultrasonography or computed tomography is recommended to exclude a parotid abscess in patients presenting with suppurative parotitis.
TI  - Isolation of three antibacterial naphthoquinones from Plumbago indica roots and development of a validated quantitative HPLC analytical method.
AB  - Three naphthoquinones, plumbagin (1), 3,3'-biplumbagin (2) and elliptinone (3), isolated from Plumbago indica roots by antibacterial bioassay-guided isolation, were used as standard markers for quantitative determination. A reversed-phase HPLC method was established for the simultaneous determination of the naphthoquinones in P. indica root extracts. The method utilised a Phenomenex(R) ODS column (4.6 x 150 mm, 5 microm) at 25 degrees C with a mixture of methanol and 5% aqueous acetic acid (80 : 20 v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.85 mL/min, and UV detection at 260 nm. The parameters of linearity, precision, accuracy specificity and sensitivity of the method were evaluated. The recovery of the method was 98.6-100.6% with good linearity (r (2 )>/= 0.9997) for all three naphthoquinones. A high degree of sensitivity, specificity as well as repeatability and reproducibility (R.S.D. values less than 5%) were also achieved.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - Folliculitis et perifolliculitis capitis abscedens et suffodiens controlled with  a combination therapy: systemic antibiosis (metronidazole plus clindamycin), dermatosurgical approach, and high-dose isotretinoin.
AB  - Folliculitis et perifolliculitis capitis abscedens et suffodiens is a rare disease of unknown etiology. It is a suppurative process that involves the scalp, eventually resulting in extensive scarring and irreversible alopecia. The condition is also known as 'acne necrotica miliaris' or 'Proprionibacterium' folliculitis. Most often the disease affects men of African-American or African-Caribbean descent between 20 and 40 years of age. The clinical picture is determined by fluctuating painful fistule-forming conglomerates of abscesses in the region of the occipital scalp. The cause of scalp folliculitis is not well understood. It is generally considered to be an inflammatory reaction to components of the hair follicle, particularly the micro-organisms. These include: bacteria (especially Propionibacterium acnes, but in severe cases, also Staphylococcus aureus), Yeasts (Malassezia species) and mites (Demodex folliculorum). The initial histopathologic finding is an exclusively neutrophilic infiltration followed by a granulomatous infiltrate. The treatment of the disease is usually difficult and often disappointing. Successful treatment with isotretinoin 1 mg/kg body mass could be achieved only after regular systematic administration in the course of 3-4 months. Here we describe a patient with eruptive purulent form of the disease, which has been controlled with combination therapy: systemic antibiosis with metronidazole and clindamycin, dermatosurgical removal of single nodular formations, and isotretinoin 1 mg/kg body mass for 3-5 months.
TI  - [Postoperative recurrence of subdural empyema].
AB  - We present a case of recurrent subdural post-surgical empyema by Proprionibacterium acnes after a first drained empyema in which no microbiological diagnosis was reached. P. acnes is a gram-positive anaerobic organism which is part of the saprophytic flora of the skin and others parts of the body. However, it can cause infections, as in the central nervous system, especially post-surgical infections in which can be the second more frequent organism after Staphylococcus aureus. P. acnes grows slowly and shows better growth in liquid anaerobic media. It is usually resistant to metronidazol and sensitive to penicillin. In postoperative central nervous system infections we must take into account the possibility of this organism, process the sample properly and keep touch with the Microbiology Department.
TI  - Evaluation of the ScanRDI(R) as a Rapid Alternative to the Pharmacopoeial Sterility Test Method: Comparison of the Limits of Detection.
AB  - Two sterility test methods, the ScanRDI(R) rapid sterility test and the United States Pharmacopeia/European Pharmacopoeia/Japanese Pharmacopoeia (USP/EP/JP) compendial sterility test, were compared with respect to the limits of detection for the presence of viable microorganisms in aqueous solutions at low inoculation levels. The ScanRDI(R) system employs a combination of direct fluorescent labeling techniques and solid-phase laser scanning cytometry to rapidly enumerate viable microorganisms from aqueous samples, whereas the compendial sterility test is a qualitative, growth-based method that uses a visual assessment of turbidity to indicate microbial contamination. Eight microorganisms were evaluated, seven compendial microorganisms (Clostridium sporogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans) and the Gram-positive anaerobe Propionibacterium acnes. The number of viable organisms was estimated using the ScanRDI(R) method and the conventional sterility test method using most probable number methodology. The mean difference between the methods was computed and 95% confidence intervals around the mean difference were estimated. The ScanRDI(R) method was found to be numerically superior and statistically non-inferior to the compendial (USP/EP/JP) sterility test with respect to the limits of detection for all organisms tested.
TI  - Infection after shoulder surgery.
AB  - Infection after shoulder surgery is rare but potentially devastating. Normal skin flora, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Propionibacterium acnes, are the most commonly isolated pathogens. Perioperative measures to prevent infection are of paramount importance, and clinical acumen is necessary for diagnosis. Superficial infections may be managed with local wound measures and antibiotics; deep infections require surgical debridement in combination with antibiotic treatment. Treating physicians must make difficult decisions regarding antibiotic duration and the elimination of the offending organisms by resection arthroplasty, direct implant exchange, or staged revision arthroplasty. Eradication of a deep infection is usually successful, but the course of treatment is often protracted, and tissue destruction and scar may adversely affect functional outcome.
TI  - Deep brain stimulation hardware-related infections: a report of 12 cases and review of the literature.
AB  - In this monocentric study, the median delay between deep brain stimulation implantation and infection was 28 days (range, 8-820). Infections limited to generator (n = 4) required partial hardware removal, whereas infections involving frontal or retroauricular sites (n = 7) required total removal. Surgical samples yielded Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 2), Propionibacterium acnes, and Micrococcus species.
TI  - Indole-3-acetic acid: a potential new photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy of acne vulgaris.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: ALA (5-aminolevulinic acid) photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a new treatment option for acne. However, it needs a relatively long incubation period and adverse effects are common. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is not toxic by itself but produces free radicals with ultraviolet B. In this study we examined the potential of IAA as a photosensitizer for acne treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Free radical formation was measured after visible light irradiation of IAA. Antimicrobial effect was evaluated by assessing growth suppression of Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus after IAA PDT. To evaluate the histological changes, skin biopsies were performed on nude mice skin after IAA PDT. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of IAA PDT, 14 acne patients were treated with the following IAA PDT regimen: three times each with a 15 minutes incubation period and a 2-week interval. The number of inflammatory lesions and the amount of sebum secretion were then assessed. RESULTS: IAA produced free radicals with green light irradiation. Importantly, IAA lost its photosensitizing ability after exposure to certain amount of light. This implies IAA PDT would not require post-procedure photo-protection. The growth of P. acnes and S. aureus were significantly suppressed with IAA PDT. In addition, IAA PDT treated skin showed destruction of follicular ostia epithelium. Interestingly, there was no significant difference between a 4 hours and a 30 minutes incubation, which means that longer absorption time is not necessary for IAA PDT. In the clinical study, inflammatory lesions and sebum secretion were significantly reduced. The procedure was painless and no adverse effect was observed. Photo-protection was not performed and there were no further phototoxic responses. CONCLUSIONS: IAA PDT has therapeutic effects on acne via its antimicrobial activities, its sebum-reducing effect and through relieving follicular occlusion. It is a very simple and safe treatment option for acne.
TI  - Clinical significance of positive cranial bone flap cultures and associated risk  of surgical site infection after craniotomies or craniectomies.
AB  - OBJECT: The risk of surgical site infection (SSI) after craniotomies or craniectomies in patients in whom contaminated bone flaps have been reimplanted has not been determined. The objectives of this study were to identify the prevalence of bone flaps with positive cultures--especially those contaminated with Propionibacterium acnes--to assess the risk of SSI after reimplanting (either during the initial operation or subsequently) bone flaps with positive cultures, and to identify risk factors for SSI following the initial craniotomies or craniectomies. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of cases in which patients underwent craniotomy/craniectomy procedures between January and October 2007 in the neurosurgery department at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. They also reviewed processes and procedures and did pulsed field gel electrophoresis of P. acnes isolates to look for a common source of contamination. They then conducted a prospective cohort study that included all patients who underwent craniotomy/craniectomy procedures between November 2007 and November 2008 and met the study criteria. For the cohort study, the authors obtained cultures from each patient's bone flap during the craniotomy/craniectomy procedures. Data about potential risk factors were collected by circulating nurses during the procedures or by a research assistant who reviewed medical records after the procedures. An infection preventionist independently identified SSIs through routine surveillance using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definitions. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed to determine the association between SSI and potential risk factors. RESULTS: The retrospective review did not identify specific breaks in aseptic technique or a common source of P. acnes. Three hundred seventy-three patients underwent 393 craniotomy/craniectomy procedures during the cohort study period, of which 377 procedures met the study criteria. Fifty percent of the bone flaps were contaminated by microorganisms, primarily skin flora such as P. acnes, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Staphylococcus aureus. Reimplanting bone flaps that had positive culture results did not increase the risk of infection after the initial craniotomy/craniectomy procedures and the subsequent cranioplasty procedures (p = 0.80). Allowing the skin antiseptic to dry before the procedures (p = 0.04, OR 0.26) was associated with lower risk of SSIs. Female sex (p = 0.02, OR = 3.49) was associated with an increased risk of SSIs; Gliadel wafer implants (p = 0.001, OR = 8.38) were associated with an increased risk of SSIs after procedures to treat tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Operative factors such as the way the skin is prepared before the incision rather than the skin flora contaminants on the bone flaps may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SSIs after craniotomy/craniectomy. Gliadel wafers significantly increased the risk of SSI after procedures to treat tumors.
TI  - Interactions between various microbes and ginseng botanicals.
AB  - Three kinds of interactions occur between ginseng botanicals and microorganisms:  a) spoilage of the botanical by various fungi (e.g., Aspergillus, Penicillium, Alternaria, and Eurotium species) and bacteria; b) transformation of ginsenosides into more bioactive forms by bacteria such as Intrasporangium sp. GS603, Microbacterium sp. GS514, Caulobacter leidyia, Bifidobacterium sp. Int57, Bifidobacterium sp. SJ32, Fusobacterium sp. and Bacteroides sp., and moulds (e.g., Aspergillus niger, Fusarium sacchari, Paecilomyces bainier sp. 229, Rhizopus stolonifer, Myrothecium verrucaria and Acremonium strictum); and c) inhibition of certain bacteria (Propionibacterium acnes, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium oxysporum) and viruses by ginseng constituents.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus hijacks a skin commensal to intensify its virulence: immunization targeting beta-hemolysin and CAMP factor.
AB  - The need for a new anti-Staphylococcus aureus therapy that can effectively cripple bacterial infection, neutralize secretory virulence factors, and lower the risk of creating bacterial resistance is undisputed. Here, we propose what is, to our knowledge, a previously unreported infectious mechanism by which S. aureus may commandeer Propionibacterium acnes, a key member of the human skin microbiome, to spread its invasion and highlight two secretory virulence factors (S. aureus beta-hemolysin and P. acnes CAMP (Christie, Atkins, Munch-Peterson) factor) as potential molecular targets for immunotherapy against S. aureus infection. Our data demonstrate that the hemolysis and cytolysis by S. aureus were noticeably augmented when S. aureus was grown with P. acnes. The augmentation was significantly abrogated when the P. acnes CAMP factor was neutralized or beta-hemolysin of S. aureus was mutated. In addition, the hemolysis and cytolysis of recombinant beta-hemolysin were markedly enhanced by recombinant CAMP factor. Furthermore, P. acnes exacerbated S. aureus-induced skin lesions in vivo. The combination of CAMP factor neutralization and beta-hemolysin immunization cooperatively suppressed the skin lesions caused by coinfection of P. acnes and S. aureus. These observations suggest a previously unreported immunotherapy targeting the interaction of S. aureus with a skin commensal.
TI  - Sinogenic orbital and subperiosteal abscesses: microbiology and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus incidence.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the current bacteriology and the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in orbital and subperiosteal abscesses of paranasal sinus disease origin. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: An otolaryngology and ophthalmology specialty hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients were treated between 1994 and 2008 for orbital or subperiosteal abscess and paranasal sinusitis, confirmed by imaging and surgical intervention; 46 had operative culture specimens and comprise the study cohort. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 28 years; one third were younger than 18. Nearly twice as many patients had subperiosteal (n = 30) as had orbital abscesses (n = 16). In 12 patients (26%), cultures were negative or grew only skin flora contaminants (coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids, and Propionibacterium acnes). Fifteen patients (33%) grew more than one pathogen. Streptococci were isolated in 17 of the 46 cases (37%), S. aureus in 13 (28.3%), gram-negative bacilli in eight (17.4%), and anaerobes in nine (19.6%). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus accounted for three (23.1%) of the S. aureus isolates and 6.5 percent of the total cases. CONCLUSION: Abscess cultures grew a mixture of bacteria, including gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes. Although streptococci were the most common genus of bacteria isolated, S. aureus was the single most common pathogen recovered and one fourth of these cases were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Given the significant morbidity that may result from inadequate treatment, an antibiotic active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus should be included in the initial broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment regimen of orbital and subperiosteal abscesses of sinusitis origin until culture results are available.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Thai herbal extracts on acne involved microorganism.
AB  - Ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of 18 Thai medicinal plants were investigated for their antibacterial activity against Propionibacterium acnes, Stapylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis. Thirteen plant extracts were capable of inhibiting the growth of P. acnes and S. epidermidis, while 14 plant extracts exhibited an inhibitory effect on S. aureus. Based on the broth dilution method, the ethyl acetate extract of Alpinia galanga (L.) Wild. (Zingiberaceae) rhizome showed the strongest antibacterial effect against P. acnes, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of 156.0 and 312.0 microg/mL, respectively. On the basis of bioassay-guided purification, the ethyl acetate extract was isolated to afford the antibacterial active compound, which was identified as 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate (1'-ACA). 1'-ACA had a strong inhibitory effect on P. acnes with MIC and MBC values of 62.0 and 250.0 microg/mL, respectively. Thus, 1'-ACA was used as an indicative marker for standardization of A. galanga extract using high performance liquid chromatography. These results suggest that A. galanga extract could be an interesting agent for further studies on an alternative treatment of acne.
TI  - The development of antimicrobial resistance due to the antibiotic treatment of acne vulgaris: a review.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review recent studies on the use of antibiotics in acne vulgaris which provide insight into the development of antimicrobial resistance. DATA SOURCES: Sources for this article were identified by searching the English literature by Medline for the period 1960 to March 2009. STUDY SELECTION: The following relevant terms were used: acne, acne vulgaris, acne and antibiotic therapy, acne and antimicrobial resistance, acne and resistance mechanisms, acne and systemic infections, acne and antibiotic resistance and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), acne and antibiotic resistance and upper respiratory infection. DATA SYNTHESIS: Both correct and incorrect use of antibiotics for acne vulgaris can promote antimicrobial resistance. The development of this resistance is promoted by several factors, including antibiotic monotherapy, long-term administration of antibiotics, indiscriminate use outside their strict indications, dosing below the recommended levels, and the administration of antibiotics without concurrent benzoyl peroxide and/or topical retinoids. CONCLUSION: Long-term use of antibiotics in the treatment of acne vulgaris can lead to antimicrobial resistance with serious and intractable problems not limited to Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), the skin and acne vulgaris themselves, but also to other bacterial species, with systemic consequences. These findings suggest that antibiotics should be prescribed in combination with benzoyl peroxide and/or topical retinoids and be limited to a maximum of several months.
TI  - [Clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in BACTEC9240 blood culture system].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (TTP). We evaluated the clinical relevance of TTP in the BACTEC9240 system (Becton-Dickinson, USA). METHODS: A total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. TTP was monitored from each of BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F (BD) or Pediatric Plus/F and Lytic Anaerobic/F bottles, and the differential time-to-positivity (DTP) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. RESULTS: The average TTP of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. While the average TTP values for Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for Candida spp., anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3 hr, respectively. The negative predictive values of TTP over 24 hr to predict Staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and S. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecalis showed shorter TTP in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. DTP of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp. CONCLUSIONS: TTP can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. The shorter TTP in anaerobic vials of certain Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. DTP is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp.
TI  - Evaluation of the epinecidin-1 peptide as an active ingredient in cleaning solutions against pathogens.
AB  - We tested the activity of epinecidin-1, a novel antimicrobial peptide structurally related to pleurocidin, in commercial cleaning solutions stored at 4 and 25 degrees C for 7 and 14 days. The peptide's activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, and Candida albicans were measured in a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination, minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) determination, disk diffusion test, and a count of the bacterial numbers. Exposure to epinecidn-1 in a cleaning solution following MIC value comparisons in the disk diffusion test and counts of bacterial numbers after 16, 24, 48, and 72 h suggested that bacterial numbers were much lower than those treated with only commercial cleaning solutions for all bacteria. The efficacy of the antimicrobial activities of inhibiting bacterial numbers by epinecidin-1 in cleaning solutions at a low pH and a low temperature was not affected. Given its simple structure and antimicrobial activity, epinecidin-1 may be a useful component of microbicides designed to prevent pathogen infections and/or remediate abnormal vaginal or skin flora.
TI  - Syntheses and antibacterial activities of diterpene catechol derivatives with abietane, totarane and podocarpane skeletons against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - Natural catechol, quinone and quinone methide diterpenes with abietane (15-deoxyfuerstione, taxodione) and totarane (dispermone, 12,13-dihydroxy-8,11,13-totaratriene-6-one), and podocarpane (nimbidiol, deoxynimbidiol) skeletons were synthesized using ortho-oxidation of phenol with meta-chlorobenzoyl peroxide. Minimum inhibitory activities of these diterpenes and previously synthesized natural diterpenes were measured against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Propionibacterium acnes, which cause serious skin infection associated with acne. Abietaquinone methide and 8,11,13-totaratriene-12,13-diol showed potent activities against S. aureus (MRSA) and P. acnes, and no serious toxicity by oral dose to mice.
TI  - The human nasal microbiota and Staphylococcus aureus carriage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonization of humans with Staphylococcus aureus is a critical prerequisite of subsequent clinical infection of the skin, blood, lung, heart and other deep tissues. S. aureus persistently or intermittently colonizes the nares of approximately 50% of healthy adults, whereas approximately 50% of the general population is rarely or never colonized by this pathogen. Because microbial consortia within the nasal cavity may be an important determinant of S. aureus colonization we determined the composition and dynamics of the nasal microbiota and correlated specific microorganisms with S. aureus colonization. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Nasal specimens were collected longitudinally from five healthy adults and a cross-section of hospitalized patients (26 S. aureus carriers and 16 non-carriers). Culture-independent analysis of 16S rRNA sequences revealed that the nasal microbiota of healthy subjects consists primarily of members of the phylum Actinobacteria (e.g., Propionibacterium spp. and Corynebacterium spp.), with proportionally less representation of other phyla, including Firmicutes (e.g., Staphylococcus spp.) and Proteobacteria (e.g. Enterobacter spp). In contrast, inpatient nasal microbiotas were enriched in S. aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis and diminished in several actinobacterial groups, most notably Propionibacterium acnes. Moreover, within the inpatient population S. aureus colonization was negatively correlated with the abundances of several microbial groups, including S. epidermidis (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The nares environment is colonized by a temporally stable microbiota that is distinct from other regions of the integument. Negative association between S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and other groups suggests microbial competition during colonization of the nares, a finding that could be exploited to limit S. aureus colonization.
TI  - A biofilm approach to detect bacteria on removed spinal implants.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This is a prospective study comparing the diagnosis of spinal implant infection by conventional peri-implant tissue culture with a technique which uses a combination of vortexing and bath sonication to dislodge bacteria growing as a biofilm on the surface of retrieved spinal implants. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the biofilm-sampling technique would be more sensitive than peri-implant tissue culture. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Culture of peri-implant tissue is inaccurate for the diagnosis of orthopedic device-related infection; cultures taken from the implant may be more sensitive. We have developed a technique which uses vortexing-bath sonication to sample bacterial biofilms on the surface of retrieved hip and knee implants, and shown that it is more sensitive than peri-prosthetic tissue culture for the microbiologic diagnosis of prosthetic knee, hip, and shoulder infection. METHODS: We compared peri-implant tissue culture to the vortexing-bath sonication technique which samples bacterial biofilm on the surface of retrieved spinal implants, for the diagnosis of spinal implant infection. In addition, we compared detection of Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium acnes by rapid cycle real-time polymerase chain reaction with culture of sonicate fluid. RESULTS: A total of 112 subjects were studied; 22 had spinal implant infection. The sensitivities of peri-implant tissue and sonicate fluid culture were 73% and 91% (P = 0.046), and the specificities were 93% and 97%, respectively. P. acnes and coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequent microorganisms detected among subjects with spinal implant infection, with P. acnes detected in 56 and 45%, and coagulase-negative staphylococci detected in 31 and 40% of peri-implant tissue and sonicate fluid cultures, respectively. Compared with the culture of sonicate fluid, polymerase chain reaction was 100 and 67% sensitive for the detection of culture-positive Staphylococcus and P. acnes spinal implant infection, respectively. CONCLUSION: Implant sonication followed by culture is more sensitive than peri-implant tissue culture for the microbiologic diagnosis of spinal implant infection.
TI  - Transdermal absorption enhancement through rat skin of gallidermin loaded in niosomes.
AB  - Gallidermin (Gdm) loaded in anionic niosomes composed of Tween 61/CHL/DP (1:1:0.05 molar ratio) gave the highest entrapment efficiency (45.06%). This formulation gave antibacterial activity against Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus with the MIC and MBC of 3.75 and 7.5; 7.5 and 15 microg/microl, respectively. Gdm loaded in niosomes was more chemically stable than Gdm in aqueous solution of about 1.5 times. Gdm loaded and unloaded in niosomes were not found in the receiver solution investigated by vertical Franz diffusion cells at 37 degrees C for 6h. Gdm loaded in niosomes showed higher cumulative amounts in viable epidermis and dermis (VED) of rat skin of about 2 times more than unloaded Gdm. Gdm loaded in niosomes and incorporated in gel exhibited the highest cumulative amounts (82.42+/-9.28 microg cm(-2)) and fluxes (13.74+/-1.55 microg cm(-2)h(-1)) in stratum corneum (SC) and comparative cumulative amounts (183.16+/-30.32 microg cm(-2)) and fluxes (25.74+/-5.05 microg cm(-2)h(-1)) in VED to the unloaded Gdm incorporated in gel. This study has suggested that Gdm loaded in anionic niosomes and incorporated in gel is the superior topical antibacterial formulation because of the high accumulation in the skin with no risk of systemic effect.
TI  - Bacterial colonization and infection of electrophysiological cardiac devices detected with sonication and swab culture.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electrophysiological cardiac devices are increasingly used. The frequency of subclinical infection is unknown. We investigated all explanted devices using sonication, a method for detection of microbial biofilms on foreign bodies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients in whom cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter/defibrillators were removed at our institution between October 2007 and December 2008 were prospectively included. Devices (generator and/or leads) were aseptically removed and sonicated, and the resulting sonication fluid was cultured. In parallel, conventional swabs of the generator pouch were performed. A total of 121 removed devices (68 pacemakers, 53 implantable cardioverter/defibrillators) were included. The reasons for removal were insufficient battery charge (n=102), device upgrading (n=9), device dysfunction (n=4), or infection (n=6). In 115 episodes (95%) without clinical evidence of infection, 44 (38%) grew bacteria in sonication fluid, including Propionibacterium acnes (n=27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=11), Gram-positive anaerobe cocci (n=3), Gram-positive anaerobe rods (n=1), Gram-negative rods (n=1), and mixed bacteria (n=1). In 21 of 44 sonication-positive episodes, bacterial counts were significant (>or=10 colony-forming units/mL of sonication fluid). In 26 sterilized controls, sonication cultures remained negative in 25 cases (96%). In 112 cases without clinical infection, conventional swab cultures were performed: 30 cultures (27%) were positive, and 18 (60%) were concordant with sonication fluid cultures. Six devices and leads were removed because of infection, growing Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mitis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci in 6 sonication fluid cultures and 4 conventional swab cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria can colonize cardiac electrophysiological devices without clinical signs of infection.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of minerals from ores indigenous to Korea.
AB  - We tested the antibacterial properties of a mix of minerals consisting mainly of  sericite, talc, and halloysite from Korea. The preparation showed clear growth inhibition of the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus, as well as the anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes. These results indicate that this preparation, made from ore minerals indigenous to Korea, could be used to develop new antibacterial reagents.
TI  - Syntheses of carnosic acid and carnosol, anti-oxidants in Rosemary, from pisiferic acid, the major constituent of Sawara.
AB  - Carnosic acid (2), a major anti-oxidant in rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), was synthesized from pisiferic acid (1), the major constituent of Sawara (Chamaecyparis pisifera), via ortho-oxidation of the phenol using meta-chlorobenzoyl peroxide (mCBPO), chloroacetyl meta-chlorobenzoyl peroxide (CAMCBPO) or 2-iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX). Carnosol (3), another anti-oxidant in rosemary, was synthesized from carnosic acid by oxidation with silver oxide. Potent antibacterial activities against Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC 6919) (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) mug/ml) and Staphylococcus aureus ME/GM/TC Resistant (ATCC 33592) (MIC mug/ml) of carnosic acid and carnosol were reported.

TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of silver-processed catheters for neurosurgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of silver-processed catheters for use in neurosurgery using clinically predictive tests. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of a commercially available silver-processed external ventricular drain catheter was evaluated against Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli and Propionibacterium acnes. Non-impregnated catheters were used as controls. Two assays were performed: (i) testing the ability of the catheter to kill 100% of the attached bacteria (tK100); and (ii) in vitro challenge to determine the ability to prevent colonization under flow conditions. High and low inocula (10(4) and 10(7) cfu/mL) were used. Silver-processed and control catheters were examined by scanning electron microscopy and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy; electron back-scatter and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses were used to investigate the distribution of silver within the processed catheter. RESULTS: The silver-processed catheters were not able to kill any of the bacteria tested in the tK100 assay at high inoculum. At low inoculum S. epidermidis was eradicated and some activity was seen against E. coli but without complete eradication. MRSA was also not eradicated even at low inoculum. The in vitro challenge test showed no prevention of colonization for any of the strains. Silver particles were shown to be >500 nm in size. CONCLUSIONS: The commercial silver-impregnated catheter was not able to eradicate MRSA or E. coli and while it showed activity against S. epidermidis in one assay it was unable to prevent colonization in vitro under in-flow conditions. This is consistent with clinical studies on silver-processed catheters.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and stability of rhinacanthins-rich Rhinacanthus nasutus extract.
AB  - Rhinacanthins-rich Rhinacanthus nasutus (RRn) extract was prepared and standardized to contain total rhinacantins not less than 70% w/w. In this study, antimicrobial activities of the RRn extract as well as rhinacanthin-C against Streptococcus mutans, Propionibacterium acnes, Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans were evaluated by microdilution assay. It was found that the RRn extract exhibited potent bactericidal activity against S. mutans with MIC and MBC of 4 microg/ml, and potent bacteriostatic activity against S. epidermidis, P. acnes and S. aureus with the MICs of 8-16 microg/ml. However, the RRn extract was not active against C. albicans at concentration up to 2000 microg/ml. The antimicrobial activities of the RRn extract was almost equal to those of rhinacanthin-C. Stability evaluations of the RRn extract through a period of 4 months found that the RRn extracts were stable when kept in a well-closed container protected from light and stored either under 4+/-2 degrees C or 30+/-2 degrees C. The RRn extracts that were exposed to light were not stable after 1 week of storage. Under accelerated conditions at 45 degrees C with 75% relative humidity, the RRn extracts were not stable after 8 weeks of storage. Study on the effect of pH on the stability of the aqueous methanolic solution of the RRn extract found that the solutions were not stable at pH 5.5, pH 7.0, and pH 8.0. However, the rhinacanthin solution at pH 5.5 was more stable than those at pH 7.0 and pH 8.0.

TI  - Histone H4 is a major component of the antimicrobial action of human sebocytes.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides, such as cathelicidin and beta defensins, directly kill microbes and have been detected in human sebaceous glands and cell lines. Despite the presence of several such peptides, the apparent abundance of these is insufficient for direct killing of most skin pathogens. In this study, we sought to determine which molecules provide the majority of antimicrobial peptide activity in human sebocytes. Acid-soluble protein extracts of SEB-1 sebocytes were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and were assayed for their capacity to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Antimicrobial activity was isolated in a single major fraction and identified to be histone H4 by mass spectrometry and western blot analysis. The importance of histone H4 in the antimicrobial activity of sebocytes was confirmed by a specific neutralizing antibody and by direct demonstration that recombinant histone H4 had antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and Propionibacterium acnes. In addition, histone H4 enhanced the antimicrobial action of free fatty acids in human sebum. Taken together, these results indicate that the release of histone H4 by holocrine secretion from the sebaceous gland may play an important role in innate immunity.
TI  - Screening of platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination: spectrum of bacteria detected, proportion of transfused units, and clinical follow-up.
AB  - Screening of platelet concentrates (PCs) for bacterial contamination with cultivation methods is carried out as a routine procedure in some countries. The aim is to prevent the transfusion of contaminated PCs. The German Evaluation of Regular Monitoring Study Group conducted a prospective multicenter study on 52,243 PCs to investigate the prevalence of bacteria (BacT/ALERT, bioMerieux). This study describes the detected bacterial spectrum, the proportion of PCs with a positive test result that had been transfused, and the results of the clinical follow-up. One hundred thirteen (67%) of 169 potentially or confirmed positive units had already been transfused at the time of the first positive signal. The transfusion of units contaminated by Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and 73% of the units contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis, or Staphylococcus saccharolyticus was prevented. In contrast, 85% of units with Propionibacterium acnes were transfused. A clonal relationship of the isolates from the pooled PCs and from the associated red blood cell concentrates was found in all investigated cases. The follow-up revealed six febrile reactions to culture-positive PCs not classified as transfusion reaction (TRs) by treating physicians. This demonstrates the importance of hemovigilance. Serious septic reactions due to Klebsiella pneumoniae in two units of one apheresis PC that had tested false-negative were reported; one had a fatal outcome. Culture systems reduce the risk of transfusion of contaminated PCs but cannot guarantee sterility. Physicians must be aware of bacterial contamination of PCs as a potential cause of TRs and must report all adverse events.
TI  - Positive culture rate in revision shoulder arthroplasty.
AB  - We recognized a trend of positive cultures taken from presumably uninfected shoulders during revision arthroplasty. Owing to the indolent nature of common shoulder pathogens such as Propionibacterium acnes, these cultures often become positive several days, even weeks, after surgery. Having concern regarding the potential importance of these positive cultures, we reviewed our revision arthroplasty population to determine the rate of positive intraoperative cultures in patients presumed to be aseptic, to characterize the isolated organisms, and to determine the subsequent development of infection. We retrospectively reviewed 27 patients (28 revisions) presumed to be uninfected between April 2005 and October 2007. Intraoperative cultures were positive in eight (29%) of the 28 revisions. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated in six. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in one patient and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in one patient. One-year followup was available on 24 of the 28 revisions. Two of the eight culture-positive revisions had a subsequent infection develop. Cultures taken at revision surgery for failed shoulder arthroplasty are often positive, and our findings document the importance of these positive cultures. Our data confirm previous reports isolating Propionibacterium acnes as a primary pathogen in revision shoulder arthroplasty.
TI  - Sonication is superior to scraping for retrieval of bacteria in biofilm on titanium and steel surfaces in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low-virulence implant infections are characterized by bacterial colonization of the implant with subsequent biofilm formation. In these cases, soft tissue biopsies often prove to be culture negative. Consequently, detachment of the causative adherent bacteria is crucial for correct microbiological diagnosis. Using an in vitro model, we compared 4 methods of biofilm sampling from metal surfaces. METHODS: Discs of titanium and steel were incubated in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Propionibacterium acnes in Mueller Hinton broth. Non-adherent bacteria were removed by repeated rinsing of the discs. 10 parallels of each disc were subjected to 1 of 4 methods for bacterial recovery: (A) sonication of the discs, (B) scraping of the discs using surgical blades followed by streaking of the blades onto agar plates, (C) scraping of the discs followed by vortex mixing of the surgical blades, and (D) scraping of the discs followed by sonication of the surgical blades. Quantitative bacterial cultures were performed for each sampling method. RESULTS: With the exception of S. epidermidis on steel, sonication efficiently and reliably dislodged biofilm bacteria. The scraping methods employed did not detach bacteria embedded in biofilm. INTERPRETATION: Scraping of metal surfaces is not an adequate method for sampling of biofilm bacteria in vitro.
TI  - Suture-related corneal infections after clear corneal cataract surgery.
AB  - Three patients at our institution developed corneal infections associated with sutures placed after clear corneal incision cataract surgery. The time to infection was 9 weeks, 22 months, and 33 months. One patient required injection of intravitreal antibiotic agents for presumed endophthalmitis associated with the corneal infection. Two patients were treated with topical fortified antibiotic eyedrops only. Although there was no significant change in visual acuity after resolution of the infection, morbidity from suture-related corneal infections can be significant. Routine suture removal in the early postoperative period may be warranted to prevent such infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial property of lauric acid against Propionibacterium acnes: its therapeutic potential for inflammatory acne vulgaris.
AB  - The strong bactericidal properties of lauric acid (C12:0), a middle chain-free fatty acid commonly found in natural products, have been shown in a number of studies. However, it has not been demonstrated whether lauric acid can be used for acne treatment as a natural antibiotic against Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), which promotes follicular inflammation (inflammatory acne). This study evaluated the antimicrobial property of lauric acid against P. acnes both in vitro and in vivo. Incubation of the skin bacteria P. acnes, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) with lauric acid yielded minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against the bacterial growth over 15 times lower than those of benzoyl peroxide (BPO). The lower MIC values of lauric acid indicate stronger antimicrobial properties than that of BPO. The detected values of half maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) of lauric acid on P. acnes, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis growth indicate that P. acnes is the most sensitive to lauric acid among these bacteria. In addition, lauric acid did not induce cytotoxicity to human sebocytes. Notably, both intradermal injection and epicutaneous application of lauric acid effectively decreased the number of P. acnes colonized with mouse ears, thereby relieving P. acnes-induced ear swelling and granulomatous inflammation. The obtained data highlight the potential of using lauric acid as an alternative treatment for antibiotic therapy of acne vulgaris.
TI  - Purulent pericarditis: report of 2 cases and review of the literature.
AB  - Purulent pericarditis, a localized infection within the pericardial space, has become a rare entity in the modern antibiotic era. Although historically a disease of children and young adults, this is no longer the case: the median age at the time of diagnosis has increased by nearly 30 years over the past 6 decades. Despite advances in diagnostic and treatment modalities, purulent pericarditis remains a life-threatening illness. Unfortunately, the diagnosis is made postmortem in more than half the cases. Thus, a high index of clinical suspicion is crucial. We present 2 cases of purulent pericarditis, and provide an updated review of other case series published over the past 60 years.
TI  - Susceptibility comparisons of normal preoperative conjunctival bacteria to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the susceptibility and efficacy of 3 fluoroquinolones, (levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin) in treating conjunctival bacteria in patients having ocular surgery. SETTING: Osaka University Hospital, Osaka, and Tohoku University Hospital, Miyagi, Japan. METHODS: Eyes of patients were examined preoperatively. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were obtained from conjunctival swabs. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin for isolated strains were determined. Using the MIC values, descriptive statistics (median, MIC(50), MIC(90), mode, and range), susceptibility, and efficacy of each fluoroquinolone were calculated for the bacteria isolated, and the data were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Of the 200 eyes sampled, 163 (81.5%) had positive bacterial growth. From the 163 eyes, 235 bacterial strains were isolated: 116 (49.4%) Propionibacterium acnes; 58 (24.7%) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS), including 36 methicillin-sensitive CNS (MS-CNS) and 22 methicillin-resistant CNS (MR-CNS); 10 (4.3%) Staphylococcus aureus, including 6 methicillin-sensitive S aureus and 4 methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA); and 29 (12.3%) Corynebacterium. Approximately 40% of Staphylococci (22/58 CNS, 37.9%; 4/10 S aureus, 40.0%) were methicillin-resistant. Furthermore, 18 (81.8%) of MR-CNS and all 4 MRSA were fluoroquinolone resistant. The MICs of moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin were statistically significantly lower than those of levofloxacin for CNS and P acnes (P<.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the susceptibility patterns of the fluoroquinolones for these strains (P>.05, McNemar test). CONCLUSION: Because many methicillin-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were isolated from the conjunctiva preoperatively, clinicians should be mindful of endophthalmitis or ocular infections associated with these strains.
TI  - Cloning and expression of antibacterial goat lactoferricin from Escherichia coli  AD494(DE3)pLysS expression system.
AB  - Goat lactoferricin (GLfcin), an antibacterial peptide, is released from the N terminus of goat lactoferrin by pepsin digestion. Two GLfcin-related cDNAs, GLfcin L and GLfcin S, encoding Ala20-Ser60 and Ser36-Ser60 of goat lactoferrin, respectively, were cloned into the pET-23a(+) expression vector upstream from (His)6-Tag gene and transformed into Escherichia coli AD494(DE3)pLysS expression host. After being induced by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), two (His)6-Tag fused recombinant lactoferricins, GLfcin L-His*Tag and GLfcin S-His*Tag, were expressed in soluble form within the E. coli cytoplasm. The GLfcin L-His*Tag and GLfcin S-His*Tag were purified using HisTrap affinity chromatography. According to an antibacterial activity assay using the agar diffusion method, GLfcin L-His*Tag had antibacterial activity against E. coli BCRC 11549, Staphylococcus aureus BCRC 25923, and Propionibacterium acnes BCRC 10723, while GLfcin S-His*Tag was able to inhibit the growth of E. coli BCRC 11549 and P. acnes BCRC 10723. These two recombinant lactoferricins behaved as thermostable peptides, which could retain their activity for up to 30 min of exposure at 100 degrees C.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antibacterial, anticollagenase, and antioxidant activities of hop components (Humulus lupulus) addressing acne vulgaris.
AB  - Seven naturally derived components from hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.) extracts were tested for evaluation of biological activities affecting acne vulgaris. Five strains, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Kocuria rhizophila and, Staphylococcus pyogenes, were selected as the main acne-causing bacteria. Hop extracts xanthohumol and the lupulones showed strong inhibitory activities against all of the strains. Although hydrogenated derivatives did not show the same level of activity, naturally occurring xanthohumol, humulones, and lupulones all showed moderate to strong anticollagenase inhibitory activities. Antioxidant capacity was also evaluated with seven different methods based on different reactive oxygen species. Xanthohumol showed the highest activity in total oxygen radical absorbance capacity as well as singlet oxygen absorbance capacity.
TI  - In vitro anti-adhesive activity of green tea extract against pathogen adhesion.
AB  - Camellia sinensis polysaccharide has been reported to possess anti-adhesive activity against pathogens. The present study was designed to investigate whether hot water extracts obtained from green tea leaves might inhibit pathogen adhesion to human or mouse cell lines. Green tea extract-4 (CSI-4) with the maximum yield of 4% (w/v) is composed of a major proportion of carbohydrates containing 40% uronic acids, but lack of catechins. It showed strong inhibitory activities against hemagglutination mediated by pathogens Helicobacter pylori, Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.01-0.5 mg/mL. CSI-4 further demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of these pathogens to host cell lines with the IC(50) values (50% inhibition of adhesion) of 0.14-2.3 mg/mL. It exhibited the highest activity against P. acnes, but no inhibitory effects were observed against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that CSI-4 may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria with no adverse effects against beneficial or commensal bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of nadifloxacin against several Gram-positive bacteria and analysis of the possible evolution of resistance after 2 years of use in Germany.
AB  - Nadifloxacin has good activity against Propionibacterium acnes as well as against both meticillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA, respectively) and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of this fluoroquinolone against the abovementioned microorganisms, comparing isolates collected in 2007 in Germany, a country where nadifloxacin has been used for the last 2 years, with isolates collected from 2006-2007 in Spain where nadifloxacin has not been used. A collection of P. acnes from Hungary (strains collected during 2005-2006) and a collection of P. acnes from different countries in Europe (collected during 2002) were also included. The activity of nadifloxacin was compared with ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and clindamycin. Susceptibility testing of P. acnes was performed by agar dilution, whereas the susceptibility of the different staphylococci was determined by microdilution. Although the isolates were collected from three different countries (Spain, Hungary and Germany) where the use of quinolones can produce a different effect, no significant differences in the percentages of resistance to nadifloxacin were observed in P. acnes, MSSA, MRSA and S. epidermidis. Therefore, topical antibiotics such as nadifloxacin do not have an additional effect on resistance. Moreover, nadifloxacin presented much better activity than the comparator drugs used in this study against the studied microorganisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2% gel against ciclopirox and clotrimazole.
AB  - Commercially available topical formulations consisting of iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2%, ciclopirox 0.77%, and clotrimazole 1%-betamethasone dipropionate 0.5% were assessed for their antimicrobial activity against cultures of Micrococcus luteus, Propionibacterium acnes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Corynebacterium aquaticum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Malassezia furfur, Microsporum canis, Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum, or Epidermophyton floccosum. At 1 and 5 minutes following inoculation into suspensions of each product, aliquots were removed, serially diluted, and plated onto appropriate agar to determine the log reduction in colony-forming units (CFUs) for each organism. Iodoquinol 1% produced the broadest and greatest antimicrobial activity as measured by a 3-log reduction of CFU, active against all microbes tested following incubation times of 1 or 5 minutes, except M luteus. By contrast, ciclopirox 0.77% and clotrimazole 1% showed activity against P aeruginosa and T rubrum, with ciclopirox also killing M luteus, P acnes, M canis, C albicans, and E floccosum at 5 minutes. Iodoquinol 1%-hydrocortisone acetate 2% also was the only product that showed effective antibacterial reduction of MRSA at 1 minute.
TI  - Antibiotic use in acne vulgaris and rosacea: clinical considerations and resistance issues of significance to dermatologists.
AB  - Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in dermatology practice for a variety of disorders, including acne vulgaris and rosacea. Importantly, they often are used long-term for these inflammatory dermatoses. Changes in bacterial ecology related to antibiotic prescribing have led to the decreased sensitivity of some bacterial organisms, such as Propionibacterium acnes, to antibiotics commonly prescribed by dermatologists. The potential clinical outcomes of altered bacterial sensitivities may vary among specific disease states and include decreased therapeutic response and the need to alter approaches in disease management. Additionally, changing patterns of antibiotic sensitivity and the emergence of more virulent pathogens, such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, macrolide-resistant staphylococci and streptococci, and mupirocin-resistant S aureus, have led to marked changes in how clinicians use antibiotics in clinical practice. This article reviews antibiotic prescribing in dermatology practice and provides important clinical perspectives and recommendations to preserve the therapeutic value of antibiotics based on a thorough review of current literature and clinical experience.
TI  - Biofilms in skin infections: Propionibacterium acnes and acne vulgaris.
AB  - It is generally accepted that many human infections are biofilm-related and that  sessile (biofilm-grown) cells are highly resistant against antimicrobial agents. Propionibacterium acnes plays a role in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris, a common disorder of the pilosebaceous follicles and it has been suggested that P. acnes cells residing within the follicles grow as a biofilm. Although P. acnes biofilms have not been observed directly in the pilosebaceous unit, the observation that P. acnes readily forms biofilm in vitro as well as on various medical devices in vivo, combined with the high resistance of sessile P. acnes cells and the increased production of particular virulence factors and qourum sensing molecules in sessile cells point in this direction. In addition, in vitro and in vivo biofilm formation has also been demonstrated for other microorganisms involved in skin diseases (including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes).
TI  - Bacteriologic profile of the conjunctiva in the patients with dry eye.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the conjunctival bacterial profiles in dry eye and their fluoroquinolone susceptibility patterns. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. METHODS: Sixty-seven female patients with dry eye (29 with Sjogren syndrome and 38 without Sjogren syndrome) who received artificial tears were enrolled at Osaka University Hospital in Japan. Twenty-three patients received additional topical steroids. Twenty-six puncta were occluded with plugs. Cultures were obtained with conjunctival swabs at the right eye of the subjects. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of isolated strains were determined for the fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin and gatifloxacin). The profiles of conjunctival bacteria of patients with dry eye were compared with those obtained before surgery from 56 female control patients. RESULTS: Eighty-eight strains were isolated (48 strains of Propionibacterium acnes, 26 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus [CNS] species, six Staphylococcus aureus strains, and eight others). Of the 26 CNS strains, 17 (65.4%) were fluoroquinolone resistant, including four (33.3%) of 12 methicillin-sensitive CNS and 13 (92.9%) of 14 methicillin-resistant CNS. All methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains and P. acnes strains were sensitive to fluoroquinolones; one methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain was resistant. There was no significant difference in the conjunctival isolation rates between patients with dry eye and controls. However, the dry eye group had a significantly higher incidence of fluoroquinolone-resistant methicillin-sensitive CNS and of fluoroquinolone-resistant methicillin-resistant CNS than controls (P = .018 and P = .024, respectively). There were no significant differences in bacteria isolated between subgroups with or without punctal plugs and with or without topical steroids. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with dry eye are more likely to have fluoroquinolone-resistant conjunctival bacteria than controls. These results may help prevent infectious keratoconjunctivitis in patients with dry eye.
TI  - Characteristics and treatment outcome of cerebrospinal fluid shunt-associated infections in adults: a retrospective analysis over an 11-year period.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on infections associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts among adults are limited. Therefore, we performed a retrospective study of shunt-associated infections in adults. METHODS: Patients aged > or = 12 years with infections associated with CSF shunts and admitted to our institution(University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland) from January 1996 through December 2006 were included retrospectively. Hospital charts were reviewed, and follow-up was performed by assessment of later hospitalizations and telephone contact with patients, their families, and general practitioners. RESULTS: Seventy-eight episodes of infection associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt (65 episodes), ventriculoatrial shunt (7), lumboperitoneal shunt (5), and central nervous system reservoir (1) were included. Median patient age was 50 years (range, 12-80 years); 49 (63%) of the patients were men. Most infections (48 [62%])manifested within 1 month after shunt surgery. Fever was present in 61 episodes (78%), neck stiffness was present in 35 (45%), and local signs of infection were present in 38 (49%). In CSF, leukocyte count was >5 x 10(6) cells/L in 80% of episodes, and lactate level was 11.9 mmol/L in 81% of episodes. Leukocyte counts were significantly higher in CSF obtained by use of lumbar puncture (median leukocyte count, 573 x 10(6) cells/L; P = .001) and valve puncture (median leukocyte count, 484 x 10(6) cells/L; P = .016) than in ventricular CSF (median leukocyte count, 8.5 x 10(6) cells/L). Overall, results of CSF cultures were positive in 66% of episodes (48 of 73 episodes for which CSF was collected), and microorganisms were isolated more often from valve puncture CSF specimens(91% of specimens) and ventricular CSF specimens (70%) than from lumbar CSF specimens (45%). The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (found in 37% of specimens), Staphylococcus aureus(18%), and Propionibacterium acnes (9%). A surgical procedure was performed to treat infection in 63 (81% of the episodes) (shunt removal in 37 episodes and shunt replacement in 26). The shunt was retained without surgery for 15 episodes (19% of episodes). Median duration of patient follow-up was 4.6 years (range, 0.1-11.1 years),with favorable treatment outcome in 75 (96%) of 78 cases. One of the 63 patients who underwent surgical treatment of shunt-associated infection experienced infection relapse; of the 15 patients who received treatment with antibiotics alone, 1 experienced infection relapse and 1 died. The 2 relapses involved rifampin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. CONCLUSIONS: Shunt-associated infections among adults often present with nonspecific clinical signs, and affected patients can have normal CSF leukocyte counts and lactate levels; therefore, a high index of suspicion and improved methods are required for diagnosing shunt-associated infection.
TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid shunt infections in children over a 13-year period: anaerobic cultures and comparison of clinical signs of infection with Propionibacterium acnes and with other bacteria.
AB  - OBJECT: Shunt infections represent a major problem with risk for sequelae and even death. The aim in this retrospective study was to analyze the incidence, origin, and clinical presentation of shunt infections, with special reference to the results of cultures for anaerobic organisms performed in addition to the usual tests, to prolonged incubation times, and to infections caused by Propionibacterium acnes. METHODS: The medical records of 237 hydrocephalic children (age range 0-15 years) in whom operations were performed by a pediatric surgeon at Uppsala University Hospital during a 13-year period were reviewed. RESULTS: Thirty-four verified or suspected intraventricular shunt infections and 5 distal catheter infections occurred after 474 operations. Skin bacteria, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci ([CoNS], 19 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (7 patients), and P. acnes (6 patients) predominated. The addition of anaerobic cultures and prolonged incubation times increased the verification of shunt infection by more than one third. Children with P. acnes infection were significantly older, had a lower body temperature, fewer cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocytes, a higher CSF/blood glucose ratio, more distal catheter infections, and other sources of infection. Four had an abdominal pseudocyst. Children < 1 year of age and infected with CoNS were more affected than older children with systemic and local symptoms. In children with distal catheter infection and growth of propionibacteria at the time of the distal catheter and valve replacement, no follow-up antibiotic treatment was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of anaerobic cultures and prolonged incubation times led to an increase in the detection of shunt infections. Infections caused by propionibacteria often result in mild symptoms that may be overlooked if adequate anaerobic cultures are not obtained.

TI  - Treatment of primary isolated shoulder sepsis in the adult patient.
AB  - Isolated shoulder sepsis is an uncommon clinical problem with little information  in the literature on causative organisms and potential sequelae. We examined the organisms involved, surgical treatments, antibiotic treatments rendered, and complications in these cases. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 19 adult patients (19 shoulders) who underwent operative treatment of isolated shoulder sepsis from 1996 to 2005. Patient age, gender, laboratory studies, previous treatment, surgical procedures, surgical findings, cultured organism, antibiotic treatment, and complications were reviewed. The organisms included methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (five), Streptococcus B beta hemolytic (five), Staphylococcus epidermidis (three), negative cultures (two), Streptococcus viridans (one), Escherichia coli (one), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (one), and Propionibacterium acnes (one). We treated patients with intravenous antibiotics an average of 4.2 weeks (range, 3-8 weeks). One patient underwent humeral head resection with an antibiotic spacer. Another patient died during hospitalization. Open or arthroscopic debridement in conjunction with appropriate antibiotics appears effective in eradicating infection in most adults who present with shoulder sepsis. Functional outcome is poor in those patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears and/or cartilage loss. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
TI  - Infection after the surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: evaluation of the diagnosis, treatment, and impact on clinical outcomes.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a single surgeon's experience with infection after surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, with a focus on the diagnosis, treatment, and impact on radiographic and patient-reported outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although previous studies have evaluated this postoperative complication, no studies to date have looked at the impact of this complication on both radiographic and patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: From 1986 to 2004, 236 patients were identified who underwent surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and had at least 2-year follow-up. The medical records of patients who developed infection were retrospectively reviewed in detail. Preoperative and most recent postoperative radiographic parameters and Scoliosis Research Society 24 outcomes of both infected and noninfected patients were compared. RESULTS: Of 236 patients 7 (3%) developed an infection. One was acute (17 days postoperative), and 6 were delayed (average 34.2 months postoperative). The most common presenting complaints included back pain (5 of 7) and localized swelling (4 of 7). All patients with delayed infection were treated with 1 surgery (irrigation and debridement, instrumentation removal) and 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Of 6 patients 3 had pseudarthrosis. Culture results were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 2), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 1), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), Group A Streptococcus (n = 1), no growth (n = 1). The patient with acute infection required 6 surgical procedures and 16 weeks of antibiotics. Cultures were positive for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Serratia marscesens. Revision fusion surgery was performed 5 months after the infection was treated. Compared with the noninfected patients, those with infection had lower percent thoracic (P = 0.01) and lumbar (P = 0.06) curve correction. There was no difference in the pain, function, self-image, satisfaction, or total Scoliosis Research Society 24 scores. CONCLUSION: Postoperative infection after the surgical treatment of idiopathic scoliosis can successfully be treated with irrigation and debridement, instrumentation removal, and a course of antibiotics. Although less curve correction was achieved in the infected group, there were no differences in patient-reported outcomes when compared with the noninfected group.
TI  - N-substituted 3-acetyltetramic acid derivatives as antibacterial agents.
AB  - In order to expand the structure-activity relationship of tetramic acid molecules with structural similarity to the antibiotic reutericyclin, 22 compounds were synthesized and tested against a panel of clinically relevant bacteria. Key structural changes on the tetramic acid core affected antibacterial activity. Various compounds in the N-alkyl 3-acetyltetramic acid series exhibited good activity against Gram-positive bacterial pathogens including Bacillus anthracis, Propionibacterium acnes, Enterococcus faecalis, and both Methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Comparison of multiple methods for quantification of microbial biofilms grown in  microtiter plates.
AB  - In the present study six assays for the quantification of biofilms formed in 96-well microtiter plates were optimised and evaluated: the crystal violet (CV) assay, the Syto9 assay, the fluorescein diacetate (FDA) assay, the resazurin assay, the XTT assay and the dimethyl methylene blue (DMMB) assay. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes and Candida albicans were used as test organisms. In general, these assays showed a broad applicability and a high repeatability for most isolates. In addition, the estimated numbers of CFUs present in the biofilms show limited variations between the different assays. Nevertheless, our data show that some assays are less suitable for the quantification of biofilms of particular isolates (e.g. the CV assay for P. aeruginosa).
TI  - Microbial colonization of an in vitro model of a tissue engineered human skin equivalent--a novel approach.
AB  - This was a preliminary investigation to define the conditions of colonization of  a human skin equivalent (SE) model with cutaneous microorganisms. SEs of 24 mm diameter were constructed with a dermal matrix of fibrin containing fibroblasts and a stratified epidermis. Microbial colonization of the SEs was carried out in a dry environment, comparable to 'in vivo' skin, using a blotting technique to remove inoculation fluid. The microbial communities were sampled by scrub washing and viable cells enumerated on selective growth medium. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes and Malassezia furfur (human skin commensals) and Staphylococcus aureus (transient pathogen) were colonized at inoculum densities of 10(2)-10(6) CFU SE(-1) on the surface of replicate SEs. Growth of all species was supported for upto 72-120 h, with recovery densities of between 10(4)-10(9) CFU SE(-1). A novel, real-time growth monitoring method was also developed, using S. aureus containing a lux cassette. Light output increased from 20 to 95 h, and colonization increased from 10(2) to 10(8) CFU SE(-1), as confirmed by conventional recovery. Thus, the SE model has potential to investigate interactions between resident and transient microbial communities with themselves and their habitat, and for testing treatments to control pathogen colonization of human skin.
TI  - Wound contamination in cardiac surgery. A systematic quantitative and qualitative study of the bacterial growth in sternal wounds in cardiac surgery patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the degree of bacterial contamination in the sternal wound during cardiac surgery and the sternal skin flora after operation in order to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of sternal wound infections. DESIGN: Prospective study where cultures were taken peri- and postoperatively from sternal wounds and skin. SETTING: University Hospital. PATIENTS: 201 cardiac surgery patients. RESULTS: 89% of the patients grew bacteria from the subcutaneous sternal tissue. 98% of the patients showed bacterial growth on the surrounding skin at the end of the operation. We found both commensal and nosocomial bacteria in the sternal wound. These bacteria had different temporal distribution patterns. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Propionibacterium acnes (PA) were by far the most prevalent bacteria during and after the operation. Furthermore, 41% of patients had more than 10,000 CFU/pad CoNS on the skin. There was no correlation between length of operation and number of bacteria. Men displayed higher bacterial counts than women on the skin. CONCLUSION: Skin preparation with ethanol/chlorhexidine is unable to suppress the physiological skin flora for the duration of a heart operation. A decrease of CoNS and PA postoperatively can be caused by competitive recolonisation of commensal and nosocomial bacteria.
TI  - Breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections have also affected the microbial profile of breast abscesses. OBJECTIVE: To update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: County hospital emergency department. PATIENTS: Forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range, 20-63 years) with breast abscesses. METHODS: All cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. RESULTS: Of 46 specimens only 28 showed bacterial yield (61%). Of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. The most common organism was S aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with MRSA in 7 (58%). The remaining organisms included coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), Proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). All MRSA was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. Only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. Two anaerobic cultures were positive for Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. Many breast abscesses have community-acquired MRSA, with more than 50% of all S aureus and 19% of all cultures being MRSA. This finding parallels the local and national increases in MRSA reported in other soft-tissue infections. With increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.
TI  - Microcalorimetry: a novel method for detection of microbial contamination in platelet products.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measuring heat from replicating microorganisms in culture may be a rapid, accurate, and simple screening method for platelets (PLTs). Microcalorimetry for detection of microorganisms in in vitro contaminated PLT products was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Candida albicans were inoculated in single-donor apheresis PLTs to achieve target concentrations of 10(5), 10(3), 10, or 1 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL of PLTs. Contaminated PLTs in growth medium were incubated at 37 degrees C for 5 days in a calorimeter. Positivity was defined as heat flow of at least 10 microW above the lowest value of the power-time curve. RESULTS: With microcalorimetry, inocula of 10 CFUs per mL PLTs could be detected with the following detection times: S. epidermidis (31.65 hr), S. aureus (24.24 hr), S. sanguinis (7.82 hr), E. coli (7.53 hr), P. acnes (73.57 hr), and C. albicans (43.77 hr). The detection time was less than 4 hr at 10(5) CFUs per mL PLTs for S. aureus, S. sanguinis, and E. coli. Noncontaminated PLTs remained negative. The total heat ranged from 2.8 (S. sanguinis) to 8.3 J (E. coli). The shape of the power-time curve was species-specific and independent from the initial concentration of microorganisms. CONCLUSION: The detection limit of microcalorimetry was 1 to 10 CFUs per mL PLTs. Microcalorimetry is a promising novel method for detection of contaminated PLTs. Applying this method to all PLT products could reduce the frequency of transfusion-related sepsis and prolong the shelf life of PLTs.
TI  - Comparison of azithromycin and moxifloxacin against bacterial isolates causing conjunctivitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine in vitro resistance to azithromycin and moxifloxacin in bacterial conjunctivitis isolates. METHODS: MIC90s (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) and resistance rates to azithromycin and moxifloxacin were determined based upon microtiter broth dilution and/or antimicrobial gradient test strips in a multicenter phase III study and confirmed externally. RESULTS: The most common isolates collected from bacterial conjunctivitis patients in the phase III study were Haemophilus influenzae (40.6%), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (19.3%), Propionibacterium acnes (17.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), and Staphylococcus aureus (0.06%). MIC90s for all of these organisms were well below established resistance breakpoints for moxifloxacin, indicating no bacterial resistance. On the other hand, the MIC90 for H. influenzae was 3-fold higher than the resistance breakpoint for azithromycin, > or = 128-fold higher for S. epidermidis, 16-fold higher for S. pneumoniae and > or = 128-fold higher for S. aureus, indicating moderate to very high bacterial resistance to azithromycin. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to azithromycin is more common than resistance to moxifloxacin in clinical isolates causing bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - Prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (PLT) components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one double-dose PLTs were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL). After split, each PLT unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 CFUs. One unit was photochemically treated (PCT; 150 micromol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A). The other unit was untreated. All units were stored and sampled on Days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux). PLTs were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. RESULTS: In all PCT PLTs, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. In untreated PLTs, Staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. Growth of 1 to 10 CFUs per unit Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 CFUs per unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 to 1000 CFUs per unit Propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. Low levels of Streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 CFUs/unit), Escherichia coli (1-100 CFUs/unit), and Clostridium perfringens (1-100 CFUs/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: For the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated PLTs may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. In contrast, bacterial inactivation by PCT could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of PLTs contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.
TI  - Microbiology of acute sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periorbital cellulitis in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to evaluate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of acute maxillary sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periodontal infection in children. METHODS: Aspirates of 18 acutely infected maxillary sinuses that were associated with odontogenic infection in children who presented with periorbital cellulitis were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: A total of 54 isolates were recovered (3.0 per specimen): 13 aerobic and facultative (0.7 per specimen) and 41 anaerobic (2.3 per specimen). The number of isolates per specimen varied from 1 to 4. Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 2 specimens (11%), anaerobes only in 7 (39%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 9 (50%). The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (4), microaerophilic streptococci (3), and Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each). The predominant anaerobic bacteria were anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (17), Peptostreptococcus spp (11), Fusobacterium spp (8), and Propionibacterium acnes (2). Twelve beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 9 specimens (50%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the unique aerobic and anaerobic microbiological features of acute maxillary sinusitis of odontogenic origin presenting with periorbital cellulitis in children.
TI  - Postoperative central nervous system infection: incidence and associated factors  in 2111 neurosurgical procedures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative central nervous system infection (PCNSI) in patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures represents a serious problem that requires immediate attention. PCNSI most commonly manifests as meningitis, subdural empyema, and/or brain abscess. Recent studies (which have included a minimum of 1000 operations) have reported that the incidence of PCNSI after neurosurgical procedures is 5%-7%, and many physicians believe that the true incidence is even higher. To address this issue, we examined the incidence of PCNSI in a sizeable patient population. METHODS: The medical records and postoperative courses for patients involved in 2111 neurosurgical procedures at our institution during 1991-2005 were reviewed retrospectively to determine the incidence of PCNSI, the identity of offending organisms, and the factors associated with infection. RESULTS: The median age of patients at the time of surgery was 45 years. Of the 1587 cranial operations, 14 (0.8%) were complicated by PCNSI, whereas none of the 32 peripheral nerve operations resulted in PCNSI. The remaining 492 operative cases involved spinal surgery, of which 2 (0.4%) were complicated by PCNSI. The overall incidence of PCNSI was 0.8% (occurring after 16 of 2111 operations); the incidence of bacterial meningitis was 0.3% (occurring after 4 of 1587 operations), and the incidence of brain abscess was 0.2% (occurring after 3 of 1587 operations). The most common offending organism was Staphylococcus aureus (8 cases; 50% of infections), followed by Propionibacterium acnes (4 cases; 25% of infections). Cerebrospinal fluid leakage, diabetes mellitus, and male sex were not associated with PCNSI (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: In one of the largest neurosurgical studies to have investigated PCNSI, the incidence of infection after neurosurgical procedures was <1%--more than 6 times lower than that reported in recent series of comparable numerical size. Cerebrospinal fluid leak, diabetes mellitus, and male sex were not associated with an increased incidence of PCNSI. The results from this study indicate that the true incidence of PCNSI after neurosurgical procedures may be greatly overestimated in the literature and that, in surgical procedures associated with a high risk of infection, prophylaxis for S. aureus and/or P. acnes infection should be of primary concern.
TI  - [Preoperatively administered flomoxef sodium concentration in aqueous humor].
AB  - PURPOSE: We intravenously administered flomoxef sodium (FMOX) 0.5-3.5 hours before cataract surgery and measured the concentration of the agent in the aqueous humor to investigate its penetration into the aqueous humor and its efficacy in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis. METHODS: 56 patients who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. They received 1 g FMOX via a 20-minute intravenous drip beginning 0.5-3.5 hours before the operation. Aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for FMOX concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The mean intraoperative FMOX concentrations in the patients' aqueous humor were 0.79 +/- 0.24 microg/ml (administered 3.5 hours before surgery)--1.47 0.79 microg/ml (administered 1.5 hours before surgery). These concentrations administered 0.5-3.0 hours before surgery sufficiently exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 90 values against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes, but did not achieve the MIC90 values against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: The FMOX concentrations in the aqueous humor sampling were adequate to kill bacteria in vitro. This drug may be efficacious in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis in patients undergoing cataract surgery.
TI  - Screening of plant extracts for antimicrobial activity against bacteria and yeasts with dermatological relevance.
AB  - There is cumulative resistance against antibiotics of many bacteria. Therefore, the development of new antiseptics and antimicrobial agents for the treatment of skin infections is of increasing interest. We have screened six plant extracts and isolated compounds for antimicrobial effects on bacteria and yeasts with dermatological relevance. The following plant extracts have been tested: Gentiana lutea, Harpagophytum procumbens, Boswellia serrata (dry extracts), Usnea barbata, Rosmarinus officinalis and Salvia officinalis (supercritical carbon dioxide [CO2] extracts). Additionally, the following characteristic plant substances were tested: usnic acid, carnosol, carnosic acid, ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, harpagoside, boswellic acid and gentiopicroside. The extracts and compounds were tested against 29 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and yeasts in the agar dilution test. U. barbata-extract and usnic acid were the most active compounds, especially in anaerobic bacteria. Usnea CO2-extract effectively inhibited the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains - MRSA), Propionibacterium acnes and Corynebacterium species. Growth of the dimorphic yeast Malassezia furfur was also inhibited by Usnea-extract. Besides the Usnea-extract, Rosmarinus-, Salvia-, Boswellia- and Harpagophytum-extracts proved to be effective against a panel of bacteria. It is concluded that due to their antimicrobial effects some of the plant extracts may be used for the topical treatment of skin disorders like acne vulgaris and seborrhoic eczema.
TI  - Role of bacterial and host factors in infectious endophthalmitis.
AB  - Endophthalmitis is a frequent blinding complication of globe-penetrating injury and ocular surgery. The outcome of this intraocular infection depends both on the organism involved and management of the ensuing inflammation. The role of various toxins and bacterial factors in the pathogenesis of this infection is beginning to be delineated, but appears to be organism specific. Because of the immune-privileged environment of the eye, principles important in the resolution of infection at extraocular sites cannot be extrapolated to understanding the host-parasite dynamics in eye infection. Moreover, some factors that suppress the intraocular immune environment appear to have unexpected roles in activating phagocytic cells of the innate immune system in response to the presence of bacteria. Therefore, considerable additional information characterizing the precise role of bacterial and host factors in the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis will be required in order to develop new therapies to improve the outcome of this often blinding infection.
TI  - Incidence, microbiological findings, and clinical presentation of sternal wound infections after cardiac surgery with and without local gentamicin prophylaxis.
AB  - Sternal wound infection (SWI) is a serious complication after cardiac surgery. In a previous randomized controlled trial, the addition of local collagen-gentamicin in the sternal wound before wound closure was found to significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative wound infections compared with the routine intravenous prophylaxis of isoxazolyl-penicillin only. The aims of the present study were to analyse the microbiological findings of the SWIs from the previous trial as well as to correlate these findings with the clinical presentation of SWI. Differences in clinical presentation of SWIs, depending on the causative agent, could be identified. Most infections had a late, insidious onset, and the majority of these were caused by staphylococci, predominantly coagulase-negative staphylococci. The clinically most fulminant infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria and presented early after surgery. Local administration of gentamicin reduced the incidence of SWIs caused by all major, clinically important bacterial species. Propionibacterium acnes was identified as a possible cause of SWI and may be linked to instability in the sternal fixation. There was no indication of an increase in the occurrence of gentamicin-resistant bacterial isolates in the treatment group. Furthermore, the addition of local collagen-gentamicin reduced the incidence of SWIs caused by methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. This technique warrants further evaluation as an alternative to prophylactic vancomycin in settings with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal effects of 405-nm and 470-nm blue light.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the bactericidal effect of 405- and 470-nm light on two bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in vitro. BACKGROUND DATA: It is well-known that UV light kills bacteria, but the bactericidal effects of UV may not be unique since recent studies indicate that blue light produces a somewhat similar effect. The effects of blue light seem varied depending on wavelength, dose and the nature of the bacteria, hence this study. METHODS: Two common aerobes, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic Propionibacterium acnes were tested. Each organism was treated with Super Luminous Diode probes with peak emission at 405 and 470 nm. Treatment was timed to yield 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 Jcm2 doses. Colony counts were performed and compared to untreated controls. RESULTS: The 405-nm light produced a dose dependent bactericidal effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (p < .05), achieving as much as 95.1% and nearly 90% kill rate for each, respectively. The 470-nm light effectively killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa at all dose levels, but only killed Staphylococcus aureus at 10 and 15 J cm2. With this wavelength, as much as 96.5% and 62% reduction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was achieved, respectively. Neither of the two wavelengths proved bactericidal with anaerobic Propionibacterium acnes. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that, in vitro, 405- and 470-nm blue light produce dose dependent bactericidal effects on Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus but not Propionibacterium acnes.

TI  - Activities of four frog skin-derived antimicrobial peptides (temporin-1DRa, temporin-1Va and the melittin-related peptides AR-23 and RV-23) against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activities of two antimicrobial peptides belonging to the temporin family (temporin-1DRa from Rana draytonii and temporin-1Va from Rana virgatipes) and two peptides with structural similarity to the bee venom peptide melittin (AR-23 from Rana tagoi and RV-23 from R. draytonii) were evaluated against a range of reference strains and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. These peptides were selected because they show broad-spectrum growth inhibitory activity against reference strains of several medically important aerobic microorganisms and against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. All peptides showed relatively high potency (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) </=25 microM) against the Gram-positive bacilli Propionibacterium acnes and Clostridium tertium and the Gram-positive cocci Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Activity was lower and more variable against Clostridium septicum, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. Growth of the Gram-negative bacilli Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium spp. was poorly inhibited, but all the peptides were active (MIC</=25 microM) against Prevotella melaninogenica. The clinical utility of the melittin-related peptides is limited by their toxicities, but temporin-1DRa and temporin-1Va have relatively low haemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and so represent candidates for drug development, particularly for topical therapy of infected surface lesions.
TI  - [The influence of AMPs from HaCaT keratinocytes on some bacteria strains derived  from skin changes].
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial activity of protein extracts  from HaCaT cell line against bacterial strains, isolated from clinical materials, obtained from patients with clinical symptoms of acne (Propionibacterium acnes) and gas gangrene (Clostridium perfringens and Sterptococcus pyogenes). Reference strain of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 also was used. Protein extracts from cultured HaCaT cells were obtained by 3-fold freezing/defreezing cells in dry ice following by centrifugation and incubated with appropriate bacterial suspension (0.5 McFarland scale) during 6 and 24 hours. We observed time-depending and strain-depending activity of HaCaT--protein extract. Interestingly, high activity was demonstrated against strains of S. pyogenes and C. perfringens. Because of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics further studies in the field of antimicrobial peptides are required.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of nadifloxacin against Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium isolated from patients with dermatological infections].
AB  - Nadifloxacin (NDFX) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic developed by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and is used as a topical drug for the treatment of infections in the field of dermatology. We investigated the susceptibility of a total of 575 strains (two kinds of Staphylococcus species and Propionibacterium species which were isolated from patients with dermatological infections for 3 periods, i.e., 1996, 2000 and 2005) to NDFX and other reference antibiotics. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the four antibiotics, NDFX, levofloxacin (LVFX), clindamycin (CLDM) and gentamicin (GM), against the test strains were determined by the agar dilution methods, in according with the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. The antibacterial activity of NDFX against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis and P. acnes was the most potent of all the antibiotics tested, and there were no test organisms which became resistant to NDFX with period. The MIC90 values of NDFX for the four test organisms isolated in 2005 were 0.05 microg/mL; MSSA, 1.56 microg/mL; MRSA, 0.78 microg/mL; S. epidermidis and 0.20 microg/mL; P. acnes, respectively. On the other hand, there were LVFX-, CLDM- and GM-resistant MRSA. The MIC50 values of CLDM and GM for MRSA were >100 and 25 microg/mL, respectively. The MIC50 value of GM for P acnes was 12.5 microg/mL, but NDFX was potently active against these organisms as compared with these two antibiotics and the MIC50 values of NDFX were 0.05 microg/mL for MRSA and 0.20 microg/mL for P. acnes. These results suggest that NDFX is even at present useful as an antibiotic for the treatment of infections in the field of dermatology though it is more than 12 years since the approval to manufacture and sell the drug was obtained in 1993.
TI  - Inhibition of pathogenic bacterial adhesion by acidic polysaccharide from green tea (Camellia sinensis).
AB  - An acidic polysaccharide CS-F2 from Camellia sinensis was examined to characterize its anti-adhesive effects against pathogenic bacteria, most notably Helicobacter pylori, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. CS-F2 showed marked inhibitory activity against the pathogen-mediated hemagglutination with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/mL, which is lower than the previously reported MIC values for Panax ginseng and Artemisia capillaris. The inhibitory effects of CS-F2 on the adhesion of H. pylori to AGS adenocarcinoma gastric epithelial cells, or P. acnes and S. aureus to NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells, were further assessed resulting in MIC values between 0.063 and 0.13 mg/mL. Importantly, CS-F2 showed no inhibitory effects against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Our results suggest that CS-F2, which is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a molecular weight of approximately 8.0 x 10(4) Da, may exert a selective anti-adhesive effect against certain pathogenic bacteria, while exerting no effects against beneficial and commensal bacteria.
TI  - Transfer of bacteria between biomaterials surfaces in the operating room--an experimental study.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion to and transfer between surfaces is a complicated process. With regard to the success of biomaterials implants, studies on bacterial adhesion and transfer should not be confined to biomaterials surfaces in the human body, but also encompass surfaces in the operating room, where the origin of many biomaterials related infections is found. The purpose of this study was to quantify the transfer of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Propionibacterium acnes from one operating room material to another, while accounting for surface hydrophobicity and roughness, moistness and application of friction during transfer. The tested operating room materials were gloves, broaches (orthopaedic drills), theatre gowns, and light handles. As a possible clinical intervention method to prevent transfer, it was investigated whether dipping the gloves in a chlorhexidine splash-basin affected the viability of the transferred bacteria. Transfer (moist and without friction) was demonstrated to some extent with all bacterial strains and with every material, ranging from 17% to 71%, and was influenced by the bacterial strain, moistness of the inoculum, the application of friction, and the characteristics of both the donating and the receiving surface. Dipping the glove material in 4% or 0.4% chlorhexidine solutions killed all bacteria present, regardless of whether surfaces were dried or moist and thus prevented transfer.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic sinusitis and acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the microbiological characteristics of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (AECS). SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Thirty-two patients with chronic sinusitis and 30 patients with AECS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of maxillary AECS and chronic maxillary sinusitis. RESULTS: A total of 81 isolates (33 aerobic and 48 anaerobic) were recovered from the 32 cases (2.5 per specimen) with chronic sinusitis. Aerobes alone were recovered in 8 specimens (25%), anaerobes only were isolated in 11 (34%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 13 (41%). The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus. The predominant anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus subspecies, Fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and Propionibacterium acnes. Twenty-one beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 17 specimens (53%). A total of 89 isolates (40 aerobic and facultatives, and 49 anaerobic) were recovered from the 30 patients (3.0 per specimen) with AECS. Aerobes were recovered in 8 instances (27%), anaerobes only in 11 (37%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes were recovered in 11 (37%). The predominant aerobes were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus subspecies, Fusobacterium subspecies, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, and P acnes. Thirty-six beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 28 specimens (53%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the organisms isolated from patients with AECS were predominantly anaerobic and were similar to those generally recovered in patients with chronic sinusitis. However, aerobic bacteria that are usually found in acute infections (eg, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) can also emerge in some of the episodes of AECS.
TI  - An in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. METHOD: Three bioxygenating hydrogels were tested: Oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and Iodozyme 402 and Iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with Iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. Cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. Cut squares of control or test dressings were placed on top of each disk. Kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. RESULTS: Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. The order of sensitivity for Oxyzyme was Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (Iodozyme 402, followed by Iodozyme 401 and then Oxyzyme) was the same regardless of the target species. CONCLUSION: The novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.
TI  - Influence of skin flora and preventive measures on surgical site infection during cardiac surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The skin flora responsible for most surgical site infections (SSIs) include Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Propionibacterium acnes, gram-negative bacilli, micrococci, and diphtheroids. The two major methods of reducing local concentrations of bacteria are administration of an antibiotic and cleansing of the skin. Resistance to antibiotics is a major concern. Mortality rates in patients infected by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or comparably virulent bacteria may be as high as 74%. METHODS: Review of current practice and guidelines. RESULTS: There is no standard regimen for antimicrobial prophylaxis. No added benefit is conferred by prophylaxis exceeding 48 h. A number of preoperative skin care techniques have been used to limit concentrations of bacteria at the surgical site, including antiseptic preparations, adhesive barrier drapes, topical antibiotics, hair removal, and hand hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic prophylaxis minimizes the risk of SSI in patients having cardiac surgery. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria makes it necessary to avoid the use of antimicrobials when they are not necessary. Preoperative skin care does reduce contamination at the incisional site and may reduce the risk of SSI.
TI  - Infections associated with orthopedic implants.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We review recent advances in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infections associated with joint prostheses and internal fixation devices. RECENT FINDINGS: The perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered 60-30 min before incision or before inflation of the tourniquet. New diagnostic approaches include sonication of removed implants to dislodge adherent microorganisms growing in biofilms and the use of molecular techniques to improve diagnostic yield. Treatment of implant-associated infections without removal of the device is an established option for selected patients. Treatment with rifampin combinations in staphylococcal infections is crucial for success. As demonstrated in vitro, in animal studies and in clinical trials, quinolones are suitable combination agents with rifampin against susceptible staphylococci, but increasing antimicrobial resistance requires evaluation of alternative combination agents, such as quinpristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin, although clinical experience is limited. New antimicrobial agents, such as dalbavancin, tigecycline, iclaprim, and novel rifamycin derivatives are studied. SUMMARY: Better understanding of the interaction between microorganisms, the implant and the host may improve our current approach to the diagnosis and treatment of implant-associated infections. The treatment modality depends on duration of infection, stability of the implant, antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogen and condition of the surrounding soft tissue.
TI  - Effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 on skin-inflammatory bacteria.
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 against skin-inflammatory bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 65389, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 21059, and Propionibacterium acnes ATCC 6919. The spot-on-the-lawn method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin against indicator strains on the human skin. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 inhibited the growth of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. aureus ATCC 65389, Strep. pyogenes ATCC 21059, and P. acnes ATCC 6919. The treatment of crude bacteriocin caused a rapid inactivation of P. acnes ATCC 6919. The LC50 of bacteriocin on human fibroblast was ca. 50mg/ml at which the inhibition of cell proliferation was not observed. Neither any irritations nor allergic reactions by the bacteriocin were evident in a human patch test. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 may be a useful antimicrobial substance to control the growth of P. acnes and to prevent skin inflammation and acne.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of Dead Sea black mineral mud.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The unique, black, hypersaline mud mined from the Dead Sea shores is  extensively used in mud packs, masks, and topical body and facial treatments in spas surrounding the lake, and in cosmetic preparations marketed worldwide, but little is known about its antimicrobiological properties. METHODS: We performed detailed microbial and chemical analysis of Dead Sea mineral mud compounded in dermatological and cosmetic preparations. RESULTS: Using conventional bacteriological media (with or without salt augmentation), we found surprisingly low numbers of colony-forming microorganisms in the mud. The highest counts (up to 20,000 colonies per gram, mostly consisting of endospore-forming bacteria) were obtained on sheep blood agar. Test microorganisms (i.e. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, Candida albicans) rapidly lost their viability when added to the mud. Zones of growth inhibition were observed around discs of Dead Sea mud placed on agar plates inoculated with Candida or with Propionibacterium, but not with Staphylococcus or Escherichia. The effect was also found when the mud was sterilized by gamma irradiation. Using (35)S-labeled sulfate as a tracer, bacterial dissimilatory sulfate reduction could be demonstrated at a low rate (0.13 +/- 0.03 nmol/cm(3).d). CONCLUSION: The antibacterial properties of Dead Sea mud are probably owing to chemical and/or physical phenomena. Possible modes of antimicrobial action of the mud in relation to its therapeutic properties are discussed.
TI  - Pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from Panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of Panax ginseng against the adhesion of Helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of Porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. In this study, this acidic polysaccharide from P. ginseng, PG-F2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/mL. However, results showed no inhibitory effects of PG-F2 against Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. PG-F2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean MW of 1.2 x 10(4) Da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. The complete hydrolysis of PG-F2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (EC. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor PG-F2 (the MIC of ca. 0.01 mg/mL against H. pylori and P. gingivalis). Our results suggest that PG-F2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.
TI  - Improved aero-anaerobe recovery from infected prosthetic joint samples taken from 72 patients and collected intraoperatively in Rosenow's broth.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recovery of the bacteria responsible for prosthetic joint infections is a major problem, which is due in part to the alteration of their ability to grow by storage during transportation to the laboratory. METHODS: In this prospective study, we assessed the benefit of inoculating an enriched liquid medium (Rosenow's broth) with intraoperative samples from 72 patients with prosthetic joint revision due to infection. We compared the results of culture of specimens collected in a standard receptacle with the results for specimens collected in Rosenow's broth. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: 144 samples were taken by each of the 2 collection methods for subsequent culture. Concordance between standard and Rosenow samples was observed for 52 of the 58 strains cultured on agar and for 42 of the 97 strains (p < 0.001) which grew only in liquid medium. Infection would not have been diagnosed in 26 patients (almost one-third of all patients) without combining sample collection in Rosenow's broth with standard collection. The bacteria that were not recovered from standard samples but which were recovered from those collected in Rosenow's broth included not only strict anaerobes, in particular Propionibacterium acnes, but also coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Long-chain 3-acyl-4-hydroxycoumarins: structure and antibacterial activity.
AB  - By reacting 4-hydroxycoumarin with long-chain acyl chlorides, a number of new 3-acyl derivatives were prepared and the relationship was studied between their structures and activities against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, and Propionibacterium acnes ATCC 11827. Antibacterial activity was associated with enolic tautomers of a tricarbonylmethane group bearing a lipophilic side chain (undec-10-enoyl, undec-10-ynoyl, palmitoyl or octadec-9-enoyl). A newly synthesized 2-acyl derivative of 2H-indene-1,3-dione containing the same tricarbonylmethane motif showed a comparable activity.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - Biological activities of Schefflera leucantha.
AB  - This study investigated various biological activities of the ethanolic extract of dried ground leaves of Schefflera leucantha Viguier (Araliaceae). The extract possessed very low cytotoxicity to brine-shrimp with the LC(50) of 4,111.15 microg/ml; the significant antioxidant activity on DPPH with the EC(50) of 71.90 microg/ml; the inhibitory activity on mushroom tyrosinase with the IC(50) of 10.53 mg/ml using the dopachrome microplate-assay. The extract of 5-20 mg/ml range in the agar dilution assay were active against various pathogenic microbial (11 species, 11 strains), with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5 mg/ml against Clostridium spp.; MIC=10 mg/ml against enteropathogens as Bacteroides spp., Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Lactobacillus spp., Peptococcus spp. and Streptococcus mutans; MIC=10 mg/ml against a pneumonia causing bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and a dermatopathogen as Propionibacterium acnes; MIC=20 mg/ml against dermatopathogens as Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus spp. and Candida albicans ATCC 90028. TLC fingerprints of the specific extracts from the leaf powder exhibited zones of steroids-terpenes and flavonoids. HPLC fingerprint of the flavonoid extract was performed.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction for the rapid detection of cerebrospinal fluid shunt or ventriculostomy infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Infection after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts or ventriculostomies  is a common complication associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a powerful molecular technique that allows rapid and precise amplification of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and has proven a powerful tool in the detection of a wide variety of clinically important infectious diseases. We analyzed specimens of CSF derived from ventriculoperitoneal shunts or external ventricular drains by using both conventional cultures and PCR and report herein our preliminary results. METHODS: We selected 86 CSF samples from adult patients who underwent either shunt tap or routine surveillance cultures of their ventriculostomy. These specimens were chosen from a larger group of 300 specimens that were routinely collected (many serially) in our clinical practice. They were chosen because clinical suspicion of infection was increased because of either patient signs and symptoms (fever, stiff neck, lethargy, worsening neurological examination) or preliminary laboratory analysis of CSF data (increased white blood cell count, increased protein level, decreased glucose). We considered this subgroup optimal to efficiently initiate our investigation of the correlation of PCR and culture results. CSF was increased by using standard culture techniques and by using PCR. Samples of CSF that were to undergo PCR had DNA extracted, purified, and amplified for 16S rRNA using primers 16S-Forward and 16S-Reverse of conserved sequence regions of all bacteria. DNA was PCR-amplified for 30 cycles. One microliter of the first PCR product was subjected to nested PCR using primers specific for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Samples were also subjected to PCR amplification for specific detection of Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus using specific primers for 16S rRNA Propionibacterium, nuclease gene of Staphylococcus, and Mec gene of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: For 18 of 86 specimens (21%), both the culture and PCR were positive. For 30 of 86 specimens (35%), both the PCR and culture results were negative. For 42 of 86 specimens (49%), cultures were negative and PCR was positive. There were no positive culture results with negative PCR results. Most negative culture/positive PCR cases occurred after prolonged intravenous antibiotics. Of the 56 PCR-positive specimens, 30 were positive for Propionibacterium acnes, whereas 40 were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Of the Staphylococcus aureus-positive specimens, two were positive for methicillin resistant-Staphylococcus aureus. Among the 56 PCR-positive specimens, 30 were positive for both Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus aureus; gram-negative organisms were not detected by any method in these specimens. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that PCR is a highly sensitive, rapid, and potentially promising modality for the detection and treatment of CSF shunt ventriculostomy infection.
TI  - Effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 on skin-inflammatory bacteria.
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp.HY 449 against skin-inflammatory bacteria such as Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 65389, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 21059, and Propionibacterium acnes ATCC 6919. The spot-on-the-lawn method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin against indicator strains on the human skin. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 inhibited the growth of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, S. aureus ATCC 65389, Strep. pyogenes ATCC 21059, and P. acnes ATCC 6919. The treatment of crude bacteriocin caused a rapid inactivation of P. acnes ATCC 6919. The LC(50) of bacteriocin on human fibroblast was approximately 50mg/ml at which the inhibition of cell proliferation was not observed. Neither any irritations nor allergic reactions by the bacteriocin were evident in a human patch test. The bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus sp. HY 449 may be a useful antimicrobial substance to control the growth of P. acnes and to prevent skin-inflammation and acne.
TI  - Infectious keratitis in the corneal graft: treatment with partial conjunctival flaps.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The infection of the corneal graft is one of the most serious complications following keratoplasty. In many instances, it can be treated successfully with intensive topical and subconjunctival antibiotics. However, when this therapy is ineffective, a surgical approach must be considered. The usefulness of partial conjunctival flaps that spare the visual axis for managing corneal graft infections is reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of four cases. All patients were males between 12 and 85 years old. The four abscesses developed in the penetrating corneal graft during the first year after keratoplasty. The organisms found were Propionibacterium acnes, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. After failure of medical therapy, they were operated on using the partial, thick conjunctival flap technique. RESULTS: Resolution of the infection and maintenance of a clear graft was achieved in all patients. The follow-up ranged from 5 to 8 years. CONCLUSION: The partial conjunctival flap is an effective surgical procedure for the treatment of abscesses in penetrating keratoplasties when medical treatment has failed.
TI  - Microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We undertook to evaluate the microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (AECS). METHODS: Repeated aspirations of maxillary sinus secretions by endoscopy were performed in 7 patients over a period of 125 to 242 days. RESULTS: Bacteria were recovered for all 22 aspirates, and the number of isolates was between 2 and 4. A total of 54 isolates were isolated: 16 aerobic and facultative bacteria and 38 anaerobic bacteria. The aerobic bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae (7 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Moraxella catarrhalis (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1). The anaerobic bacteria included pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp (19), Peptostreptococcus spp (9), Fusobacterium spp (8), and Propionibacterium acnes (2). A change in the types of isolates was noted in all consecutive cultures obtained from the same patients as different organisms emerged and previously isolated bacteria were no longer recovered. An increase in antimicrobial resistance was noted in 6 instances. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the microbial dynamics of AECS in which anaerobic and aerobic bacteria prevail, and highlights the importance of obtaining cultures from patients with AECS for guidance in selection of proper antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - Flomoxef sodium and levofloxacin concentrations in aqueous humor.
AB  - AIMS: We intravenously administered flomoxef sodium (FMOX) 120 minutes before cataract surgery, topically administered levofloxacin (LVFX) into the eyes four times at 30-minute intervals before surgery, and measured the aqueous humor concentrations of these agents to investigate their penetration into the aqueous humor and their efficacy in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients who underwent cataract surgery at the Department of Ophthalmology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, or its affiliate, Kanazawa Hospital, Yokohama, were enrolled in this study. They received one or both of the following: 1.0 g FMOX via a 20-minute intravenous drip and LVFX ophthalmic solution applied four times at 30-minute intervals, both beginning two hours before the operation. Aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for FMOX and LVFX concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: The mean intraoperative FMOX and LVFX concentrations in the patients' aqueous humor were 1.21 +/- 0.63 microg/ml and 0.69 +/- 0.47 microg/ml, respectively. These concentrations sufficiently exceeded the MIC90 values against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes. CONCLUSIONS: The FMOX and LVFX concentrations in the aqueous humor sampling were adequate to kill bacteria in vitro. These drugs may have efficacy in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis in patients undergoing cataract surgery.
TI  - Repeat infective endocarditis: differentiating relapse from reinfection.
AB  - Repeat infective endocarditis due to the same species can represent relapse of the initial infection or a new infection. We used time-based clinical criteria and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-based molecular criteria to classify 13 cases of repeat infective endocarditis as either relapse or reinfection. The agreement between clinical and molecular criteria was imperfect (agreement in 10 [77%] of 13 cases).
TI  - The antimicrobial activities of Psidium guajava and Juglans regia leaf extracts to acne-developing organisms.
AB  - This study aims to present the in vitro inhibitory effect of Psidium guajava and  Juglans regia leaf extracts on the main developer of acne lesions, Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), and other organisms that are isolated from acne lesions. Thirty-eight subjects (males and females) who had various types of acne were enrolled in the study. The contents of the acne lesions were cultured and the frequency of P. acnes (alone and with Staphylococci spp.) was 47%, whereas the frequencies for Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 13% and 24%, respectively. The antimicrobial activities of Psidium guajava and Juglans regia leaf extracts, determined by disk diffusion method (zone of inhibition), were compared to tea tree oil (TTO), doxycycline and clindamycin antibiotics. The zones of inhibition due to the Psidium guajava and Juglans regia leaf extracts ranged from 15.8-17.6 mm against P. acnes, 11.3-15.7 mm against S. aureus and 12.9-15.5 mm against S. epidermidis, respectively. These zones of inhibition were significantly higher than those of TTO and equivalent in case of Staphylococci spp., but less in case of P. acnes, to those obtained from doxycycline or clindamycin. It can be concluded that Psidium guajava and Juglans regia leaf extracts may be beneficial in treating acne especially when they are known to have anti-inflammatory activities.
TI  - Microbial contamination of hematopoietic progenitor cell grafts-incidence, clinical outcome, and cost-effectiveness: an analysis of 735 grafts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening of progenitor cell grafts (marrow, peripheral blood, and cord blood) for microbial contamination is required by the standards of AABB. Clinical sequelae from infusion of these contaminated grafts, however, is uncommon. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 735 consecutive marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cell harvests between 1998 and 2003 was performed. Analysis included incidence, clinical outcome, and cost outcomes of positive blood cultures and antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: Thirty-three of 735 (4.5%) harvests were contaminated. The incidence of microbial contamination varied with the source of the graft (4 of 26 [15%] were cord blood, 8 of 177 [4.5%] were marrow, and 21 of 532 [3.9%] were peripheral blood). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (n=22) and Propionibacterium acnes (n=8) were most frequently isolated. Potentially pathogenic organisms were isolated in 6 of 735 (0.81%) grafts (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 4; methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 1; and Enterobacter cloacae, 1). The estimated total cost of surveillance was approximately $81,585. The cost of vancomycin therapy in 4 patients who received prophylactic antibiotic therapy was approximately $10,000. No adverse sequelae followed infusion of contaminated grafts. CONCLUSION: Clinical sequelae following infusion of microbially contaminated progenitor cells is extremely rare. Prophylactic empiric antibiotics may be unnecessary. Routine microbial surveillance of progenitor cell grafts is a low-yield procedure.
TI  - Infected neonatal cephalohematomas caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the microbiological and clinical features of six children with infected cephalohematomas (IC) caused by anaerobic bacteria. DESIGN: Presentation of a case series. RESULTS: Polymicrobial infection was present in all instances, where the number of isolates varied from two to four. Two patients had anaerobes only and the other four had mixed flora of strict anaerobes and facultatives. There were 16 bacterial isolates (12 anaerobic, 4 aerobic). The anaerobic isolates were Peptostreptococcus spp. (5 isolates), Prevotella spp. (4), Bacteroides fragilis group (2), and Propionibacterium acnes (1). The aerobic isolates were E. coli (2), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and group B streptococci (1). Blood cultures were positive for three patients. The most common predisposing conditions were vacuum extraction and amnionitis (4 instances of each), instrumental delivery (3), electronic fetal monitoring (2), prolonged delivery (1), and premature rupture of membranes (1). All patients underwent drainage, and four also had surgical incision and drainage of the IC. Osteomyelitis developed in one instance and scalp abscess developed in two patients, both of whom had electronic fetal monitoring. All patients eventually recovered from infection after receiving parenteral and subsequent oral antibiotic therapy for a total of 14-38 days. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in IC in newborns.
TI  - Formulation and evaluation of an effective pH balanced topical antimicrobial product containing tea tree oil.
AB  - The effect of pH on the antimicrobial activity of Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil formulations was studied. Microemulsions, liposomal dispersions, multiple emulsions and a colloidal bed of sterile clay were formulated using 5% w/w of tea tree oil. A number of formulations were prepared at various pH values (5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0). Thermal stability studies showed that the formulations were stable for more than eight months. Agar dilution tests showed MICs of 1.0% v/v S. aureus and S. epidermidis. In the broth dilution test, MBC of the oil for P. acnes was 0.5% v/v. MIC and MBC values were comparable to those of non-formulated tea tree oil, indicating that tea tree oil retained its activity in the above-mentioned formulations. The microbiological evaluation showed that the formulations containing 5% w/w tea tree oil had a maximum effect at pH 5.5.
TI  - [The study of the pro-nucleating activity of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones in model bile systems].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones and gallstone formation. METHODS: Observe the bacteria activity in model bile and the influence of bacteria on the cholesterol nucleation time (NT). RESULTS: (1) Model bile were suitable for the growth of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and Clostridium. Propionibacterium acne grew weakly and the growth of Bacteroides fragilis was restrained in model bile. (2) Only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enTerococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) With pseudomonas aeruginosa or enTerococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.
TI  - [Study on anti-bacterium activity of ginkgolic acids and their momomers].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ginkgolic acids and their three monomers were separated from ginkgo sarcotestas. The anti-bacterium activity of ginkgolic acids were tested. The relation between the anti-bacterium activity and side chain of ginkgolic acid were studied. METHOD: The MIC of ginkgolic acids and their three monomers and salicylic acid were tested. RESULTS: Ginkgolic acid has strong inhibitive effect on G+-bacterium. Salicylic acid has no side chain, so no anti-bacterial activity. When the length of gingkolic acid side chain is C13:0, it has the strongest anti-bacterial activity in three monomers. CONCLUSION: The side chain of ginkgolic acid is the key functional group that possessed anti-bacterial activity. The length of Ginkgolic acid was the main effective factor of anti-bacterial activity.
TI  - Enhanced resistance to Gram-positive bacterium and increased susceptibility to bacterial endotoxin in mice sensitized with Propionibacterium acnes: involvement of Toll-like receptor.
AB  - Mice sensitized with Propionibacterium acnes showed an enhanced resistance against infection with Listeria monocytogenes in contrast to the increased susceptibility to LPS-induced endotoxin shock. The enhanced protection to L. monocytogenes was mediated by activated innate immunity but not by generation of Listeria-specific acquired immunity. After infection with L. monocytogenes, the elimination of bacteria was observed earlier in accordance with a higher level of endogenous cytokine production in P. acnes-sensitized mice than in control mice. Peritoneal cells from P. acnes-sensitized mice produced a larger amount of IL-12p70 and nitric oxide after stimulation with heat-killed L. monocytogenes or peptidoglycan purified from Staphylococcus aureus. RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of TLR2 but not TLR1, TLR4 nor TLR6 was induced by injection of P. acnes in peritoneal cells. These results indicated that P. acnes-sensitization could induce the activation of innate immunity against L. monocytogenes through increased recognition of bacterial components by TLR2.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic hyperplastic sinusitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic hyperplastic sinusitis (CHS) form a heterogeneous group with similar symptoms and similar treatment despite of possible different mechanisms behind the disease. In the present study we focused on the microbiological findings in CHS and compared these results to the patient history in order to find out a possible explanation for the aetiology and chronicity of CHS. METHODS: In 30 patients the sinus mucus was collected under endoscopic sinus surgery. Samples from 20 healthy volunteers were collected by nasal lavage. Eosinophil staining, bacterial culturing and fungal staining and culturing were done. Histological samples were obtained from all patients. RESULTS: Bacterial cultures were positive in 93% of the patients compared to 70% in controls. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococci were the two most common findings in both groups. A total of seven patients had positive fungal finding. The only fungal genus found was Aspergillus. In the control group no samples were positive for fungi. CONCLUSIONS: Microbiological findings do not seem to explain the chronic course of CHS, but fungi may play some part in the pathophysiology of the disease. These results may be more a reflection of a change in the environment in the paranasal sinuses and a change in normal flora than the actual cause of CHS.
TI  - Single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  - The participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. This study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. Each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha points for 7 d. The gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. E. faecalis, Strep. sanguis, Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. The E. faecalis and Strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of Strep. intermedius, Strep. pyogenes and Staph. aureus. No biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with F. nucleatum, Prop. acnes, Porph. gingivalis and Prev. intermedia. These findings suggest that Gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.
TI  - Activity of nadifloxacin (OPC-7251) and seven other antimicrobial agents against  aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria isolated from bacterial skin infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The in vitro activity of nadifloxacin (OPC-7251), a novel topical fluoroquinolone, was assessed and compared with those of ofloxacin, oxacillin, flucloxacillin, cefotiam, erythromycin, clindamycin, and gentamicin against 144 Gram-positive bacteria: 28 Staphylococcus aureus, 10 Streptococcus spp., 68 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 36 Propionibacterium acnes, and 2 Propionibacterium granulosum strains. All strains originated from bacterial-infected skin disease and were isolated from patients with impetigo, secondary infected wounds, folliculitis and sycosis vulgaris, and impetiginized dermatitis. In vitro susceptibility of all clinical isolates was tested by agar dilution procedure and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined. RESULTS: Nadifloxacin was active against all aerobic and anaerobic isolates. MIC(90) (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited) was 0.1 microg/ml for S. aureus, 0.78 microg/ml for both Streptococcus spp. and CNS, and 0.39 microg/ml for Propionibacterium spp. On the other hand, resistant strains with MICs exceeding 12.5 mug/ml were found in tests with the other antibiotics. For both CNS and Propionibacterium acnes, MIC(90) values > or =100 microg/ml were demonstrated for erythromycin. Ofloxacin, cefotiam, erythromycin, clindamycin and gentamicin exhibited MIC(90) values < or =1 microg/ml for some bacterial species tested. Both oxacillin and flucloxacillin were active against all investigated bacterial species with MIC(90) values < or =1 microg/ml. CONCLUSION: In summary, nadifloxacin, a topical fluoroquinolone, was found to be highly active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from patients with infected skin disease, and seems to be a new alternative for topical antibiotic treatment in bacterial skin infections.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - [Microbiology of acute exacerbation chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  - The bacterial flora taken by sinus puncture from 115 patients with uni and bilateral acute exacerbation of chronic maxillary sinusitis was analyzed. Germ-free culture was obtained in 49 cases (40%) and in 69 cases (60%) bacteria were isolated from all sinus aspirates. Microbiological evaluation shows, that in majority of cases (90%) of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis there were pathogenic bacteria namely aerobic and anaerobic. The most frequent pathogens isolated from the aspirates were; Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus hominis, Propionibacterium acnes i Candida albicans. The culture analysis proves that one or more pathogens can be the etiological factor. In the majority of cases (64%) the sinusitis is caused by monoculture.
TI  - Validation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial detection of platelet (PLT)-rich-plasma (PRP)-derived PLTs  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. This study validated the BacT/ALERT for use in testing pooled PRP-derived PLTs with nine contaminating organisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two PRP-derived PLT pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 CFUs/mL). Four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 mL was plated onto blood agar. RESULTS: All organisms (excluding P. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respective). P. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively). With E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. This was most notable with S. viridans where the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for the detection of bacteria in PRP-derived PLTs in a pooled format. Overall, the use of the BacT/ALERT system allowed the detection of pooled PRP-derived PLTs inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 CFUs per mL in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding P. acnes).
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts and flavonoids from Eucalyptus maculata.
AB  - AIMS: We investigated the antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts to find effective antibacterial agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial activities of leaf extracts from 26 species of eucalyptus were measured. Extracts of Eucalyptus globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis significantly inhibited the growth of six Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Propionibacterium acnes), and of a fungus (Trichophyton mentagrophytes), but they did not show strong antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida). 2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxy-dihydrochalcone, eucalyptin and 8-desmethyl-eucalyptin, isolated from E. maculata extracts, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against seven micro-organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.0 to 31 mg l(-1). CONCLUSIONS: The eucalyptus extracts and three compounds from E. maculata were found to be effective against micro-organisms that cause food poisoning, acne and athlete's foot. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows potential uses of extracts from E. globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis, and antimicrobial compounds isolated from E. maculata.
TI  - Evaluation of the antibacterial efficacy of diesters of azelaic acid.
AB  - A number of diesters of the topical dermatosis treatment azelaic (nonanedioic) acid were prepared and tested for antibacterial effect. Two esters, bis-[(hexanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate and especially bis-[(butanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate showed promising activity against acne related bacteria in vitro. No activity of azelaic acid was detected in Mueller Hinton II agar at pH 7.3 when using the agar diffusion method, whereas both esters gave zones of growth inhibition. At pH 5.6, activity of azelaic acid was detected. At this pH, the zones of inhibition and MIC values obtained with azelaic acid were smaller than those of bis-[(butanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate for all test organisms. A preparation for topical use containing 20% (w/w) bis-[(butanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate, and the commercially available Skinoren (20% (w/w) azelaic acid), were compared for antibacterial effect against cutaneous bacteria using contact plate analyses of the skin. Though Skinoren was usually most effective, the differences were not statistically significant. Furthermore, bacteria surviving contact with the topical preparations were invariably more sensitive to the ester than to azelaic acid upon subculturing onto agar (pH 5.6) containing either preparation at 0.2-0.7 mg/ml. This might indicate that other factors, such as the composition of the cream base, mitigate the antibacterial activity of the ester. It is proposed that the pharmacological and microbiological properties of bis-[(butanoyloxy)methyl] nonanedioate are worthy of further study based on an extended screening of acne sufferers.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in PLT components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux [formerly Organon Teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in PLTs. The recovery of nine organisms seeded into PLTs with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. The use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into Day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis PLT units to 10 and 100 CFUs per mL. Replicate samples (4 mL) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. RESULTS: All organisms (with the exception of P. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 CFUs/mL). In aggregate (with the exception of P. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). In all cases, the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. P. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 CFUs/mL), respectively. The narrower bottle neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.
TI  - Comparison of chloroxylenol 0.5% plus salicylic acid 2% cream and benzoyl peroxide 5% gel in the treatment of acne vulgaris: a randomized double-blind study.
AB  - A 12-week double-blind randomized study was performed to compare benzoyl peroxide 5% (BP) gel and chloroxylenol 0.5% plus salicylic acid 2% (PCMX + SA) cream (Nisal cream) for efficacy and adverse reactions. Thirty-seven volunteers participated in the study, 19 in the BP group and 18 in the PCMX + SA group. The patients applied the medication twice daily to the entire face. Clinical evaluation and lesion counts were obtained at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks. At week 12 both groups showed a marked improvement in both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions (60% and 54% for the BP group and 62% and 56% for and 56% for the PCMX + SA group, respectively). Although PCMX + SA showed a slightly stronger keratolytic effect throughout the study period, there was no statistically significant difference in the reduction of the papulopustules or comedones between the two groups. Adverse effects such as erythema and photosensitivity were significantly fewer in the PCMX + SA group at week 12 (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.05, respectively). These results suggest that PCMX + SA cream is as effective as BP gel in the treatment of papulopustular and comedonal acne and that it is better tolerated.
TI  - Endophthalmitis isolates and antibiotic sensitivities: a 6-year review of culture-proven cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the spectrum of organisms causing culture-proven endophthalmitis and their sensitivities to commonly used antimicrobial agents. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed of all patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at a single institution between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2001. Endophthalmitis categories included postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and miscellaneous (for example, keratitis). The outcome measures included intravitreal isolates identified, antibiotic sensitivities, and category of endophthalmitis. RESULTS: In all, 313 organisms were isolated from 278 patients during the study interval. The most common organisms identified were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 27.8% (87/313), Streptococcus viridans group in 12.8% (40/313), other coagulase-negative staphylococci in 9.3% (29/313), Staphylococcus aureus in 7.7% (24/313), and Propionibacterium acnes in 7.0% (22/313). Overall, 246 of 313 (78.5%) isolates were gram-positive organisms, 37 (11.8%) were gram-negative organisms, and 27 (8.6%) were fungi. For gram-positive organisms, sensitivities were the following: vancomycin 100%, gentamicin 78.4%, ciprofloxacin 68.3%, ceftazidime 63.6%, and cefazolin 66.8%. For gram-negative organisms, sensitivities were the following: ciprofloxacin 94.2%, amikacin 80.9%, ceftazidime 80.0%, and gentamicin 75.0%. Fungal isolates were Candida species (9/313), Aspergillus species (9/313), and other molds (9/313). Among the endophthalmitis categories, the most frequent organisms were the following: (1) acute-onset postoperative: S epidermidis, 46.9%; (2) delayed-onset postoperative: S epidermidis, 22.7%; (3) delayed-onset bleb-associated: fastidious gram-negative rods, 20.4%; (4) posttraumatic: S epidermidis, 20.8%; (5) endogenous: Aspergillus species, 20.8%; and (6) miscellaneous: molds (other), 36.4%. CONCLUSIONS: In considering antibiotic treatment of endophthalmitis, it is important to recognize that no single antibiotic provided coverage for all of the microbes isolated from eyes with endophthalmitis. Combination therapy is recommended as the initial empiric treatment of suspected bacterial endophthalmitis. Appropriate history and characteristic clinical features may justify the use of initial antifungal agents. Knowledge of the most frequent causative organisms in various categories will help direct appropriate initial therapy.
TI  - Formation of Propionibacterium acnes biofilms on orthopaedic biomaterials and their susceptibility to antimicrobials.
AB  - Failure to treat and eradicate prosthetic hip infection with systemic antibiotic  regimens is usually due to the fact that the infection is associated with biofilm formation and that bacterial cells growing within a biofilm exhibit increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. In this in vitro study, we investigated the susceptibility of prosthetic hip Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus spp. isolates growing within biofilms on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement to a range of antibiotics. All P. acnes isolates in the biofilm mode of growth demonstrated considerably greater resistance to cefamandole, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. In contrast, only four of the eight P. acnes isolates demonstrated an increase in resistance to gentamicin. All ten Staphylococcus spp. isolates in the biofilm mode of growth exhibited large increases in resistance to gentamicin and cefamandole with eight of the ten isolates also exhibiting an increase in resistance to vancomycin. However, only three of the ten Staphylococcus spp. isolates exhibited an increase in resistance to ciprofloxacin. Biofilms were also formed on three different titanium alloys and on PMMA bone cement using P. acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus strains to determine if the underlying biomaterial surface had an effect on biofilm formation and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacteria growing within biofilms. Although differences in the rate at which the three strains adhered to the different biomaterials were apparent, no differences in biofilm antibiotic resistance between the biomaterials were observed. In the light of these results, it is important that the efficacy of other antibiotics against P. acnes and Staphylococcus spp. prosthetic hip isolates growing within biofilms on orthopaedic biomaterials be determined to ensure optimal treatment of orthopaedic implant infection.
TI  - Palmitoleic acid isomer (C16:1delta6) in human skin sebum is effective against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The percent lipid composition of pooled human sebum analyzed by thin-layer chromatography was: ceramides (13%), fatty acid (47%), cholesterol (7%), cholesterol esters (2%), squalene (11%), triglycerides (3%), and wax esters (17%). Total sebum lipids (2- 4 mg/ml), sonicated into bacterial culture medium, caused 4- to 5-fold log reduction in growth of gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius and the anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum, but was ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. Fractionation of the sebum lipids showed that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contained the bulk of the antimicrobial activity. Lauric acid (C12:0) was the most active saturated fatty acid. The unsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (C16:1delta6, cPA) was both the most predominant monoene and the most active antimicrobial fatty acid. Purified cPA (>99%) yielded typical minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 10-20 microg/ml against gram-positive bacteria. Organically synthesized cPA isomer gave MIC values comparable to the natural material. Both natural and synthetic cPA were found to be the most active sebum lipid fraction in blocking the adherence of a pathogenic strain of Candida albicans to porcine stratum corneum. Ethanol in combination with cPA exerts a synergistic bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, and several methacillin-resistant strains of S. aureus. Palmitoleic acid may be useful in topical formulations for treatment of secondary gram-positive bacterial infections, as a gram-positive bacteria antimicrobial in wound dressings, and as a natural gram-positive antimicrobial preservative in skin and hair care products.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal effect of low-dose ultraviolet B in patients with acne.
AB  
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Acne phototherapy with a high-intensity, enhanced, narrow-band, blue light source: an open study and in vitro investigation.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of phototherapy with a  newly-developed high-intensity, enhanced, narrow-band, blue light source in patients with mild to moderate acne. An open study was performed in acne patients who were treated twice a week up to 5 weeks. Acne lesions were reduced by 64%. Two patients experienced dryness. No patient discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. In vitro investigation revealed that irradiation from this light source reduced the number of Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes), but not Staphylococcus epidermidis that were isolated from the acne patients. Phototherapy using this blue light source was effective and well tolerated in acne patients and had an ability to decrease numbers of P. acnes in vitro, suggesting that this phototherapy may be a new modality for the treatment of acne.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Mediastinitis after cardiac surgery: improvement of bacteriological diagnosis by  use of multiple tissue samples and strain typing.
AB  - The diagnosis of postsurgical mediastinitis (PSM) among patients with sternal wound complication (SWC) after cardiac surgery is sometimes difficult, as fever, elevated C-reactive protein levels, and chest pain can be caused by a general inflammatory reaction to the operative trauma and/or sternal dehiscence without infection. The definitions of PSM usually used emphasize clinical signs and symptoms easily observed by the surgeon. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the use of standardized multiple tissue sampling, optimal culturing methods, and strain typing, together with a microbiological criterion for infection, could identify more infected patients than clinical assessment alone. Patients reexplored due to SWC after cardiac artery bypass grafting (CABG) or heart valve replacement (HVR) with or without CABG performed at the Department for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery at the Uppsala University Hospital between 10 March 1998 and 9 September 2000 were investigated prospectively. Tissue samples were taken from the sternum or adjacent mediastinal tissue, preferably before the administration of antibiotics. Culturing was performed both directly (on agar plates) and using enrichment broth. Species identification was performed by standard methods, and strain typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. A total of 41 cases with at least five tissue samples each were included in the study group. Of these patients, 32 were infected according to the microbiological criterion (i.e., the same strain was found in >/=50% of the samples). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the primary pathogen in 38% of the cases (12/32), S. aureus was the primary pathogen in 31% (10/32), P. acnes was the primary pathogen in 25% (8/32), and S. simulans and S. haemolyticus were the primary pathogens in 3% (1/32) each. All cases of S. aureus infection and 86% (12/14) of coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CoNS) infections were identified from primary cultures. All cases fulfilling the microbiological criterion for S. aureus infection were clinically diagnosed as cases of infection, but among the 14 cases fulfilling the criterion for microbiological diagnosis of CoNS infection, only 10 appeared to qualify clinically as cases of infection. Among the patients with sternal dehiscence in whom a microbiological diagnosis was established, 67% (12/18) had a CoNS infection, compared to 14% (2/14) of those without sternal dehiscence. The difference was statistically significant. PSM caused by S. aureus is readily identified by the surgeon, whereas 30% of cases with CoNS infections may be misinterpreted as noninfected. Multiple sampling before administration of antibiotics, primary culturing on agar plates, species identification, strain typing, and susceptibility testing should be used to ensure a fast and microbiologically correct diagnosis which identifies the primary pathogen and infected patients among those with minor infective symptoms. The role of P. acnes as a possible cause of PSM needs further investigation. PSM caused by CoNS is significantly related to sternal dehiscence.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An automated bacterial culture system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. The recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into Day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU per mL. Samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. RESULTS: All organisms, except P. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 CFU/mL) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 CFU/mL) hours. P. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 CFU/mL) or 66.0 (100 CFU/mL) hours. The 10-fold increase in inoculum was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. The aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours) between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: No difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. The new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.
TI  - Toxicity of Australian essential oil Backhousia citriodora (Lemon myrtle). Part 1. Antimicrobial activity and in vitro cytotoxicity.
AB  - The antimicrobial and toxicological properties of the Australian essential oil, lemon myrtle, (Backhousia citriodora) were investigated. Lemon myrtle oil was shown to possess significant antimicrobial activity against the organisms Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Aspergillus niger, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Propionibacterium acnes comparable to its major component-citral. An in vitro toxicological study based on the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium) cytotoxicity assay was performed. In vitro cytotoxicity testing indicated that both lemon myrtle oil and citral had a very toxic effect against human cell lines: HepG2 (a hepatocarcinoma-derived cell line); F1-73 (a fibroblast cell line derived from normal skin) and primary cell cultures of human skin fibroblasts. Cytotoxicity IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) values ranged from 0.008 to 0.014% (w/v) at 4 h to 0.003-0.012% (w/v) at 24 h of exposure. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for lemon myrtle oil was calculated as 0.5 mg/l at 24 h exposure and the RfD (reference dose) was determined as 0.01 mg/l. A product containing 1% lemon myrtle oil was found to be low in toxicity and could potentially be used in the formulation of topical antimicrobial products.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of T-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activity of T-3912, a novel non-fluorinated topical quinolone, was compared with that of nadifloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin and gentamicin. The in vitro activity of T-3912 against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, ofloxacin-resistant S. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Propionibacterium acnes was four-fold to 16 000-fold greater than that of other agents at the MIC90 for the clinical isolates. The activity of T-3912 was not influenced by grlA mutation in S. aureus, and the degree of MIC increase of T-3912 for grlA-gyrA double and triple mutants was lowest among the quinolones tested (nadifloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin). The inhibitory activity of T-3912 was compared with other quinolones for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV of S. aureus SA113. T-3912 showed the greatest inhibitory activity for both enzymes among the quinolones tested. The isolation frequency of spontaneous mutants resistant to T-3912 was < 1.7 x 10(-9) and < 2.0 x 10(-9) for S. aureus SA113 and P. acnes JCM 6425, respectively. Furthermore, resistance to T-3912 could not be clearly detected in the 28th transfer by the serial passage method. T-3912 exhibited more potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus and P. acnes than nadifloxacin and clindamycin in a short time period. T-3912 in a 1% gel formulation showed good therapeutic activity against a burn infection model caused by S. aureus SA113, P. acnes JCM6425 and multidrug-resistant S. aureus F-2161. These results indicate that T-3912 is potentially a useful quinolone for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections and that its potent bactericidal activity might be able to shorten the treatment period.
TI  - The microbiology of mucopyocele.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of mucopyocele. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of clinical and microbiologic records of patients with mucopyocele between June 1982 and September 1997. METHODS: Aspirates of 36 mucopyocele were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: One hundred six bacterial isolates, 42 aerobic and facultatives and 64 anaerobic, were recovered. The predominant aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (6 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (6), Hemophilus spp. (5), and Gram-negative bacilli (6). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (22), Prevotella sp. (15), Fusobacterium sp. (5), and Propionibacterium acnes(5). Thirty-three beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 23 patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of mucopyocele.
TI  - [Mechanisms behind the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is an increasing threat to the successful treatment of hospital and community-acquired infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on relevant literature, this article focuses on some of the essential resistance problems caused by pathogens such as pneumococci, staphylocci, enterococci and gram-negative rods, and provides a review of the genetic and molecular basis of bacterial resistance, as well as of the global trends in bacterial resistance. RESULTS: Mechanisms of resistance continue to evolve and disseminate among gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. New problems are developing, such as glycopeptide resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics as a result of chromosomal changes or the exchange of genetic material via plasmids and transposons. The emergence of multiresistant bacteria e.g. S. aureus, enterococci and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has made many currently available antibiotics ineffective. INTERPRETATION: The introduction of new antibiotics has always been followed by development of resistance.
TI  - Delayed infections after posterior TSRH spinal instrumentation for idiopathic scoliosis: revisited.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of delayed infections in idiopathic scoliosis treated with TSRH instrumentation, proper wound management after instrumentation removal, and whether the previously identified bacterial trend remains consistent. METHODS: All patients with idiopathic scoliosis > or =2 years after surgery with posterior TSRH instrumentation were included. Those cases with delayed infections were retrospectively reviewed. Time of presentation (infection) from index operation, clinical picture, sedimentation rate, presence of pseudarthrosis, organisms grown on culture, type of wound closure, and duration of antibiotics were examined. RESULTS: A total of 489 patients were identified > or =2 years postoperation; 23 had delayed infections (4.7%). Time of presentation averaged 27 months after initial surgery. Spontaneous drainage occurred in 15 patients, fluctuance in 6, and neither in the remaining 2 (pain and fever). Sedimentation rate averaged 48 mm/hr. All patients had instrumentation removed. Primary closure (1 stage) was performed in 14 patients, and delayed primary closure (> or =2 stages) was performed in nine patients. All wounds healed uneventfully. Cultures at the time of instrumentation removal grew Propionibacterium acnes in 12 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis (or Staphylococcus coagulase-negative) in 4, Micrococcus varians in 1, and Staphylococcus aureus in 1. Five patients had negative cultures. After removal, patients received parenteral antibiotics; in 21 of these patients this was followed by oral antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Low-virulent skin organisms are primarily responsible for delayed infections. Intraoperative seeding followed by subclinical quiescent periods appears to be the method by which infection occurs. The increased bulk and modularity of modern instrumentation systems can lead to inflammation and bursa formation, thus contributing significantly to the activation of these infections. Primary wound closure results in successful wound healing. Delayed closure after 48 hours is unnecessary. Short-term postoperative parenteral antibiotics (2-5 days) followed by short-term oral antibiotics (7-14 days) is recommended.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on dermatophyte fungi, Candida and bacterial skin pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: Nitric oxide is generated from sweat nitrite in the acidic environment of the skin surface and is thought to contribute to protection against infection. This study examined the sensitivity of Trichophyton mentagrophytes, T. rubrum, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes to acidified nitrite. METHODS AND RESULTS: Organisms were cultured in varying concentrations of nitrite and pH for different lengths of time, before being transferred to recovery medium. With the exception of Strep. pyogenes, addition of nitrite increased the antimicrobial activity of acid solutions against all organisms tested. The rank order of sensitivity was: C. albicans < T. rubrum < T. mentagrophytes < Staph. aureus < P. acnes, with P. acnes being most sensitive. CONCLUSION: This work has shown that acidified nitrite is microbiocidal to common cutaneous pathogens. The concentrations of nitrite required to kill pathogenic fungi and bacteria in in vitro assays were higher than the concentrations of nitrite measured in sweat. However, additional co-factors in vivo and in sweat may potentiate the effect of acidified nitrite. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Pharmacological preparations of acidified nitrite are novel antimicrobial agents. These data suggest skin organisms which may be sensitive to this treatment.
TI  - Activation of clindamycin phosphate by human skin.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the relative antimicrobial activity of clindamycin phosphate (CP) and clindamycin (Cly) and to examine the effect of skin homogenates on the activity of CP. METHODS AND RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined against dermally relevant organisms and bactericidal activity was studied using time-kill methodology. The effect of skin homogenates on the antimicrobial activity of CP was studied by well-diffusion assay. The MIC of Cly was substantially lower than that of CP in all susceptible organisms. Clindamycin also showed greater bactericidal activity (rate of kill) than CP. Phosphatases in skin homogenates activated CP at pH 4-8 with a maximal activation at pH 4. CONCLUSION: Phosphatases within the skin have been shown to convert CP to the more potent form Cly. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Conversion to Cly is a major determinant of antimicrobial activity in the skin layers following topical application of CP.
TI  - Killing of cutaneous microbial species by photodynamic therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes photosensitizers and light. Whereas PDT use in cancer treatment has been widely accepted, antimicrobial PDT (APDT) is still in its early stages of development. OBJECTIVES: To study microbial killing in vitro using APDT. METHODS: We used a combination of methylene blue and visible light, and a range of microbial species representative of those encountered on the skin in health and disease. Using standard light intensity conditions (slide projector, 25 cm distance from target, 42 mW cm(-2)) and methylene blue dye at 100 microg mL(-1), kill rates and subsequent D-values were determined against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Propionibacterium acnes and Candida albicans. RESULTS: D-values for these species were 72, 66, 48, 120, 30 and 660 s, respectively. The effects of light intensity on the killing of S. epidermidis showed the kill rate to be proportional to the light intensity. A high rate of cell kill was also obtained using natural sunlight. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicate that APDT of the skin may represent a useful alternative to conventional antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Correlation between microbiology and previous sinus surgery in patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 108 chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. There were 295 bacterial isolates: 109 aerobic and facultative, and 186 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (17 isolates), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12), Moraxella catarrhalis (10), and Haemophilus spp (8). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp (61), Prevotella spp (45), Fusobacterium spp (15), and Propionibacterium acnes (14). Analysis of the medical histories revealed a correlation only between the microbial results and previous sinus surgery. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-negative aerobic bacilli (GNAB) were more often isolated in patients who had surgery (9 of 33 patients had P aeruginosa and 17 had GNAB) than in patients who did not have surgery (3 of 75 had P aeruginosa and 7 had GNAB; p < .001). Anaerobes were isolated more often in patients who did not have surgery (69 of 75 patients) than in those who had previous surgery (21 of 33 patients; p < .001). These findings illustrate the unique microbiological features of chronic maxillary sinusitis that persist after sinus surgery.
TI  - A high incidence of Staphylococcus aureus colonization in the external eyes of patients with atopic dermatitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency distribution of bacteria on the external surface of eyes of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and to investigate the relationship between the frequency of bacterial colonization and the grade of atopy or ocular diseases associated with AD. DESIGN: Comparative cross-sectional study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six AD patients (mean age, 24.5 years) and 16 nonatopic, age-matched control participants (mean age, 25.5 years). INTERVENTION: The eyelid margins and conjunctival sacs were scraped with sterile swabs. These samples were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic culture media. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The frequency distribution of bacteria isolated from the eyelid margins and conjunctival sacs. RESULTS: Bacteria isolated from AD patients were: Staphylococcus aureus in 21 of 36 patients (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in two patients); Staphylococcus epidermidis in two patients (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in one patient); other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in six patients;alpha-streptococcus in three patients; Corynebacterium species in three patients; Neisseria species in two patients; and Propionibacterium acnes in one patient. From the nonatopic control participants, we isolated S. aureus in one patient, S. epidermidis in two patients and alpha-streptococcus in one patient. S. aureus was isolated from 67% of the AD patients, and any type of bacteria was isolated from 86% of the patients. These rates were significantly higher than those of nonatopic control participants (6% S. aureus and 25% any bacteria). There was no significant relationship between the frequency distribution of bacteria and the grade of atopy or associated ocular diseases. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of bacterial colonization, especially S. aureus, were found in the conjunctival sacs and eyelid margins of AD patients. In case management of AD patients, this unique distribution of bacteria must be carefully considered.
TI  - [In vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (LVFX) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. The clinical isolates except Vibrio cholerae were collected in Japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the MIC50 of LVFX against MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. LVFX was the most active against MRSA among the antibiotics tested. Most of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. LVFX showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. In particular, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains including PRSP were susceptible to LVFX at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. Among Enterococcus, ABPC showed superior activity against Enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of Enterococcus species were resistant to ABPC. LVFX was more active against to these Enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. On the other hand, LVFX and CPFX showed similar activity against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. CPFX had an MIC50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and LVFX showed an MIC50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LVFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against Acinetobacter species than CPFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and V. cholerae were inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. The MIC90 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. Some isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the MIC50 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Among anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than Peptostreptococcus species, and the MIC90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. In conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of LVFX compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. And our results suggest that LVFX may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Safety, efficacy, and functionality of high-field strength interventional magnetic resonance imaging for neurosurgery.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows neurosurgeons to interactively perform surgery using MRI guidance. High-field strength (1.5-T) imaging permits exceptional observation of intracranial and spinal pathological features. The development of this technology and its application to a variety of neurosurgical procedures are described. METHODS: We report on the first 101 cases that were treated in the interventional MRI unit (between January 1997 and September 1998). These cases included 39 brain biopsies, 30 tumor resections, 9 functional neurosurgical cases, 8 cyst drainages, 5 laminectomies, and 10 miscellaneous cases. Patients ranged in age from 14 months to 84 years (median, 43 yr); 61 patients were male and 40 were female. Intraoperative functional techniques that were used to influence surgical decision-making included magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional MRI, magnetic resonance angiography and venography, chemical shift imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging. All surgery was performed using MRI-compatible instruments within the 5-gauss line and conventional instruments outside that line. RESULTS: All 39 brain biopsies yielded diagnostic tissue. Of the 30 tumor resections, 24 (80%) were considered radiographically complete. The incidence of serious complications was low and was comparable to that associated with conventional operating rooms. One patient developed a Propionibacterium acnes brain abscess 6 weeks after surgery and another patient experienced Staphylococcus aureus scalp cellulitis after a brain biopsy, yielding an infection rate of less than 2%. No clinically significant hemorrhage was observed in immediate postoperative imaging scans, although one patient developed a delayed hematoma after a thalamotomy. One patient experienced a stroke after resection of a hippocampal tumor. No untoward events were associated with MRI-compatible instrumentation or intraoperative patient monitoring. CONCLUSION: High-field (1.5-T) interventional MRI is a safe and effective technology for assisting neurosurgeons in achieving the goals of surgery. Preliminary results suggest that the functional capabilities of this technology can yield data that can significantly influence intraoperative neurosurgical decision-making. The rates of serious complications, such as infection, associated with this new technology were low.
TI  - Antibacterial and antiandrogen flavonoids from Sophora flavescens.
AB  - Sixteen flavanones, three flavanonols, and four pterocarpans were isolated from the MeOH extract of the roots of Sophora flavescens. Twelve of these were new compounds, including eight prenylflavanones (1-8), one prenylflavanonol (9) and three novel pterocarpane derivatives (10-12). Their structures were elucidated using NMR and mass spectral methods. Some of these compounds have irregular C10 prenyl moieties at C-8 of the flavanone skeleton. These compounds exhibited significant antibacterial activities against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, S. epidermidis, and Propionibacterium acnes. They also exhibited antiandrogen activities.
TI  - Optimizing breast pocket irrigation: an in vitro study and clinical implications.
AB  - Subclinical infections have been implicated in the etiology of capsular contracture. Intraoperatively, breast pocket irrigation with povidone-iodine or other antibiotic solutions has been popularized; however, detrimental effects on wound healing for these agents have been reported and their efficacy against common organisms found around breast implants has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro efficacy of serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and two double antibiotic solutions DAB-1 (gentamicin/polymyxin B) and DAB-2 (gentamicin/cefazolin), against organisms most commonly found around breast implants. In phase I trials, serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and DAB were combined 1:1 with cultures of five common organisms found around implants. In phase II, povidone-iodine was serially diluted in DAB-1 rather than saline. In phase III, povidone-iodine was serially diluted with DAB-2. Efficacy for all phases was determined by plating the mixture onto agar plates and incubating at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. Povidone-iodine was 100 percent effective at a dilution of 12.5% against Staphylococcus epidermidis and 25% against Staphylococcus aureus but relatively ineffective against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas, DAB-1 was found to be ineffective against S. epidermidis but effective against S. aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, E. coli, and Pseudomonas. In phase II trials, a concentration of 12.5% povidone-iodine in DAB was effective at killing all experimental bacteria. In phase III trials, 10% povidone-iodine in DAB-2 was effective at killing all bacteria tested. In conclusion, to maximize bacterial control of common breast implant organisms and to minimize the detrimental effects on wound healing, 10% povidone-iodine in gentamycin/cefazolin may be used with excellent results and its use clinically may reduce the incidence of capsular contracture.
TI  - Microbiology of infected pustular psoriasis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections can occur in lesions of pustular psoriasis (PP). The objective of this study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected PP. METHODS: A retrospective 10-year review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records from patients with secondarily infected PP lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 23 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 patients (52%), anaerobic bacteria only in four (17%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in seven (30%). Thirty-six isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 23 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 13 strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (15 isolates), Group D Enterococcus (two isolates), and Escherichia coli (two isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (six isolates) and Bacteroides fragilis group, Propionibacterium acnes, and pigmented Prevotella spp. in two each. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (61%), 11 of which were S. aureus. Nineteen of the organisms isolated from 18 patients (78%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. S. aureus was isolated from all body sites. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. Enteric Gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on the legs and buttocks. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella, and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the hand. CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected PP lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions were demonstrated.
TI  - [Bacterial keratitis. Microbiological analysis as a principle for therapeutic recommendations].
AB  - PURPOSE: The study presented differentiates between the aetiological agents of bacterial keratitis in patients with and without a history of contact lens wear. Based on these results, recommendations are given for optimal antibiotic primary therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Swabs and corneal scrapings were taken from 218 patients referred to the University Eye Hospital in Munich with a diagnosis of bacterial keratitis from 1989 to 1997. Ninety-two of these patients had a history of contact lens wear; 126 had none. The germs were isolated and identified by staining and microscopy. Observing polymicrobial growth in 51 patients, a total of 275 germs was isolated. RESULTS: The most frequent pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis (44%), S. aureus (18%), Streptococcus spp. (10%), Propionibacterium acnes (7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%). Gram-negative germs were nearly exclusively isolated from contact lens wearers, gram-positive germs were predominant in non-contact lens wearers. CONCLUSION: Keratitis in patients with a history of contact lens wear is often caused by aggressive gram-negative germs. Those cases should immediately be treated with quinolones and erythromycin. In keratitis caused by gram-positive pathogens, a combination with aminoglycosides and erythromycin is sufficient.
TI  - In vitro viability of external eye microbial flora in hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose.
AB  - The aim of this study was to verify the in vitro influence of various dilutions of a viscoelastic substance containing 2% hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) on the viability of some microbial strains representative of the normal flora of the external eye. Pure reference strain cultures of Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and a fresh clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis were selected for this study. Serial twofold dilutions of 2% HPMC, prepared so as to obtain a final concentration ranging from 50 to 0.78% of the product in sterile saline solution (0.85% NaCl), were taken out with a pipette that delivered 1.0 ml per tube. One hundred microliters of the abovementioned microbial inocula, used for the evaluation of the positive control of the test organism, were dispensed into each tube. After 24 h of incubation, 100 microl of samples were taken from each tube and plated into the specific medium for the growth of the test organism. After 24-48 h of incubation, these agar plates were examined and the colony-forming-unit count of each test organism was compared to the corresponding total colony count, acting as a positive control, in order to determine the quantitative variation of the test organism grown in the presence of the viscoelastic compounds. C. albicans and P. aeruginosa showed a statistically significant increase in growth with HPMC dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:16. P. acnes and P. mirabilis growth was significantly reduced by all dilutions except for the 1:128 one. S. epidermidis growth was also significantly reduced in the presence of HPMC dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:64. S. aureus growth was not significantly influenced. The viability of P. aeruginosa in HPMC dilutions needs to be carefully considered because of the ability of this organism to induce endophthalmitis, and the possibility that during cataract surgery, a small amount of HPMC may be left in the eye, trapped behind the intraocular lens optic.
TI  - [Bacterial keratitis in patients with and without contact lens anamnesis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study shows differences between contact lens wearers and patients without history of contact lenses regarding the spectrum of etiological agents in bacterial keratitis. Based on microbiological analysis, there are given recommendations for an optimal initial antibiotic treatment in both groups. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1989 to 1997 smears, scrapings and corneal biopsies were taken from 218 patients with bacterial keratitis. The causing pathogens were isolated on directly inoculated culture media and identified by staining and microscopy. The resistance pattern of a total of 275 germs was analysed for different antibiotics. RESULTS: The most frequently isolated germs were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Propionibacterium acnes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Whereas sensitive gram-positive germs were predominating in contact lens wearers as well as in non-contact lens wearers, multiresistant gram-negative germs could nearly exclusively be isolated from contact lens wearers. Frequently administered antibiotics like aminoglycosides and quinolones are effective in infections caused by Staphylococcus spp., but increasing resistance could be seen to Streptococcus spp. In this case, erythromycin is very sensitive. Gram-negative germs like Pseudomonas aeruginosa are sensitive to quinolones and some aminoglycosides (e.g. tobramycin). CONCLUSION: In contact lens wearers, more aggressive germs have to be considered than in non-contact lens wearers. In such cases, frequently administered antibiotics like amino-glycosides are not effective. To cover problematic gram-negative germs we recommend the application of quinolones alternating with erythromycin. The latter one is more effective than quinolones and aminoglycosides in case of Streptococcus spp. co-involvement.
TI  - Use of a low nutrient culture medium for the identification of bacteria causing severe ocular infection.
AB  - A low nutrient culture medium was used to identify the pathogens in four cases of persisting ocular infection. Bacto R2A agar was used in addition to conventional liquid- and solid-phase media to culture pathogenic bacteria from one case of recurrent keratitis, one case of suture-related keratitis with endophthalmitis and two eyes (two patients) with post-operative endophthalmitis. In each case, a pathogen was identified solely with R2A agar after culture for 6 days. Species isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one), Propionibacterium acnes (two) and Staphylococcus aureus (one). Antibiotic therapy was tailored to conform to the sensitivity of the cultured organism in each case. The use of Bacto R2A low nutrient agar should be considered in culture negative eyes not showing clinical improvement, or for chronic cases where bacteria may have become adapted to more stringent ocular environments.
TI  - Bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (HA) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. The rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that HA can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. METHODS: In this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant HA (low, 141 kD; medium, 757 kD; and high, 1,300 kD) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. Three concentrations of each HA formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. RESULTS: Recombinant HA exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (MW) and concentration. The high concentrations of the medium MW HA had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella oris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes strains. The 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high MW HA had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. Among the bacterial strains studied, HA was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that HA in the MW range of 1,300 kD may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.
TI  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common bacteria found in cultures from the deep portions of hidradenitis suppurativa lesions, as obtained by carbon dioxide laser surgery.
AB  - The significance of bacterial findings in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is controversial. Interpretation of the results of bacteriological examinations from the surface of HS lesions is obscured by the possible contamination of resident skin bacteria. Bacteriological analysis of aspirates from deeper parts of HS is liable to show low sensitivity. We used a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser method to evaporate the diseased tissue level by level from the surface downwards, allowing concurrent sampling of bacteriological cultures from each level and thereby minimizing contamination with bacteria from the level above. In this study, 22 women and three men with a mean age of 35.3 years and a mean HS duration of 10.6 years were treated with this CO2 laser surgical method. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from superficial and deep levels were taken during surgery. The regions treated were axillary in eight and perineal in 17 cases. Bacterial cultures were positive for one or more specimens from at least one level in all cases and from deep levels in all but three cases. Sixteen different species or sub-species were found. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were the species most frequently found. Peptostreptococcus species and Propionibacterium acnes were not uncommon. S. aureus was detected in a total of 14 cases, six of which were from the deep levels. S. aureus was the sole bacterium isolated in two deep cultures. CNS were found in 21 patients and 16 of these isolates were from the deep levels. In nine of the 16 deep samples CNS were the only bacteria detected. These findings motivate a re-evaluation of the significance of bacteria in the progress of HS and in particular they suggest that CNS are true pathogens. It is known that foreign bodies aggravate the virulence of the CNS in surgical implants, and an environment which resembles that produced by a foreign body, as found in chronic HS tissue, serves to intensify the pathogenic properties of CNS in HS.
TI  - Resistance to antibiotics used in dermatological practice.
AB  - The increased prevalence of bacterial resistance is one of the major problems of  medicine today. Antibiotic resistance can be defined as the situation where the minimal inhibitory concentration is greater than the concentration obtainable in vivo. Resistance genes are easily transferred among bacteria, especially bacteria on skin and mucous membranes. In dermatological patients the most important resistance problems are found among staphylococci, Propionibacterium acnes and, to some extent, streptococci. Staphylococcus aureus strains have developed worldwide resistance to penicillin due to betalactamase production in > 90% of cases, and methicillin resistance is now a major problem with resistance levels of > 50% in certain areas of the world. These resistant strains are often multiresistant, and include resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline, with resistance to quinolone developing rapidly. Group A streptococci are still susceptible to penicillin, but increasing problems with erythromycin and tetracycline have been reported. After treatment with both systemic and oral antibiotics, P. acnes develops resistance in more than 50% of cases, and it is estimated that one in four acne patients harbours strains resistant to tetracycline, erythromycin, and clindamycin. To limit the development of antibiotic resistance, it is necessary to establish an antibiotic policy (prescription rules, reimbursement strategy, development of both national and local guidelines, and limitations on non-medical use). Clinicians also need access to rapid diagnostic methods, including resistance testing. This may provide further data for surveillance systems, reporting both antibiotic consumption and resistance levels. The involvement of clinical doctors in teaching and research in this area is probably the most important aspect, along with their involvement in the formulation of national and local guidelines. In the future we may consider it more important to ensure that future patients can be offered antibiotic treatment, rather than focusing on the patient presenting today.
TI  - Prospective evaluation of external ocular microbial growth and aqueous humor contamination during cataract surgery.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the route of aqueous humor contamination leading to the development of postoperative endophthalmitis. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, University of Helsinki, Finland. METHODS: Forty-nine eyes of 49 patients (31 having phacoemulsification and 18 extracapsular cataract extraction [ECCE]) participated in the study. Four bacterial cultures were taken: preoperative conjunctival swab, lid margin culture, intraoperative lacrimal lake sample, and immediate postoperative anterior chamber fluid sample. RESULTS: Preoperative lid margin cultures were positive in 59.2% of eyes, conjunctival cultures in 69.4%, and lacrimal lake cultures in 24.9%. Four aqueous humor samples (8.2%) showed bacterial growth in the anterior chamber aspirate: 3 in the phacoemulsification and 1 in the ECCE group. The bacteria isolated in this study, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes (2 positive isolates each) were sensitive to the preoperative topical antibiotics used. No aqueous humor sample or any from other locations showed gram-negative microbe growth. The most frequently recovered microbes in all samples collected from the 3 other sources were S epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococcus species, followed by P acnes and other propionibacterium species. Staphylococcus aureus, and diptheroids. CONCLUSION: The ocular surface significantly contributed to the transmission of microbes into the eye during cataract surgery. These microbes could not be eradicated by topical preoperative antibiotics. However, no patient developed postoperative endophthalmitis. Natural defense mechanisms appear to fend off a minor inoculum with these microbes of relatively low pathogenicity.
TI  - Superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present the microbiology and clinical features of six children with superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis (SST) caused by anaerobic bacteria. METHODS: A retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data was undertaken. RESULTS: Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they were mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 12 bacterial isolates (10 anaerobic and 2 facultatives). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus species (four isolates), Prevotella species (three), and one isolate each of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. SST at an intravenous infusion site developed in all but one patient. One patient sustained trauma to the leg, and cellulitis developed. Anaerobes of oral origin (Prevotella and Fusobacterium species) were recovered in scalp vein SST, and of gastrointestinal origin (Bacteroides fragilis) in a lower extremity SST. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with SST.
TI  - Pancreatic fluid collections: diagnostic and therapeutic implications of percutaneous drainage guided by ultrasound.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of the present study is to assess the usefulness of biochemical and bacteriological analysis of the pancreatic fluid obtained at percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts and abscesses guided by ultrasound. METHODOLOGY: The study population was comprised of 65 patients, aged 21-79 years: 18 with abscesses and 47 with pseudocysts. In all cases the etiological factor of pancreatic fluid collections was acute pancreatitis. Microbiological (both of aerobic and anaerobic flora), biochemical (including alpha 2-macroglobulin) and cytological analysis of aspirated fluid was performed. Duration of percutaneous drainage in pseudocysts was 10-40 days (mean 18 +/- 12) and in abscesses 21-56 days (mean 32 +/- 19). RESULTS: Complete resolution of pancreatic fluid collections was obtained in 54 (83%) patients, among them in 40 (85.1%) with pseudocysts and in 14 (77.7%) with abscesses, which was confirmed in follow-up ultrasound and/or computed tomography one year after the catheter was removed. Mild complications of this procedure observed in 17 (26.1%) patients were managed without catheter removal. A variety of organisms were cultured from pancreatic fluid, E. coli being the most prevalent. Enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus saccharolyticus, propionibacterium acnes and bacteroides fragilis were also isolated. Cytologic analysis of the aspirate revealed no atypical cells. The level of alpha 2-macroglobulin in the pancreatic fluid was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with successful pancreatic drainage as compared to the remaining group. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous drainage represents a safe therapeutic method that also provides additional criteria for the management of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions.
TI  - Percutaneous suction aspiration and drainage for pyogenic spondylitis.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of results in 23 cases of early-stage pyogenic spondylitis treated with percutaneous suction aspiration and drainage. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous suction aspiration and drainage as a treatment method for early-stage pyogenic spondylitis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Traditional surgical treatment for pyogenic spondylitis has the disadvantage of increased morbidity caused by the extensive exposure required in the presence of infection. Recently, a few case reports have described minimally invasive treatment for pyogenic spondylitis in which percutaneous suction aspiration was used. However, the efficacy of this new treatment has not yet been evaluated. METHODS: All charts, radiographs, and bacteriologic and histologic findings were reviewed. All 23 patients who received the new treatment were observed clinically and radiographically, to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. RESULTS: To date, all patients have been observed for more than 2 years. Twenty (87%) of the 23 patients have shown good results according to the evaluation. The causative organism was identified using tissue culturing in 12 (52%) of the 23 patients. The causative organism was Staphylococcus aureus in 8, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Propionibacterium acnes in 1 each. Back pain as the major symptom in these patients was relieved within an average of 9.4 days after the operation. However, the patient in whom the spondylitis was caused by Candida albicans has received this new treatment twice without success. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of percutaneous suction aspiration with drainage shows that it is an effective treatment for early-stage pyogenic spondylitis.
TI  - Microbiology of cervical lymphadenitis in adults.
AB  - The microbiology of needle aspirates from 40 inflamed cervical lymph glands was studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi and mycobacteria. Forty-two bacterial, 11 mycobacterial and six fungal isolates were isolated. Aerobic bacteria only were recovered in 11 (27.5%), anaerobes alone in five (12.5%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in seven (17.5%). Mycobacterium sp. were recovered in 11 (27.5%) and fungi in six (15%). The recovery of anaerobes was associated with dental infection. Eighteen aerobic bacteria were isolated and the predominant ones were Staphylococcus aureus (eight isolates) and group A streptococci (four). Twenty-four anaerobic bacteria were recovered and the predominant ones were: Prevotella sp. (six), Peptostreptococcus sp. (five), Propionibacterium acnes (four) and Fusobacterium sp. (three). These findings demonstrate the role of anaerobic organisms in cervical lymphadenitis and the need to culture aspirated material from the glands for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of chronic venous ulcers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of bacteria in the pathogenesis of chronic venous leg ulcers (CVLU) is unclear. The objective of the study was to establish the aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of CVLU. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of the clinical and microbiological laboratory records obtained from patients with CVLU. Microorganisms were grown from 43 specimens obtained from 41 patients. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria alone were present in 18 (42%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only in three (7%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 22 (51%). In total, there were 97 isolates, 64 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, an average of 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.5 aerobes and 0.8 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (26 isolates), group D streptococci (5), and Escherichia coli(5). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (15), Bacteroides fragilis group (6), Propionibacterium acnes (4), and Prevotella spp. (3). CONCLUSIONS: CVLU have a polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora.

TI  - Susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis to 10 Kampo formulations.
AB  - We examined the in vitro sensitivities of three bacteria: Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, commonly detected in acne lesions, and Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of skin infections, to 10 Kampo formulations (Chinese herbal medicines; combinations of powdered extracts of crude drugs). Both Staphylococcus species showed similar sensitivities to all 10 formulations, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 25 to 400 mg/ml. P. acnes, however, was particularly sensitive to one formulation, keigai-rengyo-to (MIC, 0.78-25 mg/ml), prompting speculation that it might contain components with strong antibacterial activity to P. acnes. P. acnes showed similar sensitivities to all the other formulations (MIC 6.25-200 mg/ml). The ranges of MICs and the MIC50S (concentrations that inhibit 50% of isolates) were very similar to those previously recorded in 1990 for the two Staphylococcus species.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  - Bacterial flora of stethoscopes' earpieces and otitis externa.
AB  - External otitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus was observed in a nurse after extensive use of a stethoscope. The infection recurred and a similar organism was isolated from the stethoscope's earpiece. The infection did not recur after the earpiece was cleansed after each use. In a prospective study, the bacterial flora of 35 earpieces was evaluated. Fifty-three isolates, 36 aerobic or facultative and 17 anaerobic, were recovered. The number of organisms per earpiece ranged from 14 to 204 (average 92 +/- 17). The predominant isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 isolates), Propionibacterium acnes (12), and Saureus (7). The study demonstrates the colonization of the stethoscope's earpiece with microorganisms that possess the potential for causing nosocomial infection.

AB  - Immunomodulation is now possible in veterinary medicine with the licensure of a number of biological products by the United States Department of Agriculture for veterinary use. These products activate primarily macrophages, induce the production of cytokines, and have various effects on the activity and proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Those products most commonly used are inactivated whole bacteria of Propionibacterium acnes, cell wall fractions of nonpathogenic Mycobacterium spp, and the lysate derived from lysis of Staphylococcus aureus by a bacterial phage. All products have been licensed for use against specific diseases, but the literature includes studies for off-label usage. These immunomodulators are considered to be nonspecific stimulators of the immune system and may affect both humoral and cellular functions of immunity.
TI  - Postoperative endophthalmitis: incidence, predisposing surgery, clinical course and outcome.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the predisposing surgery, clinical course and final visual outcome for patients with culture-proven and culture-negative postoperative endophthalmitis. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospital in Toronto. PATIENTS: A total of 164 patients with clinically suspected postoperative endophthalmitis admitted between January 1989 and March 1996. OUTCOME MEASURES: Type of surgery, clinical presentation, culture results, infecting organism, treatment and final visual outcome. RESULTS: An infectious agent was identified in 99 cases (60%). The organism most commonly isolated was coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (59 cases [60%]). In the culture-proven group cataract extraction was the most common predisposing surgical procedure, accounting for 85 cases (extracapsular cataract extraction [ECCE] in 60 cases and phacoemulsification in 25). The incidence rates of culture-proven endophthalmitis over the study period at our institution were 0.22% for ECCE and 0.30% for phacoemulsification. Of the 99 patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis 94 received intravitreal injections of antibiotics and 52 underwent vitrectomy. Of the 83 patients in this group for whom the final outcome was known, 29 (35%) had a visual acuity of 20/50 or better, and 15 (18%) had a vision of no light perception, with four eyes undergoing enucleation. Infection with organisms of low virulence (coagulase-negative Staphylococcus or Propionibacterium acnes) was associated with higher rates of 20/50 or better visual acuity compared with more virulent organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, streptococcal species and gram-negative bacilli) (46% vs. 10%) (p < 0.05). The culture-negative group had a significantly lower frequency of hypopyon on presentation (55% vs. 85%) and final outcome of no light perception (2% vs. 18%) (p < 0.01) than the culture-proven group. CONCLUSIONS: Endophthalmitis was most common after cataract surgery. The rates of endophthalmitis after ECCE and phacoemulsification were similar. Postoperative endophthalmitis caused by organisms other than coagulase-negative Staphylococcus or P. acnes carries a poor visual outcome.
TI  - Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis.
AB  - I retrospectively reviewed the records of 111 patients who had pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis unrelated to an open procedure on the spine. The mean age at the time of the diagnosis was sixty years (range, eighteen to eighty-four years); sixty-one patients (55 per cent) were sixty years old or more. Forty-four patients (40 per cent) had an impaired immune system secondary to diabetes mellitus, the use of corticosteroids, chemotherapy for cancer, rheumatic or immunological disease, renal or hepatic failure, malnutrition, or myelodysplasia. Magnetic resonance imaging, critical for the determination of an early diagnosis, was performed for 103 patients (93 per cent). The infection in sixty-eight patients (61 per cent) was diagnosed within one month after the onset of symptoms. The most frequent infecting organism was Staphylococcus aureus (forty patients; 36 per cent). The infection in forty-one patients (37 per cent) was caused by organisms, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, and diphtheroid species, that are traditionally considered to be of low virulence. The urinary tract was the most frequent source of infection (confirmed in thirteen patients and suspected in twenty-one). The success of non-operative treatment was predicted by four independent variables: an age of less than sixty years, the immune status, infection with Staphylococcus aureus, and a decreasing erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Forty-two patients were managed with debridement and arthrodesis. Fourteen of these patients also had instrumentation of the spine, in the presence of infection, without compromise of the outcome. Eighteen patients died by the time of the latest follow-up evaluation at a mean of four years (range, two years and two months to six years and six months): seven who had been managed non-operatively died in the first month after the diagnosis was made, three died in the acute postoperative period, three died of late complications of paraplegia, and five died of unrelated causes. None of the eighty-nine patients who were seen at a minimum of two years postoperatively had had late recurrence of infection. Chronic, severe back pain was noted in only seven patients.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the hyaluronate lyase gene from Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - The hyaluronate lyase (hyaluronidase) gene from Propionibacterium acnes was cloned and sequenced. The gene was isolated on an EcoRI-generated 3-kb piece of DNA. Expression was less in Escherichia coli than in P. acnes; in E. coli, active enzyme was only cell associated and not secreted. The gene is 2256-pb long and codes for a protein of 82 kDa. Amino terminal sequencing of the protein of the partially purified gene indicated the presence of a 32-amino-acid leader sequence. The leader sequence showed a membrane-spanning domain and all of the features usually associated with the leader for a secreted protein. The amino acid sequence is predicted to share homology with the hyaluronidase enzymes from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A potential hyaluronate-binding domain was identified and antibody against this domain was inhibitory to the enzyme.
TI  - Microbial evaluation: 139 implants removed from symptomatic patients.
AB  - Possible adverse effects of microbial organisms have been implicated in symptomatic silicone implant patients. In the literature, numerous authors have investigated the possible role of infection with respect to implant problems. To date, various bacterial species have been reported, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococci, and Clostridium perfringens. Infections in polyurethane-coated prostheses also have been shown to prolong morbidity. Antibiotic use has been relatively empirical in this regard. The purpose of this study was, first, to determine the frequency, type, and clinical relevance of microbial colonization on implant surfaces removed from symptomatic patients and, second, to determine possible effects of microbial colonization on implant integrity (gel bleed, rupture). A total of 139 implants from 72 symptomatic patients were entered into the prospective clinical study between February of 1993 and July of 1994 at the UCLA Medical Center. The implant shell types included smooth (79 percent), polyurethane (8 percent), textured (7 percent), and smooth and Dacron (6 percent). The implant locations were subglandular (71 percent), submuscular (28 percent), and subcutaneous (1 percent). Of the 139 implants removed, 69 percent were intact and 31 percent were ruptured. Forty-seven percent of 139 implants were culture-positive. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated most frequently (57.5 percent), followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (41 percent), and then Escherichia coli (1.5 percent). No fungal infections were identified. Culture positivity was not significantly associated with systemic symptoms. Sixty-seven percent of the positive culture implants were intact; 33 percent were ruptured. The frequency (47 percent) and types (P. acnes and S. epidermidis) of microbial colonization are determined in symptomatic silicone implant patients.
TI  - Microbiology of acute purulent pericarditis. A 12-year experience in a military hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic micro-biological and clinical characteristics in 15 cases of acute pericarditis treated over a 12-year period. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data. SETTING: Military hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria alone were present in 7 specimens (47%), anaerobic bacteria alone in 6 specimens (40%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 2 specimens (13%). In total, there were 21 isolates: 10 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 11 anaerobic bacteria, an average of 1.4 per specimen. Anaerobic bacteria predominated in patients with pericarditis who also had mediastinitis that followed esophageal perforation and in patients whose pericarditis was associated with orofacial and dental infections. The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (3 isolates) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2 isolates), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were Prevotella species (4 isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (3 isolates), and Propionibacterium acnes (2 isolates). CONCLUSION: The findings in our study highlight the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in acute pericarditis.
TI  - Orbital infections in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opportunistic infections frequently involve the anterior and posterior segments of the eye but rarely occur in the orbit in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The authors managed eight patients with HIV and unilateral orbital infections who presented between July 1988 and March 1995. METHODS: Records of the patients were reviewed. A literature review of orbital infections in patients infected with HIV also was conducted. RESULTS: There were five men and three women, with a mean age of 33.8 years. The mean CD-4 cell count from five of the eight patients was 18.4 cells/mm3. Invasive aspergillosis was the most common orbital infection occurring in four patients, all of whom had contiguous sinus involvement and intracranial extension. Orbital cellulitis with subperiosteal abscesses secondary to ethmoiditis caused by Propionibacterium acnes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa developed in two patients. Orbital cellulitis and panophthalmitis secondary to Staphylococcus aureus endogenous endophthalmitis developed in one patient, and one patient had presumed syphilitic optic neuritis, orbital periostitis, and necrotizing vasculitis. Five patients had permanent visual loss, including four who had loss of light perception. Four patients died of orbital diseases within 1 year of presentation, and three deaths were attributed to intracranial spread of Aspergillus fumigatus. Other organisms reported in the literature that caused orbital infections in patients with HIV include Rhizopus arrhizus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Pneumocystis carinii. CONCLUSION: Opportunistic infections of the orbit from bacterial, fungal, and parasitic organisms should be recognized as a serious complication of systemic HIV infection and are associated with a high ocular morbidity and mortality rate.
TI  - Salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius T140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and/or Propionibacterium acnes. Strain T140, isolated from the surface of Japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. Since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by T140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. Strain T140 required a high initial pH (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.
TI  - Bacterial immunomodulator Olimunostim inhibits degranulation of mastocytes in vitro.
AB  - A bacterial immunomodulator Olimunostim (OS) is one of the first Czech biologic response modifiers, which have been introduced into clinical practice. OS activates the mechanisms of non-specific immunity and is used for the most part in chronic infections. Since OS is indicated in patients suffering from infection complicated allergic diseases (asthma bronchiale, atopic eczema, etc.), (1) the concentration of histamine (Hi) and Hi-like compounds in OS, and (2) the possible role of OS in the process of histamine release from rat peritoneal mastocytes (PMC) were studied. The cells were preincubated with soluble fractions of OS. PMC degranulation was stimulated by the compound 48/80. The amount of Hi and Hi-like substances in the supernatant and in the pellet of PMC was determined by the fluorimetric method. Compounds of Hi nature were also evaluated in OS (lysate of S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, P. acnes) by original modification of high-performance liquid chromatography. The data provide the first evidence for a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of OS on the degranulation of rat PMC. Moreover, we found that 1 mg of OS itself contained 0.376 microgram of Hi and 0.142 microgram of 1-methylHi. Histamine was detected in P. acnes (0.672 microgram/mg), K. pneumoniae (0.136 microgram/mg), and S. aureus (0.175 microgram/mg), while methylHi was detected only in the case of K. pneumoniae (0.454 microgram/mg). The results of our in vitro study do not support the hypothesis of inducing type I allergic reaction by OS or facilitating OS in crossing the enteral barrier.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. SETTING: Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. Aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Escherichia coli (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella sp (n = 3). The most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), Prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; B fragilis and Enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and S aureus and P aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp, with burns. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - [Antibiotic prophylaxis in open fractures].
AB  - The administration of antibiotics is now generally accepted as a prophylactic treatment of infection in compound fractures. Nevertheless the question is not completely resolved and many problems are still to be discussed.The efficacy of antibiotherapy in this field has just been recently demonstrated ; with the animals by Worlock et al. (1988) using an experimental rabbit model, and clinically by Braul et al. (1987) which randomized 87 patients with open fractures to receive either cloxacillin or placebo. The rate of infection was significantly lower in the antibiotic group.No reports comparing various antimicrobial drugs draw effective conclusions regarding the choice of antibiotics. In the same way it seems that the time of interval from injury to antibiotic administration was not associated with a significantly different incidence of infection.The study of duration of the treatment was perfectly conducted by Dellinger. In his prospective trial 248 patients received different doses of the same antibiotic, from a single dose to four doses daily during 5 days. In conclusion he found no relation between the duration of the treatment and the risk of infection.A semantic but very important question concerns the reality of a preventive action of antibiotics against infection in open fractures. In order to answer, it is necessary to assess the incidence of contamination, its nature and its density.According to papers reporting the results of early cultures of the fracture wound, bacterial contamination was present in 30-70% of the cases. But the bacteria most commonly isolated were members of the normal skin flora (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium sp. Micrococcus) or environmental contaminants which infrequently were the cause of infection.The specimens taken from patients who have an infection show mostly hospitalacquired bacteria as Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These findings emphasize the risk of colonization of the wound by nosocomial bacteria.In addition, it seems that the density of contamination may also be a determinant of subsequent clinical infection. Quantitative bacterial counts suggest a greater risk of infection when microorganisms were present in high number more than 105 colony forming unit per g. of tissue.In conclusion, the prophylactic action of antibiotics against infection in open fractures is well established, but many points are still subject to discussion and need further study. Furthermore antibioprophylaxis is only a complement to surgical treatment, debridement and immobilization, which remains of paramount importance.
TI  - In vitro activity of MDL 62,879 against gram-positive bacteria and Bacteroides species.
AB  - The new thiazolyl peptide antibiotic MDL 62,879 (GE2270 A) showed excellent in vitro activity in testing against staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC90s ranging from 0.23 to 0.9 mg/l. It was very active against Clostridium difficile and Propionibacterium acnes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l in each case) and had variable activity against Bacteroides spp. MDL 62,879 had exceptionally good activity against Enterococcus faecalis, including against a collection of high-level aminoglycoside-resistant isolates where it had an MIC90 of 0.047. The antibiotic was bacteriostatic for enterococcal isolates but bactericidal for a methicillin-resistant isolate of Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of tea-tree oil and its major components on Staphylococcus  aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - Major components of two tea-tree oil samples were identified using thin layer and gas-liquid chromatography (TLC and GLC). Using a TLC-bioautographic technique, the tea-tree oils, terpinen-4-ol, alpha-terpineol and alpha-pinene were found to be active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes whereas cineole was inactive against these organisms. The MIC values of the three active compounds increased in the order alpha-terpineol < terpinen-4-ol < alpha-pinene for all three micro-organisms. MIC values of the tea-tree oils and terpinen-4-ol were lower for P. acnes than for the two staphylococci. This study supports the use of tea-tree oil in the treatment of acne, and demonstrates that terpinen-4-ol is not the sole active constituent of the oil.
TI  - Efficacy of a Propionibacterium acnes immunostimulant for treatment of chronic Staphylococcus aureus mastitis.
AB  - This study determined the efficacy of treatment of chronic Staphylococcus aureus  IMI of lactating dairy cows with a biological response modifier consisting of a killed preparation of Propionibacterium acnes. Fifty-one lactating dairy cows with chronic S. aureus IMI on two commercial dairies were enrolled in a controlled, randomized field trial. Twenty-four cows received 1 ml of the immunostimulant twice weekly for 4 wk, and the remainder of the cows served as untreated controls. Quarter milk samples were collected for SCC from all cows at 3 and 6 wk after initiation of treatment and for culture at 6 wk after initiation of treatment. If samples were negative for S. aureus at 6 wk, cows were sampled again for culture 1 wk later for 2 successive d before being considered cured. For the cows treated with immunostimulant, 16.7% (36.7% of infected quarters) were cured of S. aureus IMI; for the untreated group, 11.1% of cows (32.2% of quarters) were cured. The difference was not statistically significant. Immunostimulant treatment had no effect on quarter SCC in infected quarters overall, but, in those quarters that were cured of S. aureus infection, quarter SCC of treated cows tended to be lower than SCC of control cows.
TI  - Adherence of bacteria to intraocular lenses: a prospective study.
AB  - AIMS: The study was designed to investigate the bacterial flora of the operating  field during routine cataract surgery and the source of intraocular lens contamination during the surgery. METHODS: The normal flora of the external eye and fornices of 17 patients undergoing selective cataract surgery was determined preoperatively. Swabs taken from the eyelid surface and lashes showed coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) in 90%, Propionibacterium acnes in 62%, Corynebacterium sp in 18%, and Peptostreptococcus in 3% of the patients. The lower fornices of 70% had CNS, 47% P acnes, 6% Staphylococcus aureus, 6% Corynebacterium sp, and 6% Candida. RESULTS: A sterile PMMA intraocular lens was touched on the upper bulbar conjunctiva immediately before the surgery. Eighty two per cent of lenses grew CNS, 18% P acnes, 18% Bacillus sp, 12% S aureus, and 6% Corynebacterium sp. A second sterile PMMA intraocular lens was left on the drape and near the eye during surgery. Forty seven per cent of these cultured CNS, 12% Corynebacterium sp, and 6% Bacillus sp. A high count of bacteria in the operating field, especially CNS and P acnes can contribute to postoperative inflammation and endophthalmitis. CONCLUSION: Special measures are needed before and during the surgery to reduce the chance of intraocular inoculation of these bacteria. Use of proper culture media and techniques are necessary to identify these organisms, especially anaerobes, in postoperative inflammation.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of nadifloxacin (OPC-7251), a new topical quinolone, in  acne vulgaris.
AB  
TI  - Efficacy and safety of gentamicin and streptomycin in Optisol-GS, a preservation  medium for donor corneas.
AB  - Increasing reports of gentamicin-resistant bacteria contaminating donor corneas and causing endophthalmitis have indicated that preservation of corneal storage media with 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin alone needs reevaluation. We investigated the stability and possible cytotoxicity of streptomycin as a supplement to gentamicin in Optisol corneal storage medium. The combination of gentamicin and streptomycin in Optisol solution was stable at room temperature for at least 4 weeks and inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, alpha hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus Group D, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, and diphtheroids, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The addition of vancomycin did not significantly improve the antibacterial effectiveness of the gentamicin and streptomycin combination when stored at 4 degrees C. The growth of 15 of 20 clinical ocular isolates of Ps. aeruginosa was suppressed by the gentamicin-streptomycin combination. Streptomycin in concentrations of up to 1,000 micrograms/ml did not decrease the mitotic activity of corneal endothelial cells as evaluated by the in vitro incorporation of tritiated thymidine or cause cytotoxicity. The addition of 200 micrograms/ml of streptomycin to Optisol corneal storage medium containing 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin may significantly improve activity against gentamicin-sensitive and gentamicin-resistant contaminants.
TI  - Efficacy of dry cow therapy and a Propionibacterium acnes product in herds with low somatic cell count.
AB  - Dry cow therapy and a Propionibaterium acnes product were evaluated in four commercial herds with low SCC. Cows were randomly assigned within herds to treatment groups of approximately 90 cows receiving dry cow therapy, P. acnes, dry cow therapy plus P. acnes, or no treatment in a factorial arrangement. Each lactating quarter of cows that received dry cow therapy was infused via the teat duct with 300 mg of cephaprin at drying off. Cows that received P. acnes were infused intravenously with .4 mg of killed P. acnes at drying off, 7 to 10 d prepartum, and within 7 d after calving. A second prepartum injection of P. acnes immunostimulator was administered to cows that did not calve within 10 d after the first prepartum injection. Dry cow therapy enhanced bacteriological cures of IMI by Staphylococcus aureus and Corynebacterium bovis at drying off. Dry cow therapy reduced incidence of new IMI by environmental streptococci and C. bovis that originated during the dry period. Cows treated with P. acnes alone had a greater incidence of new IMI by Gram-negative bacilli originating during the dry period than did cows in the other treatment groups. Incidence of clinical mastitis at calving was greater for cows receiving no treatment than for cows receiving dry cow therapy, P. acnes, or dry cow therapy plus P. acnes.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Concurrent endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.
AB  - PURPOSE: Eyes with concurrent endophthalmitis and retinal detachment usually have a poor anatomic and visual outcome after treatment. The purpose of this study is to define the relation among the causative organism, the results of retinal detachment repair, and the final visual acuity. METHODS: Data were retrieved by a retrospective, computer-assisted review of the coded inpatient diagnoses from April 1987 through March 1992. RESULTS: This study included 16 patients (9 males, 7 females) ranging in age from 5 to 88 years (average, 58.7 years). Endophthalmitis was classified as exogenous in 13 (81%) patients and endogenous in 3 (19%). Two groups were identified: a virulent group that included eight (50%) patients (Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, gram-negative, Bacillus), and a less-virulent group that included eight (50%) patients (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, fungal). The initial surgical procedure consisted of diagnostic vitreous fluid collection by pars plana vitrectomy (11 cases), anterior vitrectomy (1 case), or vitreous aspiration (4 cases). Additional initial adjunctive surgical procedures included pars plana lensectomy (2 cases), scleral buckling (6 cases), fluid-gas exchange (7 cases), and intraocular antibiotic injections (9 cases). In six (75%) of eight patients with endophthalmitis in the virulent group, the retina remained detached. However, in seven (88%) of eight patients with endophthalmitis in the less-virulent group, the retina remained reattached postoperatively, and the remaining patient had a stable, nonprogressive peripheral tractional retinal detachment. None of the eight patients with endophthalmitis in the virulent group retained a postoperative visual acuity of better than 3/200, and four (50%) lost all light perception. Five (62%) of the eight patients with endophthalmitis in the less-virulent group retained a postoperative visual acuity of 5/200 or better, and none lost all light perception. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent endophthalmitis and retinal detachment patients with virulent organisms have a poor prognosis. Visual and anatomic outcomes were better in the less-virulent group.
TI  - Phagocytosis of antigens by Langerhans cells in vitro.
AB  - Dendritic cells (DC) isolated from lymphoid tissues are generally thought to be nonphagocytic in culture. It has therefore been unclear how these cells could acquire particulate antigens such as microorganisms for initiation of primary immune responses. Lymphoid DC derive in part from cells that have migrated from nonlymphoid tissues, such as Langerhans cells (LC) of skin. The ability of LC to internalize a variety of particles was studied by electron, ultraviolet, phase, and differential interference contrast microscopy, and by two-color flow cytometry. Freshly isolated LC in epidermal cell suspensions phagocytosed the yeast cell wall derivative zymosan, intact Saccharomyces cerevisiae, representatives of two genera of Gram-positive bacteria, Corynebacterium parvum and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as 0.5-3.5-microns latex microspheres. During maturation in culture, the phagocytic activity of these cells was markedly reduced. Likewise, freshly isolated splenic DC were more phagocytic than cultured DC for two types of particle examined, zymosan and latex beads. Unlike macrophages, LC did not bind or internalize sheep erythrocytes before or after opsonization with immunoglobulin G or complement, and did not internalize colloidal carbon. The receptors mediating zymosan uptake by LC were examined. For this particle, C57BL/6 LC were considerably more phagocytic than BALB/c LC and exhibited a reproducible increase in phagocytic activity after 6 h of culture followed by a decline, whereas this initial rise did not occur for BALB/c LC. These differential kinetics of uptake were reflected in the pattern of zymosan binding at 4 degrees C, and endocytosis of the soluble tracer fluorescein isothiocyanate-mannose-bovine serum albumin at 37 degrees C. Zymosan uptake by LC from both strains of mice was inhibited in the presence of mannan or beta-glucan, although to different extents, but not by antibodies specific for CR3 (CD11b/CD18). These data indicate that zymosan uptake by LC can be mediated by a mannose/beta-glucan receptor(s) that is differentially expressed in the two strains of mice and that is downregulated during maturation of LC in culture.
TI  - Clinical bacteriology of dacryocystitis in adults.
AB  - To better define the spectrum and relative incidence of pathogens causing dacryocystitis in adults, samples of purulent lacrimal sac contents were obtained from 236 patients undergoing dacryocystorhinostomy for a clinical diagnosis of dacryocystitis. Positive culture results were obtained in 52.5%. Cultures were pure, consisting of a single organism in 71%, and were mixed in 29%. Gram-positive organisms were most common, accounting for 64.5% of the isolates. Staphylococcus epidermidis, comprising 27.3% of the isolates and Staphylococcus aureus, comprising 22.1% of the isolates, were the most frequently encountered organisms. Gram-negative organisms were present in 27.3% of the isolates with Pseudomonas aeruginosa the most common, accounting for 8.7% overall. Anaerobic organisms were found in 7.0% of the isolates with Propionibacterium acnes the most frequent, recovered in 4.7% overall. Unexpected findings included the paucity of Streptococcus pneumoniae organisms recovered and the high incidence of involvement by gram-negative and anaerobic organisms.
TI  - [Chlorhexidine digluconate/chlorocresol combination. In vitro study of interactions observed against potential cutaneous strains].
AB  - The interaction type of chlorhexidine digluconate/chlorocresol association (foaming solution DC 102/1, Laboratoires Pierre Fabre Medicament) have been studied according to the chess-board method, on microplate, by determining MBC (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) (or MFC (Minimal Fungicidal Concentrations)) adjusted to T 72-150 AFNOR norm (dilution-neutralization, contact 5 mn) and computation of FBC (or FFC) Index. Trials were carried out against 18 hospital strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, Candida albicans) and against 4 strains of the AF-NOR norm. MBC of chlorhexidine, against Staphylococci were included between 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, and between 25 and 200 micrograms/ml against the others strains. MBC of chlorocresol were included between 800 and 3,200 micrograms/ml. Against the 22 tested strains, 18 synergistic interactions (FBC Index < or = 0.75) were observed, with 4 to 8 reducing factor for chlorhexidine, and > or = 2 for chlorocresol. No antagonism was noted (maximal FBC Index = 1).
TI  - Sterility of refrigerated injectable collagen syringes after injection of patient.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Injectable collagen has been used for more than 15 years to correct soft tissue cosmetic defects. After injection, the collagen remaining in the syringe is often refrigerated for later use in the same patient, despite manufacturer and Food and Drug Administration recommendations to discard the unused collagen. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the incidence of bacterial contamination of stored collagen. METHODS: Syringe needle tips and collagen from 50 previously used syringes containing either Zyderm I, Zyderm II, or Zyplast were cultured separately under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Bacterial isolates were identified. RESULTS: Propionibacterium acnes was cultured from 7 of 50 needle tips. One positive needle tip culture grew both P. acnes and Staphylococcus aureus. Bacteria were isolated from only one collagen sample that grew a nonhemolytic streptococcus that may have represented a laboratory contaminant. CONCLUSION: Syringes of collagen stored for repeated use rarely become contaminated with bacteria despite frequent contamination of their needle tips. Skin abscesses after collagen injection should be cultured under anaerobic, as well as aerobic, conditions so that infections caused by P. acnes will not be missed.
TI  - Comparative activity of the topical quinolone OPC-7251 against bacteria associated with acne vulgaris.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the topical quinolone OPC-7251 against bacteria commonly found in acne vulgaris was tested in vitro by an agar dilution method. The MIC50 was 0.25 mg/l for Propionibacterium acnes, 0.125 mg/l for Propionibacterium granulosum, 0.03 mg/l for Staphylococcus aureus and 0.06 mg/l for coagulase-negative staphylococci. Compared with seven other antibiotics tested (ciprofloxacin, penicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, clindamycin, fusidic acid and gentamicin), OPC-7251 had potent activity against both propionibacteria and staphylococci and the lowest incidence of resistant strains.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of totarol and its potentiation.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of six diterpenoids isolated from the bark of Podocarpus nagi (Podocarpaceae) has been tested against twelve selected microorganisms. Totarol [1], the most abundant compound among the six, exhibited potent bactericidal activity only against Gram-positive bacteria, among which Propionibacterium acnes was the most sensitive bacterium. Totarol also showed strong activity against four other Gram-positive bacteria tested: Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus subtilis, Brevibacterium ammoniagenes, and Staphylococcus aureus (both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains). The bactericidal activity of totarol was enhanced when it was tested in combination with several other natural products. Noticeably, the activity of totarol against Sta. aureus was increased eightfold when tested in combination with 1/2MIC of anacardic acid [9]. The synergistic activity of anacardic acid caused the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of totarol to be lowered from 1.56 to 0.2 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of crinitol and its potentiation.
AB  - An acyclic diterpene alcohol, crinitol [1], was identified in a marine brown alga, Sargassum tortile, as the principal antibacterial agent against Gram-positive bacteria, among which Propionibacterium acnes was most sensitive and, Staphylococcus aureus was least. To enhance its activity, crinitol was combined with several antioxidants, which presumably retard oxidative destruction of this molecule which possesses two easily oxidizable allylic alcohol groups. Two synthetic antioxidants, BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene), significantly enhanced the activity of crinitol, especially against Streptococcus mutans. Interestingly, crinitol also synergized BHT and BHA against this cariogenic bacterium.
TI  - Influence of the pH-value on the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes in continuous culture.
AB  - A cutaneous isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes was grown in continuous culture at varying pH-values ranging from 5.0 to 8.5. In terms of the specific growth rate as well as the bacterial density during the plateau phase there were remarkable differences. In particular, Propionibacterium acnes grew much better in the pH 6.0 to 7.0 range than in a more acidic or alkaline milieu. Staphylococcus epidermidis resembled Staphylococcus aureus showing no major difference at pH 5.5 and 7.0. These findings substantiate the hypothesis that minor changes of the pH in the pH 5.5 to pH 6.0 range as to be induced by chemically neutral or alkaline skin cleansers on the human skin surface can increase the number of propionibacteria but not staphylococci remarkably due to the relative alkalinity by itself.
TI  - Isolation and properties of the Capnocytophaga ochracea bacteriocin.
AB  - A bacteriocin from a subgingival plaque isolate of Capnocytophaga ochracea was purified and characterized. It was isolated from cell extract and had a molecular weight of 100,000. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Propionibacterium acnes were susceptible to the bacteriocin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. Of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; D-sphingosine; D,L-sphinganine; 4-D-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; N,N-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against Staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microM]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microM]). The sphingosines were similarly active against Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Propionibacterium acnes, Brevibacterium epidermidis, and Candida albicans, moderately active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. Both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. Optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees C and at pH 6.5. Antimicrobial activity, which was Ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. Because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
TI  - A zymographic assay for detection of hyaluronidase activity on polyacrylamide gels and its application to enzymatic activity found in bacteria.
AB  - A zymographic assay for the determination of hyaluronidase activity in cell-free  extracts on native polyacrylamide gels has been developed. In this assay an agarose replica of the polyacrylamide gel which contains hyaluronic acid and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used. After an incubation at 37 degrees C to allow transfer and development of enzymatic activity, the hyaluronic acid and BSA were precipitated in the agarose gel with 2 M acetic acid. Areas of enzymatic activity appeared as clear zones in the agarose replica. The assay was sensitive and was used to demonstrate hyaluronidase activity in cell-free extracts from a number of bacterial and mammalian species.
TI  - Study of modulatory effects of Olimunostim on cellular immunity in healthy humans.
AB  - To objectivize potential modulatory effects of polybacterial lysate Olimunostim on cellular immunity, the T-lymphocyte subpopulations and lymphocyte reactivity to mitogens were followed up in 10 healthy volunteers subjected to Olimunostim application and parallelly in 6 healthy individuals receiving placebo. The preparation, which was applied perorally in seven consecutive daily doses, had no effects on T-lymphocytes and their subpopulations and exerted only a limited influence on lymphocyte reactivity to mitogens. Both the moderate suppression of proliferative response to Con A and PWM, observed after the application of the three doses of Olimunostim, and the insignificantly enhanced response to PHA and Con A, revealed shortly after the last dose was given, were only of transient character and in comparison with the control group were not proved to be statistically significant. To explain the discordance of these results with the recently reported modulatory effects of Olimunostim on murine lymphocytes it is suggested, that the performed tests using the peripheral blood lymphocytes cannot mirror the processes developing in the diseased tissues. With respect to this presumption and also to the observations of enhanced immunomodulatory effect of Olimunostim on terrain altered by infection, it is proposed to investigate cellular immune parameters in specific disease sites of Olimunostim treated patients suffering from recurrent infections.
TI  - Lymphocyte proliferation and T-lymphocyte subsets during experimental immunomodulation of Balb/C mice by Olimunostim.
AB  - To objectivize possible immunomodulatory effects of polybacterial lysate Olimunostim (P. acnes, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus), splenic lymphocyte proliferation and T-lymphocyte subsets were followed-up in Balb/c mice administered perorally the lysate or saline (controls). The enhanced spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation observed at the beginning of Olimunostim application preceded a gradual increase of lymphocyte reactivity to T-mitogens reaching the maximum five days after the administration of the last dose and returning back to the control levels ten days afterwards. This stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation was accompanied by Olimunostim induced increase of CD4+ splenic lymphocytes being most pronounced five days after the end of immunomodulation and later returning to the initial values. The last experiment revealed an enhanced response of the in vivo primed lymphocytes after the re-exposure to Olimunostim in vitro. It is concluded that mostly nonspecific activation mechanisms, plausibly also parallelly induced specific immunity, are involved in Olimunostim modulatory effects on the cellular immune response.
TI  - [Activation of the resident microbial flora as a possibility for the improvement  of humoral antibody potentials].
AB  - The effect of a parenteral application of an adjuvant (Propionibacterium acnes) and an adjuvant/antigen combination (Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I/Al(OH)3, Pseudomonas aeruginosa/Al(OH)3 respectively, was tested with regard to the improvement of antibacterial resistance. Parameter was the humoral antibody production (IgG) of rabbits against six facultative pathogen bacterial species (St. aureus, Sc. faecium, Bac. cereus, P. multocida, E. coli, Ps. aeruginosa) and against sheep rod blood cell membranes. The three methods of treatment led to a significant enhancement of IgG-antibodies against the particular homologous antigen. In addition to this specific reaction the application of adjuvant/antigen combinations provoked a significant enhancement of antibodies also against heterologous antigens (P. multocida, Bac. cereus, sheep red blood cell membranes). The application of P. acnes had no distinct effect on the antibody titer against the different antigen preparations. In order to analyse the immune response qualitatively, a greater part of serum samples was examined by immuno blot technique. The number of partial antigens recognized by the sera increased during the experiments but the rise did generally not relate to developments of antibody titers. Nevertheless, the Ps. aeruginosa/Al(OH)3-treatment seemed to improve the ability of sera to detect antigenic determinants of heterologous bacterial species.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - To better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. Sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). We cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, Streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group D streptococcus in five patients, Corynebacterium in five patients, Haemophilus influenzae in three patients, Neisseria in three patients, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. Cultures yielded no growth in nine patients. A strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. A poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). All seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. Only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. Cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. The presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.
TI  - The importance of positive bacterial cultures of specimens obtained during clean  orthopaedic operations.
AB  - Microbiological cultures of specimens of tissue and of fluids from the wound in forty patients who had had consecutive clean, elective orthopaedic operations (excluding total joint replacements) and had not received antibiotics preoperatively were analyzed. Of the forty patients, twenty-three (58 per cent) had a positive culture on at least one of the media that were used and seventeen (43 per cent) had negative cultures. Of the forty specimens that were obtained from swabbing of the wound, eight (20 per cent) were positive on culture, compared with twenty (50 per cent) that were obtained from biopsy of tissue. Of these twenty-eight positive cultures, thirteen (46 per cent) were on routine blood-agar plates and fifteen (54 per cent), in broth only. Of the thirty-three bacterial organisms that were identified in the twenty-eight positive cultures of the wound, nineteen (58 per cent) were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; eight (24 per cent), Propionibacterium acnes; two (6 per cent), Peptostreptococcus; and four (12 per cent), miscellaneous organisms. In all of the positive cultures on the blood-agar plates, except in those showing Propionibacterium acnes, there were five colonies or fewer. One patient had a clinical infection with Staphylococcus aureus that developed later, but the initial cultures of the wound had been positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis only. None of the bacteria that grew on culture were Staphylococcus aureus or the less common pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, or Klebsiella.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Tumor necrosis factor alpha mediates lethal activity of killed gram-negative and  gram-positive bacteria in D-galactosamine-treated mice.
AB  - Treatment with D-galactosamine increases sensitivity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-responder mice to the lethal effects of LPS, while nonresponder mice remain resistant (M.A. Freudenberg, D. Keppler, and C. Galanos, Infect. Immun. 51:891-895, 1986). In the present study it is shown that, in contrast to LPS, killed gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella abortus equi and S. typhimurium) were highly toxic for D-galactosamine-treated LPS-responder (C57BL/10 ScSN and C3H/HeN) and -nonresponder (C57BL/10 ScCR and C3H/HeJ) mice, although to a higher extent in the former strains. Also, killed gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, and Mycobacterium phlei) exhibited toxicity for D-galactosamine-treated mice, LPS-responder and -nonresponder mice being equally susceptible. Evidently, bacterial components other than LPS may exhibit lethal effects in sensitized animals. In all cases, the lethality of LPS and of bacteria was inhibited by anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) serum. While LPS induced TNF-alpha in vitro only in macrophages from LPS-responder mice, gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced TNF-alpha also in macrophages from LPS-nonresponder mice. The data show that TNF-alpha is a common endogenous mediator of the lethal activity of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Propionibacterium acnes in mixed infections with facultative bacteria.
AB  - Single and mixed infections with 11 clinical isolates of Propionibacterium acnes  and three facultative bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Abscesses were induced by pure cultures of six of 11 strains of P. acnes and by the three facultative bacteria. The abscesses produced by each of the six "virulent" P. acnes isolates mixed with S. aureus, E. coli or K. pneumoniae were larger than those induced by the single organisms in 16 of the 18 combinations. There was a significant increase in the numbers of the six P. acnes strains in 13 of the 18 bacterial mixtures and in the numbers of the facultative bacteria in 17 of the 18 combinations. These data illustrate the potential virulence of some P. acnes strains and their synergic capacity with facultative bacteria.
TI  - Activity of mersacidin, a novel peptide, compared with that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and daptomycin.
AB  - Mersacidin, a new peptide antibiotic, was four- to eightfold less active (MIC for 90% of isolates, 8 micrograms/ml) than vancomycin, teicoplanin, or daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml, and the MICs of mersacidin for hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 4 to 8 micrograms/ml. The mersacidin MICs for anaerobic organisms were as follows: Clostridium perfringens, 4 micrograms/ml; Propionibacterium acnes, 8 micrograms/ml; peptococci, 1 microgram/ml; and peptostreptococci, 8 micrograms/ml. Mersacidin had no activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria and Haemophilus species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The size of the inoculum, the pH of the assay (5.5 to 7.5), the type of medium, and the anaerobic conditions had minimal effects on the MICs and MBCs of mersacidin. Overall, mersacidin proved less active than available glycopeptides and peptolides.
TI  - Efficacy of cloxacillin prophylaxis in craniotomy: a one year follow-up study.
AB  - A previous prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study showed that cloxacillin prophylaxis significantly reduces the rate of infection after craniotomy. The purpose of the present follow-up study was to find out whether the data on routine cloxacillin prophylaxis would confirm the decreased infection rate after craniotomy. During this 1-year study, 8 infections occurred after 201 operations (4.0%) in 175 patients. No prophylaxis was given during 17 operations in 15 patients; 4 infections occurred in this group. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Propionibacterium acnes, all of which were sensitive to cloxacillin. We conclude that cloxacillin is beneficial as prophylaxis in patients undergoing craniotomy.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 against 229 aerobic and 330 anaerobic clinical isolates was determined using the agar dilution technique. For comparison, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefuroxime, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, erythromycin and metronidazole (only anaerobic bacteria) were tested. Bay v 3522 was found to have high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic cocci, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and fusobacteria. When tested against a higher inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of Bay v 3522 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to inhibitory activity in most bacterial groups. Bay v 3522 may be useful in the treatment of skin, soft tissue and respiratory tract infections. Clinical studies are thus warranted.
TI  - Bacteria from solid tumours.
AB  - Bacteria were grown from 63 (69%) of 91 specimens from necrotic tumours in 63 patients. Of the tumours, 14 were abdominal, 5 pelvic, 23 of the head and neck, 4 of the lungs, 4 mediastinal, 2 lymphatic, 3 of the breast, and 8 were miscellaneous. Aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 (19%) specimens, anaerobes only in 10 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 41 (65%). A total of 83 anaerobic and 47 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were isolated. The predominant anaerobic bacteria were Bacteroides spp. (36 isolates), and anaerobic cocci (21) and Propionibacterium acnes (22). The aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria most frequently isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli (seven isolates each), S. epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five isolates each). These data demonstrate that infection of tumours is usually polymicrobial.
TI  - Complications associated with Ommaya reservoirs in patients with cancer. The Princess Margaret Hospital experience and a review of the literature.
AB  - The complications associated with the use of Ommaya reservoirs in 106 patients with meningeal involvement due to malignant disease are reviewed. Twenty-seven patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 12 acute myelogenous leukemia, 3 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 34 lymphoma, 29 carcinoma, and 1 chronic myelocytic leukemia. There were 11 technical complications, including 1 death due to misplacement of the catheter, 2 mild intraventricular hemorrhages, and 5 malfunctioning reservoirs; 3 required craniotomies (1 for subdural hematoma and 2 for subdural hygroma); 13 cases of bacterial meningitis occurred in 10 patients. One patient died of Staphylococcus aureus meningitis. The organisms causing the other infections were mainly coagulase-negative staphylococci (8 cases) or Propionibacterium acnes (2 cases). The projected infection rate for all patients (by Kaplan-Meier analysis) during the first year following insertion of a reservoir was 15%. Successful use of Ommaya reservoirs requires expert surgical implantation and meticulous care during accessing to minimize complications.
TI  - Contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet laser acts as a sterilizing scalpel.
AB  - As a cold knife cuts through contaminated or infected wounds, bacteria are dragged along with the blade of the knife through the entire wound. Herein, the effect of incisions made with a cold knife is compared with that of incisions made by a contact neodynium-yttrium-aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. Agar plates were inoculated with multiple strains of exogenous, endogenous, hospital-acquired and multiple antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. While the cold knife dragged bacteria to sterile areas, incisions made with the contact laser were always sterile. In addition to not dragging bacteria, the tip of the contact laser sterilized itself and provided a bacteria-free zone on either side of the cut, depending on the power density applied. It appears that the contact Nd:YAG laser acts as a sterilizing wand while providing much needed tactile feedback, precision and hemostasis during surgical treatment with the laser.
TI  - Effect of cloxacillin prophylaxis on the bacterial flora of craniotomy wounds.
AB  - During a double-blind placebo-controlled study, the effect of cloxacillin prophylaxis in craniotomies on samples taken for culture from 334 operation wounds in 279 patients was assessed. Patients and operations were equally divided over the cloxacillin and placebo groups. In the cloxacillin group significantly fewer samples contained microorganisms than was the case in the placebo group both just after the incision was made (p less than 0.05) and just before closure of the wound (p less than 0.001). The contaminating bacteria found most frequently were Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For material collected immediately after the incision, the percentage of cultures positive for S. epidermidis was significantly (p = 0.001) lower in the cloxacillin group than in the placebo group; the percentage of cultures with P. acnes did not differ between the two groups. For samples taken just before the wound was closed, the percentage of cultures with P. acnes or S. epidermidis was significantly (p = 0.008 and 0.003, respectively) lower in the cloxacillin than in the placebo group. In the placebo group neurosurgical infections occurred with P. acnes and/or S. epidermidis as causative microorganisms; in almost all cases those bacteria could be cultured from the edge of the wound. In none of the patients with an infection caused by S. aureus was the bacteria found in the operation area. In 2/6 infections in the cloxacillin group the infecting microorganisms could be cultured from the operation area. These findings support a significant reduction in the infection rate after craniotomy under cloxacillin prophylaxis compared with placebo.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. III. Microbiological aspects].
AB  - A retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy). A total of 4386 vials from 619 patients were examined. There were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). Ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. There were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). A total of 165 microorganism were isolated: Gram-positive (52.7%) and Gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). The predominant families were: Enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), Micrococcaceae (27.3%), Pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), Bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and Streptococcus "Genus" (18.8%). The species frequencies were: Escherichia coli (20%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Enterococcus (8.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), Proteus mirabilis (4.2%), Brucella spp. (2.4%), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus bovis e Propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). These findings are compared with those published in the Italian and international literature. Stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - Nontoxic concentration of ceftazidime and flomoxef sodium for intravitreal use--evaluated by in-vitro ERG.
AB  - The effects of ceftazidime (CAZ) and flomoxef sodium (FMOX) on the in-vitro electroretinogram (ERG) of albino rabbits were studied. The a-wave, the b-wave and the oscillatory potential (OP) were unchanged by 0.3mM (0.19mg/ml) CAZ-containing solution. The OP was suppressed by 0.5mM (0.32mg/ml) CAZ. The a-wave, the b-wave and the OP were unchanged by 0.5mM (0.26mg/ml) FMOX. The OP was suppressed and its peak latency was delayed by 2mM (0.52mg/ml) FMOX. The concentration of 0.3mM (0.19mg/ml) CAZ was higher than its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Propionibacterium acnes. The concentration of 0.5mM (0.26mg/ml) FMOX was higher than its MIC against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens and Propionibacterium acnes.
TI  - Activity of capryloyl collagenic acid against bacteria involved in acne.
AB  - Synopsis Capryloyl collagenic acid (Lipacide C8Co) has similar bacteriostatic activity in vitro to that of benzoyl peroxide towards the bacteria found in acne lesions (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes) (MIC between 1 and 4 mg ml(-1) for C8Co, and between 0.5 and 5 mg ml(-1) for benzoyl peroxide). The presence of Emulgine M8 did not affect the bacteriostatic activity of C8Co. A 4% w/v solution of C8Co (incorporating Emulgine M8) fulfilled the criteria for an antiseptic preparation as laid down by the French Pharmacopoeia (10th Edition), and had a spectrum 5 bactericidal activity according to the French Standard AFNOR NF T 72-151. The excellent cutaneous tolerance of capryloyl collagenic acid would indicate that an aqueous solution might be of value for topical treatment of the bacterial component of acne. Resume Activite antibacterienne de l'acide capryloyl-collagenique vis a vis des bacteries impliquees dans l'etiologie de l'acne L'acide capryloyl-collagenique (Lipacide C8Co) et le peroxyde de benzoyle presentent une activite bacteriostatique in-vitroequivalente vis a vis des especes bacteriennes retrouvees au niveau des lesions acneiques (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis et Propionibacterium acnes) (CMI comprise entre 1 et 4 mg ml(-1) pour le lipoaminoacide, et 0,5 et 5 mg ml(-1) pour le peroxyde de benzoyle). La mise en solution aqueuse de l'acide capryloyl-collagenique en presence d'Emulgine M8 ne modifie pas son activite bacteriostatique. Une telle solution, a 4% m/V d'acide capryloyl-collagenique et 5% m/V d'Emulgine M8, satisfait a l'essai d'activite des preparations antiseptiques decrit a la Pharmacopee Francaise (Xeme Ed.) (concentration minimale antiseptique: 10% v/V, pour un temps de contact de 5 min a 32 degrees C entre les germes tests et la solution diluee en eau distillee), et possede une activite bactericide antiseptique spectre 5 conforme a la norme AFNOR NF T 72-151 (concentration minimale bactericide: 40% v/V). Cette activite antiseptique est diminuee par l'augmentation du pH, mais demeure significative a pH 5,5, pH moyen du revetement cutane. Compte tenu de la bonne tolerance cutanee de l'acide capryloyl-collagenique, cette solution pourrait constituer une base interessante pour une preeparation dermique destinee au traitement local de la composante bacterienne de l'acne.
TI  - Comparison of the nasal bacterial floras in two groups of healthy subjects and in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis.
AB  - The nasal bacterial flora was studied in 183 healthy men entering military service (entry group), 103 healthy recruits in service (service group), and 185 recruits with acute maxillary sinusitis. The 267 nasal and ipsilateral sinus aspirate findings in the same patients with acute maxillary sinusitis were compared pairwise. In the entry group presumed sinus pathogens were only rarely isolated from the nasal cavities: Haemophilus influenzae in 4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 1%, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3%, and Streptococcus pyogenes in 0%. The corresponding isolation frequencies in the service group were 19, 13, 3, and less than 1%, respectively, and those in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis were 61, 25, 7, and 6%, respectively. Suppression of the major components of the normal nasal flora, Corynebacterium sp., coagulase-negative staphylococci, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus aureus, was seen in the group with acute maxillary sinusitis and also occasionally in the service group. When a sinus aspirate culture yielded a presumed sinus pathogen, the same pathogen was found in the nasal samples in 91% of the cases. The predictive value of a pathogen-positive nasal finding was highest (93.8%) for S. pyogenes, followed by 77.7% for H. influenzae and 68.7% for S. pneumoniae, and lowest (20%) for B. catarrhalis.
TI  - Studies on antibacterial agents. I. Synthesis of substituted 6,7-dihydro-1-oxo-1H,5H-benzo[i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acids.
AB  - A series of substituted 6,7-dihydro-1-oxo-1H,5H-benzo[i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acids was synthesized and tested for antibacterial activities. Among them, 9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-5-methyl-8-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-1-oxo-1H,5H- benzo[i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid (OPC-7241) exhibited potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-8-(4-hydroxy-1-piperidyl)-5-methyl-1-oxo-1H, 5H-benzo[i,j]quinolizine-2-carboxylic acid (OPC-7251) showed potent activity characteristically against Propionibacterium acnes.
TI  - Characteristics of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1-induced lectin-like activity and  inhibitor(s) in rabbit serum.
AB  - In adult rabbits intravenously injected with toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1) or staphylococcal enterotoxin B, serum lectin-like activity (detectable by cation-dependent agglutination of bacteria) developed. This activity was sensitive to heat, trypsin, and formaldehyde but resistant to neuraminidase or galactose oxidase. Formaldehyde-fixed Propionibacterium acnes or Escherichia coli cells reactive with plant lectins provided sensitive targets for titration of serum agglutination activity that was competitively blocked with D-galactose, D-glucose, D-mannose, and alpha-L-fucose. The lectin-like activity, partially purified by affinity chromatography, was a protein of approximately 76,000 Da with an isoelectric point of 5.4. Both lectin-positive and normal serum contained agglutination inhibitors that were absorbed by protein A-producing staphylococci. S protein may be the origin of this lectin-like activity. In vitro exposure of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells to TSST-1 (1.0 micrograms/mL) and to lectin-positive serum induced rapid cell clumping and subsequent "activation" to a larger blast form expressing receptors for buccal epithelial cells. The interaction of toxin/lymphokine-activated mononuclear cells with glycoproteins and/or other antigens selectively expressed by tissues in various organ systems may play a role in target cell pathology in rabbits dying with toxic shock syndrome.
TI  - Analysis of the proinflammatory property of epidermal cyst contents: chemotactic  C5a anaphylatoxin generation.
AB  - We investigated in vitro the contents of epidermal cysts for complement activation and found that they activated complement mainly through the alternative pathway. Chemotactic C5a anaphylatoxin produced by the cyst contents after contact with serum most likely plays a significant role in the initiation and aggravation of inflammation in ruptured epidermal cysts. Our additional study disclosed that components of three representative follicular resident microorganisms (Pityrosporum ovale, Propionibacterium acnes, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) also produced C5a anaphylatoxin mainly through the alternative pathway; the C5a production was more vigorous than that by a virulent pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. These results suggest that accidental colonization of the cyst contents by these follicular microbial flora further augments the inflammatory changes in ruptured epidermal cysts.
TI  - Bacteriological findings of acute maxillary sinusitis in young adults.
AB  - Bacteriological findings in 339 sinus secretions obtained by puncture were investigated in 238 young adult patients with acute maxillary sinusitis. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed immediately. A total of 76% of the secretions were positive. The most common pathogens isolated were Haemophilus influenzae (50%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), Streptococcus pyogenes (5%), and Branhamella catarrhalis (2%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated in 8 and 1% of the specimens, respectively. The staphylococci were almost invariably present in low numbers and, therefore, probably represented nasal contamination. Other aerobic species were found only occasionally. Anaerobes were isolated in 5% of the secretions. In one-half of these, a low concentration of Propionibacterium acnes was the sole anaerobe that was found, and it was usually mixed with a facultative organism (suggestive of contamination with nasal flora). Only 2% of the sinuses were considered to have true anaerobic infections (high concentrations of several species typical of anaerobic infection), indicating that anaerobes are not a significant cause of acute maxillary sinusitis in a young adult population. The high recovery of H. influenzae in this study indicates that aminopenicillins may be more appropriate choice than conventional penicillin in the antimicrobial therapy of acute maxillary sinusitis (only 2 of 168 H. influenzae strains produced beta-lactamase).
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of purulent nasopharyngitis in children.
AB  - Cultures of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the inferior nasal  meatus of 25 children with purulent nasopharyngitis and from 25 controls. Microorganisms were isolated from all specimens. A total of 98 isolates (3.9 per patient), 45 aerobes (1.8 per patient) and 53 anaerobes (2.1 per patient), were isolated in patients with purulent nasopharyngitis. Seventy-three isolates (2.9 per patient), 47 aerobes (1.9 per patient) and 26 anaerobes (1.0 per patient) were found in the controls. The organisms recovered in statistically significantly higher numbers in patients with nasopharyngitis were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus sp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Bacteroides spp. The organisms recovered in significantly higher numbers in controls were Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes. beta-Lactamase activity was detected in 19 isolates recovered from 15 individuals (9 patients and 6 controls). These findings demonstrate the aerobic-anaerobic polymicrobial flora associated with purulent nasopharyngitis. Further studies are indicated to evaluate the pathogenic role of these organisms in this condition.
TI  - Phototoxicity of skin microorganisms tested with a new model.
AB  - A new standardized method for testing phototoxicity of chemicals against microorganisms is described. The inoculum size of the microorganism, application of test chemicals, prediffusion time, incubation time and incubation period are defined. Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Candida albicans, and Pityrosporum orbiculare were studied. Both 8-methoxypsoralen and trimethylpsoralen were phototoxic against all microorganisms tested, while tetracycline and doxycycline were not phototoxic. C. albicans may be chosen for phototoxicity testing because it has been used earlier, it is easy to maintain in culture, it grows easily when tested, and its pathogenicity is low. The phototoxicity of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes, C. albicans, and P. orbiculare against each other were also investigated. Only P. orbiculare was inhibitory. It inhibited the growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Ps. aeruginosa - both in the dark and after irradiation. The growth inhibition was markedly enhanced after UVA irradiation, indicating phototoxicity. The phototoxic effect of P. orbiculare may play a role in the ecology of the human skin flora.
TI  - Changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  - Concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. In particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. Likewise structural components such as fimbriae in Escherichia coli, M protein in Streptococcus pyogenes, protein A in Staphylococcus aureus and capsule in Bacteroides fragilis and Haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. These products, through their importance as impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. By their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid killing of the pathogen. The immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.
TI  - [Etiology of erysipelas].
AB  - Bacterial cultures were taken from 31 patients by scarification from the dermal compartment of recent erysipelas foci. Pathogenic organisms were isolated from the dermis while cultures from the skin surface remained sterile in 5 patients; Streptococcus pyogenes was cultured in 2 of these patients and Staphylococcus aureus in the other 3 patients. Our findings indicate that staphylococcal erysipelas does exist and we suppose that Staphylococcus aureus is able to induce erysipelas, above all in the presence of dysfunction of lymph vessels. When treatment with penicillin G is not successful, erysipelas caused by staphylococci has to be considered. In these cases treatment has to be changed to penicillinase-resistant penicillin.
TI  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin with a (Z)-propenyl side chain at the 3 position and a p-hydroxyphenylglycyl substituent at the 7 position, was evaluated in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin and, when appropriate, ampicillin and vancomycin. In vitro, BMY 28100 was more active than the reference cephalosporins against streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. BMY 28100 was comparable to cefaclor and more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and ampicillin-susceptible strains of Branhamella catarrhalis; but against ampicillin-resistant strains of B. catarrhalis, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin and more active than cefaclor. Against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin, but less active than cefaclor. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae overall were equally susceptible to BMY 28100 and cefaclor but were less susceptible to cephalexin. In human serum, BMY 28100 was 45% protein bound. After an oral dose to mice, 82% of the drug was recovered in urine. The oral therapeutic efficacy of BMY 28100 in systemically infected mice reflected its activity in vitro.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - Susceptibility in vitro of gram-positive aerobe and anaerobe bacteria to ofloxacin.
AB  - Ofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone derivative active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including obligate anaerobes. In this study the in vitro activity of ofloxacin was evaluated against 325 Gram-positive organisms freshly isolated from clinical specimens, in comparison with that of ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and ceftazidime. Susceptibility tests indicated that the MIC90 was 2 mg/l (range 0.25-2) against both methicillin-susceptible (MS) and methicillin-resistant (MR) Staphylococcus aureus. A value of 2 mg/l (range 0.5-4) was also found for all other staphylococci. The MIC of ofloxacin was 8 mg/l for 90% of Streptococcus faecalis (range 1-16), Str. faecium (range 2-8) and members of JK group (range 0.5-16). Propionibacterium acnes strains were all inhibited by 2 mg/l and 90% of Clostridia spp. (range 2-16) by 8 mg/l. Ofloxacin activity compared favourably with that of ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and ceftazidime determined on the same isolates. MBC and time-kill studies indicated that this compound is rapidly bactericidal against enterococci. The great intrinsic activity against MS and MR staphylococci, refractory enterococci and JK bacteria may make ofloxacin a useful adjunct to the therapeutic arsenal.
TI  - The bacterial flora of the nasal cavity in healthy young men.
AB  - The nasal cavity of 97 young healthy men (applicants for the pilot education in the Finnish Air Force) was examined. Bacterial culture demonstrated one or more species of aerobic bacteria in all 194 nasal cavities examined and anaerobic bacteria in 76.5%. In ten per cent of the cultures bacteria were detected after enrichment only. The most common aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis (79%), diphtheroids (41%) and Staphylococcus aureus (34%). Haemophilus influenzae was found in 5% and Streptococcus pneumoniae in 0.5%. Anaerobic culture yielded Propionibacterium acnes in 74.5% and Peptococcus magnus in 3.5%.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of A-56268 (TE-031), a new macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of A-56268 (TE-031), the 6-O-methyl derivative of erythromycin, was compared with those of erythromycin and other reference drugs. A-56268 had the same spectrum of antibacterial activity as erythromycin. A-56268 was generally 1 log2 dilution more potent or equal to erythromycin against all organisms except haemophilus influenzae and Propionibacterium acnes, for which A-56268 was 1 log2 dilution and 3 log2 dilutions, respectively, less potent. The MBC of A-56268 and erythromycin was not significantly different from the MIC against Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and H. influenzae but was more than 2 log2 dilutions higher than the MICs for some Staphylococcus aureus strains. Human serum at a concentration of 50% did not change the in vitro potency of A-56268 or erythromycin. A-56268 was similar to erythromycin in being more active at pH 8.0 than at the physiologic pH of 7.3. The activity of A-56268 was synergistic with sulfamethoxazole against 4 of 12 strains of H. influenzae. In mouse protection tests, when administered orally A-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against H. influenzae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. After subcutaneous administration the potencies of A-56268 and erythromycin were not statistically different from each other. A-56268 was more potent than erythromycin against Legionella infection in guinea pigs. The concentration of A-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. In A-56268 in the serum and lung was higher than that of erythromycin after intraperitoneal administration. In mice, the peak levels in serum of A-56268 and erythromycin were similar after subcutaneous administration and seven times higher for A-56268 after oral administration. The serum half-life of A-56268 was approximately twice that of erythromycin after administration by both routes.
TI  - Response of bacterial antigen in palmoplantar pustulosis.
AB  - Motilities of leukocytes in response to bacterial antigens or sera were examined  in tissues from patients with palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). Accelerated migration towards bacterial antigens was detected in the case of Staphylococcus epidermidis in 9 of 19 patients, to Propionibacterium acnes in 5 of 19, to Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus in 3 of 19, while no acceleration was found in neutrophils from the controls. A significantly accelerated migration of normal lymphocytes in response to both patients' and control sera was nil. Inhibition of migration of guinea pig peritoneal exudate cells mixed with lymphocytes from PPP patients was detected in 12 out of 14 patients with the addition of S. epidermidis antigen and 8 of 14 with the addition of P. acnes antigen, while no such inhibition was detected in all 7 controls. The accelerated migration of neutrophils and inhibition of macrophages may participate in the development of PPP.
TI  - Bacterial lipases and chronic blepharitis.
AB  - Eyelids and conjunctivae of 36 normal individuals and 60 patients from six clinical groups of chronic blepharitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The most common species isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci (C-NS) and Propionibacterium acnes. All strains of these species, and all Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated were tested for the ability to break down triglycerides, cholesterol esters, and fatty waxes. Each strain was incubated independently with appropriate substrates in nutrient media. Each medium was then extracted and assayed for the presence of substrate hydrolysis products by thin-layer chromatography. The percentage of strains capable of hydrolyzing a particular substrate was determined for each individual. S. aureus was a consistent and strong lipase producer, able to hydrolyze all three substrates. P. acnes was able to hydrolyze triolein and behenyl oleate but not cholesteryl oleate. No differences were observed among groups for P. acnes or S. aureus. C-NS showed a high degree of strain variability. Eighty-three percent of C-NS strains could hydrolyze triolein, 82% behenyl oleate, and 40% cholesteryl oleate. Significant group differences were seen in the percentage of lipase positive C-NS strains isolated per individual. Patients in the mixed staphylococcal/seborrheic, meibomian seborrheic, secondary meibomitis, and the meibomian keratoconjunctivitis (MKC) groups harbored significantly more C-NS strains capable of hydrolyzing cholesteryl oleate than did normal individuals. Patients in the meibomian seborrheic, secondary meibomitis, and MKC groups harbored significantly more C-NS strains capable of hydrolyzing behenyl oleate than did normals. No group differences were seen among groups with triolein hydrolyzing C-NS strains.
TI  - Qualitative and quantitative changes in cutaneous bacteria associated with systemic isotretinoin therapy for acne conglobata.
AB  - Quantitative cultures in 40 patients treated with systemic isotretinoin demonstrated a significant reduction in the anaerobic diphtheroid, Propionibacterium acnes within one month of therapy and a continued suppression during 5 months of treatment. This reduction persisted after discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy despite a return of sebum excretion to pretreatment levels. Surface aerobic bacteria showed a significant reduction in the total number of organisms and significant qualitative changes. Gram negative bacteria were sharply reduced in both the anterior nares and skin while Staphylococcus aureus recovery increased significantly.
TI  - Infections after craniotomy: a retrospective study.
AB  - A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the rate of infection directly related to craniotomy. Of 246 craniotomies performed in 1981, 234 could be evaluated. The overall incidence of infection was 8.1% (19 infections in 18 patients). The infection rate was 15.2% after insertion of a ventricular shunt (seven infections after 45 ventriculostomies). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes were the most frequent isolated micro-organisms. We recommended a double-blind prospective study to evaluate the possible benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis in craniotomies.
TI  - Ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  - The fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. Ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides loeschii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptococcus prevotii, Clostridium sporogenes, and Propionibacterium acnes. The fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of B. gingivalis and B. intermedius. In addition, strains of the nonoral Bacteroides species B. asaccharolyticus and B. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. No such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of Streptococcus, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, or Haemophilus species.
TI  - Head-space gas-liquid chromatographic analysis for presumptive identification of  bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - A total of 445 strains of common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for their volatile microbial metabolites by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. The bacteria were incubated for 24 or 48 h in blood-containing Trypticase soy or Lombard-Dowell glucose broth before being analyzed by automatic head-space injection. From the chromatographic pattern obtained, the majority of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes could be characterized. The head-space technique developed provides a rapid, direct and easily-performed means for presumptive identification of bacteria found in blood culture.
TI  - Bacterial aspects of chronic blepharitis.
AB  - Patients with all forms of chronic blepharitis were thoroughly evaluated. These patients were found to have evidence for a primary bacterial component in the disease process only in the clinical staphylococcal and mixed seborrheic/staphylococcal forms of chronic blepharitis. Evidence was found for a shared common pathway for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, and Propionibacterium acnes to contribute to the disease process. These organisms were found to produce lypolytic exoenzymes including fatty wax esterase, cholesteryl esterase, and triglyceride lipase. Statistically significantly larger numbers of coagulase negative staphylococci were found to produce these enzymes in patients with the various forms of seborrheic blepharitis and meibomian keratoconjunctivitis. Additionally, abnormalities in the free fatty acid component of the meibomian secretions were found in these patients supporting the hypothesis that lypolytic exoenzymes produced by bacteria might alter the meibomian secretion. Even though a primary pathogen is identifiable only in staphylococcal and mixed seborrheic/staphylococcal blepharitis, several different bacteria may contribute to the expression of disease in all other forms of chronic blepharitis.
TI  - Protease production by microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  - Factors influencing pathogenicity of various microbes found in the female lower genital tract remain incompletely understood. Protease production by cervico/vaginal microorganisms may alter or inactivate a variety of proteins important in host defense and structural-functional integrity including collagen-containing chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cervix. Host tissues may be made more susceptible to other organisms' virulence factors by protease-producing members of genital tract local flora. Microorganisms themselves may also be influenced by the presence of other microbial protease. Nonspecific protease, gelatinase, collagenase, and elastase production was examined for in vitro with use of aerobic (30) and anaerobic (25) strains of microorganisms typical of those isolated from the lower genital tract of women with premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and puerperal infection. Microorganisms including Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species, and Propionibacterium acnes produce various proteases. Protease production by both acknowledged pathogenic and commensal bacteria may contribute to the occurrence of reproductive tract morbidity including premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor.
TI  - Evaluation of the sterility and stability of insulin from multidose vials used for prolonged periods.
AB  - Diabetic patients frequently use their insulin vials for prolonged periods, even  though antibacterial preservatives used in multidose insulin vials are not required to be effective beyond 28 days. For this reason, we evaluated the antibacterial activity present in multidose insulin vials for up to 50 days. Multidose lente insulin vials were inoculated with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Vials incubated at room temperature (21 degrees C) were sterile by 48 hours, whereas when they were incubated at refrigerator temperatures (4 degrees C), S. aureus contamination persisted up to the 17th day and P. aeruginosa were killed after 10 days. The same vials were serially contaminated on days 17, 30, and 50, and a similar antibacterial effect was maintained. Sixty-nine multidose insulin vials used for an average of 53 days were cultured. Eight vials demonstrated bacterial contamination with 1 cfu/ml of S. epidermidis or Propionibacterium acnes. No endotoxin was detected in the multidose vials used for more than 28 days. Insulin assays on 40 multidose insulin vials used for more than 28 days showed an average insulin content of 101.6 +/- 1.9 units/ml. This study did not demonstrate significant bacterial contamination, endotoxin activity, or insulin degradation of multidose insulin in vials used for periods longer than 28 days. In addition, antibacterial preservatives were more effective at room temperature than at refrigerator temperature; thus, the practice of patients not refrigerating insulin vials is sensible.
TI  - Susceptibility of Propionibacterium acnes to killing and degradation by human neutrophils and monocytes in vitro.
AB  - Propionibacterium acnes, the target of inflammation in acne, was tested for its sensitivity to the bactericidal and degradative functions of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), monocytes, and their fractions. P. acnes strains were not killed by PMN under any conditions and were variably killed by monocytes in the presence of serum from acne patients. Control strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus lysodeicticus were susceptible to both PMN and monocyte killing. P. acnes strains were also not killed by lysozyme, chymotrypsin, H2O2, human serum, PMN granule lysate, and PMN and monocyte cell lysates. The organism was sensitive to the bactericidal activity of myeloperoxidase in acid pH. In addition, P. acnes was shown to be relatively resistant to the degradative action of PMN and monocyte lysates, whereas M. lysodeicticus, S. aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were all degraded to various degrees. The moieties that were liberated from P. acnes by PMN enzymes were predominantly low in molecular weight (1,000 to 25,000) and were consistent with cell wall fragments.
TI  - The quantity and function of pulmonary alveolar macrophages after splenectomy and Corynebacterium parvum.
AB  - We have previously shown that Corynebacterium parvum (C. parvum), a nonspecific immunomodulator, partially protects splenectomized and nonsplenectomized mice when challenged with aerosolized pneumococci. We report here the effects of both splenectomy and C. parvum on the phagocytic function of the lavageable pulmonary alveolar macrophage (PAM). Groups of young adult male Sprague Dawley rats underwent splenectomy or sham operation 3 weeks before injection of C. parvum 1.5 mg IP (or saline) per animal. One week postinjection PAM's were harvested. The in vitro phagocytic indices (PI) for PAM incubated with tritiated thymidine-labeled S. aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae, type 14, opsonized with normal rat serum, were determined. Splenectomy had no effect on lung weights, PAM yield, or PAM phagocytic activity. C. parvum administration significantly increased spleen weight in sham-operated animals, but had no effect on lung weights, PAM yield, or phagocytic activity of either control or splenectomized animals. Splenectomy in the adult rat did not induce a phagocytic defect in the PAM and thus the lavageable PAM cannot be considered a significant site of the postsplenectomy defect. Since C. parvum protects animals from respiratory challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae but does not alter the number or activity of lavageable alveolar macrophages, we hypothesize that C. parvum protection is more likely related to our previous finding of an increased clearance of blood-borne bacteria by the expanded and enhanced reticuloendothelial system.
TI  - In vitro generation of procoagulant activity by Corynebacterium parvum-stimulated mononuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Thromboembolic complications are known in cancer patients after i.v. administration of Corynebacterium parvum. We examined the ability of this organism to induce production of procoagulant activity by human blood mononuclear leukocytes in vitro. After 4 hours incubation Corynebacterium parvum was an effective stimulant for mononuclear leukocytes, behaving in the same way as the typical gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, whereas mononuclear cells incubated with Staphylococcus aureus were not affected. Corynebacterium parvum used was found devoid of endotoxin by the Limulus assay and was not affected by Polymyxin B, which, on the contrary, inhibited Escherichia coli-induced production of procoagulant activity. Intact Corynebacterium parvum may be required for the production of procoagulant activity and, although this specific aspect of the research will require further study, from the exposed data it is concluded that such a production could be a factor contributing to the pathogenesis of the coagulopathy following Corynebacterium parvum therapy.
TI  - Comparative bacteriology of chronic blepharitis.
AB  - One hundred and fifteen patients with chronic blepharitis were compared with 47 normal controls. Six clinically distinct groups of blepharitis were observed: staphylococcal; seborrhoeic, alone, with associated staphylococcal superinfection, meibomian seborrhoea, or secondary inflammation of the meibomian glands; and meibomian keratoconjunctivitis (MKC). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in appreciable frequency from the staphylococcal and the mixed staphylococcal/seborrhoeic groups in contrast to the normal and non-staphylococcal groups. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., Propionibacterium acnes, and cornyneform bacteria were the most commonly isolated bacteria from the lid for all groups. Cultures of material expressed from the meibomian glands yielded similar organisms but in reduced frequency. Testing of antibiotic susceptibility revealed Staph aureus to be usually sensitive to most commonly used ophthalmic antimicrobials except sulphonamides.
TI  - Acetic, propionic, and oleic acid as the possible factors influencing the predominant residence of some species of Propionibacterium and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus on normal human skin.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of acetic and propionic acid for resident bacteria on normal human skin, such as Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, was 25 mg/mL or more at any pH tested (pH 5.5-6.8). While the MIC of these acids for most of the transient bacteria was markedly decreased by lowering the pH of the media and at pH 5.5, the mean pH value of the normal human skin, the MIC was 6.25 mg/mL or less. The MIC of oleic acid for some strains of Gram-positive transient bacteria of Streptococcus, Micrococcus, or Bacillus was 100 micrograms/mL or less at all pH's tested. Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to this acid at pH 6.8, but became as sensitive as Streptococcus when the pH was lowered. The growth of P. acnes, the most predominant resident bacterium, was enhanced markedly and reached a maximum level at 6.25 mg/mL of propionic acid, 12.5 mg/mL of acetic acid, and 50-100 micrograms/mL of oleic acid. On the basis of these results, we presumed that acetic, propionic, and oleic acids are factors influencing the predominant residence of some species of Propionibacterium and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus on normal human skin.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of wet cerumen.
AB  - The viable populations of seven species of bacteria were reduced 17% to 99% by treatment with a 3% suspension of human cerumen of the soft or "wet" type. Species tested for susceptibility to cerumen were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphlylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. The reduction depended upon the species of bacterium and the age of the culture. Pathogenic species appeared to be more susceptible than others, while cultures in logarithmic growth were more susceptible than stationary phase cultures to the bactericidal activity of wet cerumen. There appeared to be little difference in the bactericidal activity between the two lots of cerumen used. The bactericidal activity of wet cerumen was found to be quite similar to that of dry cerumen as reported earlier in the literature.
TI  - Skin microbiology: coming of age.
AB  
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriologic features of serous otitis media in children.
AB  - Aspirates of serous ear fluids from 57 children were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial growth was noted in 23 patients (40 per cent). Aerobic organisms only were recovered in 13 aspirates (57 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in four (17 per cent); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in six (26 per cent). A total of 45 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 2.0 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.6 anaerobe). There were a total of 31 aerobic isolates, including Hemophilus influenzae (eight isolates), Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (five of each), and Staphylococcus epidermidis and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (four of each). Fourteen anaerobes were recovered, including anaerobic gram-positive cocci and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (five isolates each) and Propionibacterium acnes (three isolates).
TI  - Isolation of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria from clean surgical wounds: an experimental and clinical study.
AB  - A pad imprint method was evaluated for quantitative sampling of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria from clean surgical wounds. The best recovery of bacteria from the pads was obtained when they were treated with a rinsing solution in a 'Stomacher' apparatus. Pads of three different fabrics were compared, but no difference was noted in their efficiency in sampling anaerobic and aerobic bacteria from clean surgical wounds. Sampling of known quantities of Staphylococcus aureus from experimental wounds in rabbits performed with the pad method gave a threefold better recovery than with a swab. The pad method was superior to the wound wash-out method when sampling wounds in hip surgery.
TI  - Adherence of streptococci to cells infected with herpesvirus.
AB  - The attachment of streptococci and staphylococci to cells infected with influenza virus has been previously reported and has been correlated with the increased incidence of these bacterial infections during flu epidemics. The present work was initiated to determine whether infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV) might lead to preferential bacterial attachment. HEp-2 cells were grown in monolayer and infected with HSV, Type I or Type II. Twenty-four hours later the cells were incubated with suspensions of various organisms, including Group A and B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, and Candida albicans. After incubation for one hour, the cells were washed and fixed. Bacterial adherence and virus infection were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as well as conventional light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Only Group A streptococci adhered to virus-infected cells, both to cells infected with HSV, Type I and those infected with HSV, Type II. SEM and TEM revealed bacteria attaching to cells with budding virus particles. Preincubation of infected cells with anti-HSV serum prevented bacterial adherence. These findings suggest that infection of oral epithelium with HSV might lead to superinfection with Group A streptococci.
TI  - Teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - Teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and Gram-positive anaerobes (Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and Cl. difficile). Ninety per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of Staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. Vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. Multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. Teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for Str. faecalis. In mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. It was very effective in curing experimental mouse septicemias caused by Gram-positive bacteria (ED50 values less than 1 mg/kg).
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - Synergism of the antimicrobial agents miconazole and benzoylperoxide.
AB  
TI  - Recovery of microorganisms from synovial and pleural fluids of animals using hyperosmolar media.
AB  - L-phase (CWD) broth and plate media were used in parallel with conventional microbiological media during a 3-year period for culturing synovial and pleural fluids of animals. Two kinds of recoveries were obtained where parallel conventional methods were negative: (1) parent or normal bacteria, in very low numbers; and (2) Type B CWD variants in equally low numbers. Organisms in group 1 were: Streptococcus zooepidemicus from horses (2x); beta-hemolytic streptococci, Lancefield Gp. G (2x); Staphylococcus aureus; Actinobacillus, and Actinomyces viscosus. Group 2 consisted of Bacteroides sp., Propionibacterium acnes, and three "Nocardia-like" sp. Catalase + Actinomyces was not recovered equally well on CWD plates as on conventional media with fluids obtained during ampicillin treatment. This occurred in spite of the fact that the CWD media was shown to support growth and reversion of laboratory induced L-phase variants of Nocardia caviae and N. asteroides, and had facilitated recovery of a Bacteroides L-phase variant from a pleural fluid. The nature of this fault in the media is under investigation in this laboratory.
TI  - A simplified medium for detecting the effect of lecithin on the growth of Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - Thirty strains of Propionibacterium acnes were assayed to detect the effect of lecithin on their growth and to test the nutritional requirement of this bacterium for this phospholipid. The liquid lecithin medium (LLM) and solid lecithin medium (SLM), containing purified bovine lecithin (PBL) supported the growth of P. acnes strains assayed. Two percent PBL, which was an optimal concentration of lecithin (w/v in LLM and SLM) for the normal growth of P. acnes, was found to be inhibitory for the growth of a strain of Staphylococcus aureus tested. the growth of P. acnes in lecithin media was consistently comparable to the growth patterns of P. acnes in complex media. These results indicated that lecithin in lower concentrations than 2% stimulated the growth of P. acnes. There was an indication that this bacterium may produce enzymes capable of hydrolyzing this phosphoglyceride, incorporated in a defined basal medium, to use it as a source of carbon, energy and fatty acids.
TI  - Intrasplenic abscess: two case reports and review of the literature.
AB  - The occurrence of splenic abscess, sickle cell trait, and drug addiction is described in two patients. The coincidence of sickle cell disease and drug addiction in the possible etiology of splenic abscess should be noted. The first patient had a splenic abscess in the inferior pole of the spleen with signs and symptoms of left upper quadrant peritoneal irritation. The second patient had an intrasplenic abscess in the superior pole with pleuritic type chest pain and large left pleural effusion. In both cases, the upper gastrointestinal series was of aid in establishing the diagnosis. In one case, a splenic scan was helpful. Clostridium perfringens were cultured from the abscess of one patient; and Clostridium species, Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes were cultured from the other. Both patients were successfully treated with splenectomy and drainage of the splenic bed.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in deep infections after total hip arthroplasty: differential diagnosis between infectious and non-infectious loosening.
AB  - Five separate biopsy samples for bacterial culture were taken at primary total hip arthroplasty in patients without signs of infection and at reoperation of patients with infectious and noninfectious loosening of the prosthesis. Based on the results of the culture, on serologic results and on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, bacteria of clinical significance could be distinguished from contaminants. Growth in one or two of five biopsy samples was a strong indicator of contamination, while growth in five of five biopsy samples of one or two bacterial species strongly indicated an infection. These diagnostic procedures are applied to differentiate between infectious and noninfectious loosening of the prosthesis. In the delayed infections, the low-virulent aerobic and anaerobic bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes and peptococci were predominant.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cervical adenitis in children.
AB  - Needle aspirates from 53 inflamed cervical lymph glands were studies for aerobic  and anaerobic bacteria and mycobacteria. Bacterial growth was achieved in 45 patients (85%). Sixty-six bacterial isolates were recovered, averaging 1.5 isolates per specimen (0.8 aerobes and 0.7 anaerobes), with as many as 4 isolates in some specimens. Aerobic organisms alone were recovered in 27 aspirates (60%) of the 45 culture-positive aspirates, anaerobic bacteria alone in 8 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 9 specimens (20%). Mycobacterium scrofulaceum was recovered in one (2%). The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (14 isolates) and group A beta hemolytic streptococci (8). A total of 31 anaerobes were recovered, including gram-positive cocci (9, including 6 Peptococcus sp. and 3 Peptostreptococcus sp.), 8 Bacteroides sp. (including 3 B. melaninogenicus), 5 Propionibacterium acnes, and 4 Fusobacterium nucleatum. These data demonstrate the role of anaerobic organisms in cervical lymphadenitis and the need to culture aspirated material for both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro effects of skin lipid extracts on skin bacteria in relation to age and acne changes.
AB  - Skin lipid extracts of 185 persons of different age were tested in vitro against  single representatives of skin bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, P. granulosum and Corynebacterium sp. in order to find differences in their inhibitory effects. Percentages of the extracts inhibiting the first 4 bacteria were nearly the same (about 20%) while corynebacteria were inhibited by only 3 extracts. Extracts showing these properties were isolated mainly from adolescents with acne changes, young adults, about 20 yr old, and from children 8--10 yr old, but not from elderly people. The age-related differences in growth inhibition may be related to known differences in relative composition of the sebum constituents according to age. Forty-two extracts of acne patients and healthy adults and adolescents showed an inverse effect in vitro: they enhanced bacterial growth. Growth enhancement was demonstrated only for P. granulosum.
TI  - Microbiology of otitis media.
AB  - The microbiology of otitis media (OM) has been documented by cultures of middle ear fluid (MEF) obtained by needle aspiration. The results of studies of bacteriology of OM from Sweden, Finland and the United States are very similar: Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the most important pathogens: Gram-negative enteric bacilli are isolated from MEF of approximately equal to 20% of infants to six weeks of age but are rarely present in MEF of older children; group A beta hemolytic streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus are infrequent causes of otitis. Preliminary results suggest that anaerobic bacteria are responsible for some episodes of OM. Although epidemiologic data suggest that virus infection is associated with OM, the results of ten studies indicate that these agents are infrequently isolated from MEF of children with OM. Viruses were isolated from 29 to 663 patients (4.4%). Respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus were isolated most frequently. The results of seven studies of mycoplasma infection in 771 patients with OM included only one isolation of Mycoplasma pneumoniae from MEF. These results indicate that viruses and mycoplasmas are uncommonly found in MEF of patients with OM, but few studies have been attempted in recent years. Chlamydia trachomatosis is the etiologic agent of a mild but prolonged pneumonia in infants. OM may accompany the respiratory infection, and C. trachomatis has been isolated from MEF of some of these infants. Recent studies of asymptomatic children with persistent MEF indicate that bacterial pathogens are present in some of these fluids. Investigators in Columbus, Boston, and Pittsburgh obtained MEF for culture at the time of myringotomy or placement of tympanostomy tubes. Bacteria were isolated from MEF of 50% of these children; S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or group A streptococcus were isolated from 10% to 20% of cases. There were only minimal differences in the rates of isolation of bacteria from serous, mucoid, or purulent fluids. The significance of these results is uncertain, but they suggest that the persistent effusion may be a result of asymptomatic but prolonged infection or may be an immune response to a persisting antigen.
TI  - Biphasic protection against bacterial infection in mice induced by vaccination of Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - A single intraperitoneal injection of the phenol-treated cells of Propionibacterium acnes into mice showed nonspecific resistance against subsequent lethal doses of an intraperitoneal challenge of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The protection showed a biphasic pattern. The maximum protection, designated as the early phase protection, was seen in mice injected with P. acnes vaccine 1 to 2 days before the challenge, whereas the late phase protection was seen in mice vaccinated 16 to 22 days before the challenge. The activity of the reticuloendothelial system in mice after vaccination also showed a biphasic pattern with the peak on days 4 and 12. The delayed activation of the reticuloendothelial system lasted up to 3 weeks and coincided with the period of the late phase protection. The early phase resistance was markedly impaired by the treatment with hydrocortisone and carrageenan, but not by the treatment with anti-thymocyte serum, actinomycin D, or cyclophosphamide. The number of peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vaccinated mice increased on days 1 to 2. The number of macrophages also increased at 2 to 21 days after vaccination and reached its maximum on day 14. Total activities of acid phosphatase, Nitro Blue Tetrazolium reduction, and the phagocytic activities of peritoneal exudate cells were also enhanced on and after day 1 after the injection of P. acnes vaccine.
TI  - Bacterial colonization in intubated newborns.
AB  - The bacteriology of tracheal aspirates from 127 newborns was studied. Specimens were obtained twice a week as long as the newborns were intubated. Each newborn had between one and eight specimens taken (average 1.7). 127 babies had one specimen taken, 38 had two, 25 had three, 12 had four, and 10 had more than four specimens taken, which made a total of 212 specimens. No bacterial or fungal growth was obtained from 65 specimens, whereas the remaining specimens (147) yielded 209 bacterial and fungal isolates accounting for 1.4 isolates per specimen. The total isolates recovered were 168 aerobes, 36 anaerobes, and 5 Candida albicans. Of this total, 70 specimens yielded one isolate, 48 two isolates, 6 three isolates, 5 four isolates, and one aspirate yielded five isolates. 78 newborns (61%) received antimicrobial therapy. A higher incidence of positive cultures and the presence of more than one organism per culture were found in those infants not receiving antibiotics. More isolates per specimen were noted with increasing time of incubation. The rate of isolation Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae remained constant with increased length of intubation, the rate of recovery of Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans group streptococci, and Propionibacterium acnes increased, and the rate of isolation of Escherichia coli and anaerobic organisms decreased.
TI  - Corynebacterium parvum: immunomodulation in local bacterial infections.
AB  - Inoculation with Corynebacterium parvum 14 days before bacterial challenge produced protection against murine-simulated surgical wound infection with Escherichia coli to the same degree as had been provided by Bacillus Calmette-Guerin pretreatment. Simulated surgical wound infection induced by Staphylococcus aureus in mice followed a much more variable course; bacterial growth was depressed 7 days after C. parvum inoculation and was equivocal at a 14 day interval. Unlike E. coli infection modified by C. parvum or BCG, bacterial growth was significantly enhanced when the interval between C. parvum inoculation and S. aureus challenge was 20 or 28 days. Explanations for these differences and their possible clinical relevance are discussed.
TI  - Anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of acute conjunctivitis.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic cultures and clinical data were obtained from 131 patients  presenting with acute conjunctivitis. Similar cultures were obtained from 60 noninflamed individuals. Anaerobes were isolated from 66 patients, 51 times in mixed culture with aerobes and 15 times (11.5%) as the only isolates. Aerobes only were recovered in 54 patients. The organisms found to be statistically significantly more commonly recovered from eyes with conjunctivitis were Staphylococcus aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes. No statistical difference was present between the bacterial flora of the eyes with unilateral conjunctivitis when compared to their uninvolved mates in 20 cases in which only one eye was involved.
TI  - [The bacterial flora of preputial space].
AB  - The bacterial flora of the preputial space of 210 healthy males (43 children aged between 2 and 11 years, 137 males between 12 and 60 years and 30 men over 60 years) was determined by smears and cultueres from glans penis, sulcus coronarius and the adjacent prepuce. The results were grouped according to various criteria, e.g. glans covered or uncovered and age of males. Differences in the distribution of germs could be found in relationship to age. In the case of an uncovered glans penis the presence of microbial flora corresponds to the grampositive saprophytic bacteria in areas rich in sebaceous glands. In the case of a covered glans the density of microorganisms increases. Prevalent are gramnegative anaerobes, especially Bacterioides melaninogenicus, also enterococci, enterobacteria and coagulase-positive staphylococci.
TI  - Purification of antibodies to bacterial antigens by an immunoadsorbent and a method to quantify their reaction with insoluble bacterial targets.
AB  - A combination of procedures was employed to develop a radioimmunoassay which quantified the binding of antibodies to antigens of either intact Propionibacterium acnes or to antigens of insoluble extracts derived from the bacteria. Reactive antibody populations were purified by use of bacterial immunoadsorbents which were prepared by coupling P. acnes to diethylaminoethyl cellulose. Binding of antibodies was detected with [125I]staphylococcal protein A ([125I]SpA) and optimal conditions for the assay defined by varying the amounts of antibodies, bacterial antigenic targets and [125I]SpA. In antibody excess, 100% of available [125I]SpA was bound by the target-antibody complexes. However, when antibody concentration was limiting, a linear relationship was demonstrated between per cent specific binding of [125I]SpA and antibodies bound to bacterial targets. These results were achieved only with immunoadsorbent-purified antibody populations and not with hyperimmune sera or IgG. The radioimmunoassay detected subtle antigenic differences and similarities between P. acnes, P. acnes extracts and a variety of unrelated microorganisms.
TI  - Quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  - A widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, Triton X-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. We determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. The shortest-lived was Streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. All of the others (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. K. pneumoniae, the only Gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. Thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.
TI  - Electron capture gas-liquid chromatographic study of metabolites produced by some arthritic transudate-associated organisms in vitro and in vivo in rabbit models.
AB  - Computerized, frequency-pulsed, modulated electron capture gas-liquid chromatography was used to study the acid metabolites produced in vitro in fetal calf serum and in vivo in an animal chamber model. Several strains of Diplostreptococcus agalactiae, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus serogroups A, B, and G were studied. All of these organisms have been reported to be associated with arthritic transudates in humans. Metabolites were detected by this method from derivatized extracts of both spent fetal calf serum and chamber fluids. Since there was little host response to the organisms cultured in the chambers, it is highly probable that the products detected represent metabolites produced in an in vivo type of environment. The metabolic patterns were reproducible and exhibited many similarities in vitro and in vivo. Production of the acids detected was reproducible, and these acids were useful identification markers. The data support published reports (J. B. Brooks, C. C. Alley, and J. A. Liddle, Anal. Chem. 46: 1930-1934, 1974; J. B. Brooks, G. Choudhary, R. B. Craven, D. Edman, C. C. Alley, and J. A. Liddle, J. Clin. Microbiol. 5:625-628, 1977; J. B. Brooks, R. B. Craven, A. R. Melton, and C. C. Alley, in H. H. Johnson and W. B. Newson, ed., Second International Symposium on Rapid Methods and Automation on Microbiology, 1976; J. B. Brooks, R. B. Craven, D. Schlossberg, C. C. Alley, and F. M. Pitts, J. Clin. Microbiol. 8:203-208, 1978; J. B. Brooks, D. S. Kellogg, C. C. Alley, H. B. Short, and H. H. Handsfield, J. Infect. Dis. 129:660-668, 1974) that bacterial metabolites might be detectable in diseased body fluids. The growth characteristics of the organisms in the animal model and fetal calf serum are discussed, and a moderately priced computer for performing data manipulations is evaluated.
TI  - Synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - Sheep and human erythrocytes, partially processed by Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium perfringens, were susceptible to lysis in the presence of Propionibacterium acnes. P. acnes liberated a lipase that was detected on Tween 80 agar and also on phospholipase C-precipitated egg yolk agar. Such a lipase might have contributed in the process of an intensified cellular lysis. Similar reactions were attempted with Lactobacillus acidophilus, known to possess a nondiffusible lipase, and failed to produce any such reactions. The synergistic reactions, between P. acnes and C. perfringens, were compared with The classical CAMP reaction in an attempt to find a correlation with the established membrane composition of the erythrocytes involved. Synergistic reactions observed do seem to reflect the membrane composition. Such findings, besides being contributory to an understanding of the role of these organisms in the process of pathogenesis, are of importance in the elucidation of molecular organization of biomembranes. Detailed studies, involving a large number of representative anaerobic bacteria, may also help provide an avenue in anaerobic species identification.
TI  - Adjuvant protection against bacterial infection in granulocytopenic mice.
AB  - The hypothesis that the induction of nonspecific resistance to infection by immunostimulation prior to drug-induced granulocytopenia would afford increased protection to subsequent bacterial challenge was tested in a murine model of infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus in mice rendered granulocytopenic with cyclophosphamide. Prior intraperitoneal immunostimulation of mice with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or Mycobacterium bovis (Bacille Calmette-Guerin; BCG) increased the 50% lethal dose in mice challenged subcutaneously with P. aeruginosa, but only CFA protected against challenge with S. aureus. The degree of protection was 1-2 log 10. Corynebacterium parvum provided no protection against infection with P. aeruginosa. The protective effect observed with CFA and BCG substantiates our hypothesis and indicates that nonspecific immunostimulation may be of value in protection of granulocytopenic patients from opportunistic infections.
TI  - Bacteremia after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
AB  - During 24 months, 200 upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed on 193 patients. Blood cultures were obtained before and five and 30 minutes after the procedure using thiol (50 ml) and trypticase soy broth (100 ml) media. The mean endoscopic time was 34 minutes. Sixteen patients developed bacteremia (8%). Twelve groups of microorganisms were detected in positive blood cultures: Streptococcus (5 species), Lactobacillus sp, Veillonella alcalescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph epidermidis, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Corynebacterium acnes, and Bacillus subtilis. Seven patients had positive blood cultures at five and 30 minutes, eight at five minutes, and one at 30 minutes only. There was no clear correlation of bacteremia with the age or previous history of the patient, biopsy, active bleeding, endoscopic time, or findings. A follow-up study of all patients for six months to two years indicated no complications related to endoscopy and/or bacteremia.

TI  - Effects of BCG, Corynebacterium parvum, and methanol-extration residue in the reduction of mortality from Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans infections in immunosuppressed mice.
AB  - An immunosuppressed mouse model was devised to test the effects of immunopotentiators on the prevention of bacterial and fungal infections. The effects of BCG and Corynebacterium were tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans infection. The effect of methanol-extraction residue (MER-BCG) was tested against S. aureus septicemia. CDF mice were given various doses of BCG, 1.0 mg of C. parvum, or 0.5 mg of MER intraperitoneally at varying intervals before injection of an intravenous bacterial challenge. Four days before challenge, 300 mg of cyclophosphamide per ml was given intraperitoneally. BCG (106 colony-forming units) reduced mortality due to S.aureus at pretreatment intervals of 3, 7, 14, and 28 days. Isonicotinic acid hydrazide treatment elimated the protective effect of the live BCG. C. parvum was as effective as BCG against S. aureus septicemia when given 3 days before infection, but lost most of its protective effect after that time. MER protected at doses as small as 0.25 mg when given 25 days prior to challenge. Both BCG and C. parvum exerted a protective effect against Candida albicans infection.
TI  - Quantitative microbiology of the scalp in non-dandruff, dandruff, and seborrheic  dermatitis.
AB  - The composition of the scalp microflora was assessed quantitatively in normal individuals and in patients with dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis, disorders characterized by increasing scaling. Three organisms were constantly found: (1) Pityrosporum, (2) aerobic cocci, and (3) Corynebacterium acnes. Pityrosporum (mainly Pityrosporum ovale) made up 46% of the total microflora in normals, 74% in dandruff, and 83% in seborvheic dermatitis. The geometric mean number of organisms per cm-2 in non-dandruff subjects was 5.04 times 10-5; 9.22 times 10-5 in dandruff subjects; and 6.45 times 10-5 in those with seborrheic dermatitis. The cocci were dominantly Baird-Parker type SII and no quantitative or qualitative change occurred in the scaling disorders. C. acnes comprised 26% of the flora on the normal scalp, 6% in dandruff, and only 1% in seborrheic dermatitis. These results differ significantly from previous reports which describe a much more complex microflora and suggest an etiologic role for microorganisms in dandruff.
TI  - Bacteriology of normal and infected conjunctiva.
AB  - The conjunctivas of 273 inflamed eyes were cultured by both aerobic and anaerobic techniques. Isolations were obtained from 267 (97.8%) of the eyes. Aerobic organisms were isolated from 237 (86.8%) of the conjunctivas. Staphylococcus aureus from 63 (23.1%) of the diseased eyes was the aerobic pathogen most often isolated. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 172 (63.0%) of the conjunctivas. Propionibacterium acnes was isolated from 126 (46.2%) of the conjunctivas, and Peptostreptococcus species were isolated from 80 (29.3%) of the conjunctivas. Comparison with the bacteriology of 96 normal eyes showed that anaerobes play a much greater role as etiological agents of conjunctivitis than formerly believed. When anaerobic bacteria were isolated, they appeared on the average in 7 days, indicating that they may be missed by ordinary bacteriological culturing.
