TI  == [etiological aspects of acute gastroenteritis--a ten-year review (1.01. 2001-31.12.2010)].
AB  == acute gastroentritis is one of the most common diseases in humans, and continues  to be a significant cause of morbidity worldwide. aims: to determine the bacterial pathogens associated with gastroenteritis in patients admitted to the iasi infectious diseases hospital in the last ten years. material and methods: a  total of 40481 stool samples were examined using conventional methods. results: bacteria were found in 7.36% of cases, and parasites in 9.64%; 83% of the cases were viral, micotic, or disbiotic. the bacterial etiology was dominated by salmonella spp. (58.34%), shigella spp. (27.08%), yersinia enterocolitica 03 (8.53%), campylobacter spp. (1.31%), other bacterial pathogens (epec, aeromonas hydrophilla/caviae/sobria, plesiomonas shigelloides, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, etc) being detected in 3.74% of the cases. of the salmonella species, group b (51.99%) followed by group d (45.23%) were most common. shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri were found in almost the same proportion (49.45% and 49.70%, respectively); shigella boydii was isolated in only 0.85% of cases. the trend of gastroenteritis caused by bacterial pathogens is decreasing: from 355 cases in 2001 to 105 cases in 2010; three peaks have been recorded in 2002, 2005 (when salmonella typhi was isolated in a patient), and 2008 (469, 409, and 252 cases, respectively). bacterial gastroenteritis affected  both sexes almost equally (122 males and 118 females). the most affected age groups were: 0 - 4 years, 15 - 24 years, 5 - 14 years and 25 - 39 years. conclusions: laboratory investigations are essential in determining the etiology  of gastroenteritis. its unpredictable incidence justifies the human and material  efforts aimed at controlling the spread of potentially epidemic acute gastroenteritis.

TI  == application of a continuously stirred tank bioreactor (cstr) for bioremediation of hydrocarbon-rich industrial wastewater effluents.
AB  == a continuously stirred tank bioreactor (cstr) was used to optimize feasible and reliable bioprocess system in order to treat hydrocarbon-rich industrial wastewaters. a successful bioremediation was developed by an efficient acclimatized microbial consortium. after an experimental period of 225 days, the  process was shown to be highly efficient in decontaminating the wastewater. the performance of the bioaugmented reactor was demonstrated by the reduction of cod  rates up to 95%. the residual total petroleum hydrocarbon (tph) decreased from 320 mg tph l(-1) to 8 mg tph l(-1). analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) identified 26 hydrocarbons. the use of the mixed cultures demonstrated high degradation performance for hydrocarbons range n-alkanes (c10-c35). six microbial isolates from the cstr were characterized and species identification was confirmed by sequencing the 16s rrna genes. the partial 16s rrna gene sequences demonstrated that 5 strains were closely related to aeromonas punctata (aeromonas caviae), bacillus cereus, ochrobactrum intermedium, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and rhodococcus sp. the 6th isolate was affiliated to genera achromobacter. besides, the treated wastewater could be considered as non toxic according to the phytotoxicity test since the germination index of lepidium sativum ranged between 57 and 95%. the treatment provided satisfactory results and presents a feasible technology for the treatment of hydrocarbon-rich  wastewater from petrochemical industries and petroleum refineries.
