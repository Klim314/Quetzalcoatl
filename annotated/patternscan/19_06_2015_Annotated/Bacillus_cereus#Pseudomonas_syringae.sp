TI  == comparison of identification systems for psychrotrophic bacteria isolated from raw bovine milk.
AB  == psychrotrophic bacteria in raw milk produce heat-resistant extracellular proteases, resulting in spoilage and shelf-life reduction of ultrahigh temperature treated milk and milk products. controlling of these spoilage microbes requires rapid and reliable identification systems for screening of raw  milk. this study aimed to compare commercial bacterial identification systems with a genetic method (considered as the 'gold standard' method) for the identification of heat-resistant protease producing bacteria in raw milk. five bacterial identification systems were compared based on typability, discrimination power (i.e. simpson's index of diversity), reproducibility and speed of analysis. the accuracy of 16s rrna gene sequencing, biolog, maldi-tof ms, api, and microbact for the identification of gram negative bacilli at the species level was 100.0%, 86.8%, 63.2%, 60.5% and 57.9%, respectively. the gram positive bacilli were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing, biolog, maldi-tof ms, and api with accuracies at the species level of 100.0%, 85.0%, 95.0% and 90.0%, respectively. the 16s rrna gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis discriminated pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas syringae, hafnia alvei, bacillus cereus, bacillus pumilus and bacillus licheniformis to the subspecies level. the simpson's index of diversity scores were 0.966, 0.711, 0.496, 0.472, and 0.140, for 16s rrna gene sequencing, biolog, maldi-tof ms, api and microbact, respectively. limited reference profiles in the databases of biolog, maldi-tof ms, api and microbact systems reduced their accuracy in bacterial identification, compared to 16s rrna gene sequencing. the rapidity of each assay is in the following order; maldi-tof ms>16s rrna gene sequencing>biolog>microbact>api. the  reproducibility of the assays is in the order of 16s rrna gene sequencing>api>microbact>maldi-tof ms>biolog. thus, 16s rrna gene sequencing appears to be the most reliable and robust system for the identification of dairy spoilage bacteria. the biolog system is suitable for the identification of gram negative spoilage bacteria, while maldi-tof ms and api systems are suitable for the identification of gram positive spoilage bacteria isolated from raw milk. the commercial systems used in this study have been developed and extensively used for the identification of clinical microbes but only a limited number of studies  used those systems to identify the environmental microorganisms that often contaminate raw milk. therefore, comparison of those systems for the identification of spoilage microbes in raw milk would provide better understanding of their suitability for routine dairy microbiology and more extensive dairy research.

TI  == the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium bacillus cereus ar156 induces systemic  resistance in arabidopsis thaliana by simultaneously activating salicylate- and jasmonate/ethylene-dependent signaling pathways.
AB  == bacillus cereus ar156 is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium that induces resistance against a broad spectrum of pathogens including pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc3000. this study analyzed ar156-induced systemic resistance (isr) to dc3000 in arabidopsis ecotype col-0 plants. compared with mock-treated plants, ar156-treated ones showed an increase in biomass and reductions in disease severity and pathogen density in the leaves. the defense-related genes pr1, pr2,  pr5, and pdf1.2 were concurrently expressed in the leaves of ar156-treated plants, suggesting simultaneous activation of the salicylic acid (sa)- and the jasmonic acid (ja)- and ethylene (et)-dependent signaling pathways by ar156. the  above gene expression was faster and stronger in plants treated with ar156 and inoculated with dc3000 than that in plants only inoculated with dc3000. moreover, the cellular defense responses hydrogen peroxide accumulation and callose deposition were induced upon challenge inoculation in the leaves of col-0 plants  primed by ar156. also, pretreatment with ar156 led to a higher level of induced protection against dc3000 in col-0 than that in the transgenic nahg, the mutant jar1 or etr1, but the protection was absent in the mutant npr1. therefore, ar156  triggers isr in arabidopsis by simultaneously activating the sa- and ja/et-signaling pathways in an npr1-dependent manner that leads to an additive effect on the level of induced protection.

TI  == saccharides cross-reactive with bacillus anthracis spore glycoprotein as an anthrax vaccine component.
AB  == bacillus anthracis is a spore-forming bacterium that causes anthrax in humans and in other mammals. the glycoprotein bcla (bacillus collagen-like protein of anthracis) is a major constituent of the exosporium, the outermost surface of b.  anthracis spores. the glycosyl part of bcla is an oligosaccharide composed of 2-o-methyl-4-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanamido)-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose, referred to as anthrose, and three rhamnose residues. a structure similar to anthrose, 4-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanamido)-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose is found in the side chain of the capsular polysaccharide (cps) of shewanella spp. mr-4. under certain growth conditions the bacteria produce a variant cps lacking one methyl group on  the hydroxybutyrate, 4-(3-hydroxybutanamido)-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose. contrary to anthrose, neither of the shewanella cpss is 2-o methylated. here, we report that  both shewanella cps variants react with anti-b. anthracis spore sera. we also found that these antisera reacted with flagellae of pseudomonas syringae, reported to be glycosylated with a similar terminal saccharide, 4-(3-hydroxybutanamido)-4,6-dideoxy-2-o-methyl-d-glucose. sera produced by immunization with shewanella or p. syringae cells bound to b. anthracis spores but not to bacillus cereus spores in a fluorescent microscopy assay. these experiments show that methylation of the anthrose at the o-2 of the sugar ring and at the c-3 of 3-hydroxybutyrate are not essential for induction of cross-reactive antibodies. we report the preparation, characterization, and antibody responses to protein conjugates of the two variants of shewanella cps. both conjugates induced antibodies that bound to both shewanella cps variants by  elisa and to b. anthracis spores, as detected by fluorescent microscopy. we propose the use of shewanella cps conjugates as a component of an anthrax vaccine.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of extracts of chemical races of the lichen pseudevernia furfuracea and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity and the mic values of the ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetone extracts of the chemical races of pseudevernia furfuracea (var. furfuracea and var. ceratea) and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents have been investigated against some microorganisms. nearly all extracts of both chemical races showed antimicrobial activity against aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, yersinia enterocolitica, candida albicans, candida glabrata, alternaria alternata, ascochyta rabiei, aspergillus niger, fusarium culmorum, fusarium moniliforme, fusarium oxysporum, fusarium solani, and penicillium notatum. there  was no antimicrobial activity of the extracts against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas syringae, salmonella typhimurium, alternaria citri, alternaria tenuissima, and gaeumannomyces graminis. chloroatranorin and olivetoric acid were active against the same microorganisms with few exceptions. physodic acid was active against about the same bacteria and yeasts and inactive against all of the filamentous fungi tested. also no activity of atranorin against the filamentous fungi was observed.

TI  == antibacterial and proteolytic activity in venom from the endoparasitic wasp pimpla hypochondriaca (hymenoptera: ichneumonidae).
AB  == venom from the endoparasitic wasp, pimpla hypochondriaca, is composed of a mixture of high and low molecular weight proteins, possesses phenoloxidase activity, has immunosuppressive properties, and induces paralysis in several insect species. in the present study we demonstrate that p. hypochondriaca venom  also contains antibacterial and proteolytic activity. antibacterial activity was  detected against the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and xanthamonas campestris but not against pseudomonas syringae nor against two gram-positive bacteria, bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis. endopeptidase and aminopeptidase activity in venom was detected using the synthetic fluorogenic substrates n-t-boc-phe-ser-arg-amc, arg-amc and leu-arg. the aminopeptidase activity towards arg-amc was sensitive to amastatin (70% inhibition), an aminopeptidase inhibitor. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace)-like enzyme activity was detected, by reverse-phase hplc using the synthetic tripeptide hip-his-leu as a substrate. this activity was sensitive to captopril, an ace inhibitor (ic(50) 3.8 x 10(-8) m). using an antiserum raised against recombinant drosophila melanogaster ace-like enzyme, (rance), western blot analysis revealed an immunoreactive protein, with a molecular weight estimate of 74 kda, in p. hypochondriaca venom.  the possibility that the endopeptidase, aminopeptidase and ace are involved in the processing of peptide precursors in the venom sac is discussed.
