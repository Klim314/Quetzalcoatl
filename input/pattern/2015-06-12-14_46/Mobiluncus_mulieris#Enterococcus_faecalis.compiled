TI  - Microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. Yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. The primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. Secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. RESULTS: Based on Gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (BV) microflora and that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous Gram-negative and Gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. Candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. On average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. The species most often found were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus anginosus group spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp., Mobiluncus curtisii and Bacteroides ureolyticus. Lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. There was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. There was however a highly significant correlation between the presence of E. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). Respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with M. curtisii, Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis primer sets. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. It reveals a mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a BV microflora.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetQ.
AB  - We tested 34 American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetQ gene using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and DNA-DNA hybridization. The identities of PCR products were confirmed by Southern blot hybridization of whole-cell DNA. Eleven of the ATCC strains were positive for tetQ, including five Bacteroides spp., five Prevotella spp. and a single isolate of Mitsuokella multiacidus. Twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical Gram-negative isolates carried the tetQ gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical Gram-positive isolates carried the tetQ gene. This is the first description of tetQ in Gram-positive species. All isolates except one Peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetQ integrated into the chromosome. The tetQ gene could be transferred from Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides distasonis into an Enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. In contrast, tetQ failed to transfer from two isolates of Prevotella intermedia, two isolates of Porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of Mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of Peptostreptococcus sp. The latter two are Gram-positive species. The PCR assay was used to screen 198 proteinase K-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. Thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the PCR assay could be of value in screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.
TI  - Bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - One hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (BV) were enrolled in this study. The bacteriological epidemiology of BV and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of BV were investigated. The epidemiology of BV was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. Fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (MTN), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (CLDM) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. The major organisms occurring were Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The therapeutic efficacy of CLDM cream on BV appeared to be preferable to oral MTN from clinical and bacteriological aspects. The clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of MTN and CLDM in the treatment of BV suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms in patients with BV.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
