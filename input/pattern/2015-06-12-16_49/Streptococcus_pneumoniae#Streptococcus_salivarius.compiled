TI  - Transduction of the Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage Phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(A) and tet(O), to other Streptococcus species.
AB  - Phim46.1 - Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(A) and tet(O), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (M phenotype) and tetracycline - is widespread in S. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. Phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among S. pyogenes isolates, but no information is available about its transferability to other Streptococcus species. We thus investigated Phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of different Streptococcus species. Transductants were obtained from recipients of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus suis. Retransfer was always achieved, and from S. suis to S. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. In transductants Phim46.1 retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin C, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. The transductants shared the same Phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved RNA uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. No transfer occurred to recipients of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. A largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. Growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of Phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in S. suis. The S. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene atl.
TI  - The oral commensal Streptococcus mitis shows a mixed memory Th cell signature that is similar to and cross-reactive with Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Carriage of and infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae is known to predominantly induce T helper 17 (Th17) responses in humans, but the types of Th cells showing reactivity towards commensal streptococci with low pathogenic potential, such as the oral commensals S. mitis and S. salivarius, remain uncharacterized. METHODS: Memory CD4(+) T helper (Th) cell subsets were isolated from healthy human blood donors according to differential expression of chemokine receptors, expanded in vitro using polyclonal stimuli and characterized for reactivity against different streptococcal strains. RESULTS: Th cells responding to S. mitis, S. salivarius and S. pneumoniae were predominantly in a CCR6(+)CXCR3(+) subset and produced IFN-gamma, and in a CCR6(+)CCR4(+) subset and produced IL-17 and IL-22. Frequencies of S. pneumoniae-reactive Th cells were higher than frequencies of S. mitis- and S. salivarius-specific Th cells. S. mitis and S. pneumoniae isogenic capsule knock-out mutants and a S. mitis mutant expressing the serotype 4 capsule of S. pneumoniae showed no different Th cell responses as compared to wild type strains. S. mitis-specific Th17 cells showed cross-reactivity with S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: As Th17 cells partly control clearance of S. pneumoniae, cross-reactive Th17 cells that may be induced by commensal bacterial species may influence the immune response, independent of capsule expression.
TI  - Parallel evolution of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis to pathogenic and mutualistic lifestyles.
AB  - The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans. Intriguingly, phylogenetic analysis shows that the species constitutes one evolutionary lineage in a cluster of the otherwise commensal Streptococcus mitis strains, with which humans live in harmony. In a comparative analysis of 35 genomes, including phylogenetic analyses of all predicted genes, we have shown that the pathogenic pneumococcus has evolved into a master of genomic flexibility while lineages that evolved into the nonpathogenic S. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with their host by stabilizing an approximately 15%-reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. Our data further provide evidence that interspecies gene transfer between S. pneumoniae and S. mitis occurs in a unidirectional manner, i.e., from S. mitis to S. pneumoniae. Import of genes from S. mitis and other mitis, anginosus, and salivarius group streptococci ensured allelic replacements and antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae. Our study explains how the unique structural diversity of the pneumococcal capsule emerged and conceivably will continue to increase and reveals a striking example of the fragile border between the commensal and pathogenic lifestyles. While genomic plasticity enabling quick adaptation to environmental stress is a necessity for the pathogenic streptococci, the commensal lifestyle benefits from stability. Importance: One of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the commensal Streptococcus mitis are closely related obligate symbionts associated with hominids. Faced with a shortage of accessible hosts, the two opposing lifestyles evolved in parallel. We have shown that the nonpathogenic S. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with its host by stabilizing a reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. Meanwhile, the pathogenic pneumococcus evolved into a master of genomic flexibility and imports genes from S. mitis and other related streptococci. This process ensured antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae, which conceivably will continue to increase and present a challenge to disease prevention.
TI  - Open-label study to evaluate the pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, and safety  of meropenem for adult bacterial meningitis in Japan.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and concentration of meropenem in cerebrospinal fluid when meropenem (2 g every 8 h) was administered to Japanese adult patients with bacterial meningitis. Five Japanese patients (mean age 60.6 years [range 35-71]) were enrolled. Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (three patients), Streptococcus salivarius (one patient), and Staphylococcus aureus (one patient) was confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid culture. Meropenem (2 g every 8 h) was administered to all five patients. Treatment duration ranged from 14 to 28 days (mean 22.6 days). All the patients were successfully treated. The concentration of meropenem in cerebrospinal fluid ranged from 0.27 to 6.40 mug/ml up to 8.47 h and was over 1 mug/ml 3 h after starting meropenem infusion. In each patient, the present study confirmed for the first time that the concentration of meropenem in cerebrospinal fluid exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration for these pathogens. Eleven clinical and laboratory adverse events considered to be related to meropenem were observed in all patients, but no serious adverse event and no discontinuance of treatment due to adverse events occurred. Thus meropenem appeared to be a well-tolerated and effective agent for Japanese adult patients with bacterial meningitis. 2 g every 8 h of meropenem was delivered to CSF and its concentration was exceed in MICs for the detected pathogens.
TI  - Investigating the effects of probiotics on pneumococcal colonization using an in  vitro adherence assay.
AB  - Adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) to the epithelial lining of the nasopharynx can result in colonization and is considered a prerequisite for pneumococcal infections such as pneumonia and otitis media. In vitro adherence assays can be used to study the attachment of pneumococci to epithelial cell monolayers and to investigate potential interventions, such as the use of probiotics, to inhibit pneumococcal colonization. The protocol described here is used to investigate the effects of the probiotic Streptococcus salivarius on the adherence of pneumococci to the human epithelial cell line CCL-23 (sometimes referred to as HEp-2 cells). The assay involves three main steps: 1) preparation of epithelial and bacterial cells, 2) addition of bacteria to epithelial cell monolayers, and 3) detection of adherent pneumococci by viable counts (serial dilution and plating) or quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). This technique is relatively straightforward and does not require specialized equipment other than a tissue culture setup. The assay can be used to test other probiotic species and/or potential inhibitors of pneumococcal colonization and can be easily modified to address other scientific questions regarding pneumococcal adherence and invasion.
TI  - Effective oral health in infective endocarditis: efficacy of high-street mouthwashes against the viridans group streptococci.
AB  - AIM: Recent UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines state that there is no longer a need for oral antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing dental procedures who are at risk of infective endocarditis (IE), and advocate the importance of maintaining good oral health. As viridans group streptococci (VGS) are common etiological agents of IE and inhabitants of the mouth, the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of common high-street mouthwashes against four classes of VGS organisms (salivarius, mitis, anginosus, and mutans groupings). METHODS: The survival of VGS, Streptococcus gordonii (National Collection of Type Cultures [NCTC] 7865), Streptococcus intermedius (NCTC 11324), Streptococcus mutans (NCTC 10449), Streptococcus oralis (NCTC 11427), Streptococcus pneumoniae (NCTC 7465, NCTC 7978, & American Type Culture Collection 49619) and Streptococcus salivarius (NCTC 8618) was assessed in vitro following treatment of approximately 10(7) c.f.u. in planktonic state with four mouthwashes. RESULTS: No organisms were culturable following 1-min exposure, and were not recovered following non-selective enrichment following incubation in Brain Heart Infusion broth supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) yeast extract. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that such mouthwashes are able to completely kill VGS organisms tested in planktonic solution, where their use would promote good oral hygiene in patients at risk of IE.
TI  - The loss of topography in the microbial communities of the upper respiratory tract in the elderly.
AB  - RATIONALE: The microbial communities inhabiting the upper respiratory tract protect from respiratory infection. The maturity of the immune system is a major influence on the composition of the microbiome and, in youth, the microbiota and immune system are believed to mature in tandem. With age, immune function declines and susceptibility to respiratory infection increases. Whether these changes contribute to the microbial composition of the respiratory tract is unknown. OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to determine whether the microbes of the upper respiratory tract differ between mid-aged adults (18-40 yr) and the elderly (>65 yr). METHODS: Microbiomes of the anterior nares and oropharynx of elderly individuals were evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These communities were compared with data on mid-aged adults obtained from the Human Microbiome Project. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The microbiota of the elderly showed no associations with sex, comorbidities, residence, or vaccinations. Comparisons of mid-aged adults and the elderly demonstrated significant differences in the composition of the anterior nares and oropharynx, including a population in the anterior nares of the elderly that more closely resembled the oropharynx than the anterior nares of adults. The elderly oropharyngeal microbiota were characterized by increased abundance of streptococci, specifically, Streptococcus salivarius group species, but not Streptococcus pneumoniae, carriage of which was low (<3% of participants), as demonstrated by PCR (n = 4/123). CONCLUSIONS: Microbial populations of the upper respiratory tract in mid-aged adults and the elderly differ; it is possible that these differences contribute to the increased risk of respiratory infections experienced by the elderly.
TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. VGS are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (AR). Laboratory examination of the colonising VGS species may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the AR reservoir in this population. Freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. constellatus, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S. vestibularis. The most frequent VGS organisms isolated was S. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by S. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), S. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), S. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), S. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), S. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), S. australis (3/363; 0.8%), S. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), S. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and S. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). All patients examined carried at least one VGS organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of VGS species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different VGS species, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. Overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime, with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). Antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. S. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all VGS species examined (S. vestibularis v S. salivarius p=0.011), followed by S. anginosis. S. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible VGS species examined. Overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. However, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. In conclusion, these data indicate that VGS colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible S. salivarius.
TI  - Spontaneous meningitis due to Streptococcus salivarius subsp. salivarius: cross-reaction in an assay with a rapid diagnostic kit that detected Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. salivarius occasionally causes meningitis associated with iatrogenic or traumatic events. We herein describe a case of meningitis caused by this organism in a patient without any apparent risk factors. In an assay of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid, cross-reaction occurred with Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen-coated latex particles in the Pastorex Meningitis Kit. In the in vitro assays, three of the five clinically isolated S. salivarius strains showed cross-reactions with the kit, indicating that these strains expressed pneumococcal antigen-like antigens. This case shows that meningitis caused by S. salivarius can occur spontaneously and it may sometimes be misdiagnosed as S. pneumoniae infection.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Endocarditis in adults with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endocarditis may precede or complicate bacterial meningitis, but the  incidence and impact of endocarditis in bacterial meningitis are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with meningitis and endocarditis from a nationwide cohort study of adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands from 2006 to 2012. Endocarditis was identified in 24 of 1025 episodes (2%) of bacterial meningitis. Cultures yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae in 13 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients, and Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius in 1 patient each. Clues leading to the diagnosis of endocarditis were cardiac murmurs, persistent or recurrent fever, a history of heart valve disease, and S aureus as the causative pathogen of bacterial meningitis. Treatment consisted of prolonged antibiotic therapy in all patients and surgical valve replacement in 10 patients (42%). Two patients were treated with oral anticoagulants, and both developed life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage. Systemic (70%) and neurological (54%) complications occurred frequently, leading to a high proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome (63%). Seven of 24 patients (29%) with meningitis and endocarditis died. CONCLUSIONS: Endocarditis is an uncommon coexisting condition in bacterial meningitis but is associated with a high rate of unfavorable outcome.
TI  - Insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (HTP) family in Streptococcus.
AB  - The Histidine Triad Proteins (HTPs), also known as Pht proteins in Streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. Although many studies have revealed the importance of HTPs in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. In this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. By further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. First, htp genes originated earlier than the Streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the Bovis, Mutans and Salivarius groups. Second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of Streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. Third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp I and htp II. Although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in Streptococcus suis, htp II members are distinct from htp I due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the C-terminus. Finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. Specifically, the regions outside the HTP domains are under strong positive selection. This distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped Streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.
TI  - Occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  - The distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD, in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. ZmpB was ubiquitous in the Mitis and Salivarius groups of the genus Streptococcus and in the genera Gemella and Granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. IgA1 protease activity was observed in all members of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. oralis, S. sanguinis, and Gemella haemolysans, was variably present in S. mitis and S. infantis, and absent in S. gordonii, S. parasanguinis, S. cristatus, S. oligofermentans, S. australis, S. peroris, and S. suis. Phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpB, and zmpD genes in S. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. Presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. The widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpB, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. IMPORTANCE: The paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study maps the presence of the corresponding genes and enzyme activities in S. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera Streptococcus, Gemella, and Granulicatella. The distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpB is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. The ZmpB protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the Mitis and Salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. The relative sequence diversification of the IgA1 protease, ZmpB, and ZmpD is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen S. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.
TI  - UV-C-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  - AIM: Previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. LED curing lights (315-400 nm) and other UV lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. We examined the effect of UV-C light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy UV-A light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. METHODS: Twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus australis, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis. These organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal UV-C radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before UV-C exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal UV-C exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to UV-C light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. Given that UV-C is more toxic and mutagenic than UV-A light, it is unlikely than UV-A light would yield any difference in response to such exposure.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing oral streptococci and inhibition of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The use of bacteria as probiotics is in continuous development, thanks to their capacity to maintain or restore a host's natural microbiome by interference with and/or inhibition of other microorganisms mediated by antimicrobial peptide production such as bacteriocins. In the oral cavity, Streptococcus salivarius, a non-pathogenic and predominant oral species, is one of the major bacteriocin producers that is able to coexist in this environment and reduce the frequency of colonization of the main pathogens involved in upper respiratory tract infections. The aim of this study was to screen oral bacteria colonizing healthy children for their use as potential oral probiotics. Eighty-one alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from nasal and/or pharyngeal swabs of 31 healthy children aged between two and twelve years were isolated. Among them, 13 alpha-hemolytic streptococci were selected for their bacteriocin-like inhibitory activity against potential pathogens. These strains were tested for bacteriocin production and assayed for their capacity to adhere to HEp-2 cell lines. Our data showed that 13 bacteriocin producer strains were able to inhibit different gram-positive pathogens. Among them one strain, S. salivarius 24SMB, deposited as DSM 23307, was selected as a potential oral probiotic, thanks to its safety assessment, ability to inhibit Streptococcus pneumoniae and the absence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes.
TI  - Salivaricin D, a novel intrinsically trypsin-resistant lantibiotic from Streptococcus salivarius 5M6c isolated from a healthy infant.
AB  - In this work, we purified and characterized a newly identified lantibiotic (salivaricin D) from Streptococcus salivarius 5M6c. Salivaricin D is a 34-amino-acid-residue peptide (3,467.55 Da); the locus of the gene encoding this peptide is a 16.5-kb DNA segment which contains genes encoding the precursor of two lantibiotics, two modification enzymes (dehydratase and cyclase), an ABC transporter, a serine-like protease, immunity proteins (lipoprotein and ABC transporters), a response regulator, and a sensor histidine kinase. The immunity gene (salI) was heterologously expressed in a sensitive indicator and provided significant protection against salivaricin D, confirming its immunity function. Salivaricin D is a naturally trypsin-resistant lantibiotic that is similar to nisin-like lantibiotics. It is a relatively broad-spectrum bacteriocin that inhibits members of many genera of Gram-positive bacteria, including the important human pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Thus, Streptococcus salivarius 5M6c may be a potential biological agent for the control of oronasopharynx-colonizing streptococcal pathogens or may be used as a probiotic bacterium.
TI  - Molecular characterisation of the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR)  of the parC gene locus in viridans-group streptococci.
AB  - Forty-eight isolates of viridans-group streptococci (VGS) from adults and children in the community are examined for their resistance to ciprofloxacin phenotypically by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In addition, the parC gene locus is amplified and sequenced in all isolates and mutations noted. Overall, 44 VGS organisms were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin by the broth microdilution method, and the remaining four strains had intermediate susceptibility. Reduced MICs were observed with intermediate strains when reserpine was added to the broth, inhibiting any efflux activity. Overall, the effect of adding reserpine to the broth medium was to add one doubling dilution to the MIC in the case of Streptococcus mitis, S. oralis and S. salivarius, as well as to increase the MIC by two doubling dilutions in two of the three S. parasanguinis isolates. Amino acid sequence analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) of the parC gene locus showed good correlation to the phenotypic resistance to ciprofloxacin, where no confirmed mutation conferring quinolone resistance was found. Eleven amino acid positions showed discordance with S. pneumoniae R6 and eight (S52, F55, S58, N91, E135, K137, F141 and S167) were common in the VGS species examined. In addition, minor substitutions were found at three positions (D51, T54 and V86). In conclusion, this study demonstrates the low occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance in a population of VGS isolated from the community. In addition, several silent mutations were noted in VGS organisms without any increase in MIC against ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci in viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. However, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways has not yet been examined. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (VGS), in terms of MICs and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs). METHODS: The MICs of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the QRDRs for 190 isolates of VGS, originating from the sputa of adult CF patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. VGS organisms included Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus australis and Streptococcus mutans. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and QRDRs within the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs >/=8 mg/L) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (MICs 4 mg/L). As a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive VGS organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-CF patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. Five novel QRDR PCR assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the CF VGS population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential QRDR resistance mutations. Double mutations in gyrA and parC/parE led to MICs of 16 to >64 mg/L, while single mutations in parC or parE resulted in MICs of 8-32 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively. The mean homologies of each species to Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 were: gyrA, 70.3%-95%; gyrB, 69.6%-96.2%; parC, 76.1%-94.8%; and parE, 70.7%-94.7%. The close relatives of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis and S. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of P. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with CF may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal VGS flora, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the Streptococcus milleri group.
TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) including Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult CF patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 12 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. cristatus, S. gordonii, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. pneumoniae, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis. The most frequently VGS organism isolated was S. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by S. mitis (36/190; 19%), S. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), S. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), S. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), S. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), S. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), S. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), S. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), S. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), S. australis (1/190; 0.5%), S. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and S. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). All, but four, patients harboured at least one VGS species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. There was no clonality at the subspecies level employing ERIC RAPD PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Overall, resistance to penicillin with all VGS was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. With regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. In addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-CF population comprising 12 individuals (50 VGS isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. In comparison, 8% and 38% of VGS isolates from non-CF individuals were resistant by disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. None of the non-CF VGS organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.
TI  - [Classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  - Viridans group streptococci (VGS) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. They reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. They can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. The diagnosis of VGS are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. Viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (Sanguinis, Mitis, Mutans, Salivarius, Anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16S rRNA sequencing. Since Streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the Mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. Genetic exchange between Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis and S.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. These mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. The cultivation of VGS usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. Observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. VGS are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. The last step in the laboratory diagnosis of VGS is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. In this review article, classification of VGS, similarities between S.pneumoniae and Mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of VGS have been discussed.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(B) and mef(A)] in Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within CF airways has not yet been examined. We therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. METHODS: Erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (VGS) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and VGS [n = 84; i.e. Streptococcus salivarius (n = 30), Streptococcus mitis (n = 17), Streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), Streptococcus oralis (n = 10), Streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), Streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), Streptococcus infantis (n = 3), Streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), Streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and Streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult CF patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for at least the previous 7 months. RESULTS: Almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. The majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(B) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(A) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(E) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(B) and mef(E) genes simultaneously in 11/99 (11.1%). These results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in VGS in adult CF patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with azithromycin in CF patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal VGS, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.
TI  - Rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  - Rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1H-xanthene-1,3(2H)-di-one] from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Aiton) Hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius. Especially noteworthy was the activity against MRSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. As shown for S. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8MBC and 4MBC concentrations, respectively. Rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. A rhodomyrtone killing test with S. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. Taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant nonhemolytic Streptococci on the basis of sequence analysis of 16S-23S intergenic spacer region and partial gdh gene.
AB  - Nonhemolytic streptococci (NHS) cause serious infections, such as endocarditis and septicemia. Many conventional phenotypic methods are insufficient for the identification of bacteria in this group to the species level. Genetic analysis has revealed that single-gene analysis is insufficient for the identification of all species in this group of bacteria. The aim of the present study was to establish a method based on sequence analysis of the 16S-23S intergenic spacer (ITS) region and the partial gdh gene to identify clinical relevant NHS to the species level. Sequence analysis of the ITS region was performed with 57 NHS reference or clinical strains. Satisfactory identification to the species level was achieved for 14/19 NHS species included in this study on the basis of sequence analysis of the ITS region. Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus vestibularis obtained the expected taxon as the best taxon match, but there was a short maximum score distance to the next best match (distance, <10). Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae could not be unambiguously discriminated by sequence analysis of the ITS region, as was also proven by phylogenetic analysis. These five species could be identified to the group level only by ITS sequence analysis. Partial gdh sequence analysis was applied to the 11 S. oralis strains, the 11 S. mitis strains, and the 17 S. pneumoniae strains. All except one strain achieved a satisfactory identification to the species level. A phylogenetic algorithm based on the analysis of partial gdh gene sequences revealed three distinct clusters. We suggest that sequence analysis of the combination of the ITS region and the partial gdh gene can be used in the reference laboratory for the species-level identification of NHS.
TI  - Conjugal mobilization of the mega element carrying mef(E) from Streptococcus salivarius to Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - We report the isolation and characterization of an unusual strain of Streptococcus salivarius, 3C30, displaying both the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B and the tetracycline resistance phenotypes. It harbours the mef(E), erm(B), and tet(M) genes carried by different genetic elements. The genetic element carrying mef(E), named mega, was investigated by long PCR and sequencing, while the presence of the Tn3872-like element, carrying tet(M) and erm(B), was demonstrated by sequencing of both the int-xis-Tn and the fragment between the two resistance genes. In strain 3C30 the mega element is 5388 bp in size and its nucleotide sequence is identical to that of the element described previously in S. salivarius, with the exception of a 912 bp deletion at the left end. The composite Tn3872-like element appeared to be nonconjugative while the mega element was transferred by conjugation to Streptococcus pneumoniae. It was, however, impossible to transfer it again from these transconjugants to other strains. In addition, only in the 3C30 strain did mega form circular structures, as identified by real-time PCR. In conclusion, we found a clinical strain of S. salivarius carrying both mega and Tn3872-like genetic elements. Mega is transferable by conjugation to S. pneumoniae but it is not transferable again from the transconjugants, suggesting a possible mobilization by recombinases of the coresident Tn3872-like transposon.
TI  - Purification of bacteriocin LS1 produced by human oral isolate Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, and Salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. The objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named LS1, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1. METHODS: A simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. RESULTS: The supernatant of L. salivarius BGHO1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. Its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees C in an autoclave. Bacteriocin LS1 was purified to homogeneity. The molecular mass of bacteriocin LS1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. During purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by L. salivarius BGHO1, was detected. The molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kDa, based on tricine SDS-PAGE. CONCLUSION: Our results imply that LS1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by L. salivarius strains. The purification of bacteriocin LS1 enabled the further characterization of LS1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - [Biological activity tests of chemical constituents from two Brazilian Labiatae plants].
AB  - We studied the bioactivities of constituents from two tropical medicinal plants,  Cunila spicata and Hyptis fasciculata. These plants found in Brazil belong to the Labiatae family. Four known compounds obtained from these herbs were identified as 3alpha, 24-dihydoxylurs-12-en-28-oic acid, betulinic acid, aurantiamide acetate, and aurantiamide benzoate by spectroscopic means. 3alpha, 24-Dihydoxylurs-12-en-28-oic acid has potent inhibitory activity against Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Porphyromomas gingivalis. Aurantiamide benzoate exhibited moderate inhibitory activity against xanthine oxidase. It was clarified that herbs Cunila spicata and Hyptis fasciculata are effective against bronchitis and gout.
TI  - Identification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by pyrosequencing the 16S rRNA gene and by use of VITEK 2.
AB  - Alpha-hemolytic streptococci are very difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. In this study, a pyrosequencing method for the identification of streptococcal species based on two variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene is described. Almost all studied streptococcal species (n = 51) represented by their type strains could be differentiated except for some closely related species of the Streptococcus bovis or S. salivarius group. The pyrosequencing results of alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood (n = 99) or from the normal pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results obtained by the VITEK 2 with GP card (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). As expected, the results of the two methods did not completely agree, but 93 (75.0%) of the isolates assigned to the same streptococcal group by both methods and 57 (46.0%) reached consistent results at the species level. However, 10 strains remained unidentified by VITEK 2, and 4 isolates could not be assigned to any streptococcal group by pyrosequencing. Identification of members of the S. mitis and S. sanguinis groups proved difficult for both methods. Furthermore, the pyrosequencing analysis revealed great sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of the 133 isolates analyzed by pyrosequencing had sequences identical to a type strain. The variation was greatest in the pharyngeal isolates, slightly lower in the blood culture isolates, and nonexistent in invasive pneumococcal isolates (n = 17) that all had the S. pneumoniae type strain sequence. The resolution of the results obtained by the two methods is impeded by the lack of a proper gold standard.
TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae thoracic empyema in children: rapid diagnosis by using the Binax NOW immunochromatographic membrane test in pleural fluids.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate an immunochromatographic membrane test for Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen (Binax NOW, Inverness medical France) applied to pleural fluid samples. METHODS: Binax NOW was applied to the pleural fluids of 69 children with thoracic empyema, in comparison with conventional culture and molecular techniques. RESULTS: Binax NOW was positive on all 15 pleural fluid samples that yielded S. pneumoniae in culture, on two samples that yielded S. oralis and S. salivarius in culture and on 34 culture-negative samples. Fifteen of these 34 culture-negative samples were retrospectively tested by PCR methods, and 14 were shown to contain S. pneumoniae DNA. Thus, S. pneumoniae was identified by culture in 22% of samples and by Binax NOW in 69% of samples. CONCLUSION: Binax NOW may thus be useful for rapid diagnosis of S. pneumoniae thoracic empyema.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently FDA-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 Streptococcus mitis species group, 12 S. mutans species group, 9 S. anginosus species group, 8 S. sanguinis species group, 5 S. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual Gram-positive bacteria: 3 Listeria monocytogenes, 4 Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 Corynebacterium species, 10 Abiotrophia/Granulicatella species, 2 Rothia (Stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 Gemella morbillorum. Daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and Enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. The daptomycin MIC range for the unusual Gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. We conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types of unusual Gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  - Viridans streptococci (VS) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. Many species of VS are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. An oligonucleotide array based on 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer (ITS) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant VS. These 11 species were Streptococcus anginosus, S. constellatus, S. gordonii, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis, and S. uberis. The method consisted of PCR amplification of the ITS regions by using a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled PCR products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. After 120 strains of the 11 species of VG and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. S. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of S. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate S. pneumoniae from S. mitis. In conclusion, identification of species of VS by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of VS.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Streptococcus sinensis may react with Lancefield group F antiserum.
AB  - Lancefield group F streptococci have been found almost exclusively as members of  the 'Streptococcus milleri' group, although they have been reported very occasionally in some other streptococcal species. Among 302 patients with bacteraemia caused by viridans streptococci over a 6-year period, three cases were caused by Streptococcus sinensis (type strain HKU4T, HKU5 and HKU6). All three patients had infective endocarditis complicating their underlying chronic rheumatic heart diseases. Gene sequencing showed no base differences between the 16S rRNA gene sequences of HKU5 and HKU6 and that of HKU4T. All three strains were Gram-positive, non-spore-forming cocci arranged in chains. All grew on sheep blood agar as alpha-haemolytic, grey colonies of 0.5-1 mm in diameter after 24 h incubation at 37 degrees C in ambient air. Lancefield grouping revealed that HKU5 and HKU6 were Lancefield group F, but HKU4T was non-groupable with Lancefield groups A, B, C, D, F or G antisera. HKU4T was identified by the Vitek system (GPI), API system (20 STREP) and ATB system (ID32 STREP) as 99 % Streptococcus intermedius, 51.3 % S. intermedius and 99.9 % Streptococcus anginosus, respectively. Using the same tests, HKU5 was identified as 87 % Streptococcus sanguinis/Streptococcus gordonii, 59 % Streptococcus salivarius and 99.6 % S. anginosus, respectively, and HKU6 as 87 % S. sanguinis/S. gordonii, 77 % Streptococcus pneumoniae and 98.3 % S. anginosus, respectively. The present data revealed that a proportion of Lancefield group F streptococci could be S. sinensis. Lancefield group F streptococci should not be automatically reported as 'S. milleri'.
TI  - Bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) production by the normal flora of the nasopharynx: potential to protect against otitis media?
AB  - The normal bacterial flora of the upper airways provides an important barrier to  invading pathogens. This study investigated the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) by streptococci isolated from the nasopharyngeal flora of children who either do or do not experience recurrent acute otitis media (AOM). Twenty children with recurrent AOM and 15 controls were tested. Swabs from the nasopharynx were evaluated for streptococci having BLIS activity against two representative strains of each of the AOM pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Streptococci displaying strong BLIS activity were characterized further and tested for known streptococcal bacteriocin structural genes. Sixty-five per cent of children had nasopharyngeal streptococcal isolates that were inhibitory to strains of one or more of the AOM pathogens. Six children (17 %) had streptococci that demonstrated strong BLIS activity against strains of at least three of the pathogenic species. Three of these inhibitory isolates were Streptococcus salivarius, two were S. pneumoniae and one was S. pyogenes. The inhibitory S. salivarius and S. pyogenes were shown to have structural genes for known streptococcal bacteriocins. No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups of children with respect to the presence of inhibitory streptococci in their nasopharyngeal floras. The finding of S. salivarius with strong inhibitory activity against several AOM pathogens in the nasopharyngeal flora of children is unique. Although there is no clear evidence from the present study that these organisms protect against AOM, their low pathogenicity and strong in-vitro BLIS production capability indicate that they should be incorporated in future trials of bacteriotherapy for recurrent AOM.
TI  - Inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral Streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (KTmAb) and recombinant (KTscFv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. KTmAb and KTscFv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. Effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and S. mutans in particular. In this study, the activity of KTmAb and KTscFv against S. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by KTmAb of dental colonization by S. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KTscFv and KTmAb were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay against a serotype C strain of S. mutans, and other oral streptococci (S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. salivarius). An ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish KTmAb potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by S. mutans and other oral streptococci. RESULTS: KTmAb and KTscFv kill in vitro S. mutans and other oral streptococci. KTmAb inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by S. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: Killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.
TI  - The macrolide efflux genetic assembly of Streptococcus pneumoniae is present in erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus salivarius.

TI  - Establishment of streptococci in the upper respiratory tract: longitudinal changes in the mouth and nasopharynx up to 2 years of age.
AB  - As part of a series of longitudinal studies on the development of the indigenous  microflora of the upper respiratory tract, the establishment of streptococci in the oral cavity and nasopharynx and IgA1 protease production by the early streptococcal flora was examined in 50 healthy Caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. In the oral cavity, streptococci were found in all infants on every sampling occasion, Streptococcus mitis biovar 1 being the main finding in each age group. S. salivarius and S. mitis biovar 2 reached their highest prevalence during the first year of life, whereas the prevalence of S. oralis and S. sanguis showed no significant increase before 12 months of age. Salivary streptococci mainly consisted of the above-mentioned species during the follow-up period. In contrast to the oral cavity, no stable colonisation pattern was observed for viridans streptococci in the nasopharynx. S. mitis biovar 1 and S. pneumoniae, a traditional respiratory pathogen, were the principal streptococcal species among nasopharyngeal isolates. IgA1 protease production by early streptococci was common in infancy. Among the oral streptococcal microflora, S. mitis biovar 1 (especially during the first year of life) and S. oralis and S. sanguis constituted the main species responsible for this enzyme activity. In the nasopharynx, IgA1 protease was produced by S. mitis biovar 1, S. oralis and S. pneumoniae. In conclusion, streptococcal colonisation differs in these two close habitats in the upper respiratory tract.
TI  - [Streptococcus salivarius meningitis after oral trauma by a skewer: a case report].
AB  - Although Streptococcus salivarius is one of the normal flora in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract, the agent may cause bacteremia, meningitis, endocarditis and sinusitis under certain circumstances. We report a 3-year-old female with meningitis after oral trauma by a skewer due to penicillin resistant S. salivarius. The girl injured her throat accidentally with a skewer. Four hours later, she became febrile and came to our emergency room. Plain CT scan was normal, and cefalexin was prescribed. The next day, she had fever, lethargy, meningeal signs, and her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed neutrophilic pleocytosis. The blood culture was negative, but the CSF culture was positive for S. salivarius. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for panipenem, penicillin G, ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, vancomycin were 0.125 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml, 2 micrograms/ml, 0.5 microgram/ml, 0.5 microgram/ml, 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Intravenous administration of panipenem betamiprom (PAPM/BP) 2 g/day for 7 days and 8 courses of dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg/dose were effective, and she has had no apparent sequelae except for a slight abnormality in her electroencephalogram. Traumatic meningitis is often caused by S. pneumoniae, but may be also caused by the normal flora pathogens including S. salivarius. In addition, our case suggests that not only S. pneumoniae but also S. salivarius can be penicillin resistant. Taking the drug resistance into consideration, we have to be careful in choosing antibiotics for treating such patients.
TI  - Ecological effects on the oro- and nasopharyngeal microflora in children after treatment of acute otitis media with cefuroxime axetil or amoxycillin-clavulanate as suspensions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if the extent of normal microflora disturbances differed between treatment with amoxycillin-clavulanate administered in an active form and cefuroxime axetil administered as an inactive prodrug. METHODS: Twenty-eight children, 0.5-5 years old, diagnosed with acute otitis media (AOM), were treated with either amoxycillin-clavulanate (13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily) or cefuroxime axetil (15 mg/kg twice daily) for 7 days. Saliva samples and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected before, directly after and 2 weeks after treatment. The saliva samples were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed and the nasopharyngeal swabs were qualitatively analyzed. All isolated strains were tested for beta-lactamase production. RESULTS: Both treatment regimens gave rise to similar alterations of the normal oropharyngeal microflora. In both groups, the amount of Streptococcus salivarius was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The most common causative pathogens of acute otitis were S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. On the day of enrollment, approximately half of the patients, in both groups, were infected with more than one pathogen. The rate of infection or colonization with more than one potential pathogen was low on day 7 but recurred 2 weeks after treatment to similar levels as on day 0. The total number of patients with reinfection, recolonization or recurrence of pathogens on day 21 was 11/12 in the amoxycillin-clavulanate group and 4/7 in the cefuroxime axetil group. The most common beta-lactamase producer was M. catarrhalis. CONCLUSION: The local high concentration of antibiotics in the oropharynx immediately after intake of antibiotic suspensions seem to have little or no impact on the extent of disturbance of the microflora in this region. Children of this age group seem prone to either reinfection, recolonization or persistence of pathogens within 2 weeks after treatment. Furthermore, co-infection with more than one pathogen seems common in children with AOM and infection with beta-lactamase producing microorganisms occurs frequently.
TI  - [Effect of bioceramics on biological activity of microorganisms].
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Biomaterials that come into contact with microorganisms in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses should be tested before clinical application. Thus, it is necessary to test the influence exerted on bacterial growth by biomaterials used as bone substitutes in head and neck surgery before implantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, Bioverit, Al2O3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. RESULTS: In the suspension test, all gram-negative species were inhibited, but gram-positive microorganisms and Candida albicans were not affected. The Al2O3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. Streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. In contrast, Bioverit and Al2O3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we think that Bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.
TI  - Mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of RNase B and subsequent utilization of released mannose. RNase B is an excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. Mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. None of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or Streptococcus peroris and Streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the Man(5) glycan alone was degraded while Man(6) to Man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in Man(5), remained intact. Investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone- or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation of the Man(5) glycan of RNase B. No species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the Streptococcus anginosus, S. gordonii, and S. intermedius species. The data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.
TI  - The galU gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae that codes for a UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is highly polymorphic and suitable for molecular typing and phylogenetic studies.
AB  - The enzyme UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, UDPG:PP) is synthesized by practically all organisms, although prokaryotic UDPG:PPs are evolutionarily unrelated to the eukaryotic counterparts. The primary structure of prokaryotic UDPG:PPs is well conserved, although little information exists on the polymorphism of the genes coding for these enzymes. It has been reported that the galU gene encoding the Streptococcus pneumoniae UDPG:PP is absolutely required for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide, a sine qua non prerequisite for virulence. A 594 bp fragment covering 66% of the galU gene from 37 pneumococcal isolates and the type strains of Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sobrinus has been amplified by PCR and sequenced. Up to 21 different alleles were found in S. pneumoniae. They possess a mosaic-like structure and belong to, at least, two evolutionarily distinct families that show a sequence divergence of 15-20%. In spite of its marked polymorphism, phylogenetic relationships among pneumococcal strains deduced from the galU gene matched those previously established by using alternative approaches. Comparison of the pneumococcal galU alleles with those from other streptococci indicated the existence of a complex network of genetic interchange. The galU gene represents an informative marker to be used alone or in conjunction with other molecular typing methods.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
TI  - [Phenotypes of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin resistant Streptococcus  viridans isolated from blood].
AB  - Macrolide resistance has been widely studied in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae although not in viridans group streptococci (VGS). We studied 30 blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci (25 resistant to erythromycin: 10 S. mitis, 8 S. milleri, 6 S. sanguis and 1 S. salivarius; and 5 susceptible: 2 S. mitis, 2 S. milleri and 1 S. sanguis). We carried out a double-disk test and determined MICs. The susceptibility testing was carried out by agar dilution for 14-, 15- and 16-member lactone ring macrolides, as well as for clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Fifty-six percent of the erithromycin-resistant strains (6 S. mitis, 6 S. milleri and 2 S. sanguis) showed an MLS(B) phenotype, with a high level of intrinsic resistance to all the macrolides studied and clindomycin; 28&#37; were of the M phenotype (4 S. sanguis, 2 S. mitis and 1 S. salivarius). We found a third resistance phenotype, which was present in 4 strains with MICs of 2-8 microg/ml, with resistance to macrolides and different degrees of resistance to clindamycin. All isolates were fully susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. The MLS(B) and M phenotypes initially described in S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae are also observed in VGS.
TI  - [Different phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant blood isolates in viridans group  streptococci]
AB  - Macrolide resistance has been widely studied in Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae although not in viridans group streptococci (VGS). We studied 30 blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci (25 resistant to erythromycin: 10 S. mitis, 8 S. milleri, 6 S. sanguis and 1 S. salivarius; and 5 susceptible: 2 S. mitis, 2 S. milleri and 1 S. sanguis).

TI  - The gene encoding IIAB(Man)L in Streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  - Glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic IIAB protein, called IIAB(Man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. This paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the specific components of the mannose-PTS of Streptococcus salivarius. The man operon was composed of four genes, manL, manM, manN and manO. These genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (Pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mRNA that contained a 5'-UTR (untranslated region). The predicted manL gene product encoded a 35.5 kDa protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the IIA and IIB phosphorylation sites already determined from purified S. salivarius IIAB(Man)L. Expression of manL in Escherichia coli generated a 35 kDa protein that reacted with anti-IIAB(Man)L antibodies. The predicted ManM protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kDa. ManM had similarity with IIC domains of the mannose-EII family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-IIC proteins from Gram-negative bacteria. From multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified IIC(Man) signature is proposed: GX3G[DNH]X3G[LIVM]2XG2[STL][LT][EQ]. The deduced product of manN was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kDa. The ManN protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the IID domains of the mannose-EII family. manO encoded a 13.7 kDa protein. This gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mRNA from a promoter located in the manN-manO intergenic region. A search of current databases revealed the presence of IIAB(Man)L, ManM, ManN and ManO orthologues in Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. This work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose PTS in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (ManO) within the man operon.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  - The utility of PCR analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tDNA-ILP) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15 species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rRNA homology groups. PCR products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tDNA primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and by laser fluorescence scanning. Eleven species showed specific and distinct tDNA patterns: Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus criceti and Streptococcus ratti. Indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius on the other. S. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing S. mitis biovar 1 and two S. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with S. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. These results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that S. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. In conclusion, PCR analysis of tDNA-ILP holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.
TI  - CtsR, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - clpP and clpC of Bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the Clp ATP-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. They play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the so-called class III group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. The product of ctsR, the first gene of the clpC operon, has now been shown to act as a repressor of both clpP and clpC, as well as clpE, which encodes a novel member of the Hsp100 Clp ATPase family. The CtsR protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. Random mutagenesis, DNasel footprinting and DNA sequence deletions and comparisons were used to define a consensus CtsR recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. This target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus salivarius, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Leuconostoc oenos, Lactobacillus sake, Lactococcus lactis and Clostridium acetobutylicum. CtsR homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by CtsR is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Effect of radiotherapy on the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A against indigenous and virulent streptococci.
AB  - It is well known that the frequency of upper respiratory infection is clinically  increased after radiotherapy of the head and neck region. This study found higher antibacterial secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) activity against three indigenous streptococci (Streptococcus mitis, S. salivarius, and S. sanguis I) and S. pneumoniae in patients who had undergone radiation therapy of the head and neck region than in control subjects. This showed no relation to the extent of the radiation field. Compared with before radiotherapy, the S-IgA titer against S. pneumoniae and its ratio to the activities against the indigenous streptococci were significantly higher in patients with fully irradiated major salivary glands. These results indicated that the radiotherapy promoted the antigen-specific S-IgA production of virulent streptococci in most patients with head and neck cancer, even more than 6 months after radiotherapy. The resulting altered balance in the S-IgA system of normal indigenous streptococci may also impair the ability to maintain the stable bacterial interference between normal indigenous and virulent streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavity.
TI  - The cpsABCDE genes involved in polysaccharide production in Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus strain NCBF 2393.
AB  - A 4074-bp EcoRI fragment of Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (S. thermophilus) chromosomal DNA containing genes involved in exocellular polysaccharide (EPS) was identified and cloned. The nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined and found to contain one partial and four complete open reading frames. These were designated cpsA, cpsB, cpsC, cpsD and cpsE and encoded proteins of > 130, 243, 230, 246 and 455 amino acids, respectively, that showed homology with the genes of the cps cluster, involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis, in Streptococcus pneumoniae Type 19F. The cpsA gene is predicted to encode a transcriptional regulator, while cpsC and cpsD are predicted to encode proteins involved in polysaccharide polymerization and export. The cpsE gene is likely to encode the phosphate-prenyl glycosyl-1-phosphate transferase catalyzing the first step in polysaccharide biosynthesis in S. thermophilus. Southern blot analysis revealed that cpsE is found only in polysaccharide producing strains of S. thermophilus.
TI  - Determination of 16S rRNA sequences of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and phylogenetic relationships among members of the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - We determined the 16S rRNA sequences of the type strains of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus gordonii and calculated the phylogenetic distances between those organisms and other members of the genus Streptococcus. The viridans group streptococci were separated into five phylogenetic groups; we named these groups the anginosus group, the mitis group, the salivarius group, the bovis group, and the mutans group. S. mitis and S. gordonii clustered in the mitis group together with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus parasanguis at levels of sequence homology of more than 96%. Within this group, S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. pneumoniae exhibited more than 99% sequence homology with each other, although the DNA-DNA similarity values for their total chromosome DNAs were less than 60%.
TI  - Definition of a fundamental repeating unit in streptococcal glucosyltransferase glucan-binding regions and related sequences.
AB  - The C-termini of the glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) of oral streptococci are responsible for glucan binding. These glucan-binding domains (GBDs) are composed of a series of repeated sequences that have been classified into four different classes (A-D) by virtue of sequence similarity and which, by inference, have been suggested to be of functional importance. In contrast, we propose that repeat sequences evolve in response to selection for an increase in the number of copies of a particular domain through multiple duplication events occurring at different times. According to this hypothesis, repeats should possess various degrees of similarity, especially if only key residues are of functional importance. Analysis of the GBDs of the Gtfs indicated that a common fundamental repeat, designated the "YG" repeat, could be discerned within the "A", "B", "C", and "D" repeats. Similar elements were also conserved in the ligand-binding repeats of the Clostridium difficile toxins and the lysins and the PspA protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting that similar selective pressures had also been imposed on these sequences. Analysis of the "YG" repeats present in the GtfJ and GtfK of Streptococcus salivarius indicated that some of the "YG" repeats in the GBDs of these proteins had arisen as a result of duplication events involving a series of three sequential "YG" repeats.
TI  - Gram-positive cocci isolated from slaughtered poultry.
AB  - Gram-positive cocci were found in all meat samples of poultry slaughtered and processed for retail sale, at incidence rates ranging from 10(2) CFU/ml to 1.35 x 10(6) CFU/ml and a mode between 8 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(5) CFU/ml for 75% of the samples. The 93 isolated strains were identified as belonging to the following species: Enterococcus faecalis (48 strains), E. faecium (16), E. avium (7), E. durans (4), Aerococcus viridans (10), Streptococcus morbillorum (2), S. salivarius (1), S. sanguis (1), S. "milleri" (1), S. pneumoniae (1), S. acidominimus (1), and Gemella haemolysans (1). These species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. Their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). A count of the Gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.
TI  - Role of serum antibodies to streptococci in patients with IgA nephropathy.
AB  - Serum antibodies to whole cells of streptococci and serum immune complexes were investigated in patients with IgA nephropathy accompanied by tonsillitis and in healthy adult controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum IgA levels to Streptococcus salivarius, S. sanguis I and S. pneumoniae were higher in patients with IgA nephropathy than in healthy controls. The levels of IgG to S. pyogenes T12, S. gordonii and S. sanguis II in patients with IgA nephropathy were also higher than in healthy controls. Serum immune complexes of IgG and IgA were higher in patients with IgA nephropathy than in healthy controls. Serum levels of IgA to some strains of streptococci tended to correlate with the level of IgA immune complex in both patients and healthy controls. These results suggest that antibodies to some strains of streptococci play a role in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy.
TI  - [Significance of normal oral flora, particularly group oral streptococci as defense mechanism against infection in healthy individuals (normal defense mechanism by oral Streptococcus group)].
AB  - The alpha-streptococci, consisted of normal oral flora mainly, with inhibitory activity against pathogenic microbes in healthy individuals was investigated by group A Streptococcus (indicator strain 6-22 nonmucoid T-12). Rate of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against group A Streptococcus was increased as aging, and the rate in pre-school children was higher than that in school children. These results suggested that more than 90% of the tested alpha-streptococci with strong inhibitory activities (S. salivarius) against indicator strain had inhibitory activities against group A Streptococcus (mucoid T-6), H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, group C Streptococcus, and from 40% to 70% of the tested strains had also inhibitory activities against other pathogens. As there were many strains of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activities against pathogens, that usually detected in the upper respiratory infection, the problem on the strains in the future will explain significance of the defense mechanism against upper respiratory infection and this can be applied clinically.
TI  - [The effect of biomaterials and other industrial materials on the growth of several aerobic bacterial species in vitro].
AB  - The article deals with interactions between bio-vitro-materials and bacteria species in vitro. The growth of S. aureus, Sc. salivarius, E. coli and Ps. aeruginosa in a salt solution with and without addition of biomaterials was examined until the day 60 in a static culture. By counting the cfu/ml and determination the relative change of germ capacity the results were compared. The data of such series obtained with working materials of similar chemical composition were collected and evaluated. We found, that Ps. aeruginosa was promoted in growth by all materials, especially those, which contained carbon. The same can be said about the last materials and E. coli. In contrast as well Ca- and P-containing as--free biomaterials reduced the numbers of germs. Changes of multiplying of S. aureus and Sc. salivarius seldom were observed. It ist apparent, that the biomaterials tested are not indifferent against a few germs, which may cause infections, but they promote the growth of a few species in vitro. This may favour an infection, if such materials should be implanted. It is proposed to test biomaterials microbiologically before clinical application. Materials with indifferent behavior or low anti-microbiological effect have to be favoured.
TI  - Oral ofloxacin therapy for lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - We made an open, noncomparative evaluation of ofloxacin, 400 mg orally bid for 10 days, in 98 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia or pathogen-confirmed bronchitis. Thirty-nine (40%) of the subjects were treated in the hospital and 59 (60%) were treated as outpatients. The mean age of those treated was 56.2 years; 73 (74%) of the subjects either were more than 60 years old or had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or both. There were 95 organisms initially isolated in sputum, aspirate, or lavage fluid; all were susceptible to ofloxacin, and none acquired resistance during therapy. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen (19 isolates), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18) and Staphylococcus aureus (10). Clinical responses included cure in 70 patients (71%), improvement in 26 (27%), and failure in two (2%). After 10 days of therapy, pathogens persisted in two cases; in one case, Streptococcus salivarius was isolated, though it remained susceptible to ofloxacin, and in the other, Klebsiella pneumoniae was accompanied by superinfection due to a resistant strain of Serratia marcescens. We included in this study three confirmed cases of atypical pneumonia successfully treated with ofloxacin, two of them due to Mycoplasma pneumonia and one to Legionella pneumophila. Ofloxacin was well tolerated. Our data indicate that ofloxacin is effective and safe as specific and empiric treatment for many lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Swedish Study Group. A randomized multicenter trial to compare the influence of cefaclor and amoxycillin on the colonization resistance of the digestive tract in patients with lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - Eighty-four patients with lower respiratory tract infections participated in a randomised double-blind parallel multicenter trial in order to compare the efficacy of cefaclor and amoxycillin as treatment for lower respiratory tract infections and their ability to influence colonization resistance. Cefaclor was given to 40 patients and amoxycillin to 44 patients perorally in doses of 250 mg t.i.d. for seven days in a double-blind fashion. Sputum, oropharyngeal and intestinal specimens were taken for microbial analysis to isolate the causative pathogen of the lower respiratory tract infection and to follow the microflora changes before, during and after antibiotic treatment. The clinical outcome showed 92.5% cured or improved patients on cefaclor versus 88.4% on amoxycillin. The difference in clinical outcome between the two treatment groups was not statistically significant. Among the pathogenic bacteria isolated, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae dominated. There was no difference between the two treatments with regard to microbiological efficacy. Treatment with cefaclor did not cause any significant impact on the oropharyngeal microflora. Administration of amoxycillin caused a significant reduction of the number of Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella cocci, while an increase in number of enterobacteria was seen in the oropharyngeal microflora. In the intestinal flora, cefaclor significantly reduced the number of streptococci, staphylococci and anaerobic cocci, while the number of enterococci, enterobacteria, bacteroides and Candida albicans significantly increased. The intestinal microflora was partly influenced by amoxycillin treatment. Thus there was a significant increase in the number of enterobacteria, anaerobic gram-positive rods and bacteroides. In conclusion, none of these agents caused any major disturbances in the colonization resistance in patients with lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Investigation of the immune response in tonsillar lymphocytes against streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the etiological role of immune responses in tonsillar lymphocytes of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP). In order to determine their immune response to S. pyogenes T4, S. pyogenes T12, S mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. pneumoniae, tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with PPP, CT, and sleep apnea syndrome (control) were cultured with formalinized streptococcal cellular antigens. Blastoid transformation was investigated by [3H] -thymidine uptake, while antistreptococcal antibody production were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results were as follows. 1. Tonsillar lymphocytes from PPP patients underwent blastoid transformation and accelerated the production of immunoglobulin G following the addition of S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II S. mitis, S. pyogenes T4, and S. pyogenes T12, while those form CT patients and controls did so only with S. pyogenes T4 and S. pyogenes T12. 2. The spontaneous production of specific IgG against various streptococci, including S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. mitis by tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with PPP was already higher than that from CT patients and controls. The specific IgM production was also increased above that in PPP patients without any antigens. 3. S. sanguis I, S. sanguis II and S. salivarius antigens stimulated antigen-specific IgM production in tonsillar lymphocytes from PPP patients. 4. The levels of specific IgG production against S. sanguis I and S. sanguis II by tonsillar lymphocytes from PPP patients showed a relationship with the serum levels of the PPP patients. These results suggested that the sensitization of alpha-streptococci, especially S. sanguis, in the tonsillar lacunae may lead to the specific production of anti-S. sanguis antibodies in patients with PPP, and these may be involved in the pathogenesis of PPP.
TI  - [Investigation of the bacterial flora in the tonsillar lacunae and serum levels of streptococcal antigen-specific antibodies in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between bacterial flora in tonsillar lacunae and antistreptococcal antibody in sera of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (PPP). Since the pustules develops or worsens after tonsillitis in many patients with PPP, a pathogenic role of tonsillar bacteria is suggested, but no significant association has been proven so far. In this study, the aerobes in the tonsillar lacunae were identified and quantitated in 15 adult patients with PPP and 9 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis (CT). In addition, serum streptococcal antigen-specific antibody levels in 40 adult patients with PPP, 18 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results were as follows. 1. A total of 53 strains (17 species) of aerobes were isolated and identified from the tonsillar lacunae in patients with PPP, while 35 strains (12 species) of aerobes were found in the patients with CT. 2. S. salivarius and S. pneumoniae were the dominant aerobes isolated from patients with PPP or CT. 3. Although the rates of isolation for Staphylococcus and S. pneumoniae were lower in PPP patients than in CT patients, the rate for S. sanguis I was higher in PPP patients than in CT patients. 4. The percentage of alpha, gamma-streptococci to total aerobes in PPP patients was higher than in CT patients. 5. The IgG antibody titers against S. sanguis and S. mitis, and the IgM antibody titers against all streptococci investigated in PPP patients were higher than those in both CT patients and controls. 6. Moreover, both the IgG antibody titers against S. pyogenes T4 and S. sanguis I and the IgM antibody titers against S. sanguis I and S. sanguis II of the patients in which PPP markedly improved after tonsillectomy were higher than those in which PPP showed less improvement postoperatively.
TI  - Penicillin tolerance among oral streptococci.
AB  - Penicillin tolerance was elicited in 18 of 46 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from the mouths of 19 of 20 healthy subjects and in 31 of 54 consecutive blood-culture isolates of streptococci. Enterococci and Streptococcus sanguis were the organisms most frequently tolerant but the property was also common among isolates of S. mutans, S. mitior and Lancefield Group G streptococci. Pneumococci and S. salivarius were rarely tolerant. When incubated with penicillin at 5 x MIC in batch or continuous cultures, both tolerant and sensitive strains of oral streptococci declined in number less rapidly than S. pyogenes. However, combinations of penicillin and gentamicin killed tolerant and sensitive oral streptococci.
TI  - A preliminary survey of aerobic bacteria in breast milk of mothers from the low-income group in Nigeria.
AB  - The aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in Nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. In parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. The aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included Streptococcus salivarius, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermides. In general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. An analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. There was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load in mother's milk. Milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.
TI  - Cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and Omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  - In recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. In the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (Omniserum). Representatives of the following species were included: Streptococcus bovis, S. equinus, S. intermedius, S. lactis, S. milleri, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. suis, and Aerococcus viridans. Serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. Fifteen (12%) of the strains gave positive reactions by all three methods. Positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. Altogether 84 (68%) strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. Latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. Absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. These findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Exogenous thymidine and reversal of the inhibitory effect of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim on streptococci.
AB  - The practice of using sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT) for the selective isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes and as a taxonomic character in the presumptive identification of streptococci was applied to 17 strains of different groups of streptococci to determine their characteristic behaviour in the presence of exogenous thymidine. Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and group D enterococci utilized thymidine, the first two species obtaining a maximum reversal of the inhibitory effect of SXT at thymidine concentrations of 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.6 micrograms/ml or higher, respectively. For group D enterococci, the degree of reversal of the inhibitory effect was proportional to the thymidine concentration. In contrast, the four viridans species studied (Streptococcus sanguis I, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis II) and Streptococcus pneumoniae were unable to utilize thymidine from an exogenous source and thus growth remained inhibited even at the highest concentrations of thymidine tested. For selective isolation and identification of streptococci only stable media with batch-to-batch consistency are recommended together with a known quantity of thymidine.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid latex agglutination test for identification of group D streptococci.
AB  - The SeroSTAT latex agglutination test (Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskesville, R.I.) for identification of group D streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and Lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group D streptococci (S. faecalis, 74; S. bovis, 24; S. durans, 3; S. faecium, 9) and 65 viridans streptococci (S. anginosus-constellatus, 2; Streptococcus MG, 15; S. sanguis II, 14; S. mitis, 7; S. mutans, 5; S. salivarius, 8; S. sanguis I, 8; S. acidominimus, 1; S. morbillorum, 2; S. pneumoniae, 3). All strains of group D streptococci were bile-esculin positive. SeroSTAT reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of S. sanguisII and 1 strain of Streptococcus MG (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 S. bovis, 8 S. faecalis, 1 S. durans, and 6 S. faecium strains (22.7% of all group D streptococci tested). When considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, SeroSTAT is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group D streptococci.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - [Immunological reactivity to the products of normal microflora. IV. Antibodies to common species-specific pneumococcal antigens in the human spectrum of antibacterial antibodies].
AB  - Normal human serum antibodies to the protein complex more than 20 common (species-specific) STr. Pneumoniae antigens have been studied. In commercial lots of gamma globulin, manufactured during the last 8 years, antibodies to 9 pneumococcal antigens have been detected. The spectrum of antibodies and the intensity of reactions Str. pneumoniae has been found to be not inferior to Str. aureus and pyogenes (group A) and to considerably exceed Str. faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, St. epidermidis, Str. salivarius, Str. viridans, N. perflava, Ps. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, B. bifidum.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Fine structure and distribution of extracellular polymer surrounding selected aerobic bacteria.
AB  - The structure and distribution of extracellular polymer surrounding Bacillus circulans, Diplococcus (Streptococcus) pneumoniae, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Herella vaginacola (Acinetobacter calcoaceticus), and Agrobacterium tumefaciens were studied by electron microscopy. A modified ruthenium red staining procedure was used to examine the fine structure of capsule and slime. Freeze-etching and critical-point drying were used to examine the quantity of unaltered exocellular material. Comparative data demonstrate that fibrillar extracellular polymer surrounding B. circulans, D. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae is capsule (cell wall attached) which is characteristic of the producing organism. Capsular polymer generally appeared fibrillar, although globular polymer consisted of capsular subunits bound to S. salivarius and H. vaginacola. Exocellular slime was present about S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and A. tumefaciens.
TI  - Serum Bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Serum bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. Bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. Reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. Four of six different strains, including the propagating S. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. All six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. Active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. In contrast to sensitive S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella montevideo, S. zymogenes, and Diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. Among gram-positive bacteria, only D. pneumoniae inhibited S. aureus bacteriostasis. Agglutinins of S. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for S. aureus serum bacteriostasis. After diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins A, G, and M appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. It is suggested that S. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.
TI  - Transformation reactions between Pneumococcus and three strains of Streptococci.
AB  - Reciprocal transformation reactions to streptomycin resistance have been demonstrated between pneumococcus and 2 strains of viridans streptococci, which by the usual bacteriological criteria are distantly related to pneumococcus. Desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracts of a strain of streptomycin-resistant Streptococcus salivarius have been found capable of transforming pneumococcus and two strains of viridans streptococci but the strain itself was not transformed by autologous or heterologous DNA extracts. The two strains of viridans streptococci were more efficient than pneumococcus as receptors of both autologous and heterologous transforming principles. It is inferred, therefore, that efficiency of transformation does not necessarily indicate closeness of relationship among bacteria. The efficiency of transforming principles (TP's) from three streptococcal strains to induce streptomycin resistance in pneumococcus increased following their reduplication in pneumococcus. At the same time the efficiency of two of these TP's to transform streptococcus was reduced. Resistance to optochin (ethylhydrocupreine), a characteristic of most streptococci, can be transferred to pneumococcus, a naturally susceptible species, by transformation reactions.
