bovine milk fermented with lactobacillus rhamnosus l8020 decreases the oral carriage of mutans streptococci and the burden of periodontal pathogens.
aim: the aim of this study was to find the oral isolate of lactobacilli, which has the potential to inhibit either periodontal, cariogenic, or fungal pathogens in vitro, and to examine the effects of bovine milk fermented with the isolate on the oral carriage of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens. methods: the inhibitory effects of the supernatant of man-rogosa-sharpe broth, in which each of 42 oral isolates of lactobacilli grown, was examined. one isolate, lactobacillus rhamnosus l8020, that showed the potential to inhibit either periodontal, cariogenic, or fungal pathogens in vitro, was used to examine the effects of fermented milk on the oral carriage of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, which was examined by a placebo-controlled and cohort trial using 50 participants. results: edible yogurt containing lactobacillus rhamnosus l8020 significantly reduced the oral carriage of mutans streptococci (p < 0.01) and four periodontal pathogens examined: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium spp. (p < 0.01), but the phenomenon were not observed with the placebo yogurt (p > 0.05). conclusion: these results suggest that yogurt with lactobacillus rhamnosus l8020 could reduce the risk of dental caries and periodontal disease.
characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics for oral health.
