TI  == biofilm bacterial communities and abundance in a full-scale drinking water distribution system in shanghai.
AB  == community diversity and abundance of biofilms from a full-scale drinking water distribution system in shanghai were characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis of 16s rrna sequences and heterotrophic plate count (hpc), respectively. bacteria affiliated to the beta- and gamma-proteobacteria were dominating in both in-situ and hpc-culturable bacterial communities. other bacteria present included members of alphaproteobacteria, bacteroides, actinobacteria, nitrospirae and firmicutes. acidovorax, ralstonia and acinetobacter were common species in biofilms. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter sp. were detected in the local distribution system. dissolved organic carbon (doc), residual disinfectant and temperature were the most important factors influencing both bacterial abundance and composition. hpc for biofilm sample was not correlated with its community diversity.

TI  == new antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  == background: surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. methods: this paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition.  results: patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring  healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against mrsa, vre, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (csssi) and intra-abdominal infections. oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for csssi due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of otorrhea associated with tympanostomy tubes in children.
AB  == the microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (tt). the middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. analysis of the  138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28  patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in  20 (36%). there were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. commonly recovered aerobes were pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), staphylococcus aureus (11), proteus sp. (7), moraxella catarrhalis (6), klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable haemophilus influenzae (5). commonly isolated anaerobes were peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), prevotella sp. (10), bacteroides sp. (8) and fusobacterium sp. (6). pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of tt-related otorrhea in children. specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the tt or  through the open perforation after their removal.

TI  == microbiology of chronic suppurative otitis media in children in surabaya, indonesia.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of 38 children from surabaya, indonesia, who suffered from chronic suppurative otitis media (csom) was studied using strict microbiological methodology. a total of 106 isolates (49 anaerobic and 57  aerobic) were recovered. aerobic organisms alone were isolated from 11 (29%), anaerobic bacteria only in 4 (11%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were present in 23 (60%). the predominant organisms were peptostreptococcus sp., prevotella sp., bacteroides sp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and fusobacterium sp. thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing  bacteria were recovered from 22 (58%) patients. these findings demonstrate the role of penicillin resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial  etiology of csom in children from indonesia. judicious use of antimicrobial therapy may prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

TI  == microbiology of empyema in children and adolescents.
AB  == the microbiology of empyema was studied in 72 children and adolescents whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 93 organisms, 60 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, were isolated. aerobic bacteria was isolated in 48 (67%) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 17 (24%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 7 (10%). the predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were haemophilus influenzae (15 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (13), and staphylococcus aureus (10). the predominant anaerobes were bacteroides sp (15 isolates, including 7 bacteroides fragilis group and 5 bacteroides melaninogenicus group), anaerobic cocci (9), and fusobacterium sp (6). beta-lactamase activity was detected in at least one isolate in 20 (37%) of the 54 tested patients. these included all 8 tested s aureus and 7 b fragilis group, 3 of 10 h influenzae, 2 of 4 b melaninogenicus group, and 1 of 2 klebsiella pneumoniae. most cases of s pneumoniae and h influenzae were associated with pneumonia. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, subdiaphragmatic abscess, and abscesses of dental or oropharyngeal origin. the data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema in children and adolescents.

TI  == new diterpenoid antibiotics, spirocardins a and b.
AB  == new antibiotics spirocardins a and b were isolated from the culture broth of an actinomycete isolated from a soil sample collected near lake hibara, fukushima prefecture, japan. the producing strain was classified as nocardia sp. sank 64282. the antibiotics were isolated from the culture filtrate by solvent extraction and purified further by silica gel and preparative reverse phase column chromatography. they were primarily active against gram-positive bacteria  including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and limited species of gram-negative bacteria such as bacteroides fragilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. they were also moderately active against several species of mycoplasma. the molecular formulae of spirocardins a and b were c20h30o6 and c20h32o6, respectively. from their physico-chemical characteristics they were revealed to be diterpenoid antibiotics with closely related structures and the former was easily converted to the latter by the reduction with nabh4.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [in vitro susceptibility to a new antimicrobial agent (imipenem) of pathogens isolated from inpatients at various centers].
AB  == imipenem is a beta lactam antibiotic, a highly potent new carbapenem with broad antibacterial spectrum. to test the "in vitro" efficacy of this antimicrobial agent in pathogens more frequent in several medical centers in brazil, susceptibility testing with 10 mcg imipenem disks and, or corresponding mic were  carried out with 1231 recent isolates of 41 different bacterial species, obtained mainly from hospitalized patients in 5 different medical centers of the cities of s. paulo, rio de janeiro and salvador. our preliminary results with this antibiotic, in final phases of clinical and laboratorial experimentation in this  country, are very promissing with, 96.79% of susceptibility of test isolates to 10 mcg imipenem disks and corresponding mic correlation of up to 4 micrograms/ml. (92.31%). of the 9 bacterial species more frequently isolated totaling 1108 (82%) of the 1230 test isolates, disk susceptibility was 99% (e. coli), 93% (pseudomonas aeruginosas), 87% (staphylococcus aureus), 100% (klebsiella pneumoniae), 98% (klebsiella sp), 97% (proteus mirabiles), 94% (enterobacter sp), 100% (streptococcus faecalis) with good mic correlation (up to 8 mcg/ml) and 100% for the anaerobic species bacteroides sp (mic up to 4 micrograms/ml). "in vitro"  efficacy to hospital pathogens with high frequency of resistance to most antibiotics as pseudomonas aeruginosa and to anaerobes notably bacteroides sp is  emphasized.

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in mixed infections in children.
AB  == the recent emergence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillins in the therapy of infection caused by these organisms. these include  respiratory tract, skin of soft tissue, female genital tract, intra-abdominal, and other miscellaneous infections. the important aerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) include staphylococcus aureus, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and legionella sp. the anaerobic blpb are all bacteroidiaceae and include bacteroides fragilis group, b. melaninogenicus group, b. oralis, b. oris-buccae, and fusobacterium sp. laboratory, animal, and clinical studies that support the indirect pathogenicity  of these organisms and the distribution of these blpb in various infections are reviewed. blpb may not only have a direct pathogenic role in causing the infection, but also an indirect pathogenic role. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy, but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic blpb require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against  all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == trospectomycin, a novel spectinomycin analogue: antibacterial activity and preliminary human pharmacokinetics.
AB  == trospectomycin (tsp; u-63366f) is a novel spectinomycin (sp) analogue with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in vitro activity of the analogue was  compared to that of sp against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. the in vivo  activity of the compound was assessed using experimental infection models for both gram-positive and gram-negative facultative bacteria. the preliminary human  pharmacokinetics of tsp were evaluated following single-dose i.v. or i.m. administration. tsp was more active in vitro than sp (2 to 32-fold) against strains of numerous bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, proteus spp., bacteroides spp., gardnerella vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis. the activity of tsp for most species of the family enterobacteriaceae was comparable  to that of sp. tsp was more active than sp (2 to 32-fold) in curing experimental  infections due to streptococci, salmonella typhi, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. tsp was well-absorbed following both i.v.  and i.m. administration. pharmacokinetic analysis of microbiological assay data for the 1000 mg dose yielded the following mean values for the i.v. and i.m. routes, respectively: cmax = 81.2, 28.7 micrograms/ml; serum half-life = 2.2, 2.2 h; tmax = 25, 75 min; and auc = 156.6, 116.2 h micrograms/ml. pharmacokinetic analysis of assay data derived using the more sensitive hplc assay revealed the biphasic nature of trospectomycin elimination, highlighted by a short apparent serum half-life (2.2 h) and a prolonged tissue half-life (approximately 36 h). tsp inhibits a variety of clinically important organisms, including agents of sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic inflammatory disease, and demonstrates favourable pharmacokinetic properties.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [clinical studies on fosfomycin sodium following intravenous administration (tissue concentration and clinical efficacy)].
AB  == fosfomycin (fom) is a synthetic antibiotic having a unique structural formula and bactericidal mechanism and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against various bacterial species. it has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. as therapy, fom-na in a daily dose of 4 g (2 g x 2) was given by intravenous drip infusion for 5 to 10 days to 6 cases with infectious diseases (2 cases of acute cholecystitis, 3 cases of acute localized peritonitis due to phlegmonous appendicitis and 1 case of acute diffuse peritonitis due to perforative appendicitis). the clinical response was rated as "excellent" in 1 case, "good" in 4 cases, "fair" in 1 case and "poor" in none. no adverse effects were observed in any of the patients. six clinical isolates were obtained, and these consisted  of 4 strains of escherichia coli and 1 strain each of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  bacteroides fragilis. the mics of fom were from 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml for e. coli, 50 micrograms/ml for k. pneumoniae, and 100 micrograms/ml for b. fragilis.  fom-na was administered to the 6 cases intravenously in a dose of 2 g before surgery, and tissue specimens and body fluid samples were taken during the operation. the fom concentration was determined by bioassay with a proteus sp. (mb 838) as the test organism. the mean fom concentration in bile from the common bile duct was 61.85 +/- 17.13 micrograms/ml (n = 5) at 95 to 108 minutes after fom-na intravenous bolus injection. the mean fom concentration in the gall bladder bile was 80.06 +/- 92.36 micrograms/ml, while that in the gall bladder wall was 146.65 +/- 39.10 micrograms/g. the mean fom concentration in purulent ascites was 58.20 +/- 13.29 micrograms/ml, 36.22 +/- 14.63 micrograms/g in the appendix wall and 12.64 +/- 11.34 micrograms/ml in pus in the appendix. the fom concentrations in the infected tissues and body fluids thus exceeded the mics of  fom for the pathogenic bacteria. therefore, fom-na appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy of infections encountered in the surgical field.

AB  == the beta-lactamase inhibitor ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (pbps) of escherichia coli. when used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. some synergy between ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of pseudomonas aeruginosa. ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against bacteroides fragilis. in keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus sp. but not against those with enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and e. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type i or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type tem.

TI  == chronic otitis media in children. microbiological studies.
AB  == aspiration of the exudate through the open perforation was performed in 68 children with chronic otitis media. the middle ear aspirate and a swab specimen of the external auditory canal were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. seventy-eight isolates were recovered from the middle ears, 99 from the external  ear canals, and 95 were present at both sites. aerobes only were isolated from 33 patients (48.5%), nine (13.2%) had only anaerobes, and 26 (38%) had a culture that grew both aerobes and anaerobes. there were 99 aerobic isolates. aerobes commonly recovered were pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, proteus sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae. there were 74 anaerobes isolated. anaerobes commonly isolated were anerobic gram-positive cocci, bacteroides sp, and clostridium sp. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial  bacteriology of chronic otitis media in children. cultures collected from the external auditory canals prior to their sterilization can be misleading. reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudates when collected through the open perforation in the tympanic membrane.

TI  == in vitro activity of ly127935.
AB  == the activity of ly127935, a beta-lactam antibiotic of novel structure, was studied in vitro against facultative gram-negative bacilli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacteroides fragilis. the strains were recent clinical isolates, many of which were relatively resistant to other antibiotics. ly127935 exhibited striking activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., proteus sp., serratia marcescens, and b. fragilis with median minimum inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was somewhat less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus. cefotaxime (hr 756) showed very similar activity except that it was substantially weaker against b. fragilis. ly127935 was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, or piperacillin; it was also as potent as tobramycin or amikacin against all species except for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == bacteremia and fungemia complicating neoplastic disease. a study of 364 cases.
AB  == during a 14 month period there were 364 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia at memorial sloan-kettering cancer center. the first nine months of the study were retrospective, and the next five prospective. in patients with leukemia or lymphoma (group 1), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently isolated organisms. the mortality in this group was 40.5 per cent. in the patients with solid tumor (group 2), esch. coli, staph. aureus, bacteroides sp. and candida sp. were most frequent. mortality was 27.8 per cent. the source of infection in both groups was often indeterminate. high mortality was associated with pulmonary and intraabdominal infection and with ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae or polymicrobic sepsis. factors of prognostic significance were the causative microorganism, source of infection and shock. although mortality was higher in patients with leukopenia than in those with normal leukocyte counts, the differences were not significant. the mortality in this series was low considering the severity of the underlying diseases and the immunosuppressed state of many of the patients. in a  prospective, randomly controlled study, mortality was further diminished by infectious disease consultation at the time the positive blood culture was reported. severe fungal superinfection, predominantly aspergillosis and candidiasis, was found in 52 per cent of the autopsy patients with leukemia or lymphoma (group 1), but in only 8 per cent of those with solid tumors (group 2).

TI  == [on the acute respiratory infections of anaerobes bacteria: clinical, bacteriological and therapeutic results (author's transl)].
AB  == in order to isolate and identify aerobe and obligate anaerobe (o.a.) bacteria investigations were carried out on 11 patients with acute respiratory tract infections (7 of them severely ill and hospitalized in an intensive care unit). o.a. species were isolated in 7 subjects, in all cases in mixed culture (from 2 to 5 species per sample), including also potentially pathogenic aerobe bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, etc). on the 24 strains of o.a. bacteria identified, m.i.c. was determined for penicillin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and thiamphenciol. the data obtained have been compared with the m.i.c. of 28 strains isolated from uro-gynecological infections. the strains isolated from the respiratory tract presented a sensitivity spectrum to antibiotic similar to those isolated from the urogenital tract. chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol inhibited growth in 100% of the cases at concentrations equivalent or inferior to plasma levels obtained with normal therapeutical doses; clindamycin was active at lower concentrations but not on all the strains isolated (3 bacteroides, 1 fusobacterium sp., 1 peptococcus sp. were resistent).  penicillin g was active on 21 out of 25 gram-positive strains, but only on 7 out  26 gram-negative bacilli. in view of these results the difficulty of obtaining a  correct etiologic diagnosis and the consequent use of a correct antibiotic therapy are discussed. the usefulness of the association of different antibiotics is suggested.
