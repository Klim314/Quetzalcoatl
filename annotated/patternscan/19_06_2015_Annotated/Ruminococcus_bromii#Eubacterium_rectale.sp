TI  == diet rapidly and reproducibly alters the human gut microbiome.
AB  == long-term dietary intake influences the structure and activity of the trillions of microorganisms residing in the human gut, but it remains unclear how rapidly and reproducibly the human gut microbiome responds to short-term macronutrient change. here we show that the short-term consumption of diets composed entirely of animal or plant products alters microbial community structure and overwhelms inter-individual differences in microbial gene expression. the animal-based diet  increased the abundance of bile-tolerant microorganisms (alistipes, bilophila and bacteroides) and decreased the levels of firmicutes that metabolize dietary plant polysaccharides (roseburia, eubacterium rectale and ruminococcus bromii). microbial activity mirrored differences between herbivorous and carnivorous mammals, reflecting trade-offs between carbohydrate and protein fermentation. foodborne microbes from both diets transiently colonized the gut, including bacteria, fungi and even viruses. finally, increases in the abundance and activity of bilophila wadsworthia on the animal-based diet support a link between dietary fat, bile acids and the outgrowth of microorganisms capable of triggering inflammatory bowel disease. in concert, these results demonstrate that the gut microbiome can rapidly respond to altered diet, potentially facilitating the diversity of human dietary lifestyles.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of dysbiosis in ulcerative colitis during remission.
AB  == background: presence of intestinal microbes is a prerequisite for the development of ulcerative colitis (uc), although deviation of the normal intestinal microbiota composition, dysbiosis, is presumably implicated in the etiology of uc. methods: the fecal microbiota of 30 uc samples obtained from 15 patients who  were sampled twice and from 15 healthy control subjects originating from 2 geographic locations was analyzed using highly reproducible phylogenetic microarray that has the capacity for detection and quantification of more than 1000 intestinal bacteria in a wide dynamic range. results: the fecal microbiota composition is not significantly influenced by geographic location, age, or gender, but it differs significantly between the patients with uc and the control subjects (p = 0.0004). uc-associated microbiota is stable during remission and similar among all patients with uc. significant reduction of bacterial diversity  of members of the clostridium cluster iv and significant reduction in the abundance of bacteria involved in butyrate and propionate metabolism, including ruminococcus bromii et rel. eubacterium rectale et rel., roseburia sp., and akkermansia sp. are markers of dysbiosis in uc. increased abundance of (opportunistic) pathogens including fusobacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp., helicobacter sp., and campylobacter sp. as well as clostridium difficile were found to be associated with uc. conclusions: dysbiosis in uc is stable in time and shared between patients from different geographic locations. the microbial alterations offer a mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of the disease.

TI  == ruminococcus bromii is a keystone species for the degradation of resistant starch in the human colon.
AB  == the release of energy from particulate substrates such as dietary fiber and resistant starch (rs) in the human colon may depend on the presence of specialist primary degraders (or 'keystone species') within the microbial community. we have explored the roles of four dominant amylolytic bacteria found in the human colon  in the degradation and utilization of resistant starches. eubacterium rectale and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron showed limited ability to utilize rs2- and rs3-resistant starches by comparison with bifidobacterium adolescentis and ruminococcus bromii. in co-culture, however, r. bromii proved unique in stimulating rs2 and rs3 utilization by the other three bacterial species, even in a medium that does not permit growth of r. bromii itself. having previously demonstrated low rs3 fermentation in vivo in two individuals with undetectable populations of r. bromii-related bacteria, we show here that supplementation of mixed fecal bacteria from one of these volunteers with r. bromii, but not with the other three species, greatly enhanced the extent of rs3 fermentation in vitro. this argues strongly that r. bromii has a pivotal role in fermentation of  rs3 in the human large intestine, and that variation in the occurrence of this species and its close relatives may be a primary cause of variable energy recovery from this important component of the diet. this work also indicates that r. bromii possesses an exceptional ability to colonize and degrade starch particles when compared with previously studied amylolytic bacteria from the human colon.

TI  == resistant starches types 2 and 4 have differential effects on the composition of  the fecal microbiota in human subjects.
AB  == background: to systematically develop dietary strategies based on resistant starch (rs) that modulate the human gut microbiome, detailed in vivo studies that evaluate the effects of different forms of rs on the community structure and population dynamics of the gut microbiota are necessary. the aim of the present study was to gain a community wide perspective of the effects of rs types 2 (rs2) and 4 (rs4) on the fecal microbiota in human individuals. methods and findings: ten human subjects consumed crackers for three weeks each containing either rs2,  rs4, or native starch in a double-blind, crossover design. multiplex sequencing of 16s rrna tags revealed that both types of rs induced several significant compositional alterations in the fecal microbial populations, with differential effects on community structure. rs4 but not rs2 induced phylum-level changes, significantly increasing actinobacteria and bacteroidetes while decreasing firmicutes. at the species level, the changes evoked by rs4 were increases in bifidobacterium adolescentis and parabacteroides distasonis, while rs2 significantly raised the proportions of ruminococcus bromii and eubacterium rectale when compared to rs4. the population shifts caused by rs4 were numerically substantial for several taxa, leading for example, to a ten-fold increase in bifidobacteria in three of the subjects, enriching them to 18-30% of  the fecal microbial community. the responses to rs and their magnitudes varied between individuals, and they were reversible and tightly associated with the consumption of rs. conclusion: our results demonstrate that rs2 and rs4 show functional differences in their effect on human fecal microbiota composition, indicating that the chemical structure of rs determines its accessibility by groups of colonic bacteria. the findings imply that specific bacterial populations could be selectively targeted by well designed functional carbohydrates, but the inter-subject variations in the response to rs indicates that such strategies might benefit from more personalized approaches.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == highlighting new phylogenetic specificities of crohn's disease microbiota.
AB  == background: recent studies suggest that gastrointestinal (gi) microbes play a part in the pathogenesis of crohn's disease (cd). methods: fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 16 cd patients (age- and sex-matched).  the dna extracted from these samples were subjected to two different methods of microbiome analysis. specific bacterial groups were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods using primers designed using a high-throughput in-house bioinformatics pipeline. the same dna extracts were also used to produce fluorescently labeled crna amplicons to interrogate a custom-designed phylogenetic microarray for intestinal bacteria. results: even though the intersubject variability was high, differences in the fecal microbiomes of healthy and cd patients were detected. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and escherichia coli were more represented in healthy and ileal cd patients, respectively. additionally, probes specific for ruminococcus bromii, oscillibacter valericigenes, bifidobacterium bifidum, and eubacterium rectale produced stronger hybridization signals with the dna samples from healthy subjects. conversely, species overrepresented in cd patients were e. coli, enterococcus faecium, and species from the proteobacteria not normally found in the healthy human gi tract. furthermore, we detected "healthy specific" molecular species or operational taxonomic units (otus) that are not closely related to any known species (faecalibacterium, subdoligranulum, and oscillospora species), indicating that the phylogenetic dysbiosis is broader than at strain or species level. conclusions: these two techniques of microbiome analysis provided a statistically robust new picture of the dysbiosis in fecal microbiota from ileal  cd patients. specifically, we identified a set of six species discriminant for cd, which provides a preliminary diagnostic tool.

TI  == dominant and diet-responsive groups of bacteria within the human colonic microbiota.
AB  == the populations of dominant species within the human colonic microbiota can potentially be modified by dietary intake with consequences for health. here we examined the influence of precisely controlled diets in 14 overweight men. volunteers were provided successively with a control diet, diets high in resistant starch (rs) or non-starch polysaccharides (nsps) and a reduced carbohydrate weight loss (wl) diet, over 10 weeks. analysis of 16s rrna sequences in stool samples of six volunteers detected 320 phylotypes (defined at >98% identity) of which 26, including 19 cultured species, each accounted for >1% of sequences. although samples clustered more strongly by individual than by diet, time courses obtained by targeted qpcr revealed that 'blooms' in specific bacterial groups occurred rapidly after a dietary change. these were rapidly reversed by the subsequent diet. relatives of ruminococcus bromii (r-ruminococci) increased in most volunteers on the rs diet, accounting for a mean of 17% of total bacteria compared with 3.8% on the nsp diet, whereas the uncultured oscillibacter group increased on the rs and wl diets. relatives of eubacterium rectale increased on rs (to mean 10.1%) but decreased, along with collinsella aerofaciens, on wl. inter-individual variation was marked, however, with >60% of  rs remaining unfermented in two volunteers on the rs diet, compared to <4% in the other 12 volunteers; these two individuals also showed low numbers of r-ruminococci (<1%). dietary non-digestible carbohydrate can produce marked changes in the gut microbiota, but these depend on the initial composition of an  individual's gut microbiota.

TI  == linking phylogenetic identities of bacteria to starch fermentation in an in vitro model of the large intestine by rna-based stable isotope probing.
AB  == carbohydrates, including starches, are an important energy source for humans, and are known for their interactions with the microbiota in the digestive tract. largely, those interactions are thought to promote human health. using 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)-based stable isotope probing (sip), we identified starch-fermenting bacteria under human colon-like conditions. to the microbiota of the tim-2 in vitro model of the human colon 7.4 g l(-1) of [u-(13)c]-starch was added. rna extracted from lumen samples after 0 (control), 2, 4 and 8 h was subjected to density-gradient ultracentrifugation. terminal-restriction fragment  length polymorphism (t-rflp) fingerprinting and phylogenetic analyses of the labelled and unlabelled 16s rrna suggested populations related to ruminococcus bromii, prevotella spp. and eubacterium rectale to be involved in starch metabolism. additionally, 16s rrna related to that of bifidobacterium adolescentis was abundant in all analysed fractions. while this might be due to the enrichment of high-gc rna in high-density fractions, it could also indicate an active role in starch fermentation. comparison of the t-rflp fingerprints of experiments performed with labelled and unlabelled starch revealed ruminococcus bromii as the primary degrader in starch fermentation in the studied model, as it was found to solely predominate in the labelled fractions. lc-ms analyses of the  lumen and dialysate samples showed that, for both experiments, starch fermentation primarily yielded acetate, butyrate and propionate. integration of molecular and metabolite data suggests metabolic cross-feeding in the system, where populations related to ruminococcus bromii are the primary starch degrader, while those related to prevotella spp., bifidobacterium adolescentis and eubacterium rectale might be further involved in the trophic chain.

TI  == selective colonization of insoluble substrates by human faecal bacteria.
AB  == insoluble plant polysaccharides and endogenous mucin are important energy sources for human colonic microorganisms. the object of this study was to determine whether or not specific communities colonize these substrates. using faecal samples from four individuals as inocula for an anaerobic in vitro continuous flow system, the colonization of wheat bran, high amylose starch and porcine gastric mucin was examined. recovered substrates were extensively washed and the  remaining tightly attached bacterial communities were identified using polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s rrna gene sequences and fluorescent in situ hybridization. the substrate had a major influence on the species of attached bacteria detected. sequences retrieved from bran were dominated by clostridial cluster xiva bacteria, including uncultured relatives of clostridium hathewayi, eubacterium rectale and roseburia species. bacteroides species were also detected. the most abundant sequences recovered from starch were related to the cultured species ruminococcus bromii, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve and e. rectale. the most commonly recovered sequences from  mucin were from bifidobacterium bifidum and uncultured bacteria related to ruminococcus lactaris. this study suggests that a specific subset of bacteria is  likely to be the primary colonizers of particular insoluble colonic substrates. for a given substrate, however, the primary colonizing species may vary between host individuals.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.

TI  == predominant gram-positive bacteria in human feces: numbers, variety, and persistence.
AB  == the predominant gram-positive bacteria in 47 fecal specimens from 10 healthy men  were studied by microscopic and cultural counts, by the characterization and tentative identification of isolates, and by the use of fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-conjugated globulins prepared using some of the isolates. gram-positive bacteria averaged 10(10.5+/-0.4(sd)/g (wet weight) of feces with significant variation from host to host. characterization of 865 isolates, all strict anaerobes and carbohydrate fermenters, showed 12 to 39 distinguishable strains from each host and indicated that some strains were present the full period of about 18 months. sixty percent of the isolates belonged to one of five  types, tentatively identified with five species-bifidobacterium adolescentis, eubacterium aerofaciens, e. rectale, peptostreptococcus productus, and ruminococcus bromii. there was distinct host idiosyncrasy in the pattern of estimated counts of these five types. certain strains resembling b. adolescentis, e. aerofaciens, and p. productus, distinguished with fitc conjugates, were resident in their hosts for many months. in direct smears each strain constituted about 1% of the total bacteria.
