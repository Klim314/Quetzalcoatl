TI  - Establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.
AB  - Ten specific primer sets, for Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus crispatus, Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii, Chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy Japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: Lactobacilli such as L. crispatus, L. gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as Streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. Certain bacterial vaginosis (BV)-related bacteria, such as G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, M. curtisii, and Prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. Especially in one subject, both G. vaginalis and A. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic BV patient. These results suggest that the RT-qPCR system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.
TI  - Physico-chemical properties and hypoglycaemic activity of fermented milks prepared with Anemarrhena asphodeloides water extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this research, water extract solutions of Anemarrhena asphodeloides (AA) rhizomes were added to reconstituted milk at 5%, 10% and 15% (v/v) to prepare AA fermented milk (AAFM5 , AAFM10 and AAFM15 ). The AAFM10 was selected for investigation of hypoglycaemic activity. RESULTS: Compared with the control fermented milk, titratable acidity values and water-holding capacities of AA fermented milk were increased to different extents, but syneresis values were reduced. The viable counts of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Bifidobacterium adolescentis were significantly increased, respectively. The blood sugar level of streptozotocin diabetic mice taking AAFM10 was reduced by 14.4%, and the food intake was decreased. The contents of malondialdehyde, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were reduced by different degrees, and insulin and total superoxide dismutase were significantly increased. CONCLUSION: AAFM10 had a significant hypoglycaemic effect and improvement in the complications (such as kidney disease and hyperlipemia) in the mouse model of diabetes.

TI  - Breast milk jaundice: effect of bacteria present in breast milk and infant feces.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Breast milk is an important source of bacteria in establishing the infantile intestinal microbiota that appear to influence the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of breast milk's microbiological content on the development of breast milk jaundice (BMJ). METHODS: A total number of 60 mother-infant pairs enrolled to the study. Two groups were defined: BMJ group (n=30), full-term otherwise healthy newborns who were considered BMJ; control group (n=30), full-term healthy newborns without jaundice. All newborns in the study were exclusively breast-fed. The breast milk samples and the feces of infants were evaluated for content of selected bacterial populations (Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species) with real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Bifidobacterium bifidum content in the breast milk and B adolescentis, B bifidum, and B longum content in the fecal samples were higher in the control group than in the BMJ group. The milk and fecal concentrations of B bifidum were significantly correlated. The concentrations of breast milk B bifidum and fecal B bifidum, B adolescentis, and B longum were found to be negatively correlated with bilirubin levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Bifidobacterium species in breast milk may protect against BMJ.
TI  - Transglucosylation potential of six sucrose phosphorylases toward different classes of acceptors.
AB  - In this study, the transglucosylation potential of six sucrose phosphorylase (SP) enzymes has been compared using eighty putative acceptors from different structural classes. To increase the solubility of hydrophobic acceptors, the addition of various co-solvents was first evaluated. All enzymes were found to retain at least 50% of their activity in 25% dimethylsulfoxide, with the enzymes from Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Streptococcus mutans being the most stable. Screening of the enzymes' specificity then revealed that the vast majority of acceptors are transglucosylated very slowly by SP, at a rate that is comparable to the contaminating hydrolytic reaction. The enzyme from S. mutans displayed the narrowest acceptor specificity and the one from Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B1355 the broadest. However, high activity could only be detected on l-sorbose and l-arabinose, besides the native acceptors d-fructose and phosphate. Improving the affinity for alternative acceptors by means of enzyme engineering will, therefore, be a major challenge for the commercial exploitation of the transglucosylation potential of sucrose phosphorylase.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Bifidobacterium spp. isolated from healthy adult Koreans against cariogenic microflora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dental caries is the main common infectious disease in the human oral  cavity. Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were reported to be the most important etiological factors in human dental caries. Thus, we examined the inhibitory effects of Bifidobacterium spp. cells and culture supernatants against S. mutans and S. sobrinus, including Streptococcus gordonii, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, which is associated with periodontal disease. METHODS: Mutans streptococci or A. actinomycetemcomitans and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were mixed in 1:1 ratio and then incubated for 90 min at 37 degrees C. After the incubation, the viability of mutans streptococci or A. actinomycetemcomitans was determined by plate count technique. We also investigated the morphological changes of S. mutans treated with LAB using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: In vitro viability of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. gordonii, and A. actinomycetemcomitans was affected by human intestinal LAB identified as Bifidobacterium adolescentis SPM1005 and Bifidobacterium longum SPM1207. Especially, B. adolescentis SPM1005 cells at 1.0 x 10(8) CFU had a strong growth-inhibiting effect against S. mutans and induced a 64% loss of its viability (p<0.05). In addition, swollen and disrupted S. mutans were observed after incubation with B. adolescentis SPM1005. However, the culture supernatant of this strain did not show such inhibitory activity. CONCLUSION: B. adolescentis SPM1005 cells decreased the growth of S. mutans, which is a risk factor for dental caries. Therefore, we suggest that this Bifidobacterium strain may be a useful probiotic microorganism for prevention of dental caries that does not have adverse effects.
TI  - New L-amino acid ligases catalyzing oligopeptide synthesis from various microorganisms.
AB  - L-Amino acid ligase synthesizes various peptides from unprotected L-amino acids in an ATP-dependent manner. Known L-amino acid ligases catalyze only dipeptide synthesis, but recently we found that RizB of Bacillus subtilis NBRC 3134 catalyzes oligopeptide synthesis. In the present study, we searched for new members of the L-amino acid ligase group that catalyze oligopeptide synthesis. Several hypothetical proteins possessing the ATP-grasp motif were selected by in silico analysis. These recombinant proteins were assayed for L-amino acid ligase activity. We obtained five L-amino acid ligases showing oligopeptide synthesis activities. These proteins showed low similarity in amino acid sequence, but commonly used branched-chain amino acids, such as RizB, as substrates. Furthermore, the spr0969 protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae synthesized longer peptides than those synthesized by RizB, and the BAD_1200 protein of Bifidobacterium adolescentis showed higher activity toward aromatic amino acids than toward branched-chain ones. We also examined some of their characteristics.
TI  - Human-specific fecal bacteria in wastewater treatment plant effluents.
AB  - The objective of this study was to identify fecal bacteria able to persist after  wastewater treatment and that could be used as indicators of human fecal contamination. In a first step, the diversity of Bacteroidales, Clostridiaceae, Bifidobacterium, and Bacillus-Streptococcus-Lactobacillus cluster (BSL) was analysed using a fingerprint technique (CE-SSCP) and 16S rDNA libraries in waters collected at the end of the treatment process in different urban wastewater treatment plants. For each group, dominant bacteria present in most effluents were identified. Their origin (human feces, animal feces, non-fecal) was then analysed based on data of their closest relatives in public 16S rDNA databases. Among fecal bacteria recovered in the treated effluents analysed, phylotypes close to Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bacteroides caccae seem to be specific to human beings. Phylotypes gathering only sequences of human fecal origin were also identified among the BSL and Clostridiaceae, two bacterial groups which have been poorly investigated for bacterial source-tracking purpose. Since these bacteria were detected post-treatment in most wastewater treatment plants, they may constitute potential new indicators of fecal contamination specific to humans that could be used to track fecal contamination of surface water by sewage.
TI  - Interactions between salivary Bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacteria: in vitro coaggregation and coadhesion assays.
AB  - Coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral Bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. Bifidobacterium adolescentis OLB6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with Actinomyces naeslundii JCM8350, Streptococcus mitis OLS3293, Streptococcus sanguinis JCM5708, Veillonella parvula ATCC17745 or Porphyromonas gingivalis OB7124, but it did coaggregate with Fusobacterium nucleatum JCM8532. Subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using FISH revealed that B. adolescentis OLB6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. It did, however, adhere to biofilms of A. naeslundii, V. parvula, and F. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with A. naeslundii nor with V. parvula. These results suggest that the adhesion of B. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. Heat- or proteinase K-treated F. nucleatum could not coaggregate with B. adolescentis. Similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase K-treated B. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. It is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of B. adolescentis and F. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. The data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.
TI  - Identification of commensal bacterial strains that modulate Yersinia enterocolitica and dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory responses: implications for the development of probiotics.
AB  - An increasing body of evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria are effective in  the treatment of enteric infections, although the molecular basis of this activity remains elusive. To identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of Yersinia-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. The commensal bacteria Escherichia coli, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity for host epithelial cells (EC), and the strains were tested for their ability to inhibit Y. enterocolitica-induced NF-kappaB activation. Additionally, B. adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with Y. enterocolitica and to mice with mucosae impaired by DSS treatment. None of the commensal bacteria tested was toxic for or invaded the EC. B. adolescentis, B. distasonis, B. vulgatus, and S. salivarius inhibited the Y. enterocolitica-induced NF-kappaB activation and interleukin-8 production in EC. In line with these findings, B. adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA expression, and loss of body weight upon oral infection with Y. enterocolitica. In addition, the administration of B. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon DSS treatment in mice. We suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  - The hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. The aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. Mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus mitis, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Veillonella parvula, and Neisseria sicca. The levels of interleukin 12 (IL-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-10, and IL-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The TNF-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking CD14, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2), and TLR-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. The levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. Gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. The levels of IL-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of IL-10 were similar in newborns and adults. Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in cord cells. L. plantarum bound or signaled through CD14, TLR-2, and TLR-4, whereas E. coli acted mainly through CD14 and TLR-4. These results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.
TI  - Evaluation of N-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  - N-Acetylchitooligosaccharides ((GlcNAc)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. A chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using HCl. After purification, the purity of each (GlcNAc)(1-6) was >86%. The growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (BM) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Eubacterium limosum could use (GlcNAc)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and Proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (GlcNac)(1-6). GlcNAc was used more readily than (GlcNAc)(2-6) by Staphylococcus aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. In BM, Streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.
TI  - Thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  - This study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (TLC) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. When the chromatogram was sprayed with the indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. Succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. In addition, these organic acids showed different R(f) values. The total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. The proposed TLC method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five Bifidobacterium species. (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (Lactobacillus casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and S. lactis). Both spots of lactic acid and acetic acid were detected on all the TLC plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. The five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. Accordingly, the proposed TLC method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of Bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
TI  - Sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria as indicators of diffuse human faecal pollution in estuarine watersheds.
AB  - Sorbitol fermenting bifidobacteria were evaluated as indicators of non-point source human faecal pollution to three sub-estuaries with elevated faecal coliform densities. Human-specific bifidobacteria correlated with identifiable human sanitary deficiencies in feeder streams to estuarine creeks in two of three watersheds examined, one rural and one moderately developed. Sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria were recovered at densities ranging from 1 to 90 colony-forming-units 100 ml-1 in 11 of 258 water samples but were undetected in sediment (n = 68) and scat from resident wildlife (deer, muskrat and raccoon, n = 20). Failure to detect sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria in water samples during the summer months was consistent with laboratory microcosm results showing non-recoverability of Bifidobacterium adolescentis after 5-9 d in membrane-filtered estuarine water at 23 and 30 degrees C, but persistence for 4 weeks at 10 degrees C. Persistence of sewage-derived bifidobacteria in membrane-filtered freshwater at 15 degrees C was also observed. Recovery of sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria was complicated by high background levels of Gram-positive rods and cocci. Use of propionic acid and reduced pH (pH = 5.0), or use of a two-step resuscitation protocol using non-selective and selective media, did not improve recovery. Although human specific bifidobacteria hold promise as indicators of diffuse faecal contamination, methodological constraints now limit its application to situations of gross contamination, or sampling potential sources during environmental conditions conducive to bifid persistence.
TI  - Note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of Bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  - Pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis and Bif. bifidum), Lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. The appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. Of the selective media, AMC, RMS, NPNL and BL-OG performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lact. acidophilus. However, of these four media, AMC was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. The AMC agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.
TI  - Growth-inhibitory effects of Galla Rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The growth-inhibitory activity of Galla Rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. The biologically active components of Galla Rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (MG) and gallic acid (GA) by spectral analysis. The growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. In the test using 10 mg disc-1, MG and GA produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Cl. paraputrificum, Eubacterium limosum, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards Bifidobacterium adolescentis or B. longum whereas the growth of B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. animalis, B. thermophilum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. plantarum and Streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. However, GA did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 5 mg disc-1, MG significantly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens and Cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. At 1 mg disc-1, MG greatly inhibited the growth of Cl. perfringens alone. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of Galla Rhois.
TI  - Stimulation of cytokine production in clonal macrophage and T-cell models by Streptococcus thermophilus: comparison with Bifidobacterium sp. and Lactobacillus bulgaricus.
AB  - The effects of four commercial strains of Streptococcus thermophilus used in yogurt manufacturing on cytokine production were evaluated by using a macrophage model (RAW 264.7 cells) and a T-helper-cell model (EL4.IL-2 thymoma cells) and compared to immunologically active strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium bifidum. All cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6 in RAW 264.7 cells and IL-2 and IL-5 in EL4.IL-2 cells) were affected by heat-killed S. thermophilus in a strain- and dose-dependent fashion. Organisms of all three genera induced significant increases in IL-6 production by the macrophage line ranging from 31- to 192-fold, with S. thermophilus St 133 showing the greatest activity. The four S. thermophilus strains also strongly induced TNF-alpha production (from 135- to 176-fold). IL-6 and, to a lesser extent, TNF-alpha production were also increased when the macrophages were costimulated with lipopolysaccharide and cells of the three groups of lactic acid bacteria. Upon concurrent stimulation of EL4.IL-2 cells with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate, seven of the eight strains displayed significant enhancement of IL-2 and IL-5 production, with S. thermophilus being most effective. Taken together, the S. thermophilus strains stimulated macrophage and T-cell cytokine production to a similar or greater extent than did the species of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. These and previous results lend further support to the contention that lactic acid bacteria, in a concentration-dependent manner, can differentially induce cytokine production in macrophages, but that the effects on T cells required a costimulatory signal and were less remarkable.
TI  - Role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  - The role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (BFMeT), was examined in this study. BFMeT was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to Wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. A single oral administration of BFMeT induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. However, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. BFMeT-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with Bifidobacterium adolescentis or Lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. However, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with Eubacterium limosum or Escherichia coli. An overnight culture of B. adolescentis or L. acidophilus or yogurt containing Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with BFMeT. Gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained microorganisms were Gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were Gram-negative rods. In the group of rats with ulcers induced by BFMeT, the Gram-positive rods decreased by 56.4% and the Gram-negative rods including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus and Bacteroides increased by 37.3%. However, in the group of rats administered the Bifidobacterium culture, the Lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the Gram-negative rods were decreased. Although Lactobacillus was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the Gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods E.coli, Klebsiella and Proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with BFMeT, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with NSAIDs, and that Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.
TI  - Absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - To investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. The production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by HPLC analysis in growing cultures. Resting whole cells from a positive control strain, Eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mM cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at pH 7.3. However, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. In growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by E. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. None of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
TI  - Analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  - A 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. The blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. The decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. The dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was Bifidobacterium sp., Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium lonqum, Lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Peptococcus magnus Bifidobacterium longum. In contrast, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides distasonis, B. ovatus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. Among microorganisms isolated from the patient, Morganella morganii, Candida sp., Eubacterium aerofacience and Eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; Streptococcus mitior, Staphylococcus intermedius, Micrococcus kristinae, Selenomonas ruminantum, Bacteroides ureolyticus and Lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. These results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.
TI  - [The range of antigenic specificity of Bifidobacterium peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic relationships of Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 peptidoglycans with different strains of this species (LVA-3, 791, GO-4), bifidobacteria of other species (B. adolescentis GO-13, B. breve 79-38, B. lactentis 79-41, B. longum GO-3) and bacteria of remote taxonomic groups (Streptococcus faecalis 6-3. Staphylococcus aureus COM 885, S. epidermidis COM 2124. Lactobacillus plantarum 1, Escherichia coli M-17) were studied on the basis of a highly sensitive test system permitting the registration of normal human antibodies to peptidoglycans. The level of cross reactions with staphylococci and streptococci correspond to intraspecific and antigenic affinity to L. plantarum and E. coli was considerably less pronounced. Copying a number of epitopes of bifidobacteria, S. aureus peptidoglycan seems to possess additional antigenic determinants which participate in the formation of immunological responsiveness in man.
TI  - Distribution of metronidazole susceptibility factors in obligate anaerobes.
AB  - The distribution of metronidazole susceptibility factors in clinically important  bacteria was studied to determine why obligate anaerobes were susceptible to metronidazole and facultative ones were not. With obligate and facultative anaerobes, nitroreductase activity, metronidazole uptake, pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity and drug susceptibility were estimated. Nitroreductase activity was distributed in the obligate anaerobes and some facultative ones such as Streptococcus faecalis. Propionibacterium acnes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Actinomyces israelii and most of the facultative anaerobes had no such activity. Bacteria with nitroreductase activity were able to absorb the drug. Pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity was distributed in all of the obligate anaerobes, whereas Prop. acnes, Bif. adolescentis, A. israelii and all of the facultative anaerobes had no such activity. Distribution of metronidazole susceptibility was the same as that of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity. Therefore metronidazole may selectively inhibit obligate anaerobes with pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity. Nitroreductase activity may be necessary for drug uptake as well.
TI  - Effect of intestinal bacteria on incidence of liver tumors in gnotobiotic C3H/He  male mice.
AB  - The effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Clostridium indolis, C. paraputrificum, C. perfringens, C. innocuum, C. nexile, C. ramosum, C. clostridiiforme, Bacteroides multiacidus, Bacteroides fragilis, Veillonella alcalescens, V. parvula, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. The incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). The average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with E. coli, S. faecalis, and C. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). In contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with E. coli, S. faecalis, L. acidophilus, C. perfringens, and Bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from that in germfree animals (0.5). The present study demonstrated that the presence of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic C3H/He male mice.
TI  - Experimental Shigella infections in laboratory animals. I. Antagonism by human normal flora components in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - Germfree mice were associated with selected species of human intestinal bacteria  and then challenged with a streptomycin-resistant Shigella flexneri strain. Antagonism against Shigella was most pronounced in mice associated with Escherichia coli and least pronounced in mice associated with Bacteroides fragilis. A moderate degree of antagonism could be demonstrated in mice associated with either Streptococcus faecalis or Bifidobacterium adolescentis. Shigella persisted in the cecal contents of E. coli-associated mice at very low, stable levels. Shigella populations were reduced to levels below detection in the ceca of mice diassociated with E. coli and Bacteroides. Upon subsequent administration of streptomycin, Bacteroides disappeared from the ceca. The E. coli population was greatly reduced, and Shigella reappeared at very high population levels as an apparent recombinant which resembled E. coli biochemically. A streptomycin-resistant E. coli population subsequently emerged and became dominant in the ceca. Shigella concomitantly declined to levels below detection.
