TI  == parabacteroides chinchillae sp. nov., isolated from chinchilla (chincilla lanigera) faeces.
AB  == strains of gram-stain-negative, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria were isolated from chinchilla (chinchilla lanigera) faeces, and strain st166(t) was investigated taxonomically. phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences revealed that strain st166(t) belonged to the genus parabacteroides. strain st166(t) formed a distinct line of descent, and the highest sequence similarity to st166(t) was found with parabacteroides merdae jcm 9497(t) (95.6%) and parabacteroides johnsonii jcm 13406(t) (95.0%). analysis of hsp60 gene sequences also supported these relationships. based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, the novel species parabacteroides chinchillae sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain of p. chinchillae sp. nov. is st166(t) ( = jcm 17104(t) =ccug 62154(t)).

TI  == antimicrobial resistance and prevalence of resistance genes in intestinal bacteroidales strains.
AB  == objective: this study examined the antimicrobial resistance profile and the prevalence of resistance genes in bacteroides spp. and parabacteroides distasonis strains isolated from children's intestinal microbiota. methods: the susceptibility of these bacteria to 10 antimicrobials was determined using an agar dilution method. beta-lactamase activity was assessed by hydrolysis of the chromogenic cephalosporin of 114 bacteriodales strains isolated from the fecal samples of 39 children, and the presence of resistance genes was tested using a pcr assay. results: all strains were susceptible to imipenem and metronidazole. the following resistance rates were observed: amoxicillin (93%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (47.3%), ampicillin (96.4%), cephalexin (99%), cefoxitin (23%), penicillin (99%), clindamycin (34.2%) and tetracycline (53.5%).  p-lactamase production was verified in 92% of the evaluated strains. the presence of the cfia, cepa, ermf, tetq and nim genes was observed in 62.3%, 76.3%, 27%, 79.8% and 7.8% of the strains, respectively. conclusions: our results indicate an increase in the resistance to several antibiotics in intestinal bacteroides spp.  and parabacteroides distasonis and demonstrate that these microorganisms harbor antimicrobial resistance genes that may be transferred to other susceptible intestinal strains.

TI  == design of species-specific oligonucleotide probes for the detection of bacteroides and parabacteroides by fluorescence in situ hybridization and their application to the analysis of mouse caecal bacteroides-parabacteroides microbiota.
AB  == aims: to develop species-specific monitoring techniques for rapid detection of bacteroides and parabacteroides inhabiting the mouse intestine by fluorescence in situ hybridization. methods and results: the specificity of oligonucleotide probes was evaluated by fluorescence whole-cell hybridization. oligonucleotide probes specific for each species hybridized only with the target bacteria. using  these probes, caecal bacteroides-parabacteroides microbiota of conventional mice  and specific pathogen-free (spf) mice from three different breeders were analysed. it was shown that bacteroides acidifaciens group-1, group-2 and group-3 were dominant in conventional mice and spf mice from two out of three breeders. bacteroides vulgatus and parabacteroides distasonis were detected in one of these two spf breeding colonies in addition to bact. acidifaciens. spf mice of the remaining breeder harboured characteristic bacteroides-parabacteroides microbiota, consisting of bacteroides sp. asf519 and bacteroides caccae. conclusions: bacteroides acidifaciens is the dominant and most typical species in the mouse bacteroides-parabacteroides microbiota. the group-3 was identified as a novel group and revealed to occupy a major niche together with bact. acidifaciens group-1 and group-2. significance and impact of the study: the species-specific probe set developed in this study was the efficient tool for rapid detection of target bacterial groups inhabiting the mouse intestine. the results of this study provide important new information on the mouse bacteroides-parabacteroides community.

TI  == identification and characterization of a novel fumarase gene by metagenome expression cloning from marine microorganisms.
AB  == background: fumarase catalyzes the reversible hydration of fumarate to l-malate and is a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle and in amino acid metabolism. fumarase is also used for the industrial production of l-malate from  the substrate fumarate. thermostable and high-activity fumarases from organisms that inhabit extreme environments may have great potential in industry, biotechnology, and basic research. the marine environment is highly complex and considered one of the main reservoirs of microbial diversity on the planet. however, most of the microorganisms are inaccessible in nature and are not easily cultivated in the laboratory. metagenomic approaches provide a powerful tool to isolate and identify enzymes with novel biocatalytic activities for various biotechnological applications. results: a plasmid metagenomic library was constructed from uncultivated marine microorganisms within marine water samples.  through sequence-based screening of the dna library, a gene encoding a novel fumarase (named fumf) was isolated. amino acid sequence analysis revealed that the fumf protein shared the greatest homology with class ii fumarate hydratases from bacteroides sp. 2_1_33b and parabacteroides distasonis atcc 8503 (26% identical and 43% similar). the putative fumarase gene was subcloned into petblue-2 vector and expressed in e. coli bl21(de3)plyss. the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity. functional characterization by high performance liquid chromatography confirmed that the recombinant fumf protein catalyzed the hydration of fumarate to form l-malate. the maximum activity for fumf protein occurred at ph 8.5 and 55 degrees c in 5 mm mg(2+). the enzyme showed higher affinity and catalytic efficiency under optimal reaction conditions: k(m) = 0.48  mm, v(max) = 827 mum/min/mg, and k(cat)/k(m) = 1900 mm/s. conclusions: we isolated a novel fumarase gene, fumf, from a sequence-based screen of a plasmid metagenomic library from uncultivated marine microorganisms. the properties of fumf protein may be ideal for the industrial production of l-malate under higher  temperature conditions. the identification of fumf underscores the potential of marine metagenome screening for novel biomolecules.

TI  == ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel patients exhibit distinct abnormalities of the gut microbiota.
AB  == background: previous studies suggest a link between gut microbiota and the development of ulcerative colitis (uc) and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). our aim was to investigate any quantitative differences in faecal bacterial compositions in uc and ibs patients compared to healthy controls, and to identify individual bacterial species that contribute to these differences. methods: faecal microbiota of 13 uc patients, 11 ibs patients and 22 healthy volunteers were analysed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) using universal and bacteroides specific primers. the data obtained were normalized using in-house developed statistical method and interrogated by multivariate approaches. the differentiated bands were excised and identified by sequencing the v3 region of the 16s rrna genes. results: band profiles revealed that number  of predominant faecal bacteria were significantly different between uc, ibs and control group (p < 10-4). by assessing the mean band numbers in uc (37 +/- 5) and ibs (39 +/- 6), compared to the controls (45 +/- 3), a significant decrease in bacterial species is suggested (p = 0.01). there were no significant differences  between ibs and uc. biodiversity of the bacterial species was significantly lower in uc (mu = 2.94, sigma = 0.29) and ibs patients (mu = 2.90, sigma = 0.38) than controls (mu = 3.25, sigma = 0.16; p = 0.01). moreover, similarity indices revealed greater biological variability of predominant bacteria in uc and ibs compared to the controls (median dice coefficients 76.1% (iqr 70.9 - 83.1), 73.8% (iqr 67.0 - 77.5) and 82.9% (iqr 79.1 - 86.7) respectively). dna sequencing of discriminating bands suggest that the presence of bacteroides vulgatus, b. ovatus, b. uniformis, and parabacteroides sp. in healthy volunteers distinguishes them from ibs and uc patients. dgge profiles of bacteroides species revealed a decrease of bacteroides community in uc relative to ibs and controls. conclusion: molecular profiling of faecal bacteria revealed abnormalities of intestinal microbiota in uc and ibs patients, while different patterns of bacteroides species loss in particular, were associated with uc and ibs.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from mouse caecal samples and description of bacteroides sartorii sp. nov.
AB  == caecal samples from wild-type and tnf(deltaare) mice were cultured on selective media containing bile salts, amino acids or casein macro-peptides. twenty-two strains were isolated and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. twenty-one strains showed >98% similarity to known bacteria (blautia spp., clostridium innocuum, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus murinus, parabacteroides goldsteinii and shigella dysenteriae). one additional isolate, strain a-c2-0, was a new bacterium. the closest relatives were bacteroides massiliensis, bacteroides dorei and bacteroides vulgatus (< or = 94% similarity). strain a-c2-0 is a gram-negative rod that does not form spores and has a g + c content of dna of 41.5%. its major cellular fatty acid is c(15:0 anteiso), and its major respiratory quinone is mk-9. cells are aerotolerant but grow only under strict anoxic conditions. they are resistant to cefotaxime and tobramycin. when compared with related bacteroides spp., the new bacterium was positive for alpha-arabinosidase, negative for glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase and did not  metabolise galactose, glucose, fructose, mannose, raffinose and sucrose. strain a-c2-0 therefore merits recognition as a member of a novel species within the genus bacteroides, for which the name bacteroides sartorii is proposed. the type  strain is a-c2-0(t) (= dsm 21941(t) = ccug 57211(t)).

TI  == phocaeicola abscessus gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterium isolated from a human brain abscess sample.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic bacterial strain, 7401987t, was isolated from a human brain  abscess sample. cells were gram-negative, non-spore-forming, coccoid to rod-shaped and motile by flagella in a lophotrichous arrangement. the isolate was asaccharolytic and the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-c15:0 (28.2%), c16:0 (18.0%), iso-c15:0 (12.3%) and iso-c17:0 3-oh (11.7%). 16s rrna gene sequence comparisons showed that the isolate was distantly related to members of  the genera bacteroides (<83.6% similarity), parabacteroides (<79.9% similarity),  tannerella (<79.8% similarity), dysgonomonas (<79.6% similarity), porphyromonas (<79.3% similarity) and prevotella (<78.9% similarity). the low 16s rrna gene sequence similarity values and physiological and biochemical characteristics differentiated strain 7401987t from all known species and indicate that our isolate represents a novel species in a new genus within the phylum bacteroidetes. the name phocaeicola abscessus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain of phocaeicola abscessus is 7401987t (=ccug 55929t=csur p22t=dsm  21584t).

TI  == antibacterial activity of human defensins on anaerobic intestinal bacterial species: a major role of hbd-3.
AB  == defensins are natural mucosal antimicrobial peptides and their broad spectrum activity against aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria has been well investigated. the aim of this study was to systematically examine the antibacterial activity of the small intestinal paneth cell derived alpha-defensin hd5 and the major colonic beta-defensins hbd-1-3 against strict anaerobic intestinal bacteria. the antibacterial activity was assessed with a flow cytometric assay employing a membrane potential sensitive dye as marker for loss  of cell viability. the majority of the tested strains belonging to the dominant anaerobe genera of the gut, bacteroides and parabacteroides, were only minimally  affected by the constitutively expressed defensins hd5 and hbd-1. the inducible defensin hbd-2 had a limited antibacterial effect, whereas the inducible hbd-3 exhibited potent activity against most strains. the effect of hbd-3 on bacteroides sp. appeared to be dependent on the presence of oxygen. bacteroides fragilis strains isolated from blood during bacteremia or from extraintestinal infections were more resistant to hbd-3 than strains from the physiological gut flora. thus, defensin resistance is not only species- but also strain-specific and may be clinically relevant in the host-bacteria interaction influencing mucosal translocation and systemic infection.

TI  == adherence and invasion of bacteroidales isolated from the human intestinal tract.
AB  == members of the genera bacteroides and parabacteroides are important constituents  of both human and animal intestinal microbiota, and are significant facultative pathogens. in this study, the ability of bacteroides spp. and parabacteroides distasonis isolated from both diarrhoeal and normal stools (n = 114) to adhere to and invade hep-2 cells was evaluated. the presence of putative virulence factors  such as capsule and fimbriae was also investigated. adherence to hep-2 cells was  observed in 75.4% of the strains, which displayed non-localized clusters. invasion was observed in 37.5% and 26% of the strains isolated from diarrhoeal and non-diarrhoeal stools, respectively. all strains displayed a capsule, whereas none of them showed fimbriae-like structures. this is the first report of the ability of bacteroides spp. and p. distasonis to adhere to and invade cultured hep-2 epithelial cells.
