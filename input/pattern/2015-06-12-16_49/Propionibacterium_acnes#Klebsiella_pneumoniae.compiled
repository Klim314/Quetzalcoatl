TI  - Green synthesis of copper nanoparticles by Citrus medica Linn. (Idilimbu) juice and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - We report an eco-friendly method for the synthesis of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) using Citron juice (Citrus medica Linn.), which is nontoxic and cheap. The biogenic copper nanoparticles were characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometer showing a typical resonance (SPR) at about 631 nm which is specific for CuNPs. Nanoparticles tracking analysis by NanoSight-LM20 showed the particles in the range of 10-60 nm with the concentration of 2.18 x 10(8) particles per ml. X-ray diffraction revealed the FCC nature of nanoparticles with an average size of 20 nm. The antimicrobial activity of CuNPs was determined by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method against some selected species of bacteria and plant pathogenic fungi. It was reported that the synthesized CuNPs demonstrated a significant inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes and Salmonella typhi. Among the plant pathogenic fungi tested, Fusarium culmorum was found to be most sensitive followed by F. oxysporum and F. graminearum. The novelty of this work is that for the first time citron juice was used for the synthesis of CuNPs.
TI  - [Bacterial contamination of needles after intravitreal injection in Paraguay].
AB  - PURPOSE: The study was designed to prospectively evaluate the bacterial contamination of needles used for intravitreal injection during surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between December 2007 and December 2010, 549 eyes of 413 patients were treated with intravitreal injections of 1.25 mg bevacizumab. Of the patients 322 received a single injection and 91 multiple injections. Preoperatively the periorbital skin of all patients was treated with 10% povidone iodine (PVI) and the conjunctival sac was irrigated with 1% PVI. No pre-injection antibiotics were administered. Immediately after the injection the needles were rinsed 3 times in thioglycolate broth which was then cultured at 37 degrees C for 5 days. As a negative control 73 sterile unused needles were treated in the same way. RESULTS: Out of the 549 needle points tested 8 (1,45%) were found to be contaminated after intravitreal injections. The isolated bacteria were coagulase negative Staphylococcus (n = 7), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 1) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1) (co-contamination in one case). CONCLUSION: Contamination of needles is minimal after prophylactic povidone iodine irrigation before intravitreal injections. Therefore, this prophylaxis technique is recommended before intravitreal injections in order to prevent postoperative infections.
TI  - Microbial spectrum and resistance patterns in endophthalmitis: a 21-year (1988-2008) review in northeast United States.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the microbial spectrum and antibacterial susceptibility of vitreous cultures in a tertiary referral center in Northeast United States. METHODS: All vitreous samples sent to the microbiology laboratory at a tertiary referral center from January 1988 to December 2008 were included in the study. The distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of all isolates from culture-positive samples were compared across 3 equal time periods 1988-1994, 1995-2001, and 2002-2008. RESULTS: One hundred forty-three positive cultures, where 11.9% (n=17) were polymicrobial, yielded a total of 160 isolates that consisted of 80.6% (n=129) gram-positive isolates, 12.5% (n=20) gram-negative isolates, and 6.9% (n=11) fungal isolates. The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (37.5%, n=60), Viridans Streptococcus (11.3%, n=18), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.9%, n=11). Other common gram-positive isolates include Propionibacterium acnes (5.6%, n=9), other Streptococcus species (4.4%, n=7), Staphylococcus aureus (4.4%, n=7), and Enterococcus faecalis (3.8%, n=6). The most common gram-negative isolates were Klebsiella species (3.1%, n=5), Moraxella species (3.1%, n=5), and Haemophilus species (2.5%, n=4). Vancomycin was effective against all CoNS, Sta. aureus, Viridans Streptococcus, and E. faecalis tested, and all Sta. aureus isolates were oxacillin sensitive. Of all CoNS isolates, 83.3% during 1988-1994, 73.1% during 1995-2001, and 100% during 2002-2008 were resistant to at least 1 of the antibiotics tested in the study with the last time period showing an increase in resistance (P=0.021, adjusted standard residual=2.0). CoNS showed a decreasing resistance over time to chloramphenicol and gentamicin (P=0.010, P=0.007, respectively) and an increase in resistance to penicillin and tetracycline during 2002-2008 (P=0.003, P=0.040, respectively). Susceptibility to other antibiotics did not show significant dependence on time. CONCLUSION: Bacteria causing endophthalmitis showed variable resistance to antibiotics over time. The importance of adequately treating endophthalmitis in the setting of these resistance pattern changes stresses the importance of periodic evaluation of causative organisms to ensure appropriate empiric treatment.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - Screening of platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination: spectrum of bacteria detected, proportion of transfused units, and clinical follow-up.
AB  - Screening of platelet concentrates (PCs) for bacterial contamination with cultivation methods is carried out as a routine procedure in some countries. The aim is to prevent the transfusion of contaminated PCs. The German Evaluation of Regular Monitoring Study Group conducted a prospective multicenter study on 52,243 PCs to investigate the prevalence of bacteria (BacT/ALERT, bioMerieux). This study describes the detected bacterial spectrum, the proportion of PCs with a positive test result that had been transfused, and the results of the clinical follow-up. One hundred thirteen (67%) of 169 potentially or confirmed positive units had already been transfused at the time of the first positive signal. The transfusion of units contaminated by Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, and 73% of the units contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis, or Staphylococcus saccharolyticus was prevented. In contrast, 85% of units with Propionibacterium acnes were transfused. A clonal relationship of the isolates from the pooled PCs and from the associated red blood cell concentrates was found in all investigated cases. The follow-up revealed six febrile reactions to culture-positive PCs not classified as transfusion reaction (TRs) by treating physicians. This demonstrates the importance of hemovigilance. Serious septic reactions due to Klebsiella pneumoniae in two units of one apheresis PC that had tested false-negative were reported; one had a fatal outcome. Culture systems reduce the risk of transfusion of contaminated PCs but cannot guarantee sterility. Physicians must be aware of bacterial contamination of PCs as a potential cause of TRs and must report all adverse events.
TI  - Prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (PLT) components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one double-dose PLTs were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL). After split, each PLT unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 CFUs. One unit was photochemically treated (PCT; 150 micromol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A). The other unit was untreated. All units were stored and sampled on Days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux). PLTs were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. RESULTS: In all PCT PLTs, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. In untreated PLTs, Staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. Growth of 1 to 10 CFUs per unit Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 CFUs per unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 to 1000 CFUs per unit Propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. Low levels of Streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 CFUs/unit), Escherichia coli (1-100 CFUs/unit), and Clostridium perfringens (1-100 CFUs/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: For the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated PLTs may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. In contrast, bacterial inactivation by PCT could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of PLTs contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - Biological activities of Schefflera leucantha.
AB  - This study investigated various biological activities of the ethanolic extract of dried ground leaves of Schefflera leucantha Viguier (Araliaceae). The extract possessed very low cytotoxicity to brine-shrimp with the LC(50) of 4,111.15 microg/ml; the significant antioxidant activity on DPPH with the EC(50) of 71.90 microg/ml; the inhibitory activity on mushroom tyrosinase with the IC(50) of 10.53 mg/ml using the dopachrome microplate-assay. The extract of 5-20 mg/ml range in the agar dilution assay were active against various pathogenic microbial (11 species, 11 strains), with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5 mg/ml against Clostridium spp.; MIC=10 mg/ml against enteropathogens as Bacteroides spp., Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Lactobacillus spp., Peptococcus spp. and Streptococcus mutans; MIC=10 mg/ml against a pneumonia causing bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and a dermatopathogen as Propionibacterium acnes; MIC=20 mg/ml against dermatopathogens as Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus spp. and Candida albicans ATCC 90028. TLC fingerprints of the specific extracts from the leaf powder exhibited zones of steroids-terpenes and flavonoids. HPLC fingerprint of the flavonoid extract was performed.
TI  - Microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We undertook to evaluate the microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (AECS). METHODS: Repeated aspirations of maxillary sinus secretions by endoscopy were performed in 7 patients over a period of 125 to 242 days. RESULTS: Bacteria were recovered for all 22 aspirates, and the number of isolates was between 2 and 4. A total of 54 isolates were isolated: 16 aerobic and facultative bacteria and 38 anaerobic bacteria. The aerobic bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae (7 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Moraxella catarrhalis (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1). The anaerobic bacteria included pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp (19), Peptostreptococcus spp (9), Fusobacterium spp (8), and Propionibacterium acnes (2). A change in the types of isolates was noted in all consecutive cultures obtained from the same patients as different organisms emerged and previously isolated bacteria were no longer recovered. An increase in antimicrobial resistance was noted in 6 instances. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the microbial dynamics of AECS in which anaerobic and aerobic bacteria prevail, and highlights the importance of obtaining cultures from patients with AECS for guidance in selection of proper antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Validation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial detection of platelet (PLT)-rich-plasma (PRP)-derived PLTs  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. This study validated the BacT/ALERT for use in testing pooled PRP-derived PLTs with nine contaminating organisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two PRP-derived PLT pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 CFUs/mL). Four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 mL was plated onto blood agar. RESULTS: All organisms (excluding P. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respective). P. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively). With E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. This was most notable with S. viridans where the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for the detection of bacteria in PRP-derived PLTs in a pooled format. Overall, the use of the BacT/ALERT system allowed the detection of pooled PRP-derived PLTs inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 CFUs per mL in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding P. acnes).
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in PLT components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux [formerly Organon Teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in PLTs. The recovery of nine organisms seeded into PLTs with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. The use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into Day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis PLT units to 10 and 100 CFUs per mL. Replicate samples (4 mL) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. RESULTS: All organisms (with the exception of P. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 CFUs/mL). In aggregate (with the exception of P. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). In all cases, the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. P. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 CFUs/mL), respectively. The narrower bottle neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Toxicity of Australian essential oil Backhousia citriodora (Lemon myrtle). Part 1. Antimicrobial activity and in vitro cytotoxicity.
AB  - The antimicrobial and toxicological properties of the Australian essential oil, lemon myrtle, (Backhousia citriodora) were investigated. Lemon myrtle oil was shown to possess significant antimicrobial activity against the organisms Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Aspergillus niger, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Propionibacterium acnes comparable to its major component-citral. An in vitro toxicological study based on the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium) cytotoxicity assay was performed. In vitro cytotoxicity testing indicated that both lemon myrtle oil and citral had a very toxic effect against human cell lines: HepG2 (a hepatocarcinoma-derived cell line); F1-73 (a fibroblast cell line derived from normal skin) and primary cell cultures of human skin fibroblasts. Cytotoxicity IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) values ranged from 0.008 to 0.014% (w/v) at 4 h to 0.003-0.012% (w/v) at 24 h of exposure. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for lemon myrtle oil was calculated as 0.5 mg/l at 24 h exposure and the RfD (reference dose) was determined as 0.01 mg/l. A product containing 1% lemon myrtle oil was found to be low in toxicity and could potentially be used in the formulation of topical antimicrobial products.
TI  - [Development of a vaccine for treatment of urinary tract infections].
AB  - Receiving uroinfections are predominantly treated with antibiotics and chemotherapeutics. An effective alternative treatment can be immunotherapy with inactivated bacteria. The authors have focused on the development of polybacterial vaccine with both specific and nonspecific immunostimulatory activity. The vaccine contains killed bacteria which most frequently occur as an etiological agent in urinary tract infections. Determining for the selection of particular strains for the vaccine preparation were their immunostimulatory properties evaluated after intraperitoneal application of killed cells to mice. The results were evaluated according to weight gain of liver and spleen and verified by histological examination of these organs. The final form of the vaccine URVAKOL contains immunogenically most active strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, representing specific effective part of the preparation, adjuvant activity is provided by Propionibacterium acnes. (Tab. 1, Fig. 2, Ref. 27.)
TI  - Microbiology of acute purulent pericarditis. A 12-year experience in a military hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic micro-biological and clinical characteristics in 15 cases of acute pericarditis treated over a 12-year period. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiological and clinical data. SETTING: Military hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria alone were present in 7 specimens (47%), anaerobic bacteria alone in 6 specimens (40%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 2 specimens (13%). In total, there were 21 isolates: 10 aerobic or facultative bacteria and 11 anaerobic bacteria, an average of 1.4 per specimen. Anaerobic bacteria predominated in patients with pericarditis who also had mediastinitis that followed esophageal perforation and in patients whose pericarditis was associated with orofacial and dental infections. The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (3 isolates) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2 isolates), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were Prevotella species (4 isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (3 isolates), and Propionibacterium acnes (2 isolates). CONCLUSION: The findings in our study highlight the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in acute pericarditis.
TI  - Bacterial immunomodulator Olimunostim inhibits degranulation of mastocytes in vitro.
AB  - A bacterial immunomodulator Olimunostim (OS) is one of the first Czech biologic response modifiers, which have been introduced into clinical practice. OS activates the mechanisms of non-specific immunity and is used for the most part in chronic infections. Since OS is indicated in patients suffering from infection complicated allergic diseases (asthma bronchiale, atopic eczema, etc.), (1) the concentration of histamine (Hi) and Hi-like compounds in OS, and (2) the possible role of OS in the process of histamine release from rat peritoneal mastocytes (PMC) were studied. The cells were preincubated with soluble fractions of OS. PMC degranulation was stimulated by the compound 48/80. The amount of Hi and Hi-like substances in the supernatant and in the pellet of PMC was determined by the fluorimetric method. Compounds of Hi nature were also evaluated in OS (lysate of S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, P. acnes) by original modification of high-performance liquid chromatography. The data provide the first evidence for a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of OS on the degranulation of rat PMC. Moreover, we found that 1 mg of OS itself contained 0.376 microgram of Hi and 0.142 microgram of 1-methylHi. Histamine was detected in P. acnes (0.672 microgram/mg), K. pneumoniae (0.136 microgram/mg), and S. aureus (0.175 microgram/mg), while methylHi was detected only in the case of K. pneumoniae (0.454 microgram/mg). The results of our in vitro study do not support the hypothesis of inducing type I allergic reaction by OS or facilitating OS in crossing the enteral barrier.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Biochemical aspects of immunomodulation by Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - The present paper deals with the effect of indomethacin and/or Propionibacterium  acnes (Pa) on the cytochrome P-450 content in liver microsomal fraction, free fatty acids and lipase concentration in serum with respect to the phagocytic activities of monocytomacrophage system, changes in weight of the spleen and liver, survival after LD100 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and histology of the spleen and liver. The results obtained indicate that INDO acts as an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 and at the same time stimulates functions of the monocytomacrophage system in all the parameters studied. Pa, a classical immunomodulator, inhibits cytochrome P-450. After the initial suppression phase (3rd day after administration), it stimulates significantly the activity of monocytomacrophage system and increases the amount of FFA in the serum. The combination of both preparations also inhibits the cytochrome P-450 concentration in the liver and stimulates functions of the monocytomacrophage system in all the studied parameters. However, no temporary suppression of phagocytic activities was observed on the 3rd day of the experiment, in contrast to the animals administered Pa alone. Serum FFA concentration increased significantly. The application of both preparations accelerated markedly the onset of proliferation and differentiation processes in lymphatic follicles of the spleen.
TI  - Study of modulatory effects of Olimunostim on cellular immunity in healthy humans.
AB  - To objectivize potential modulatory effects of polybacterial lysate Olimunostim on cellular immunity, the T-lymphocyte subpopulations and lymphocyte reactivity to mitogens were followed up in 10 healthy volunteers subjected to Olimunostim application and parallelly in 6 healthy individuals receiving placebo. The preparation, which was applied perorally in seven consecutive daily doses, had no effects on T-lymphocytes and their subpopulations and exerted only a limited influence on lymphocyte reactivity to mitogens. Both the moderate suppression of proliferative response to Con A and PWM, observed after the application of the three doses of Olimunostim, and the insignificantly enhanced response to PHA and Con A, revealed shortly after the last dose was given, were only of transient character and in comparison with the control group were not proved to be statistically significant. To explain the discordance of these results with the recently reported modulatory effects of Olimunostim on murine lymphocytes it is suggested, that the performed tests using the peripheral blood lymphocytes cannot mirror the processes developing in the diseased tissues. With respect to this presumption and also to the observations of enhanced immunomodulatory effect of Olimunostim on terrain altered by infection, it is proposed to investigate cellular immune parameters in specific disease sites of Olimunostim treated patients suffering from recurrent infections.
TI  - Lymphocyte proliferation and T-lymphocyte subsets during experimental immunomodulation of Balb/C mice by Olimunostim.
AB  - To objectivize possible immunomodulatory effects of polybacterial lysate Olimunostim (P. acnes, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus), splenic lymphocyte proliferation and T-lymphocyte subsets were followed-up in Balb/c mice administered perorally the lysate or saline (controls). The enhanced spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation observed at the beginning of Olimunostim application preceded a gradual increase of lymphocyte reactivity to T-mitogens reaching the maximum five days after the administration of the last dose and returning back to the control levels ten days afterwards. This stimulation of lymphocyte proliferation was accompanied by Olimunostim induced increase of CD4+ splenic lymphocytes being most pronounced five days after the end of immunomodulation and later returning to the initial values. The last experiment revealed an enhanced response of the in vivo primed lymphocytes after the re-exposure to Olimunostim in vitro. It is concluded that mostly nonspecific activation mechanisms, plausibly also parallelly induced specific immunity, are involved in Olimunostim modulatory effects on the cellular immune response.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - To better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. Sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). We cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, Streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group D streptococcus in five patients, Corynebacterium in five patients, Haemophilus influenzae in three patients, Neisseria in three patients, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. Cultures yielded no growth in nine patients. A strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. A poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). All seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. Only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. Cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. The presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Propionibacterium acnes in mixed infections with facultative bacteria.
AB  - Single and mixed infections with 11 clinical isolates of Propionibacterium acnes  and three facultative bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Abscesses were induced by pure cultures of six of 11 strains of P. acnes and by the three facultative bacteria. The abscesses produced by each of the six "virulent" P. acnes isolates mixed with S. aureus, E. coli or K. pneumoniae were larger than those induced by the single organisms in 16 of the 18 combinations. There was a significant increase in the numbers of the six P. acnes strains in 13 of the 18 bacterial mixtures and in the numbers of the facultative bacteria in 17 of the 18 combinations. These data illustrate the potential virulence of some P. acnes strains and their synergic capacity with facultative bacteria.
TI  - Periodic acid-Schiff-positive organisms in primary cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection. Case report and an investigation of the periodic acid-Schiff staining properties of bacteria.
AB  - Primary cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection frequently presents as a single necrotic bulla on the extremity of an immunocompromised patient. In lesional biopsy specimens and smears, the large gram-positive rods of B cereus may be mistaken for Clostridium species. This is a potentially serious error, as Bacillus species are resistant to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. We studied a case in which large periodic acid-Schiff-staining organisms were seen in the biopsy specimen from a necrotic bulla on the finger of a neutropenic patient with diffuse large cell lymphoma. The tissue biopsy specimen subsequently yielded a pure culture of B cereus. Staining with periodic acid-Schiff was then performed on a series of bacterial species in human tissue and from smears of culture colonies. The following bacterial species were found to be consistently periodic acid-Schiff positive after diastase digestion: B cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Propionibacterium acnes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Bacteria from solid tumours.
AB  - Bacteria were grown from 63 (69%) of 91 specimens from necrotic tumours in 63 patients. Of the tumours, 14 were abdominal, 5 pelvic, 23 of the head and neck, 4 of the lungs, 4 mediastinal, 2 lymphatic, 3 of the breast, and 8 were miscellaneous. Aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 (19%) specimens, anaerobes only in 10 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 41 (65%). A total of 83 anaerobic and 47 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were isolated. The predominant anaerobic bacteria were Bacteroides spp. (36 isolates), and anaerobic cocci (21) and Propionibacterium acnes (22). The aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria most frequently isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli (seven isolates each), S. epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five isolates each). These data demonstrate that infection of tumours is usually polymicrobial.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - Head-space gas-liquid chromatographic analysis for presumptive identification of  bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - A total of 445 strains of common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for their volatile microbial metabolites by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. The bacteria were incubated for 24 or 48 h in blood-containing Trypticase soy or Lombard-Dowell glucose broth before being analyzed by automatic head-space injection. From the chromatographic pattern obtained, the majority of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes could be characterized. The head-space technique developed provides a rapid, direct and easily-performed means for presumptive identification of bacteria found in blood culture.
TI  - Bacterial products as immunomodulating agents.
AB  
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Quantitative pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of bacterial cell walls.
AB  
TI  - Phagocytic and chemiluminescent responses of mouse peritoneal macrophages to living and killed Salmonella typhimurium and other bacteria.
AB  - In the presence of luminol, resident as well as thioglycolate-induced and immunized macrophages emitted chemiluminescence more efficiently when the cells were exposed to living Salmonella typhimurium than when they were exposed to the same bacterium killed by ultraviolet light or heat. This phenomenon was observed whether or not the bacterium was opsonized. The different response to living and killed bacteria was also found with Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus morganii, and Enterobacter aerogenes, but not with Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Propionibacterium acnes. The results suggest that macrophages respond better to living, motile bacteria than to nonmotile or killed bacteria. The experimental results obtained with motility mutants of S. typhimurium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa confirm that macrophages exposed to the motile bacteria emit chemiluminescence more efficiently and ingest the motile bacteria at a much faster rate than the nonmotile bacteria.
TI  - Biphasic protection against bacterial infection in mice induced by vaccination of Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - A single intraperitoneal injection of the phenol-treated cells of Propionibacterium acnes into mice showed nonspecific resistance against subsequent lethal doses of an intraperitoneal challenge of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The protection showed a biphasic pattern. The maximum protection, designated as the early phase protection, was seen in mice injected with P. acnes vaccine 1 to 2 days before the challenge, whereas the late phase protection was seen in mice vaccinated 16 to 22 days before the challenge. The activity of the reticuloendothelial system in mice after vaccination also showed a biphasic pattern with the peak on days 4 and 12. The delayed activation of the reticuloendothelial system lasted up to 3 weeks and coincided with the period of the late phase protection. The early phase resistance was markedly impaired by the treatment with hydrocortisone and carrageenan, but not by the treatment with anti-thymocyte serum, actinomycin D, or cyclophosphamide. The number of peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vaccinated mice increased on days 1 to 2. The number of macrophages also increased at 2 to 21 days after vaccination and reached its maximum on day 14. Total activities of acid phosphatase, Nitro Blue Tetrazolium reduction, and the phagocytic activities of peritoneal exudate cells were also enhanced on and after day 1 after the injection of P. acnes vaccine.
TI  - Bacterial colonization in intubated newborns.
AB  - The bacteriology of tracheal aspirates from 127 newborns was studied. Specimens were obtained twice a week as long as the newborns were intubated. Each newborn had between one and eight specimens taken (average 1.7). 127 babies had one specimen taken, 38 had two, 25 had three, 12 had four, and 10 had more than four specimens taken, which made a total of 212 specimens. No bacterial or fungal growth was obtained from 65 specimens, whereas the remaining specimens (147) yielded 209 bacterial and fungal isolates accounting for 1.4 isolates per specimen. The total isolates recovered were 168 aerobes, 36 anaerobes, and 5 Candida albicans. Of this total, 70 specimens yielded one isolate, 48 two isolates, 6 three isolates, 5 four isolates, and one aspirate yielded five isolates. 78 newborns (61%) received antimicrobial therapy. A higher incidence of positive cultures and the presence of more than one organism per culture were found in those infants not receiving antibiotics. More isolates per specimen were noted with increasing time of incubation. The rate of isolation Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae remained constant with increased length of intubation, the rate of recovery of Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans group streptococci, and Propionibacterium acnes increased, and the rate of isolation of Escherichia coli and anaerobic organisms decreased.
TI  - Quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  - A widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, Triton X-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. We determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. The shortest-lived was Streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. All of the others (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. K. pneumoniae, the only Gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. Thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.
TI  - [Growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy of the commercially available Vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). The media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. Analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. From the results obtained with strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides splanchnicus, Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the Vacutainer culture tubes, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.
