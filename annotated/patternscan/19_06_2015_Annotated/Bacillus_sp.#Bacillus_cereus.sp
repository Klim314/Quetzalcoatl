TI  == research into acetone removal from air by biofiltration using a biofilter with straight structure plates.
AB  == the biological air treatment method is based on the biological destruction of organic compounds using certain cultures of microorganisms. this method is simple and may be applied in many branches of industry. the main element of biological air treatment devices is a filter charge. tests were carried out using a new-generation laboratory air purifier with a plate structure. this purifier is called biofilter. the biofilter has a special system for packing material humidification which does not require additional energy inputs. in order to extend the packing material's durability, it was composed of thermally treated birch fibre. pollutant (acetone) biodegradation occurred on thermally treated wood fibre in this research. according to the performed tests and the received results, the process of biodestruction was highly efficient. when acetone was passed through biofilter's packing material at 0.08 m s-1 rate, the efficiency of the biofiltration process was from 70% up to 90%. the species of bacteria capable of removing acetone vapour from the air, i.e. bacillus (b. cereus, b. subtilis),  pseudomonas (p. aeruginosa, p. putida), stapylococcus (s. aureus) and rhodococcus sp., was identified in this study during the process of biofiltration. their amount in the biological packing material changed from 1.6 x 107 to 3.7 x 1011 cfu g-1.

TI  == diversity of foodborne bacillus volatile compounds and influence on fungal growth.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the antifungal activity of the volatile organic compounds (vocs) produced by 75 different foodborne bacillus species against aspergillus niger, a. flavus, a. parasiticus, a. clavatus, fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lactucae, and moniliophthora perniciosa and to determine the vocs responsible for the inhibition. methods and results: bacillus strains inhibited fungal growth, although with different inhibition grades, with b. subtilis, b. amyloliquefaciens and b. cereus strains as the best antifungal vocs producers. while m. perniciosa  dm4b and f. oxysporum f.sp. lactucae ma28 were the most sensitive fungi, a. parasiticus mg51 showed the greatest resistance to bacillus vocs exposure. thirty-seven compounds were detected by spme-gc-ms analysis, although similar patterns in volatile compounds were evidenced within the species, interspecific vocs differences determined different effects on fungal growth. multiple partial  least regression (mplrs) and antifungal activity of the individual vocs revealed  that only propanone, 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, acetic acid, 2-methylpropanoic acid, carbon disulfide, 3-methylbutanoic acid and ethyl acetate were responsible for mycelia inhibition of m. perniciosa dm4b and f. oxysporum f.sp. lactucae ma28. conclusions: the antagonistic activity of the bacillus vocs  was demonstrated, although it cannot easily be explained through the action of a  single molecule, thus a holistic approach could be more appropriate to estimate the fungal growth inhibition. significance and impact of the study: vocs produced by bacillus from cooked food can be considered as promising antifungal compounds  useful in the control of fungal plant pathogens. this study investigates for the  first time the correlation between mycelia inhibition of m. perniciosa and f. oxysporum f. sp. lactucae and the vocs emitted by the bacillus species. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == production, optimization and characterization of polyhydroxybutyrate, a biodegradable plastic by bacillus spp.
AB  == poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (phb) is the intracellular lipid reserve accumulated by many bacteria. the most potent terrestrial bacterium bacillus cereus se-1 showed  more phb accumulating cells (22.1 and 40% after 48 and 72 h) than that of the marine bacillus sp. cs-605 (5 and 33% after 48 and 72 h). both the isolates harbored phbb gene and the characteristics c=o peak was observed in the extracted phb by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy analysis. maltose was found to be the most suitable carbon source for the accumulation of phb in b. cereus se-1. the extracted phb sample from b. cereus se-1 was blended with a thermoplastic starch (ts) and an increased thermoplasticity and decreased crystallinity were observed after blending in comparison to the standard phb. the melting temperature (tm), melting enthalpy (hf), and crystallinity (xc) of the blended phb sample were found to be 109.4 degrees c, 64.58 j/g, and 44.23%, respectively.

TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory efficacy of extracellularly synthesized silver and gold nanoparticles by a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus bipolaris tetramera.
AB  == background: particulates of nanometers size have occupied a significant area in the field of medicinal and agricultural purposes due to their large surface-to-volume ratio and exceptional physicochemical, electronic and mechanical properties. myconanotechnology, an interface between mycology and nanotechnology is budding nowadays for nanoparticle-fabrication using fungus or its metabolites. in the present study, we have isolated and characterized a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus b. tetramera kf934408 from rhizospheric soil. this  phosphatase releasing fungus was subjected to extracellular synthesis of metal nanoparticles by redox reaction. results: silver (agnps) and gold nanoparticles (aunps) were characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron  microscopic analysis. the formulated agnps were irregular shaped with a size ranging between 54.78 nm to 73.49 nm whereas aunps were spherical or hexagonal, with a size of 58.4 and 261.73 nm, respectively. the nanoparticles were assessed  for their antibacterial and antifungal efficacy. the results showed effective antimicrobial activity of agnps against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter aeroginosa and trichoderma sp. at higher concentrations, however, aunps possessed only moderate antibacterial efficacy while they found no antifungal activity. cytotoxicity analysis of nanoparticles on j774 and thp1 alpha cell lines revealed the dose dependence in case of agnps, while aunps were  non-toxic at both low and high doses. furthermore, significant elevation of intracellular ros was observed after 4 h of incubation with both the nanoparticles. the capping of fungal proteins on the particulates might be involved in the activities demonstrated by these inert metal nanoparticles. conclusion: in conclusion, the findings showed that the metal nanoparticles synthesized by fungus b. tetramera could be used as an antimicrobial agents as well as cost effective and nontoxic immunomodulatory delivery vehicle.

TI  == biodegradation of carbofuran in soils within nzoia river basin, kenya.
AB  == carbofuran (2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethylbenzofuran-7-yl methylcarbamate) has been used within the nzoia river basin (nrb), especially in bunyala rice irrigation schemes, in kenya for the control of pests. in this study, the capacity of native bacteria to degrade carbofuran in soils from nrb was investigated. a gram positive, rod-shaped bacteria capable of degrading carbofuran was isolated through liquid cultures with carbofuran as the only carbon and nitrogen source. the isolate degraded 98% of 100-mug ml(-1) carbofuran within 10 days with the formation of carbofuran phenol as the only detectable metabolite. the degradation of carbofuran was followed by measuring its residues in liquid cultures using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). physical and morphological characteristics as well as molecular characterization confirmed the bacterial isolate to be a member of bacillus species. the results indicate that this strain of bacillus sp. could be considered as bacillus cereus or bacillus thuringiensis  with a bootstrap value of 100% similar to the 16s rrna gene sequences. the biodegradation capability of the native strains in this study indicates that they have great potential for application in bioremediation of carbofuran-contaminated soil sites.

TI  == a rapid and miniaturized method for the selection of microbial phenol degraders using colourimetric microtitration.
AB  == a high-throughput method is described, consisting of a colourimetric microtitration for screening phenol-degrading microorganisms, using a mixture of  4-aminoantipyrine and potassium ferricyanide as the colour indicator. this contemporary study summarizes a new method to determine phenol-degrading bacteria isolated from different areas. the method was used for testing a total of 72 bacteria collected from the natural environment and five known strains obtained from diagnostic and research laboratories employing 200 mg/l phenol (the linear range saturation concentration). depending on the change in colour indicator, the degradation profiles of 11 strains of bacteria are shown, of which seven strains  were able to degrade more than 80 % of phenol within 6-8 h, while the other four  strains took 12-24 h. two of the environmentally isolated strains showed high efficiency of phenol degradation and were confirmed by the high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. these strains were identified by 16s rrna sequencing as unique (escherichia coli moh1 and bacillus cereus moh2) and were deposited in the genbank of ncbi. two pathogenic strains (uropathogenic e. coli and salmonella sp.) were found to be the fast degraders of phenol, which is of medical concern, as phenol is generally used as a disinfectant in hospitals. this method can be used for the estimation and screening of phenol degraders in a single step, for its application in bioremediation as well as in hospitals for screening the phenol resistance of pathogens.

TI  == bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis cbmdc3f with antimicrobial activity against gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria: uv-maldi-tof ms analysis of its bioactive compounds.
AB  == in this work a new bacillus sp. strain, isolated from honey, was characterized phylogenetically. its antibacterial activity against three relevant foodborne pathogenic bacteria was studied; the main bioactive metabolites were analyzed using ultraviolet matrix assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (uv-maldi ms). bacillus cbmdc3f was phylogenetically characterized as bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis after rrna analysis of the 16s subunit and the gyra gene (access codes genbank jx120508 and jx120516, respectively). its antibacterial potential was evaluated against listeria monocytogenes (9 strains), b. cereus (3  strains) and staphylococcus aureus atcc29213. its cell suspension and cell-free supernatant (cfs) exerted significant anti-listeria and anti-s. aureus activities, while the lipopeptides fraction (lf) also showed anti-b. cereus effect. the uv-maldi-ms analysis revealed surfactin, iturin and fengycin in the cfs, whereas surfactin predominated in the lf. the cfs from cbmdc3f contained surfactin, iturin and fengycin with four, two and four homologues per family, respectively, whereas four surfactin, one iturin and one fengycin homologues were identified in the lf. for some surfactin homologues, their uv-maldi-tof/tof (ms/ms; laser induced decomposition method, lid) spectra were also obtained. mass spectrometry analysis contributed with relevant information about the type of lipopeptides that bacillus strains can synthesize. from our results, surfactin would be the main metabolite responsible for the antibacterial effect.

TI  == structure, activity and stereoselectivity of nadph-dependent oxidoreductases catalysing the s-selective reduction of the imine substrate 2-methylpyrroline.
AB  == oxidoreductases from streptomyces sp. gf3546 [3546-ired], bacillus cereus bag3x2  (bcired) and nocardiopsis halophila (nhired) each reduce prochiral 2-methylpyrroline (2mpn) to (s)-2-methylpyrrolidine with >95 % ee and also a number of other imine substrates with good selectivity. structures of bcired and  nhired have helped to identify conserved active site residues within this subgroup of imine reductases that have s selectivity towards 2mpn, including a tyrosine residue that has a possible role in catalysis and superimposes with an aspartate in related enzymes that display r selectivity towards the same substrate. mutation of this tyrosine residue-tyr169-in 3546-ired to phe resulted  in a mutant of negligible activity. the data together provide structural evidence for the location and significance of the tyr residue in this group of imine reductases, and permit a comparison of the active sites of enzymes that reduce 2mpn with either r or s selectivity.

TI  == [specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in southern sierra oaxaca, mexico].
AB  == specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in southern sierra  oaxaca, mexico. bats have different ecologic roles in variable ecosystems that have been already described. they have been linked to several zoonoses, however little is known about the relationship between bat microbiota and their diet, and studies on the bacterial ecology of the microbiota in bats are limited. to contribute with the description of this important interaction between microbiota  and host, the aim of this work was to characterize the composition and bacterial  diversity in the oral and anal regions of 10 species of bats, in relation to food guild. for this monthly samplings were conducted using four mist nets (19:00-24:00h) from february to october 2012; nets were reviewed every 45 minutes. each captured organism was sampled in the oral and anal cavities with sterile swabs; these were placed in pre-enrichment media and stored at 4 degrees  c. bacterial samples were studied which through selective media, chromogenic and  biochemical tests. we obtained samples from 502 frugivorous, 29 hematophagous and 11 nectivorous bats. we found a total of 26 bacterial species, with the predominant phylum proteobacteria and the family enterobacteriaceae. statistically significant differences were observed between oral and anal microhabitats: frugivorous (t = -3.516, g.1 = 14.761, p = 0.003), hematophagous (t = -3.320, g.l = 19.262, p = 0.003), and nectivorous (t = -2.497, g.l = 11.933, p = 0.026), and in some guilds [frugivorous and nectivorous in the anal region (t = 2.274, g.l = 29.660, p = 0.030), hematophagous and nectivorous anal region (t = 2.077, g.l = 29.904, p = 0.049)]. it was also shown that there is bacteria specificity in some guilds such as nectivorous and frugivorous with bacillus cereus, b. sp. x. sp., as well as, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermis, aeromonas hydrophyla in hematophagous. bacterial presence can be explained by the type of diet and/or by transfer of bacteria from their preys. these bacteria may be indigenous to these bats and play the role of mutual benefit, providing the host with stable growth conditions and supplemental nutrients, while the microbiota contributes to host nutrition, development of the immune system, stabilization of the microbial population and to avoid pathogens colonization. by understanding the importance of the relation- ship between host and its bacterial populations, the conservation efforts being made to protect species such as bats may be improved.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-clostridium activity from actinomadura sp. 2eps.
AB  == the rare actinomycetes strain 2eps was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell  wall, and 16s rrna gene sequence indicates that 2eps belongs to genus actinomadura. in addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the  relationships of this strain to other members of actinomadura. a butanol extract  with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. the structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)h-nmr and (13)c-nmr) and mass spectrometric analysis (hr-tof-ms). compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the japanese patent number jp 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are be-45722a (1), be-45722b (2) and be-45722c (3), respectively. all compounds were active against  gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, bacillus cereus atcc 14579, and b. subtilis atcc 6633) with low mic values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar mic values, against clostridium perfringens s107 at 0.63 microg/ml and c. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. these results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of clostridium infections. overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == antibacterial and cytotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized using latex of calotropis gigantea l.
AB  == the present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (agnps) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of calotropis gigantea l. toward biomedical applications. initially, synthesis of agnps was confirmed through uv-vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (spr) at 420 nm. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. energy dispersive x-ray (edax) spectroscopy confirms the  presence of silver as a major constituent element. x-ray diffractograms displays  that the synthesized agnps were biphasic crystalline nature. electron microscopic studies such as field emission scanning electron microscopic (fe-sem) and transmission electron microscope (tem) reveals that synthesized agnps are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. further, crude latex  aqueous extract and synthesized agnps were evaluated against different bacterial  pathogens such as bacillus cereus, enterococci sp, shigella sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized agnps exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. likewise in vitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized agnps against tested hela cells. the output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized agnps using latex of c. gigantea can be used as promising nanomaterial for therapeutic application in context with nanodrug formulation.

AB  == indigenous formulations based on cow dung fermentation are commonly used in organic farming. three biodynamic preparations viz., panchagavya (pg), bd500 and  'cow pat pit' (cpp) showed high counts of lactobacilli (10(9) ml(-1)) and yeasts  (10(4) ml(-1)). actinomycetes were present only in cpp (10(4) ml(-1)) and absent  in the other two. seven bacterial isolates from these ferments were identified by a polyphasic approach: bacillus safensis (pg1), bacillus cereus (pg2, pg4 pg5), bacillus subtilis (bd2) lysinibacillus xylanilyticus (bd3) and bacillus licheniformis (cpp1). this is the first report of l. xylanilyticus and b. licheniformis in biodynamic preparations. only three carbon sources-dextrose, sucrose and trehalose out of 21 tested were utilized by all the bacteria. none could utilize arabinose, dulcitol, galactose, inositol, inulin, melibiose, raffinose, rhamnose and sorbitol. all the strains produced indole acetic acid (1.8-3.7 mug ml(-1) culture filtrate) and ammonia. none could fix nitrogen; but all except b. safensis and b. licheniformis could solubilize phosphorous from insoluble tri-calcium phosphate. all the strains except l. xylaniliticus exhibited antagonism to the plant pathogen rhizoctonia bataticola whereas none could inhibit sclerotium rolfsi. in green house experiment in soil microcosms, bacterial inoculation significantly promoted growth of maize; plant dry weight increased by ~21 % due to inoculation with b. cereus (pg2). results provide a basis for understanding the beneficial effects of biodynamic preparations and industrial deployment of the strains.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a furfural-degrading bacterium bacillus cereus  sp. strain ds1.
AB  == furfural was found to be the main organic pollutant in the wastewater coming from the diosgenin factory. this substance is derived from acidic pentosan in dioscorea zingiberensis and is also found in a variety of agricultural byproducts, including corncobs, oat, wheat bran, and sawdust. it is regarded as a toxicant and an inhibitor to the growth of microorganism in both sewage disposal  and biological fermentation. a furfural-degrading strain (ds1) was isolated from  activated sludge of wastewater treatment plant in a diosgenin factory by continuous enrichment culture. the strain was identified as bacillus cereus based on morphological, physiological tests, as well as on 16s rdna sequence and biolog analyses. the capacity of this strain to grow on a mineral salt medium, utilizing furfural as the sole carbon and energy source to degrade furfural, was investigated in this study. under the condition of ph 9.0, temperature 35 degrees c, with rotating speed of 150 rpm, and an inoculum of 6 %, the strain showed that the furfural degradation capacity reaches 35 % in 7 days, as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. the addition of inorganic carbon sources  could bring down the biodegradation efficiency of the furfural. the strain ds1 showed better furfural removal capacity, as compared to other inorganic carbon sources in the media. furthermore, a furfural concentration of as high as 4,000 mg l(-1) was tolerated by the culture. the capacity to degrade furfural was demonstrated for the first time by using the genus b. cereus. this study suggests the possible application in biodegradation strategies.

AB  == a pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, rrlj 04, and a bacillus cereus strain, bs 03, were tested both individually and in combination with a rhizobium strain, rh 2, for their ability to enhance plant growth and nodulation in pigeon pea (cajanus cajan l.) under gnotobiotic, greenhouse and field conditions. both of the rhizobacterial strains exhibited a positive effect on growth in terms of shoot height, root length, fresh and dry weight, nodulation and yield over the non-treated control. co-inoculation of seeds with these strains and rhizobium rh  2 also reduced the number of wilted plants, when grown in soil infested with fusarium udum. gnotobiotic studies confirmed that the suppression of wilt disease was due to the presence of the respective pgpr strains. seed bacterization with drug-marked mutants of rrlj 04 and bs 03 confirmed their ability to colonize and  multiply along the roots. the results suggest that co-inoculation of these strains with rhizobium strain rh 2 can be further exploited for enhanced growth,  nodulation and yield in addition to control of fusarial wilt in pigeon pea.

TI  == the self-assembly of a cyclic lipopeptides mixture secreted by a b. megaterium strain and its implications on activity against a sensitive bacillus species.
AB  == cyclic lipopeptides are produced by a soil bacillus megaterium strain and several other bacillus species. in this work, they are detected both in the bacillus intact cells and the cells culture medium by maldi-tof mass spectrometry. the cyclic lipopeptides self-assemble in water media producing negatively charged and large aggregates (300-800 nm of mean hydrodynamic radius) as evaluated by dynamic light scattering and zeta-potential analysis. the aggregate size depends on ph and ionic strength. however, it is not affected by changes in the osmolarity of the outer medium suggesting the absence of an internal aqueous compartment despite the occurrence of low molecular weight phospholipids in their composition as determined from inorganic phosphorus analysis. the activity against a sensitive bacillus cereus strain was evaluated from inhibition halos and b. cereus lysis. essential features determining the antibiotic activity on susceptible bacillus cereus cells are the preserved cyclic moiety conferring cyclic lipopeptides resistance to proteases and the medium ph. the aggregates are inactive per se at the ph of the culture medium which is around 6 or below. the knock out of the sensitive cells only takes place when the aggregates are disassembled due to a high negative charge at ph above 6.

TI  == isolation and characterization of chitinase-producing bacillus and paenibacillus  strains from salted and fermented shrimp, acetes japonicus.
AB  == chitinases catalyze the conversion of chitin and are produced by a wide range of  bacteria. the biological applications of these enzymes have been exploited in food and pharmaceutical industries. we isolated 2 halophilic chitinase-producing  novel strains of bacteria-sch-1 and sch-2 from saeu-jeot, a traditional korean salted and fermented food made with shrimp (acetes japonicus). the isolated strains- sch-1 and sch-2 were gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore-forming facultative anaerobes, with strain sch-2 showing peritrichous flagella. molecular characterization of the 16s rrna gene identified the strains sch-1 and sch-2 as bacillus sp. and paenibacillus sp. respectively. basic local alignment search tool and subsequent phylogenetic analysis of strain sch-1 showed an identity of 97.83% with bacillus cereus atcc 14579 (nr_074540), whereas strain sch-2 showed an identity of 99.16% with paenibacillus lautus jcm 9073 (nr_040882). furthermore, the sch-1 strain could use glucose, n-acetyl glucosamine, esculin, and maltose as carbon source substrates. cellular fatty acid analysis showed that iso-c15:0 and anteiso-c15:0 are the major acids in strain sch-1 and sch-2, respectively. the sch-1 strain showed a higher chitinase activity at 15.71 unit/mg protein compared with sch-2 strain. chitinase isozymes of bacillus sp. sch-1was expressed as 2 bands having sizes of 41 and 50 kda, and as 4 bands with  sizes of 30, 37, 45.7, and 50 kda in paenibacillus sp. sch-2. the rich chitinase  activity with the isozyme profiles of the isolated bacillus and paenibacillus strains provide advancement in the study of fermentation and may play putative functions in the chitin bioconversion of sea crustacean foods.

TI  == tuning the biological activity profile of antibacterial polymers via subunit substitution pattern.
AB  == binary nylon-3 copolymers containing cationic and hydrophobic subunits can mimic  the biological properties of host-defense peptides, but relationships between composition and activity are not yet well understood for these materials. hydrophobic subunits in previously studied examples have been limited mostly to cycloalkane-derived structures, with cyclohexyl proving to be particularly promising. the present study evaluates alternative hydrophobic subunits that are  isomeric or nearly isomeric with the cyclohexyl example; each has four sp(3) carbons in the side chains. the results show that varying the substitution pattern of the hydrophobic subunit leads to relatively small changes in antibacterial activity but causes significant changes in hemolytic activity. we hypothesize that these differences in biological activity profile arise, at least in part, from variations among the conformational propensities of the hydrophobic subunits. the alpha,alpha,beta,beta-tetramethyl unit is optimal among the subunits we have examined, providing copolymers with potent antibacterial activity and excellent prokaryote vs eukaryote selectivity. bacteria do not readily develop resistance to the new antibacterial nylon-3 copolymers. these findings suggest that variation in subunit conformational properties could be generally valuable in the development of synthetic polymers for biological applications.

TI  == effects of a skin neuropeptide (substance p) on cutaneous microflora.
AB  == background: skin is the largest human neuroendocrine organ and hosts the second most numerous microbial population but the interaction of skin neuropeptides with the microflora has never been investigated. we studied the effect of substance p  (sp), a peptide released by nerve endings in the skin on bacterial virulence. methodology/principal findings: bacillus cereus, a member of the skin transient microflora, was used as a model. exposure to sp strongly stimulated the cytotoxicity of b. cereus (+553+/-3% with sp 10(-6) m) and this effect was rapid  (<5 min). infection of keratinocytes with sp treated b. cereus led to a rise in caspase1 and morphological alterations of the actin cytoskeleton. secretome analysis revealed that sp stimulated the release of collagenase and superoxide dismutase. moreover, we also noted a shift in the surface polarity of the bacteria linked to a peel-off of the s-layer and the release of s-layer proteins. meanwhile, the biofilm formation activity of b. cereus was increased. the thermo  unstable ribosomal elongation factor (ef-tu) was identified as the sp binding site in b. cereus. other gram positive skin bacteria, namely staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis also reacted to sp by an increase of virulence. thermal water from uriage-les-bains and an artificial polysaccharide (teflose(r)) were capable to antagonize the effect of sp on bacterial virulence.  conclusions/significance: sp is released in sweat during stress and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of numerous skin diseases through neurogenic inflammation. our study suggests that a direct effect of sp on the skin microbiote should be another mechanism.

AB  == the cell free culture filtrate of bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, rhabditis (oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. the structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (fabms, (1)h  nmr, (13)c nmr, (1)h-(1)h cosy, (1)h-(13)c hmbc) and marfey's method. the compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (cdps): cyclo(l-pro-l-trp), cyclo(l-leu-l-val), cyclo(d-pro-d-met), and cyclo(d-pro-d-phe), respectively. compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant s. aureus) except cyclo(l-leu-l-val). cyclo(l-leu-l-val) recorded activity only against gram positive bacteria. best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against s. aureus (4 mug/ml). the four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (trichophyton rubrum, aspergillus flavus, candida albicans, candida tropicalis and cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin b, the standard fungicide. the highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) was recorded against t. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. the activity of cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against t. rubrum, c. neoformans and c. albicans were better than amphotericin b, the standard antifungal agent. to our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of cdps against the human pathogenic fungi t. rubrum and c. neoformans. the four cdps are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. we conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.

TI  == the diversity and antimicrobial activity of preussia sp. endophytes isolated from australian dry rainforests.
AB  == limited knowledge currently exists regarding species diversity and antimicrobial  activity of endophytic isolates of preussia within australia. this report describes endophytic preussia species that were identified through molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. screening for antimicrobial secondary metabolites was determined by testing crude ethyl acetate (etoac) extracts derived from fungal mycelia against a panel of atcc type strains which included bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and the opportunist yeast pathogen candida albicans. subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography generated fractions of bioactive etoac extracts which were subject to confirmatory testing using the clinical and laboratory standards institute reference microdilution antimicrobial activity assay. a total of 18 preussia were isolated from nine host plants with 6/18 having a <97 % sequence similarity to other known species in genbank, suggesting  that they are new species. in preliminary screening, 13/18 preussia isolates revealed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes tested, whilst 6/18 isolates, including 4/6 putative new species showed specific antimicrobial activity against mrsa and c. albicans. these results highlight the  antimicrobial potential of australian preussia spp. and also the importance of australian dry rainforests as an untapped repository of potentially significant bioactive compounds.

TI  == purification and characterization of two polyhydroxyalcanoates from bacillus cereus.
AB  == this work aimed to study the potential of 155 strains of bacillus sp., isolated from a collection of tunisian microorganisms, for polyhydroxyalcanoates production. the strains were submitted to a battery of standard tests commonly used for determining bioplastic properties. the findings revealed that two of the isolates, namely bacillus us 163 and us 177, provided red excitations at a wavelength of approximately 543 nm. the polyhydroxyalcanoates produced by the two strains were purified. gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (gc-ms), fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ftir), and gel permeation chromatography (gpc) were used to characterize the two biopolymers. bacillus us 163 was noted to produce a poly methyl-3-hydroxy tetradecanoic acid (p-3htd) with an average molecular weight of 455 kda, a completely amorphous homopolymer without crystallinity. the us 177 strain produced a homopolymer of methyl-3-hydroxy octadecanoic acid (p3-hod) with an average molecular weight of 555 kda. exhibiting the highest performance, us 163 and us 177 were submitted to 16s rrna  gene sequencing, and the results revealed that they belonged to the bacillus cereus species. overall, the findings indicated that the bacilli from petroleum soil have a number of promising properties that make them promising candidates for bioplastic production.

TI  == description of bacillus toyonensis sp. nov., a novel species of the bacillus cereus group, and pairwise genome comparisons of the species of the group by means of ani calculations.
AB  == strain bct-7112(t) was isolated in 1966 in japan from a survey designed to obtain naturally occurring microorganisms as pure cultures in the laboratory for use as  probiotics in animal nutrition. this strain, which was primarily identified as bacillus cereus var toyoi, has been in use for more than 30 years as the active ingredient of the preparation toyocerin((r)), an additive for use in animal nutrition (e.g. swine, poultry, cattle, rabbits and aquaculture). despite the fact that the strain was initially classified as b. cereus, it showed significant genomic differences from the type strains of the b. cereus group that were large  enough (ani values below 92%) to allow it to be considered as a different species within the group. the polyphasic taxonomic study presented here provides sufficient discriminative parameters to classify bct-7112(t) as a new species for which the name bacillus toyonensis sp. nov. is proposed, with bct-7112(t) (=cect  876(t); =ncimb 14858(t)) being designated as the type strain. in addition, a pairwise comparison between the available genomes of the whole b. cereus group by means of average nucleotide identity (ani) calculations indicated that besides the eight classified species (including b. toyonensis), additional genomospecies  could be detected, and most of them also had ani values below 94%. ani values were on the borderline of a species definition only in the cases of representatives of b. cereus versus b. thuringiensis, and b. mycoides and b. weihenstephanensis.

TI  == synergized antimicrobial activity of eugenol incorporated polyhydroxybutyrate films against food spoilage microorganisms in conjunction with pediocin.
AB  == biopolymers and biopreservatives produced by microorganisms play an essential role in food technology. polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacteriocins produced by bacteria are promising components to safeguard the environment and for food preservation applications. polyhydroxybutyrate (phb)-based antimicrobial films were prepared incorporating eugenol, from 10 to 200 mug/g of phb. the films were  evaluated for antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, spoilage bacteria, and fungi such as staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus cereus, aspergillus flavus, aspergillus niger, penicillium  sp., and rhizopus sp. the synergistic antimicrobial activity of the films in the  presence of crude pediocin was also investigated. the broth system containing pediocin (soluble form) as well as antimicrobial phb film demonstrated an extended lag phase and a significant growth reduction at the end of 24 h against  the bacteria. crude pediocin alone could not elicit antifungal activity, while inhibition of growth and sporulation were observed in the presence of antimicrobial phb film containing eugenol (80 mug/g) until 7 days in the case of  molds, i.e., a. niger, a. flavus, penicillium sp., and rhizopus sp. in potato dextrose broth. in the present study, we identified that use of pediocin containing broth in conjunction with eugenol incorporated phb film could function in synergized form, providing effective hurdle toward food contaminating microorganisms. furthermore, tensile strength, percent crystallinity, melting point, percent elongation to break, glass transition temperature, and seal strength of the phb film with and without eugenol incorporation were investigated. the migration of eugenol on exposure to different liquid food simulants was also analyzed using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. the study is expected to provide applications for pediocin in conjunction with eugenol containing phb film to enhance the shelf life of foods in the food industry.

TI  == monitoring the ecology of bacillus during daqu incubation, a fermentation starter, using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == daqu, a traditional fermentation starter, has been used to produce attractively flavored foods such as vinegar and chinese liquor for thousands of years. although bacillus spp. are one of the dominant microorganisms in daqu, more precise information is needed to reveal why and how bacillus became dominant in daqu, and next, to assess the impact of bacillus sp. on daqu and its derived products. we combined culture-dependent and culture-independent methods to study  the ecology of bacillus during daqu incubation. throughout the incubation, 67 presumptive bacillus spp. isolates were obtained, 52 of which were confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing. the identified organisms belonged to 8 bacillus species: b.  licheniformis, b. subtilis, b. amyloliquefaciens, b. cereus, b. circulans, b. megaterium, b. pumilus, and b. anthracis. a primer set specific for bacillus and  related genera was used in a selective pcr study, followed by a nested dgge pcr targeting the v9 region of the 16s rdna. species identified from the pcr-dgge fingerprints were related to b. licheniformis, b. subtilis, b. amyloliquefaciens, b. pumilus, b. benzoevorans, and b. foraminis. the predominant species was found  to be b. licheniformis. certain b. licheniformis strains exhibited potent antimicrobial activities. the greatest species diversity occurred at the liangmei stage of daqu incubation. to date, we lack sufficient knowledge of bacillus distribution in daqu. elucidating the ecology of bacillus during daqu incubation  would enable the impact of bacillus on daqu to be accessed, and the quality and stabilization of daqu-derived products to be optimized.

TI  == microbiological assessment of indoor air of a teaching hospital in nigeria.
AB  == objective: to investigate the quality of indoor air of different wards and units  of olabisi onabanjo university teaching hospital, sagamu, to ascertain their contribution to infection rate in the hospital. methods: the microbial quality of indoor air of nine wards/units of olabisi onabanjo university teaching hospital,  sagamu, nigeria was conducted. sedimentation technique using open petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed and samplings were done twice daily, one in the morning shortly after cleaning and before influx of people/patients into the wards/units and the other in the evening when a lot of activities would have taken place in these wards. isolates were identified according to standard methods. results: results showed that there was a statistically significant difference (chi(2) = 6.016 7) in the bacteria population of the different sampling time whereas it was not so for fungi population (chi(2) = 0.285 7). male medical ward (mmw) and male surgical general  (msg) recorded the highest bacterial and fungal growth while the operating theatre (ot) was almost free of microbial burden. the bacteria isolates were staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes and serratia marscences while the fungi isolates included  aspergillus flavus, penicillium sp., fusarium sp., candida albicans and alternaria sp. staphylococcus aureus was the predominantly isolated bacterium while penicillium sp. was the most isolated fungus. conclusions: though most of the microbial isolates were potential and or opportunistic pathogens, there was no correlation between the isolates in this study and the surveillance report of  nosocomial infection during the period of study, hence the contribution of the indoor air cannot be established. from the reduction noticed in the morning samples, stringent measures such as proper disinfection and regular cleaning, restriction of patient relatives' movement in and out of the wards/units need to  be enforced so as to improve the quality of indoor air of our hospital wards/units.

TI  == distinct functions of polysaccharide deacetylases in cell shape, neutral polysaccharide synthesis and virulence of bacillus anthracis.
AB  == peptidoglycan deacetylases (pgng-dacs) belong to the carbohydrate esterase family 4 (ce4) and have been described as required for bacterial evasion to lysozyme and innate immune responses. interestingly, there is an unusual occurrence of 10 putative polysaccharide deacetylases, including five pgng-dacs, in the bacillus sp. genomes, especially b. cereus and b. anthracis. to elucidate the physiological role of these multiple deacetylases, we employed genetic analysis and protein localization studies of five putative pgng-dacs from b. anthracis as  well as biochemical analysis of their corresponding homologues from b. cereus. our data confirm that three enzymes are pgng-dacs. while ba1977, associated with  lateral peptidoglycan synthesis, is a bona fide peptidoglycan deacetylase involved in resistance to host lysozyme and required for full virulence, ba1961 and ba3679 participate in the biogenesis of the peptidoglycan during both elongation and cell division. furthermore, two enzymes are important for neutral  polysaccharide attachment to pg and consequently anchoring of s-layer proteins (ba5436) and for polysaccharide modification (ba2944). our results provide novel  and fundamental insights into the function of polysaccharide deacetylases in a major bioterrorism agent.

AB  == our previous work showed that a consortium of three plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (pgpr) strains (bacillus cereus ar156, bacillus subtilis sm21, and serratia sp. xy21), termed as bbs for short, was a promising biocontrol agent. the present study investigated its effect on drought tolerance in cucumber plants. after withholding watering for 13 days, bbs-treated cucumber plants had much darker green leaves and substantially lighter wilt symptoms than control plants. compared to the control, the bbs treatment decreased the leaf monodehydroascorbate (mda) content and relative electrical conductivity by 40% and 15%, respectively; increased the leaf proline content and the root recovery intension by 3.45-fold and 50%, respectively; and also maintained the leaf chlorophyll content in cucumber plants under drought stress. besides, in relation to the control, the bbs treatment significantly enhanced the superoxide dismutase (sod) activity and mitigated the drought-triggered down-regulation of the expression of the genes capx, rbcl, and rbcs encoding cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxy/oxygenase (rubisco) large and small subunits, respectively, in cucumber leaves. however, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc) deaminase activity was undetected in none of the culture solutions of three bbs constituent strains. these results indicated that bbs conferred induced systemic tolerance to drought stress in cucumber plants, by protecting plant cells, maintaining photosynthetic efficiency and root vigor and increasing some of antioxidase activities, without involving the action of acc deaminase to lower plant ethylene levels.

AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) are considered one of the most ancient components of the innate immune system. they are able to exert their protection activity against a variety of microorganisms, and are widely distributed in both vertebrates and invertebrates. in this paper we focused on an amp identified in the antarctic teleost chionodraco hamatus, an icefish species. the cdna sequence  of the amp, named chionodracine, is comprised of 515 bp and translates for a putative protein precursor of 80 amino acids, with a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. the structural features evidenced in the primary sequence of chionodracine lead to the inclusion of the peptide in the antimicrobial family of piscidins. the analysis by real-time pcr of the basal gene transcripts of chionodracine in different icefish tissues showed that the highest expression was found in gills,  followed by head kidney. the chionodracine expression levels in head kidney leukocytes were up-regulated in vitro both by lps and poly i:c, and in vivo by lps. a putative chionodracine mature peptide was synthesized and employed to obtain a polyclonal antiserum, which was used in immunohistochemistry of gills sections and revealed a significant positivity associated with mast cells. the bactericidal activity of the peptide was investigated and found significant against antarctic psychrophilic bacteria strains (psychrobacter sp. tad1 and ta144), the gram-positive bacillus cereus, and at a lesser extent against the gram-negative escherichia coli. interestingly, the haemolytic activity of chionodracine was tested in vitro on human erythrocytes and no significant lysis  occurred until peptide concentration of 50 mum.

TI  == statistical optimization of a novel low-cost medium based on regional agro-industrial by-products for the production of proteolytic enzymes by bacillus cereus.
AB  == bacillus sp. are specific producers of peptidase amongst bacteria and peptidase enzymes and are of significant ones due to their multifarious applications. advances in industrial biotechnology offer potential opportunities for economic utilization of agro-industrial by-products for many biochemical reactions. due to their rich organic nature, they can serve as an ideal substrate for the production of different value added products like peptidases. in the present work, an attempt was made to optimize different variables by taguchi methodology  for the production of peptidase using agro-industrial by-products hydrolyzed by a bacillus cereus strain, resulting in brewer's spent grain (bsg) being the optimal organic substrate. subsequently, operative variables for the bsg were investigated using taguchi methodology in order to maximize the enzyme production. additionally, the main medium components were optimized using a mixture design. finally, the production of peptidase by b. cereus was investigated; also the possible interaction with other proteolytic microbial strains was evaluated. a notorious synergistic effect was observed when b. cereus was inoculated with pseudomonas sp. these brought a triple benefit, first, opening the possibility to produce technical enzymes at low cost, second, giving  greater value to a food industry by-product, and third, reducing the environmental impact caused by the product removal directly into the environment.

TI  == antibacterial activity of pseudoalteromonas in the coral holobiont.
AB  == corals harbor diverse and abundant prokaryotic populations. bacterial communities residing in the coral mucus layer may be either pathogenic or symbiotic. some species may produce antibiotics as a method of controlling populations of competing microbial species. the present study characterizes cultivable pseudoalteromonas sp. isolated from the mucus layer of different coral species from the northern gulf of eilat, red sea, israel. six mucus-associated pseudoalteromonas spp. obtained from different coral species were screened for antibacterial activity against 23 tester strains. five of the six pseudoalteromonas strains demonstrated extracellular antibacterial activity against gram-positive-but not gram-negative-tester strains. active substances secreted into the cell-free supernatant are heat-tolerant and inhibit growth of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and of ten endogenous gram-positive marine bacteria isolated from corals. the pseudoalteromonas spp. isolated from red sea corals aligned in a phylogenetic tree with previously isolated pseudoalteromonas spp. of marine origin that demonstrated antimicrobial activity. these results suggest that coral mucus-associated pseudoalteromonas may play a protective role in the coral holobiont's defense against potential gram-positive  coral pathogens.

TI  == microbiological and physicochemical characterisation of caxiri, an alcoholic beverage produced by the indigenous juruna people of brazil.
AB  == caxiri is a traditional fermented alcoholic beverage produced from cassava and sweet potatoes by the indigenous juruna or yudja people in brazil. our results showed that caxiri fermentation is invariably associated with the following: (i)  an increase in the total microbial population, with yeast being the largest group detected; (ii) a decrease in reducing sugars, malic, tartaric, succinic, oxalic and propionic acid; and (iii) a final product characterised by a high content of  ethanol and a high concentration of lactic acid. the microbial community dynamics were investigated by culture-based and culture-independent approaches. fermentation was assisted by a complex microbial community that changed in structure and composition during the fermentative process. the bacterial population ranged from 3.05 to 5.33 log/ml, and the yeast population varied from  3.27 log cfu/ml to 7.34 log cfu/ml, showing that yeasts dominated the fermentation process after 48 h. a total of 343 colonies of bacteria and 205 colonies of yeasts were isolated and initially grouped by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) and by biochemical features. phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequences of representative isolates showed that the bacteria were mainly represented by endospore-forming low-g+c content gram-positive bacilli (bacillus spp.; 61.5% of the isolates), with bacillus pumilus, bacillus spp. (bacillus cereus group), and bacillus subtilis being the main species identified. the species sphingomonas sp. and pediococcus acidilactici were also found. the dominant yeast identified was saccharomyces cerevisiae. rhodotorula mucilaginosa, pichia membranifaciens, pichia guilliermondii and cryptococcus luteolus were also found. according to the polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge)  analysis, the microbial communities present during fermentation were probably from the raw materials, ambient or present on the utensils used during beverage preparation. the results indicated the necessity to combine both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods for a better description of the microbial communities in indigenous starch fermentations. also, ph values decreased from 4.76 to 3.15 during fermentation. the ethanol concentration was 83.9 g/l and lactic acid reached 27.89 g/l by the end of the fermentation process.

AB  == an aerobic endospore-forming bacillus (nvh 391-98(t)) was isolated during a severe food poisoning outbreak in france in 1998, and four other similar strains  have since been isolated, also mostly from food poisoning cases. based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, these strains were shown to belong to the bacillus cereus group (over 97% similarity with the current group species) and phylogenetic distance from other validly described species of the genus bacillus  was less than 95%. based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity and mlst data, these novel strains were shown to form a robust and well-separated cluster in the b. cereus group, and constituted the most distant cluster from species of this group. major fatty acids (iso-c(15:0), c(16:0), iso-c(17:0), anteiso-c(15 : 0), iso-c(16:0), iso-c(13:0)) supported the affiliation of these strains to the genus bacillus, and more specifically to the b. cereus group. nvh 391-98(t) taxon was more specifically characterized by an abundance of iso-c(15:0) and low amounts of iso-c(13:0) compared with other members of the b. cereus group. genome similarity together with dna-dna hybridization values and physiological and biochemical tests made it possible to genotypically and phenotypically differentiate nvh 391-98(t) taxon from the six current b. cereus group species. nvh 391-98(t) therefore represents a novel species, for which the name bacillus cytotoxicus sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain nvh 391-98(t) (= dsm 22905(t) = cip 110041(t)).

TI  == isolation and growth characteristics of chromium(vi) and pentachlorophenol tolerant bacterial isolate from treated tannery effluent for its possible use in  simultaneous bioremediation.
AB  == the bacterial strains resistant to pentachlorophenol (pcp) and hexavalent chromium [cr(vi)] were isolated from treated tannery effluent of a common effluent treatment plant. most of the physico-chemical parameters analyzed were above permissible limits. thirty-eight and four bacterial isolates, respectively  were found resistant to >50 mug/ml concentration of [cr(vi)] and the same level of pcp. out of the above 42 isolates, only one was found simultaneously tolerant  to higher levels of both pcp (500 mug/ml) and cr(vi) (200 mug/ml), and hence was  selected for further studies. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in which a native bacterial isolate simultaneously tolerant to such a high concentrations of cr(vi) and pcp has been reported. the culture growth was best at 0.4% (w/v) glucose as an additional carbon source and 0.2% (w/v) ammonium chloride as a nitrogen source. the growth results with cow urine as a nitrogen source were comparable with the best nitrogen source ammonium chloride. the isolate exhibited resistance to multiple heavy metals (pb, as, hg, zn, co & ni) and to antibiotics nalidixic acid and polymixin-b. the efficacy of bacterial isolate for growth, pcp degradation (56.5%) and cr(vi) bioremediation (74.5%) was best at 48 h incubation. the isolate was identified as bacillus sp. by morphological and biochemical tests. the 16s rdna sequence analysis revealed 98%  homology with bacillus cereus. however, further molecular analysis is underway to ascertain its likelyhood of a novel species.

TI  == the pore-forming protein cry5b elicits the pathogenicity of bacillus sp. against  caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  == the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis is a pathogen of insects and nematodes  and is very closely related to, if not the same species as, bacillus cereus and bacillus anthracis. the defining characteristic of b. thuringiensis that sets it  apart from b. cereus and b. anthracis is the production of crystal (cry) proteins, which are pore-forming toxins or pore-forming proteins (pfps). although it is known that pfps are important virulence factors since their elimination results in reduced virulence of many pathogenic bacteria, the functions by which  pfps promote virulence are incompletely understood. here we study the effect of cry proteins in b. thuringiensis pathogenesis of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans. we find that whereas b. thuringiensis on its own is not able to infect c. elegans, the addition of the pfp cry protein, cry5b, results in a robust lethal infection that consumes the nematode host in 1-2 days, leading to a "bob"  or bag-of-bacteria phenotype. unlike other infections of c. elegans characterized to date, the infection by b. thuringiensis shows dose-dependency based on bacterial inoculum size and based on pfp concentration. although the infection process takes 1-2 days, the pfp-instigated infection process is irreversibly established within 15 minutes of initial exposure. remarkably, treatment of c. elegans with cry5b pfp is able to instigate many other bacillus species, including b. anthracis and even "non-pathogenic" bacillus subtilis, to become lethal and infectious agents to c. elegans. co-culturing of cry5b-expressing b. thuringiensis with b. anthracis can result in lethal infection of c. elegans by b. anthracis. our data demonstrate that one potential property of pfps is to sensitize the host to bacterial infection and further that c. elegans and probably other roundworms can be common hosts for b. cereus-group bacteria, findings with important ecological and research implications.

TI  == diversity, mobility, and structural and functional evolution of group ii introns  carrying an unusual 3' extension.
AB  == background: group ii introns are widespread genetic elements endowed with a dual  functionality. they are catalytic rnas (ribozymes) that are able of self-splicing and they are also mobile retroelements that can invade genomic dna. the group ii  intron rna secondary structure is typically made up of six domains. however, a number of unusual group ii introns carrying a unique extension of 53-56 nucleotides at the 3' end have been identified previously in bacteria of the bacillus cereus group. methods: in the present study, we conducted combined sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses of introns, host gene, plasmid and chromosome of host strains in order to gain insights into mobility, dispersal, and evolution of the unusual introns and their extension. we also performed in vitro mutational and kinetic experiments to investigate possible functional features related to the extension. results: we report the identification of novel copies of group ii introns carrying a 3' extension including the first two copies in bacteria not belonging to the b. cereus group, bacillus pseudofirmus of4 and bacillus sp. 2_a_57_ct2, an uncharacterized species phylogenetically close to b.  firmus. interestingly, the b. pseudofirmus intron has a longer extension of 70 bases. from sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses, several possible separate events of mobility involving the atypical introns could be identified, including both retrohoming and retrotransposition events. in addition, identical  extensions were found in introns that otherwise exhibit little sequence conservation in the rest of their structures, with the exception of the conserved and catalytically critical domains v and vi, suggesting either separate acquisition of the extra segment by different group ii introns or a strong selection pressure acting on the extension. furthermore, we show by in vitro splicing experiments that the 3' extension affects the splicing properties differently in introns belonging to separate evolutionary branches. conclusions:  altogether this study provides additional insights into the structural and functional evolution of unusual introns harboring a 3' extension and lends further evidence that these introns are mobile with their extension.

AB  == a gram-positive, endospore-forming, new bacillus species, strain bl4-6(t), was isolated from tidal flat sediment of the yellow sea. strain bl4-6(t) is a straight rod, with motility by peritrichate flagella. the cell wall contains meso-diaminopimelic acid, and the major respiratory quinone is menaquinone-7. the major fatty acids are iso-c(15:0) and summed feature 3 (containing c(16:1) omega7c/iso-c(15:0) 2oh, and/or iso-c(15:0) 2oh/c(16:1) omega7c). cells are catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. the g+c content of the genomic dna is 38.0 mol%. based on a comparative 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, the isolate belongs to the genus bacillus, forms a clade with the bacillus cereus group, and  is closely related to bacillus mycoides (98.5%), bacillus cereus (98.5%), bacillus anthracis (98.4%), bacillus thuringiensis (98.4%), bacillus weihenstephanensis (98.1%), and bacillus pseudomycoides (97.5%). the isolate showed less than 85% similarity of the gyra gene sequence and below 95% similarity of the rpob gene sequence to the members of this group. dna-dna relatedness between strain bl4-6(t) and b. cereus group was found to be in a range of 22.8-42.3%, and thus bl4-6(t) represents a unique species. on the basis  of these studies, strain bl4-6(t) (=kctc 13319(t) =jcm 15802(t)) is proposed to represent the type strain of a novel species, bacillus manliponensis sp. nov.

TI  == removal of high concentrations of nh(3) by a combined photoreactor and biotrickling filter system.
AB  == average emission levels as high as 800 ppm(v) nh(3) have often been found during  the anaerobic fermentation process. at these levels, nh(3) is regarded as an environmental toxic compound. high concentrations of nh(3) gas are difficult to treat in a single treatment process, suggesting that, in terms of economic cost and treatment performance, a coupled system may be a feasible technological alternative. in the coupled tio(2) photocatalytic-biological treatment system evaluated here, the optimal gas retention time for nh(3) removal--in terms of removal efficiency and capital cost--was 26 s. high gas temperatures, high nh(3)  concentrations, and low oxygen contents were unfavorable conditions for nh(3) removal by the photoreactor. the coupled system successfully removed concentrated nh(3) gas (r % > 97 %) under disrupted and shutdown conditions. the photoreactor  component of the system successfully fulfilled its role as a pretreatment process and enhanced the performance of the biotrickling filter at a high inlet nh(3) load (2,277 g-n m(-3) day(-1)). potential ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, including bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas sp., were isolated  under the high inlet nh(3) load condition. these microbial strains have a potential as biological agents in the removal of high concentrations of nh(3) in  waste gas or wastewater.

TI  == n-acyl-homoserine lactones from enterobacter sakazakii (cronobacter spp.) and their degradation by bacillus cereus enzymes.
AB  == a chemical study of acyl-homoserine lactones (acyl-hsls) produced by enterobacter sakazakii resulted in the identification of three molecules: (s)-n-heptanoyl-hsl, (s)-n-dodecanoyl-hsl and (s)-n-tetradecanoyl-hsl. mixed cultures of e. sakazakii  and bacillus cereus depleted e. sakazakii acyl-hsls, suggesting acyl-hsl degradation by b. cereus hydrolases (hydrolysis of the lactone or amide moiety).  the expression of b. cereus acyl-hsl lactonase and acyl-homoserine acylase was confirmed by monitoring the biotransformation of (s)-n-dodecanoyl-hsl into (s)-n-dodecanoyl-homoserine, dodecanoic acid and homoserine in the presence of b. cereus whole cells, using electrospray-mass spectrometry (esi-ms).

AB  == to explore bacterial diversity for elucidating genetic variability in acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) lactonase structure, we screened 800 bacterial strains. it revealed the presence of a quorum quenching (qq) ahl-lactonase gene (aiia) in 42 strains. these 42 strains were identified using rrs (16s rdna) sequencing as bacillus strains, predominantly b. cereus. an in silico restriction endonuclease (re) digestion of 22 ahl lactonase gene (aiia) sequences (from ncbi  database) belonging to 9 different genera, along with 42 aiia gene sequences from different bacillus spp. (isolated here) with 14 type ii res, revealed distinct patterns of fragments (nucleotide length and order) with four res; alui, dpnii, rsai, and tru9i. our study reflects on the biodiversity of aiia among bacillus species. bacillus sp. strain mbg11 with polymorphism (115alanine > valine) may confer increased stability to ahl lactonase, and can be a potential candidate for heterologous expression and mass production. microbes with ability to produce ahl-lactonases degrade quorum sensing signals such as ahl by opening of the lactone ring. the naturally occurring diversity of qq molecules provides opportunities to use them for preventing bacterial infections, spoilage of food,  and bioremediation.

AB  == arsenic (as) contamination of groundwater is a serious environmental health management issue of drinking water sources especially in terai region of nepal. many studies have reported that due to natural abundance of arsenic in the environment, various bacteria have developed different resistance mechanisms for  arsenic compound. in this study, the culturable arsenic-resistant bacteria indigenous to surfacewater as well as groundwater from rautahat district of nepal were randomly isolated by standard plate count method on the basis of viable growth on plate count agar amended with arsenate ranging from 0, 0.5, 10, 40, 80  to 160 milligram per liter (mg/l). with respect to the morphological and biochemical tests, nine morphologically distinct potent arsenate tolerant bacteria showed relatedness with micrococcus varians, micrococcus roseus, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas maltophilia, pseudomonas sp., vibrio parahaemolyticus, bacillus cereus, bacillus smithii 1 and bacillus smithii 2. the isolates were capable of tolerating more than 1000 mg/l of arsenate and 749 mg/l  of arsenite. likewise, bioaccumulation capability was highest with m. roseus (85.61%) and the least with b. smithii (47.88%) indicating the potential of the organisms in arsenic resistance and most probably in bioremediation.

TI  == effects of photoactivated titanium dioxide nanopowders and coating on planktonic  and biofilm growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == we exploited the ability of photocatalytic titanium dioxide (tio(2)) as an agent  for the biofilm control. two photocatalytic systems were investigated: a 3 g l(-1) suspension of tio(2) nanopowder in demineralized water and glass slides coated with a tio(2) thin film, achieved by sol-gel deposition. a running protocol for the photoactivation of tio(2) was set up using the dye rhodamine b.  the microorganisms studied were pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and  a bacillus cereus-group as planktonic cells. p. aeruginosa biofilms were also studied at both the solid-liquid and the solid-air interface. the tio(2) nanopowder produced 1-log reduction of bacillus sp. planktonic cells in 24 h, 2-log reduction of p. stutzeri planktonic cells in 30 min and 1-log reduction of  p. aeruginosa planktonic cells in 2 h compared with non-photo-activated tio(2). tio(2) thin film produced almost a complete eradication of p. aeruginosa planktonic cells (initial concentration 10(8) cells ml(-1)) in 24 h compared to a 3-log reduction caused by uv-a light alone. in contrast, neither the photocatalytic treatment with tio(2) film nor that with tio(2) nanopowder had any effect on p. aeruginosa biofilms at all the interfaces investigated. possible explanations for these findings, and for the discrepancy between this work and literature data, are discussed.

AB  == aims: the aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin z from lactococcus lactis w8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. methods and results: spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees c were identified as enterococcus italicus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus paracasei, acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter aerogenes. these bacteria were found to  have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. except enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin z preparation of the l. lactis w8. addition of the nisin z preparation to either the skim milk or fat  milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log cfu ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. the nisin z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. conclusions: the nisin z preparation from l. lactis w8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. significance and impact of the study: a rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin z preparation of l. lactis w8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin a). the nisin z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.

TI  == cloning, expression, and characterization of thermotolerant manganese superoxide  dismutase from bacillus sp. mhs47.
AB  == a superoxide dismutase gene from thermotolerant bacillus sp. mhs47 (mnsod47) was  cloned, sequenced, and expressed. the gene has an open reading frame of 612 bp, corresponding to 203 deduced amino acids, with high homology to the amino acid sequences of b. thuringiensis (accession no. een01322), b. anthracis (accession no. np_846724), b. cereus (accession no. zp_04187911), b. weihenstephanensis (accession no. yp_001646918), and b. pseudomycoides. the conserved manganese-binding sites (h28, h83, d165, and h169) show that mnsod47 has the specific characteristics of the manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod) enzymes. mnsod47 expressed an enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 22.65 kda and a specific activity of 3537.75 u/mg. the enzyme is active in the ph range 7-8.5, with an optimum ph of 7.5, and at temperatures in the range 30-45 degrees  c, with an optimum temperature of 37 degrees c. tests of inhibitors and metal ions indicated that the enzyme activity is inhibited by sodium azide, but not by  hydrogen peroxide or potassium cyanide. these data should benefit future studies  of mnsods in other microorganisms and the biotechnological production of mnsod47, and could also be used to develop a biosensor for the detection of antioxidants and free radical activity. in the future, this basic knowledge could be applicable to the detection of cancer risks in humans and therapeutic treatments.

TI  == a mixed-species microarray for identification of food spoilage bacilli.
AB  == failure of food preservation is frequently caused by thermostable spores of members of the bacillaceae family, which show a wide spectrum of resistance to cleaning and preservation treatments. we constructed and validated a mixed-species genotyping array for 6 bacillus species, including bacillus subtilis, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus pumilus, bacillus sporothermodurans, bacillus cereus and bacillus coagulans, and 4 geobacillus species, including geobacillus stearothermophilus, geobacillus thermocatenulatus, geobacillus toebii and geobacillus sp., in order to track food spoilage isolates from ingredient to  product. the discriminating power of the array was evaluated with sets of 42 reference and 20 test strains. bacterial isolates contain a within-species-conserved core genome comprising 68-88% of the entire genome and a non-conserved accessory genome comprising 7-22%. the majority of the core genome  markers do not hybridise between species, thus they allow for efficient discrimination at the species level. the accessory genome array markers provide high-resolution discrimination at the level of individual isolates from a single  species. in conclusion, the reported mixed-species microarray contains discriminating markers that allow rapid and cost-effective typing of bacillus food spoilage bacteria in a wide variety of food products.

TI  == biodegradation of phenanthrene using adapted microbial consortium isolated from petrochemical contaminated environment.
AB  == in developing countries like india, there are many industrial areas discharging effluent containing large amount of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (pah) which causes hazardous effect on the soil-water environment. the objective of this study was to isolate and characterize high-efficiency pah-degrading microbial consortium from 3 decade old petrochemical refinery field located in nagpur, maharashtra with history of pah disposal. based on biochemical tests and 16s rdna gene sequence analysis the consortium was identified as sphingobacterium sp., bacillus cereus and a novel bacterium achromobacter insolitus mhf env iv with effective phenanthrene-degrading ability. the biodegradation data of phenanthrene indicates about 100%, 56.9% and 25.8% degradation at the concentration of 100mg/l, 250 mg/l and 500 mg/l respectively within 14 days. the consortium and its monoculture isolates also utilized variety of other hydrocarbons for growth. to best of our knowledge this is the first time that achromobacter insolitus has been reported to mineralize phenanthrene effectively. gc-ms analysis of phenanthrene degradation confirmed biodegradation by detection of intermediates like salicylaldehyde, salicylic acid and catechol. all the results indicated that the  microbial consortium have a promising application in bioremediation of petrochemical contaminated environments and could be potentially useful for the study of pah degradation and for bioremediation purposes.

TI  == bacillus gaemokensis sp. nov., isolated from foreshore tidal flat sediment from the yellow sea.
AB  == a gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore-forming organism, strain bl3-6(t), was isolated from tidal flat sediments of the yellow sea in the region of tae-an. a 16s rrna gene sequence analysis demonstrated that this isolate belongs to the bacillus cereus group, and is closely related to bacillus mycoides (99.0% similarity), bacillus thuringiensis (99.0%), bacillus weihenstephanensis (99.0%), bacillus cereus (98.9%), bacillus anthracis (98.8%), and bacillus pseudomycoides  (98.1%). the phylogenetic distance from any validly described bacillus species outside the bacillus cereus group was less than 95.6%. the dna g+c content of the strain was 39.4 mol% and the major respiratory quinone was menaquinone-7. the major cellular fatty acids were iso-c(14:0) (17.8%), iso-c(16:0) (15.8%), and iso-c(12:0) (11.3%). the diagnostic amino acid of the cell wall was meso-diaminopimelic acid and the major cell wall sugar was galactose. the results of dna-dna hybridization (<55.6%) and physiological and biochemical tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of strain bl3-6(t) from the published bacillus species. bl3-6(t) therefore represents a new species, for which the name bacillus gaemokensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain bl3-6(t) (=kctc 13318(t) =jcm 15801(t)).

TI  == isolation and identification of soil bacteria growing at the expense of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.
AB  == soil-microorganism symbioses are of fundamental importance for plant adaptation to the environment. research in microbial ecology has revealed that some soil bacteria are associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (amf). however, these interactions may be much more complex than originally thought. to assess the type of bacteria associated with amf, we initially isolated spores of glomus irregulare from an agrostis stolonifera rhizosphere. the spores were washed with  sterile water and plated onto g. irregulare mycelium growing in vitro in a root-free compartment of bicompartmented petri dishes. we hypothesized that this  system should select for bacteria closely associated with the fungus because the  only nutrients available to the bacteria were those derived from the hyphae. twenty-nine bacterial colonies growing on the amf hyphae were subcultured and identified using 16s rrna gene sequences. all bacterial isolates showed high sequence identity to bacillus cereus, bacillus megaterium, bacillus simplex, kocuria rhizophila, microbacterium ginsengisoli, sphingomonas sp. and variovorax  paradoxus. we also assessed bacterial diversity on the surface of spores by pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis. finally, we used live cellular imaging to show that the bacteria isolated can grow on the surface of hyphae with different growing patterns in contrast to escherichia coli as a control.

TI  == biological activities of a mixture of biosurfactant from bacillus subtilis and alkaline lipase from fusarium oxysporum.
AB  == in this study, we investigate the antimicrobial effects of a mixture of a biosurfactant from bacillus subtilis and an alkaline lipase from fusarium oxysporum (al/bs mix) on several types of microorganisms, as well as their abilities to remove listeria innocua atcc 33093 biofilm from stainless steel coupons. the al/bs mix had a surface tension of around 30 mn.m(-1), indicating that the presence of alkaline lipase did not interfere in the surface activity properties of the tensoactive component. the antimicrobial activity of the al/bs  mix was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) micro-assays. among  all the tested organisms, the presence of the mixture only affected the growth of b. subtilis cct 2576, b. cereus atcc 10876 and l. innocua. the most sensitive microorganism was b. cereus (mic 0.013 mg.ml(-1)). in addition, the effect of the sanitizer against l. innocua attached to stainless steel coupons was determined by plate count after vortexing. the results showed that the presence of the al/bs mix improved the removal of adhered cells relative to treatment done without the  sanitizer, reducing the count of viable cells by 1.72 log cfu.cm(-2). however, there was no significant difference between the sanitizers tested and an sds detergent standard (p<0.05).

AB  == partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (hpam) in production water after polymer flooding in oil filed causes environmental problems, such as increases the difficulty in oil-water separation, degrades naturally to produce toxic acrylamide and endanger local ecosystem. biodegradation of hpam may be an efficient way to solve these problems. the biodegradability of hpam in an aerobic environment was studied. two hpam-degrading bacterial strains, named pm-2 and pm-3, were isolated from the produced water of polymer flooding. they were subsequently identified as bacillus cereus and bacillus sp., respectively. the utilization of hpam by the two strains was explored. the amide group of hpam could serve as a nitrogen source for the two microorganisms, the carbon backbone  of these polymers could be partly utilized by microorganisms. the hpam samples before and after bacterial biodegradation were analyzed by the infrared spectrum, high performance liquid chromatography and scanning electronic microscope. the results indicated that the amide group of hpam in the biodegradation products had been converted to a carboxyl group, and no acrylamide monomer was found. the hpam carbon backbone was metabolized by the bacteria during the course of its growth.  further more, the hypothesis about the biodegradation of hpam in aerobic bacterial culture is proposed.

TI  == a subset of naturally isolated bacillus strains show extreme virulence to the free-living nematodes caenorhabditis elegans and pristionchus pacificus.
AB  == the main food source of free-living nematodes in the soil environment is bacteria, which can affect nematode development, fecundity and survival. in order to occupy a reliable source of bacterial food, some nematodes have formed specific relationships with an array of invertebrate hosts (where bacteria proliferate once the hosts dies), thus forming a tritrophic system of nematode, bacteria and insect or other invertebrates. we isolated 768 bacillus strains from soil (from germany and the uk), horse dung and dung beetles and fed them to the genetically tractable free-living nematodes caenorhabditis elegans and pristionchus pacificus to isolate nematocidal strains. while c. elegans is a bacteriovorous soil nematode, p. pacificus is an omnivorous worm that is often found in association with scarab beetles. we found 20 bacillus strains (consisting of b. cereus, b. weihenstephanensis, b. mycoides and bacillus sp.) that were pathogenic to c. elegans and p. pacificus causing 70% to 100% mortality over 5 days and significantly affect development and brood size. the most pathogenic strains are three b. cereus-like strains isolated from dung beetles, which exhibit extreme virulence to c. elegans in less than 24 h, but p. pacificus remains resistant. c. elegans bre mutants were also highly susceptible to the b.  cereus-like strains indicating that their toxins use a different virulence mechanism than b. thuringiensis cry 5b toxin. also, mutations in the daf-2/daf-16 insulin signaling pathway do not rescue survival. we profiled the toxin genes (bcet, nhe complex, hbl complex, pcpl, sph, cytk, piplc, hly2, hly3, entfm and ents) of these three b. cereus-like strains and showed presence of most toxin genes but absence of the hbl complex. taken together, this study shows that the majority of naturally isolated bacillus from soil, horse dung and geotrupes beetles are benign to both c. elegans and p. pacificus. among 20 pathogenic strains with distinct virulence patterns against the two nematodes, we selected three b. cereus-like strains to investigate resistance and susceptibility immune  responses in nematodes.

TI  == the swaposin-like domain of potato aspartic protease (stasp-psi) exerts antimicrobial activity on plant and human pathogens.
AB  == plant-specific insert domain (psi) is a region of approximately 100 amino acid residues present in most plant aspartic protease (ap) precursors. psi is not a true saposin domain; it is the exchange of the n- and c-terminal portions of the  saposin like domain. hence, psi is called a swaposin domain. here, we report the  cloned, heterologous expression and purification of psi from stasp 1 (solanum tuberosum aspartic protease 1), called stasp-psi. results obtained here show that stasp-psi is able to kill spores of two potato pathogens in a dose-dependent manner without any deleterious effect on plant cells. as reported for staps (s. tuberosum aspartic proteases), the stasp-psi ability to kill microbial pathogens  is dependent on the direct interaction of the protein with the microbial cell wall/or membrane, leading to increased permeability and lysis. additionally, we demonstrated that, like proteins of the saplip family, stasp-psi and staps are cytotoxic to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in a dose dependent manner. the amino acid residues conserved in sp_b (pulmonary surfactant protein b) and stasp-psi could explain the cytotoxic activity exerted by stasp-psi and staps against gram-positive bacteria. these results and data previously reported suggest that the presence of the psi domain in mature staps could be related to their antimicrobial activity.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of enterococcus faecium fair-e 198 against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of enterococcus faecium fair-e 198 against bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. using the critical-dilution method, the bacteriocin produced by e. faecium fair-e 198 inhibited all l. monocytogenes strains evaluated (1,600 to 19,200 au ml(-1)). however, none of the b. cereus and s. aureus strains investigated were inhibited. the maximum activity of this bacteriocin (800 au ml(-1)) was observed in mrs broth, while the activity in milk was 100 au ml(-1). in the co-cultivation test in milk, b. cereus k1-b041 was reduced to below the detection limit (1.00 log cfu ml(-1)) after 48 h. e. faecium reduced the initial l. monocytogenes scott a population by 1 log cfu ml(-1) after 3 h at 35 degrees c, however, the pathogen regained growth, reaching 3.68 log cfu ml(-1) after 48 h. e. faecium did not influence the growth of s. aureus atcc 27154 during the 48 h of co-cultivation, therefore, it can be concluded that the effectiveness of the antimicrobial activity of e. faecium fair-e 198 is strictly related to the species and strain of the target microorganism and to the culture medium.

TI  == characterization of corrosive bacterial consortia isolated from petroleum-product-transporting pipelines.
AB  == microbiologically influenced corrosion is a problem commonly encountered in facilities in the oil and gas industries. the present study describes bacterial enumeration and identification in diesel and naphtha pipelines located in the northwest and southwest region in india, using traditional cultivation technique  and 16s rdna gene sequencing. phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna sequences of the  isolates was carried out, and the samples obtained from the diesel and naphtha-transporting pipelines showed the occurrence of 11 bacterial species namely serratia marcescens ace2, bacillus subtilis ar12, bacillus cereus ace4, pseudomonas aeruginosa ai1, klebsiella oxytoca acp, pseudomonas stutzeri ap2, bacillus litoralis an1, bacillus sp., bacillus pumilus ar2, bacillus carboniphilus ar3, and bacillus megaterium ar4. sulfate-reducing bacteria were not detected in samples from both pipelines. the dominant bacterial species identified in the petroleum pipeline samples were b. cereus and s. marcescens in  the diesel and naphtha pipelines, respectively. therefore, several types of bacteria may be involved in biocorrosion arising from natural biofilms that develop in industrial facilities. in addition, localized (pitting) corrosion of the pipeline steel in the presence of the consortia was observed by scanning electron microscopy analysis. the potential role of each species in biofilm formation and steel corrosion is discussed.

TI  == new approach for the detection of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes in bacillus strains by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacillus strains produce non-ribosomal lipopeptides that can be grouped into three families: surfactins or lichenysins, iturins and fengycins or plispastatins. these biosurfactants show a broad spectrum of biological activities. to detect strains able to produce these lipopeptides, a new polymerase chain reaction screening approach was developed using degenerated primers based on the intraoperon alignment of adenylation and thiolation nucleic  acid domains of all enzymes implicated in the biosynthesis of each lipopeptide family. the comparative bioinformatics analyses of each operon led to the design  of four primer pairs for the three families taking into account the differences between open reading frames of each synthetase gene. tested on different bacillus sp. strains, this technique was used successfully to detect not only the expected genes in the lipopeptide producing strains but also the presence of a plispastatin gene in bacillus subtilis atcc 21332 and a gene showing a high similarity with the polyketide synthase type i gene in the b. subtilis atcc 6633  genome. it also led to the discovery of the presence of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes in bacillus thuringiensis serovar berliner 1915 and in bacillus  cereus lmg 2098. in addition, this work highlighted the differences between the fengycin and plipastatin operon at dna level.

TI  == growth and gaseous emissions of pure and mixed small intestinal bacterial cultures: effects of bile and vancomycin.
AB  == simultaneous cultivations in anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and with microaerobic gas mixture were used to clarify the bile (oxgall) effects on the pure and mixed cultures of enterobacterial strains in simulations in portable microbe enrichment unit (pmeu) linked with chempro100i((r)) gas detector. the effects of vancomycin  were evaluated in aerobic cultures. growth and metabolic activity of cultures were also followed by measuring sugar consumption, ph alterations, and colony counts on bd chromagar orientation plates. results showed that the two fermentatively different strains of facultative anaerobes, escherichia coli e 17  and klebsiella mobilis atcc 13048 grew in balance regardless of oxygen level, bile acid concentration or other components of the mixed cultures, bacillus cereus or staphylococcus aureus. when the evaporations of the mixed cultures of e. coli, k. mobilis and s. aureus were compared with the emissions of the corresponding pure cultures by chempro100i((r)) gas sensing detector, the pure cultures of bile resistant e. coli and k. mobilis produced more gaseous components than the mixed culture indicating that these organisms cooperate and use the substrate more effectively together than separately. a survey of the aseptic bacterial isolations from the bile tract in a big university hospital, (salzburg, austria) during 3 years, showed that these bacterial groups dominated. only 13.24% of the 287 patient samples were sterile, and around 180 strains of both e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter groups were found amongst 973 isolates from 249 patients (together 35.57%). enterococcus sp. accounted for 246 isolates  being the largest group of strains (24.25% of all the isolates). in anaerobiosis  it was shown that klebsiella neutralized the acids produced in the mixed acid fermentation of the e. coli. the ethanol produced from both groups evaporated in  the gas stream of the pmeu culturing step and its formation also removes excess acidity from the cultures. the synergistic behaviour and symbiotic function between e. coli and klebsiella/enterobacter strains is suggested.

TI  == mercury stable isotope fractionation during reduction of hg(ii) by different microbial pathways.
AB  == mercury (hg) stable isotope fractionation has recently been developed as a tool in biogeochemistry. in this study, the extent of hg stable isotope fractionation  during reduction of ionic mercury [hg(ii)] by two hg(ii)-resistant strains, bacillus cereus 5 and the thermophile anoxybacillus sp. fb9 [which actively detoxify hg(ii) by the mer system] and a hg(ii)-sensitive metal-reducing anaerobe, shewanella oneidensis mr-1 [which reduces hg(ii) at low concentrations], was investigated. in all cases, barring suppression of fractionation that is likely due to lower hg(ii) bioavailability, the hg(ii) remaining in the reactor became progressively enriched with heavy isotopes with time and underwent mass-dependent rayleigh fractionation with alpha202/198 values of 1.0016 +/- 0.0004 (1 sd). based on a multistep framework for the hg(ii) reduction pathways in the three strains, we constrain the processes that could contribute toward fractionation and suggest that for hg(ii)-resistant strains, reduction by mercuric reductase is the primary step causing fractionation. the proposed framework helps explain the variation in the extent of hg stable isotope fractionation during microbial reduction of hg(ii), furthering the promise of hg  isotope ratios as a tool in determining the role of microbial hg transformations  in the environment.

AB  == sago starch is an important dietary carbohydrate in lowland papua new guinea (png). an investigation was conducted to determine whether microbes play a role in its preservation using traditional methods. in 12 stored sago samples collected from png villages, lactic acid bacteria (lab) were present (> or = 3.6  x 10(4)cfu/g) and ph ranged from 6.8 to 4.2. acetic and propionic acids were detected in all samples, while butyric, lactic and valeric acids were present in  six or more. in freshly prepared sago, held in sealed containers in the laboratory at 30 degrees c, spontaneous fermentation by endogenous microflora of  sago starch was observed. this was evident by increasing concentrations of acetic, butyric and lactic acids over 4 weeks, and ph reducing from 4.9 to 3.1: both lab and yeasts were involved. survival of potential bacterial pathogens was  monitored by seeding sago starch with approximately 10(4)/g of selected organisms. numbers of bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus  aureus fell to < 30/g within 7 days. salmonella sp. was present only in low numbers after 7 days (< 36/g), but escherichia coli was still detectable after three weeks (> 10(2)/g). fermentation appeared to increase the storability and safety of the product.

TI  == improvement of plant growth and nickel uptake by nickel resistant-plant-growth promoting bacteria.
AB  == in this study, among a collection of ni-resistant bacterial strains isolated from the rhizosphere of alyssum serpyllifolium and phleum phleoides grown on serpentine soil, five plant growth-promoting bacteria (pgpb) were selected based  on their ability to utilize 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (acc) as the sole n source and promote seedling growth. all of the strains tested positive for indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) production and phosphate solubilization. in addition,  four of the strains exhibited significant levels of siderophores production. further, the efficiency of pgpb in enhancing ni solubilization in soils was analyzed. compared with control treatment, inoculation of pgpb strains significantly increased the concentrations of bioavailable ni. furthermore, a pot experiment was conducted to elucidate the effects of inoculating ni-resistant pgpb on the plant growth and the uptake of ni by brassica juncea and b. oxyrrhina in soil contaminated with 450 mg kg(-1) ni. psychrobacter sp. sra2 significantly  increased the fresh (351%) and dry biomass (285%) of the b. juncea test plants (p<0.05), whereas psychrobacter sp. sra1 and bacillus cereus sra10 significantly  increased the accumulation of ni in the root and shoot tissues of b. juncea compared with non-inoculated controls. this result indicates that the strains sra1 and sra10 facilitated the release of ni from the non-soluble phases in the soil, thus enhancing the availability of ni to plants. a significant increase, greater than that of the control, was also noted for growth parameters of the b.  oxyrrhina test plants when the seeds were treated with strain sra2. this effect can be attributed to the utilization of acc, solubilization of phosphate and production of iaa. the results of the study revealed that the inoculation of ni mobilizing strains psychrobacter sp. sra1 and b. cereus sra10 increases the efficiency of phytoextraction directly by enhancing the metal accumulation in plant tissues and the efficient pgpb, psychrobacter sp. sra2 increases indirectly by promoting the growth of b. juncea and b. oxyrrhina.

TI  == efficiency of krcl excilamp (222 nm) for inactivation of bacteria in suspension.
AB  == aims: to examine the killing efficiency of uv krcl excilamp against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. methods and results: vegetative cells of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli o157:h7, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes at initial populations from 10(2) to 10(7) colony-forming  units (cfu) ml(-1) were treated by krcl excilamp in sterile ringer's solution with and without h(2)o(2). the number of viable cells was determined using spread plating techniques and nutrient agar method with subsequent incubation at 28 degrees c or 37 degrees c for 24 h. at estimated populations of 10(2)-10(5) cfu ml(-1) e. coli o157:h7 and staph. aureus were the most sensitive and showed 100%  disinfection within 15 s (29.2 mj cm(-2)). bacillus subtilis was more sensitive to uv treatment than b. cereus. the uv/h(2)o(2) inactivation rate coefficients within this population range were two times higher than those observed for uv treatment alone. no effect of h(2)o(2) was observed at 10(7) cfu ml(-1) for bacillus sp. and strep. pyogenes. conclusions: the narrow-band uv radiation at 222 nm was effective in the rapid disinfection of bacteria in aqueous suspensions. significance and impact of the study: krcl excilamps represent uv sources which can be applied for disinfection of drinking water in advanced oxidation processes.

AB  == the bacterial strains, paenibacillus sp. (ay952466) and bacillus cereus (dq002384), have proven capacity to degrade lignin and pentachlorophenol. in the  present study, both strains were screened at different concentrations of phenol on mineral salt agar medium in the presence of glucose. at optimized condition (ph 7.5 +/- 0.2, 37 +/- 1 degrees c, 120 rpm, 1% glucose w/v), it was observed that both paenibacillus sp., b. cereus and its mixed culture degraded phenol (500 mg/l) up to 53.86%, 91.63% and 67.76% within 168 h of incubation, respectively. phenol degradation was routinely monitored spectrophotometrically and further confirmed by hplc. catechol and 2-hydroxy muconic semialdehyde were identified as intermediate products from degraded samples using gc-ms. it was also observed that, in the absence of glucose, bacterial strains were unable to utilize phenol  indicating the phenomenon of co-metabolism.

TI  == characterization of a cryptic plasmid from an alpha-proteobacterial endosymbiont  of amoeba proteus.
AB  == a new cryptic plasmid pap3.9 was discovered in symbiotic alpha-proteobacteria present in the cytoplasm of amoeba proteus. the plasmid is 3869bp with a gc content of 34.66% and contains replication origins for both double-strand (dso) and single-strand (sso). it has three putative orfs encoding mob, rep and phosphoglycolate phosphatase (pgpase). the pap3.9 plasmid appears to propagate by the conjugative rolling-circle replication (rcr), since it contains all required  factors such as rep, sso and dso. mob and rep showed highest similarities to those of the cryptic plasmid pbmydx in bacillus mycoides. the pgpase was homologous to that of bacillus cereus and formed a clade with those of bacillus sp. in molecular phylogeny. these results imply that the pap3.9 plasmid evolved by the passage through bacillus species. we hypothesize that the plasmid-encoded  pgpase may have contributed to the establishment of bacterial symbiosis within the hostile environment of amoeba cytoplasm.

TI  == induced systemic resistance and promotion of plant growth by bacillus spp.
AB  == abstract elicitation of induced systemic resistance (isr) by plant-associated bacteria was initially demonstrated using pseudomonas spp. and other gram-negative bacteria. several reviews have summarized various aspects of the large volume of literature on pseudomonas spp. as elicitors of isr. fewer published accounts of isr by bacillus spp. are available, and we review this literature for the first time. published results are summarized showing that specific strains of the species b. amyloliquefaciens, b. subtilis, b. pasteurii,  b. cereus, b. pumilus, b. mycoides, and b. sphaericus elicit significant reductions in the incidence or severity of various diseases on a diversity of hosts. elicitation of isr by these strains has been demonstrated in greenhouse or field trials on tomato, bell pepper, muskmelon, watermelon, sugar beet, tobacco,  arabidopsis sp., cucumber, loblolly pine, and two tropical crops (long cayenne pepper and green kuang futsoi). protection resulting from isr elicited by bacillus spp. has been reported against leaf-spotting fungal and bacterial pathogens, systemic viruses, a crown-rotting fungal pathogen, root-knot nematodes, and a stem-blight fungal pathogen as well as damping-off, blue mold, and late blight diseases. reductions in populations of three insect vectors have  also been noted in the field: striped and spotted cucumber beetles that transmit  cucurbit wilt disease and the silver leaf whitefly that transmits tomato mottle virus. in most cases, bacillus spp. that elicit isr also elicit plant growth promotion. studies on mechanisms indicate that elicitation of isr by bacillus spp. is associated with ultrastructural changes in plants during pathogen attack  and with cytochemical alterations. investigations into the signal transduction pathways of elicited plants suggest that bacillus spp. activate some of the same  pathways as pseudomonas spp. and some additional pathways. for example, isr elicited by several strains of bacillus spp. is independent of salicylic acid but dependent on jasmonic acid, ethylene, and the regulatory gene npr1-results that are in agreement with the model for isr elicited by pseudomonas spp. however, in  other cases, isr elicited by bacillus spp. is dependent on salicylic acid and independent of jasmonic acid and npr1. in addition, while isr by pseudomonas spp. does not lead to accumulation of the defense gene pr1 in plants, in some cases, isr by bacillus spp. does. based on the strains and results summarized in this review, two products for commercial agriculture have been developed, one aimed mainly at plant growth promotion for transplanted vegetables and one, which has received registration from the u.s. environmental protection agency, for disease  protection on soybean.

TI  == enterotoxigenic and genetic profiles of bacillus cereus strains of food origin in brazil.
AB  == in brazil, the incidence of bacillus cereus outbreaks is unknown, and there is little information about b. cereus occurrence in food. in addition, data on toxin production and genetic characterization of the b. cereus isolates cannot be found. this pathogen causes two distinct types of toxin-mediated foodborne illnesses known as diarrheal and emetic syndromes. diarrheal syndrome has been linked to three different enterotoxins: two protein complexes, hemolysin bl (hbl) and nonhemolytic enterotoxin (nhe); and an enterotoxic protein, cytotoxin k (cytk). emetic syndrome is related to cereulide, a toxin encoded by the ces gene. in this study, nhe and hbl production capacities of 155 strains of b. cereus isolated from brazilian food products were evaluated with an immunoassay. strains were also tested for the presence of the genes of the hbl and nhe complexes, cytk, cytk-1, cytk-2, and ces, using pcr. hbl was detected in 105 (67.7%) strains and nhe in 154 (99.4%) strains. all the strains harbored at least one gene of the nhe complex, while 96.1% of them were positive for at least one of those of the hbl complex. genes cytk1 and ces were not detected. all strains showed toxigenic  capacity and could represent a risk for consumers if good practices are not followed. this is the first report on toxigenic and genetic profiles of b. cereus strains isolated in brazil.

TI  == interactions of bacillus spp. and plants--with special reference to induced systemic resistance (isr).
AB  == biological control of soil-borne pathogens comprises the decrease of inoculum or  of the disease producing activity of a pathogen through one or more mechanisms. interest in biological control of soil-borne plant pathogens has increased considerably in the last few decades, because it may provide control of diseases  that cannot or only partly be managed by other control strategies. recent advances in microbial and molecular techniques have significantly contributed to  new insights in underlying mechanisms by which introduced bacteria function. colonization of plant roots is an essential step for both soil-borne pathogenic and beneficial rhizobacteria. colonization patterns showed that rhizobacteria act as biocontrol agents or as growth-promoting bacteria form microcolonies or biofilms at preferred sites of root exudation. such microcolonies are sites for bacteria to communicate with each other (quorum sensing) and to act in a coordinated manner. elicitation of induced systemic resistance (isr) by plant-associated bacteria was initially demonstrated using pseudomonas spp. and other gram-negative bacteria. several strains of the species bacillus amyloliquefaciens, b. subtilis, b. pasteurii, b. cereus, b. pumilus, b. mycoides, and b. sphaericus elicit significant reductions in the incidence or severity of various diseases on a diversity of hosts. elicitation of isr by these strains has been demonstrated in greenhouse or field trials on tomato, bell pepper, muskmelon, watermelon, sugar beet, tobacco, arabidopsis sp., cucumber, loblolly pine, and two tropical crops (long cayenne pepper and green kuang futsoi). protection resulting from isr elicited by bacillus spp. has been reported against leaf-spotting fungal and bacterial pathogens, systemic viruses, a crown-rotting fungal pathogen, root-knot nematodes, and a stem-blight fungal pathogen as well as damping-off, blue mold, and late blight diseases. this progress will lead to a more efficient use of these strains which is worthwhile approach to explore in context of biocontrol strategies.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria community sfc-2 in fermented crop straw. methods: total 13 isolates were obtained from spontaneous fermented rice straw by plating, paper diffusion and denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis. all these strains were used to determine the antibacterial activity of sfc-2. results: (1) phylogenetic analysis of the 13 strains based on 16s rdna gene sequence data indicated that 9 strains belong to enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacterfreundii, klebsiella terrigena and citrobacter sp., which were all common pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. (2) indicating bacteria selected from the pathogens were used to detect antibacterial activity of sfc-2 cell-free  culture supernatant. the results showed that: sfc-2 community had stronger antibacterial activity than isolated strains from sfc-2 community or man-made communities against indicating bacteria. (3) antibacterial activities of seven different cell-free culture supernatants, which were extracted at intervals from  the culture of sfc-2 community during 14-48 hours, were no obvious difference, but the content of organic acids were obvious differences during 14-48 hours; the antibacterial substances were stable after heating and sensitive partly to protease k.

TI  == investigating the effect of patulin, penicillic acid and edta on biofilm formation of isolates from dental unit water lines.
AB  == this study investigated the effect of patulin and penicillic acid, two known quorum-sensing inhibitors, and the common biocide ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) on the biofilm formation and auto-inducer (ai)-2 production of three isolates from dental unit water lines, klebsiella sp., bacillus subtilis and bacillus cereus. penicillic acid on its own had no effect on the biofilm formation of all isolates, whereas in combination with edta, it enhanced biofilm  formation significantly in klebsiella sp. and b. cereus. edta at concentrations greater than 10 microm promoted biofilm formation in b. cereus and b. subtilis. patulin was found to promote biofilm formation in b. cereus up to 25 microm. a significant increase in biofilm formation was observed in b. cereus and b. subtilis at concentrations greater than 10 microm of patulin when combined with edta. the vibrio harveyi bb170 ai-2 bioassay showed a positive response for klebsiella sp. ai-2 production with a maximum fold induction at the late exponential growth phase. addition of glucose prolonged the ai-2 production phase considerably. no significant effect of patulin, penicillic acid alone as well as  in combination with edta was observed on ai-2 production by klebsiella sp. the findings have important implications for the design of biofilm prevention and eradication strategies.

AB  == identification of compositions of the biofilm in a beijing simulator water distribution system pipe networks by pcr and single strand conformation polymorphism (pcr-sscp) technique and analysis of its heterotrophic bacterial by  heterotrophic plate count (hpc) were performed. results showed that when the water velocities were same, the count of heterotrophic bacterial on the zinficated steel wall was about five times of the pvc. on the other hand, when the pipe materials were zinficated steel, the count of heterotrophic bacterial in the deadwater pipe wall was about 1/5 of the 0.6 m/s region. the difference of the bacterial count maybe related to the smooth of the water pipe surface and the velocity of flow which affected the attachment of the microorganisms and the quantity of o2 and nourishment, respectively. same sscp electrophoresis profiles  were observed between samples from different material pipes and water velocities. after sequencing and contrasting with the genbank, the identity of three bands from the sscp gel with bacillus cereus (genbank ab190077), peudomonas sp. yged143 (genbank ef419342) and a unclassified bacteria, bacterium uasws0134 (genbank dq190347) were 100%, 99% and 94%, respectively. the sameness of the microbial community structure may be induced by the samples which were from the same simulator system and the sampling regions were near and the microorganisms could  transform in these regions easily. the observed potential pathogens of bacillus cereus and peudomonas sp. should lead to a consideration of the microbiology safety of drinking water.

TI  == ecological consequences of ingestion of bacillus cereus on bacillus thuringiensis infections and on the gut flora of a lepidopteran host.
AB  == the bacillus cereus group comprises a diverse array of non-pathogenic bacteria as well as pathogens such as bacillus thuringiensis. their spores are found together in soil and leaves and are therefore likely to commonly interact within hosts. mixed infections of pathogenic b. thuringiensis and non-pathogenic strains have been little studied, despite their potential impact on biological control and the evolutionary ecology of virulence. antibiotic secreting strains of b. cereus have been shown to be able to synergize b. thuringiensis (bt) infections. we explored  the ecology of these mixed infections more broadly in the diamondback moth (dbm). we tested whether antibiotic-expressing b. cereus can synergize bt infections initiated with spores, investigated whether ingestion of antibiotic-expressing b. cereus had any consequences for the larval gut flora and whether synergistic interactions with b. cereus increase bt reproduction. ingestion of high-antibiotic secreting b. cereus synergized infections of b. thuringiensis in  diamondback moth larvae, but at a lower level than previously reported. coinfection also increased slightly the number of bt spores found in cadavers. culture independent analysis of gut homogenates indicated that ingestion of an antibiotic-expressing strain of b. cereus reduced the abundance of the gut flora  and led to gut communities being dominated bacteria with dgge profiles very similar to pure b. cereus cultures. ingestion of b. cereus, regardless of genotype, reduced densities of an enteric isolate of enterobacter sp. these findings support the hypothesis that antibiotic secretion in the gut synergizes b. thuringiensis infections by reducing the abundance of the commensal gut flora  and facilitating invasion by bacteria in the b. cereus group.

TI  == response of endophytic bacterial communities in banana tissue culture plantlets to fusarium wilt pathogen infection.
AB  == endophytic bacteria reside within plant hosts without having pathogenic effects,  and various endophytes have been found to functionally benefit plant disease suppressive ability. in this study, the influence of banana plant stress on the endophytic bacterial communities, which was achieved by infection with the wilt pathogen fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, was examined by cultivation-independent denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of 16s ribosomal dna directly amplified from plant tissue dna. community analysis clearly demonstrated increased bacterial diversity in pathogen-infected plantlets compared to that in control plantlets. by sequencing, bands most similar to species of bacillus and pseudomonas showed high density in the pathogen-treated pattern. in vitro screening of the isolates for antagonistic activity against fusarium wilt pathogen acquired three strains of endophytic bacteria which were found to match those species that obviously increased in the pathogen infection process; moreover, the most inhibitive strain could also interiorly colonize plantlets and perform antagonism. the evidence obtained from this work showed that antagonistic endophytic bacteria could be induced by the appearance of a host fungal pathogen and further be an ideal biological control agent to use in banana fusarium wilt disease protection.

TI  == biodegradability of commercial and weathered diesel oils.
AB  == this work aimed to evaluate the capability of different microorganisms to degrade commercial diesel oil in comparison to a weathered diesel oil collected from the  groundwater at a petrol station. two microbiological methods were used for the biodegradability assessment: the technique based on the redox indicator 2,6 -dichlorophenol indophenol (dcpip) and soil respirometric experiments using biometer flasks. in the former we tested the bacterial cultures staphylococcus hominis, kocuria palustris, pseudomonas aeruginosa lbi, ochrobactrum anthropi and bacillus cereus, a commercial inoculum, consortia obtained from soil and groundwater contaminated with hydrocarbons and a consortium from an uncontaminated area. in the respirometric experiments it was evaluated the capability of the native microorganisms present in the soil from a petrol station to biodegrade the diesel oils. the redox indicator experiments showed that only the consortia, even that from an uncontaminated area, were able to biodegrade the weathered diesel. in 48 days, the removal of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (tph) in the respirometric experiments was approximately 2.5 times greater when the commercial diesel oil was used. this difference was caused by the consumption of labile hydrocarbons, present in greater quantities in the commercial diesel oil, as demonstrated by gas chromatographic analyses. thus, results indicate that biodegradability studies that do not consider the weathering effect of the pollutants may over estimate biodegradation rates and when the bioaugmentation is necessary, the best strategy would be that one based on injection of consortia, because even cultures with recognised capability of biodegrading hydrocarbons may fail when applied isolated.

AB  == thirty five bacterial isolates from diverse environmental sources such as contaminated food, nitrogen rich soil, activated sludges from pesticide and oil refineries effluent treatment plants were found to belong to bacillus, bordetella, enterobacter, proteus, and pseudomonas sp. on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. under dark fermentative conditions, maximum hydrogen (h(2)) yields (mol/mol of glucose added) were recorded to be 0.68 with enterobacter aerogenes egu16 followed by 0.63 with bacillus cereus egu43 and bacillus thuringiensis egu45. h(2) constituted 63-69% of the total biogas evolved. out of these 35 microbes, 18 isolates had the ability to produce polyhydroxybutyrate (phb), which varied up to 500 mg/l of medium, equivalent to a yield of 66.6%. the highest phb yield was recorded with b. cereus strain egu3. nine strains had high hydrolytic activities (zone of hydrolysis): lipase (34-38 mm) -bacillus sphaericus strains egu385, egu399 and egu542; protease (56-62 mm) -bacillus sp. strains egu444, egu447 and egu445; amylase (23 mm) -b. thuringiensis egu378, marine bacterium strain egu409 and pseudomonas sp. strain egu448. these strains with high hydrolytic activities had relatively low h(2) producing abilities in the range of 0.26-0.42 mol/mol of glucose added and only b. thuringiensis strain egu378 had the ability to produce phb. this is the first  report among the non-photosynthetic microbes, where the same organism(s) -b. cereus strain egu43 and b. thuringiensis strain egu45, have been shown to produce h(2) - 0.63 mol/mol of glucose added and phb - 420-435 mg/l medium.

TI  == biological activity of phenylpropionic acid isolated from a terrestrial streptomycetes.
AB  == the strain anu 6277 was isolated from laterite soil and identified as streptomyces sp. closely related to streptomyces albidoflavus cluster by 16s rrna analysis. the cultural, morphological and physiological characters of the strain  were recorded. the strain exhibited resistance to chloramphenicol, penicillin and streptomycin. it had the ability to produce enzymes such as amylase and chitinase. a bioactive compound was isolated from the strain at stationary phase  of culture and identified as 3-phenylpropionic acid (3-ppa) by ft-ir, ei-ms, 1h nmr and 13c nmr spectral studies. it exhibited antimicrobial activity against different bacteria like bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, p. flourescens,  staphylococcus aureus and some fungi including aspergillus flavus, a. niger, candida albicans, fusarium oxysporum, f. udum and penicillium citrinum. the antifungal activity of 3-ppa of the strain was evaluated in in vivo and in vitro  conditions against fusarium udum causing wilt disease in pigeon pea. the compound 3-ppa is an effective antifungal agent when compared to tricyclozole (fungicide)  to control wilt caused by f. udum, but it exhibited less antifungal activity than carbendazim.

TI  == establishment and characterization of dual-species biofilms formed from a 3,5-dinitrobenzoic-degrading strain and bacteria with high biofilm-forming capabilities.
AB  == in this study, the possibility of establishing a dual-species biofilm from a bacterium with a high biofilm-forming capability and a 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (3,5-dnba)-degrading bacterium, comamonas testosteroni a3, was investigated. our  results showed that the combinations of strain a3 with each of five strains with  a high biofilm-forming capability (pseudomonas sp. m8, pseudomonas putida m9, bacillus cereus m19, pseudomonas plecoglossicida m21 and aeromonas hydrophila m22) presented different levels of enhancement regarding biofilm-forming capability. among these culture combinations, the 24-h dual-species biofilms established by c. testosteroni a3 with p. putida m9 and a. hydrophila m22 showed  the strongest resistance to 3,5-dnba shock loading, as demonstrated by six successive replacements with dmm2 synthetic wastewater. the degradation rates of  3,5-dnba by these two culture combinations reached 63.3-91.6% and 70.7-89.4%, respectively, within 6 h of every replacement. using the gfp-tagged strain m22 and confocal laser scanning microscopy, the immobilization of a3 cells in the dual-species biofilm was confirmed. we thus demonstrated that, during wastewater  treatment processes, it is possible to immobilize degrader bacteria with bacteria with a high biofilm-forming capability and to enable them to develop into the mixed microbial flora. this may be a simple and economical method that represents a novel strategy for effective bioaugmentation.

TI  == [effects of rhamnolipid on the biodegradation of n-hexadecane by microorganism and the cell surface hydrophobicity].
AB  == the experiments were made in laboratory to analyze the effects of rhamnolipid on  the biodegradation of n-hexadecane and the cell surface hydrophobicity using the  microorganism ( bacillus cereus dq01 and bacillus sp. dq02). the results show that the optimal concentrations range of rhamnolipid were 0.4 mmol/l and 0.2 mmol/l, respectively, which can obviously enhance bath(bacterial adherence to hydrocarbon). the degradation of n-hexadecane by bacillus cereus dq01 and bacillus sp. dq02 were increased 8.1% and 11.6%, respectively, within 48 h in the presence of the rhamnolipid than that of in the absence of the rhamnolipid. the growth of two strains and bath increased with obviously in the presence of the rhamnolipid. especially bath of bacillus sp. dq02 was 44% in the presence of rhamnolipid, which was better than bath of bacillus cereus dq01 without rhamnolipid. in contrast, glucose experiments showed that addition of rhamnolipid did not have much impact on growth of both strains and cell surface hydrophobicity. moreover, the interfacial tension decreased with the addition of  rhamnolipid. the rhamnolipid-treated cells had a rougher texture than the untreated cell.

TI  == inha-like protease secreted by bacillus sp. s17110 inhabited in turban shell.
AB  == a strain producing a potent protease was isolated from turban shell. the strain was identified as bacillus sp. s17110 based on phylogenetic analysis. the enzyme  was purified from culture supernatant of bacillus sp. s17110 to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, sp-sepharose, and deae-sepharose anion exchange chromatography. protease activity of the purified protein against casein was found to be stable at ph 7 to ph 10 and around 50 degrees . approximately 70% of  proteolytic activity of the enzyme was detected either in the presence of 100 mm  sds or tween 20. the enzyme activity was enhanced in the presence of ca2+, zn2+,  mg2+, but was inhibited by edta, indicating that it requires metal for its activity. the purified enzyme was found to be a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 75 kda, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and gel filtration chromatography. the purified enzyme was analyzed through peptide fingerprint mass spectra generated from matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) and a blast search, and identified as immune inhibitor a (inha) deduced from nucleotide sequence of b. cereus g9241. since inha was identified as protease that cleave antibacterial proteins found in insect, inha-like protease purified from bacillus sp. s17110 might be pathogenic to sea invertebrates.

TI  == efficacy of enterocin as-48 against bacilli in ready-to-eat vegetable soups and purees.
AB  == the broad-spectrum bacteriocin enterocin as-48 was tested for biopreservation of  ready-to-eat vegetable foods (soups and purees) against aerobic mesophilic endospore-forming bacteria. by adding as-48 (10 microg/ml), bacillus cereus lwl1  was completely inhibited in all six vegetable products tested (natural vegetable  cream, asparagus cream, traditional soup, homemade-style traditional soup, vegetable soup, and vichyssoise) for up to 30 days at 6, 15, and 22 degrees c. a  collection of strains isolated from spoiled purees showed slightly higher resistance to as-48 in the order paenibacillus sp. > bacillus macroides > b. cereus, although they were also completely inhibited in natural vegetable cream by as-48 at 10 microg/ml. however, cocktails of five or eight strains composed of b. cereus (three strains), b. macroides (two strains), and paenibacillus sp., paenibacillus polymyxa, and paenibacillus amylolyticus showed higher bacteriocin  resistance with as-48 of up to 50 microg/ml required for complete inactivation in natural vegetable cream stored at 22 degrees c. repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) analysis showed that paenibacilli (along with some b. cereus) was the predominant survivor in the cocktails after bacteriocin treatment. to increase the effectiveness of enterocin as-48, the bacteriocin was  tested (at 20 microg/ml) against the eight-strain cocktail in natural vegetable cream in combination with other antimicrobials. the combination of as-48 and nisin had a slight but significant additive effect. bactericidal activity was greatly enhanced by phenolic compounds (carvacrol, eugenol, geraniol, and hydrocinnamic acid), achieving a rapid and complete inactivation of bacilli in the tested puree at 22 degrees c.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(ii) chelate.
AB  == some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. copper(ii) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-n-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. i report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(ii) chelate. they were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus lactis), yeasts (candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (aspergillus niger). two clinical isolates of bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. the ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except  for s. lactis, and its activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. it was highly active against a. niger and moderately active against c. albicans. the chelate was highly active against s. epidermidis and s. cerevisiae. both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.

AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the mode of action of bls p34, a bacteriocin-like substance (bls) produced by a novel bacillus sp. strain p34 isolated from the amazon basin. the effect of the bls was tested against listeria monocytogenes, showing a bactericidal effect at 200 au (activity units) ml(-1), while no inhibition of spore outgrowth of bacillus cereus was observed with a dose of 1,600 au ml(-1). growth of escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis was inhibited, but only when the chelating agent edta was co-added with the bls.  the effect of bls p34 on l. monocytogenes was also investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. treated cells showed an important frequency increase in 1,452 and 1,397 cm(-1) and decrease in 1,217 and 1,058 cm(-1), corresponding assignments of fatty acids and phospholipids. transmission electron microscopy showed damaged cell envelope and loss of protoplasmic material. bls p34 was bactericidal to gram-positive, and also showed inhibitory effect against  gram-negative bacteria. there is evidence that its mode of action corresponds to  that of a membrane-active substance. the knowledge about the mode of action of this bls is essential to determine its effective application as an antimicrobial  agent.

AB  == bacillus cereus isolated from municipal wastewater treatment plant was used as a  model strain to assess the efficiency of two anionic surfactants, a chemical surfactant and a biosurfactant during fluoranthene biodegradation under anaerobic methanogenic conditions. the surfactants selected for the study were linear alkyl benzene sulphonates (las) and rhamnolipid-biosurfactant complex from pseudomonas  sp. ps-17. biodegradation of fluoranthene was monitored by gc/ms for a period up  to 12th day. no change in the fluoranthene concentration was registered after 7th day. the presence of las enhanced the cell growth as well as the fluoranthene biodegradation. the rhamnolipid-biosurfactant at both used concentrations inhibited the cell growth and had no effect on the biodegradation rate. it was shown that las did not affect the microbial cell permeability and its positive effect on fluoranthene biodegradation was most likely as a result of the increased fluoranthene solubility. the results indicate that las can be considered as a promising agent for facilitation of the process of anaerobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pah) biodegradation under methanogenic conditions.

AB  == research at the center for biological defense identified plasmid-borne forms of bacillus anthracis pxo2 genes in a gram-positive, endospore-forming rod, isolated from a forensic specimen considered a credible threat of harbouring anthrax. conventional, commercial and molecular-based methods indicated that the isolate (cbd 119(t)) was not b. anthracis and considered not to be a member of the bacillus cereus group. based on the 16s rrna gene sequence similarities, strain cbd 119(t) was most closely related to bacillus luciferensis lmg 18422(t) (99.3 %). phenotyping and fatty acid methyl ester analysis of the isolate were conducted alongside b. luciferensis jcm 12212(t). the major cellular fatty acids  (anteiso-c(15 : 0), iso-c(15 : 0), and >7 iso or anteiso forms) supported inclusion of the isolate in the genus bacillus. strain cbd 119(t) was inconsistent with b. luciferensis jcm 12212(t) for 18 of 96 traits evaluated including motility, degree of endospore-driven swelling and ph optimum; the two were linked by fatty acid methyl ester analysis as separate but closely related species. dna-dna relatedness between strain cbd 119(t) and b. luciferensis jcm 12212(t) resulted in less than 20 % hybridization. the results of biochemical and physiological characterization, chemotaxonomic analysis and dna-dna hybridization differentiated strain cbd 119(t) both phenotypically and genotypically from the only species with validly published name with greater than 97 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity. the isolate has an accelerated doubling time when grown in aerated broth at ph 5.9 relative to that at ph 7.1. therefore, it is proposed that strain cbd 119(t) represents a novel species, bacillus acidiceler sp. nov. the type strain is strain cbd 119(t) (=nrrl b-41736(t)=dsm 18954(t)).

AB  == a bacillus sp. strain producing a bacteriocin-like substance was characterized by biochemical profiling and 16s rdna sequencing. the phylogenetic analysis indicated that this strain has low sequence similarity with most bacillus spp., suggesting a new species was isolated. the antimicrobial activity was detected starting at the exponential growth phase, and maximum activity was observed at stationary phase. the substance was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including pathogenic and food spoilage bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, b. cereus, aeromonas hydrophila, erwinia carotovora, pasteurella haemolytica, salmonella gallinarum, among other. the antibacterial substance was  stable over a wide ph range, but it was sensitive to pronase e and lipase. the antibacterial substance was bactericidal and bacteriolytic to l. monocytogenes and b. cereus at 160 au ml(-1). the identification of a broad range bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against l. monocytogenes addresses an important aspect of food protection against pathogens and spoilage microorganisms.

TI  == large-scale production and efficient recovery of phb with desirable material properties, from the newly characterised bacillus cereus spv.
AB  == a newly characterised bacillus strain, bacillus cereus spv was found to produce phb at a concentration of 38% of its dry cell weight in shaken flask cultures, using glucose as the main carbon source. polymer production was then scaled up to 20 l batch fermentations where 29% dry cell weight of phb was obtained within 48  h. following this, a simple glucose feeding strategy was developed and the cells  accumulated 38% dry cell weight of phb, an increase in the overall volumetric yield by 31% compared to the batch fermentation. sporulation is the cause of low  phb productivity from the genus bacillus [wu, q., huang, h., hu, g.h., chen, j.,  ho, k.p., chen, g.q., 2001. production of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate by bacillus sp.  jma5 cultivated in molasses media. antonie van leeuwenhoek 80, 111-118]. however, in this study, acidic ph conditions (4.5-5.8) completely suppress sporulation, in accordance with kominek and halvorson [kominek, l.a., halvorson, h.o., 1965. metabolism of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoin in bacillus cereus. j. bacteriol. 90, 1251-1259], and result in an increase in the yield of phb production. this observation emphasises the potential of the use of bacillus in the commercial production of phb and other phas. the recovery of the phb produced was optimised and the isolated polymer characterised to identify its material properties. the polymer extracted, was found to have similar molecular weight, polydispersity index and lower crystallinity index than others reported in literature. also, the extracted polymer was found to have desirable material properties for potential tissue engineering applications.

TI  == application of real-time quantitative pcr for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  == bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using taqman(r) real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr). thirteen probe and primer sets were  tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp., and staphylococcus aureus. the sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic dna (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using a. hydrophila purified dna. samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. in duplicate samples, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. perfringens and e. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater  and final effluent stage. this qpcr method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the environment canada guidelines.

TI  == properties of bacterial corrosion of stainless steel and its inhibition by protamine coating.
AB  == we investigated characteristics of the corrosion of stainless steel specimens by  bacteria and the effects of using antimicrobial coating on the surface for inhibiting corrosion. bacillus sp. 2-a and staphylococcus sp. 2-1 cells adhered tightly to a stainless steel sus304 specimen, formed a microcolony or biofilm, and had highly corrosive activities. microbially influenced corrosion (mc) was observed under or around adhering cells. however, dead cells were markedly less active than viable cells not only in corroding the specimen but also in adhering  to its surface. the culture supernatant was not able to induce the corrosion of sus304 effectively. a protamine coating on the specimen killed bacterial cells only on its surface, interfered with cell adhesion, and inhibited mc. from these  results, adhesion of viable cells to the surface of a sus304 specimen led to the  outbreak of mc. protamine was also found to be an effective substance tested for  protecting the specimen from both cell adhesion and surface mc. we suggest that a protamine coating can be applied as a convenient and inexpensive corrosion prevention method.

TI  == a detailed analysis of 16s ribosomal rna gene segments for the diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == bacterial 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) genes contain nine "hypervariable regions" (v1-v9) that demonstrate considerable sequence diversity among different bacteria. species-specific sequences within a given hypervariable region constitute useful targets for diagnostic assays and other scientific investigations. no single region can differentiate among all bacteria; therefore, systematic studies that compare the relative advantage of each region for specific diagnostic goals are needed. we characterized v1-v8 in 110 different bacterial species including common blood borne pathogens, cdc-defined select agents and environmental microflora. sequence similarity dendrograms were created for hypervariable regions v1-v8, and for selected combinations of regions or short segments within individual hypervariable regions that might be appropriate  for dna probing and real-time pcr. we determined that v1 best differentiated among staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococcus sp. v2 and v3 were most suitable for distinguishing all bacterial species to the genus level except for closely related enterobacteriaceae. v2 best distinguished among mycobacterium species and v3 among haemophilus species. the 58 nucleotides-long v6 could distinguish among most bacterial species except enterobacteriaceae. v6 was also noteworthy for being able to differentiate among all cdc-defined select  agents including bacillus anthracis, which differed from b. cereus by a single polymorphism. v4, v5, v7 and v8 were less useful targets for genus or species-specific probes. the hypervariable sequence-specific dendrograms and the  "megalign" files provided online will be highly useful tools for designing specific probes and primers for molecular assays to detect pathogenic bacteria, including select agents.

TI  == insight in to the phylogeny of polyhydroxyalkanoate biosynthesis: horizontal gene transfer.
AB  == polyhydroxyalkanoates (phas) are gaining more and more importance the world over  due to their structural diversity and close analogy to plastics. their biodegradability makes them extremely desirable substitutes for synthetic plastics. phas are produced in organisms under certain stress conditions. here, we investigated 253 sequenced (completely and unfinished) genomes for the diversity and phylogenetics of the pha biosynthesis. discrepancies in the phylogenetic trees for phaa, phab and phac genes of the pha biosynthesis have led to the suggestion that horizontal gene transfer (hgt) may be a major contributor  for its evolution. twenty four organisms belonging to diverse taxa were found to  be involved in hgt. among these, bacillus cereus atcc 14579 and xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri str. 306 seem to have acquired all the three genes through hgt events and have not been characterized so far as pha producers. this study also revealed certain potential organisms such as streptomyces coelicolor a3(2),  staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, brucella suis 1330, burkholderia sp., dsmz 9242 and leptospira interrogans serovar lai str. 56601, which can be transformed  into novel pha producers through recombinant dna technology.

TI  == involvement of cytoplasmic membrane damage in the copper (ii)-dependent cytotoxicity of a novel naturally occurring tripyrrole.
AB  == in the presence of a nonlethal concentration of cu(ii), washed escherichia coli atcc8739 cells were killed by a novel tripyrrole 1, isolated as a red pigment from the serratia sp. cell killing was accompanied by a depletion in the potassium pools of the cells due to the damage to the cytoplasmic membrane, without any detectable dna damage as revealed by the transformed plasmid dna and  phage induction assay. this revealed that the bactericidal activity of compound 1 in the presence of cu(ii) results from membrane damage. induction of endogenous catalase in the e. coli cells increased their resistance against the combination  of compound 1 and cu(ii). although compound 1 alone generated large amount of reactive oxygen species (ros), it did not show any cell killing against e. coli in the absence of cu(ii). the cu(ii)-dependent bactericidal activity of compound  1 was suppressed by ethylenediaminetetraacetate, bathocuproine, catalase and superoxide disumutase (sod), but not by dimethyl sulfoxide. these findings suggest that recycling redox reactions between cu(ii) and cu(i), involving compound 1 and hydrogen peroxide on the cell surface, must be important in the mechanism of the killing. compound 1 alone showed selective bactericidal activity against the gram positive bacterium, bacillus cereus atcc 6630, possibly due to its differential cellular transport.

TI  == differential identification of bacillus anthracis from environmental bacillus species using microarray analysis.
AB  == aims: to determine whether microarray analysis could be employed for the differential identification of a range of environmental bacillus sp. from four strains of bacillus anthracis. methods and results: oligonucleotide probes were designed that were specific to virulence factor genes of b. anthracis (pag, lef and cap), the variable number tandem repeat region of the b. anthracis vrra gene  and to the 16s-23s rrna intergenic transcribed spacer region (its) and pleiotropic regulator (plcr) regions of the bacillus cereus subgroup species. generic probes were also designed to hybridize with conserved regions of the 16s  rrna genes of bacillus (as a positive control), neisseria sp., pseudomonas sp., streptococcus sp., mycobacterium sp. and to all members of the enterobacteriaceae to allow simultaneous detection of these bacteria. identification of b. anthracis was found to rely entirely on hybridization of dna specific to regions of the pag, lef and cap genes. cross-reaction was observed between b. anthracis and other bacillus species with all the other bacillus probes tested. results obtained using microarray hybridizations were confirmed using conventional microbiological techniques and found to have very high comparability. conclusions: microarray-based assays are an effective method for the identification of b. anthracis from mixed-culture environmental samples without problems of false-positivity that have been observed with conventional pcr assays. significance and impact of the study: identification of environmental bacillus sp. by conventional pcr is prone to potential for reporting false-positives. this study provides a method for the exclusion of such isolates.

TI  == use of single-point genome signature tags as a universal tagging method for microbial genome surveys.
AB  == we developed single-point genome signature tags (sp-gsts), a generally applicable, high-throughput sequencing-based method that targets specific genes to generate identifier tags from well-defined points in a genome. the technique yields identifier tags that can distinguish between closely related bacterial strains and allow for the identification of microbial community members. sp-gsts  are determined by three parameters: (i) the primer designed to recognize a conserved gene sequence, (ii) the anchoring enzyme recognition sequence, and (iii) the type iis restriction enzyme which defines the tag length. we evaluated  the sp-gst method in silico for bacterial identification using the genes rpoc, uvrb, and reca and the 16s rrna gene. the best distinguishing tags were obtained  with the restriction enzyme csp6i upstream of the 16s rrna gene, which discriminated all organisms in our data set to at least the genus level and most  organisms to the species level. the method was successfully used to generate csp6i-based tags upstream of the 16s rrna gene and allowed us to discriminate between closely related strains of bacillus cereus and bacillus anthracis. this concept was further used successfully to identify the individual members of a defined microbial community.

TI  == bacteria isolated from the different developmental stages and larval organs of the obligate parasitic fly, wohlfahrtia magnifica (diptera: sarcophagidae).
AB  == wohlfahrtia magnifica (diptera: sarcophagidae) is the major myiasis-causing fly species in the whole of eurasia for most important domestic animals. the aim of the present work was to obtain data on the culturable bacteria isolated under aerobic conditions from this fly: bacteria were isolated from all developmental stages (larvae, pupa, and imago) of wohlfahrtia magnifica, and the third-stage larval organs were also sampled. to determine the possible antagonistic effects between the dominant bacterial groups, an antibiosis assay was carried out. plating and isolation of bacteria was performed by classical microbiological methods. characterization of the isolated strains was carried out via a polyphasic approach; classical phenotypic tests, chemotaxonomical examinations, and 16s rdna sequence analyses were also applied. in the case of maggot macerate  samples, members of the family enterobacteriaceae were characteristic. members of a new genus (schineria) belonging to the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria were also isolated. according to our data, the shifts in the schineria and proteus populations within the larvae are strongly influenced by their interactions with  each other and among the members of the family enterobacteriaceae. the pupa and imago samples contained several other gram-negative bacteria (stenotrophomonas, brevundimonas, etc.). among gram-positive bacteria, in all maggot macerate samples, members of the genus bacillus and the arthrobacter-micrococcus group of  actinobacteria were dominant (neither of them was a producer or sensitive to the  compounds of other microorganisms), and bacteria related to the genus corynebacterium were also found. from the larvae aureobacterium liquefaciens and  enterococcus faecalis were isolated, and from the pupae dietzia maris and enterococcus faecalis. in the samples of third-stage larval organs, the dominant  groups were the same as in the third-stage larval macerate sample; however, several additional genera/species were observed (rhodococcus fascians, streptomyces sp., rathayibacter sp., bacillus thuringiensis/cereus).

AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

(common cockchafer, coleoptera: scarabaeidae) and the mixtures of these bacterial isolates were investigated on a. solstitiale larvae. crystals from bacillus sp. isolated from m. melolontha were also purified, and tested against the second and third-stage larvae of a. solstitiale. the bacterial isolates of a. solstitiale were identified as pseudomonas sp., pseudomonas sp., bacillus cereus and micrococcus luteus, based on their morphology, spore formation, nutritional features, and physiological and biochemical characteristics. the insecticidal effects of the bacterial isolates determined on the larvae of a. solstitiale were 90% with b. cereus isolated from  a. solstitiale, and 75% with b. cereus, b. sphaericus and b. thuringiensis isolated from m. melolontha within ten days. the highest insecticidal effects of  the mixed infections on the larvae of a. solstitiale were 100% both with b. cereus+b. sphaericus and with b. cereus+b. thuringiensis. in the crystal protein  bioassays, the highest insecticidal effect was 65% with crystals of b. thuringiensis and b. sphaericus isolated from m. melolontha within seven days. finally, our results showed that the mixed infections could be utilized as microbial control agents, as they have a 100% insecticidal effect on the larvae of a. solstitiale.

AB  == bacillus sp. sam1606 alpha-glucosidase catalyzes the transglucosylation of sucrose to produce three regioisomers of the glucosylsucroses, with theanderose (6-o(g)-glucosylsucrose) as the most abundant transfer product. to find the active-site amino acid residues which can affect the reactivity and regiospecificity of the glucosyl transfer, 16 mutants with amino acid substitutions near the active site were allowed to react with 1.75 m sucrose at 60 degrees c, ph 6.0, and the course of transglucosylation as well as the product specificity were analyzed. the sites of the amino acid substitutions were selected by comparing the conserved amino acid sequences located near the active  site of the sam1606 enzyme with those of the bacillus oligo-1,6-glucosidases (o16g), which have very high amino acid sequence similarities near the active site but have a distinct substrate specificity. the results showed that, among the mutated sam1606 enzymes examined, only the mutants with substitution of gly273 with pro showed an altered reactivity and specificity of transglucosylation; these mutants exhibited a significantly enhanced initial velocity of glucosyl transfer, yielding isomelezitose (6-o(f)-glucosylsucrose) instead of theanderose as the major transfer product. these results indicate that the substitution of gly273 with pro critically governs the enhanced reactivity and altered specificity of the transglucosylation. the notion that the amino acid residue at this position is the determinant of the glucosyl-transfer specificity  was further confirmed by observation that the bacillus cereus o16g, which has a proline at the corresponding position, produced isomelezitose as the major transfer product during transglucosylation with sucrose.

TI  == diversity of biosurfactant producing microorganisms isolated from soils contaminated with diesel oil.
AB  == biosurfactant production is a desirable property of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms (hdm). we characterized biosurfactant producing microbial populations from a long beach soil, california (usa) and a hong kong soil (china), contaminated with diesel oil. a total of 33 hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms were isolated from the soils. twelve isolates and three defined consortia were tested for biosurfactant production and emulsification activity. the highest reduction of surface tension was achieved with a consortium of l1, l2 and l3 isolates from a long beach soil (41.4mn m(-1)). isolate l1 (acinetobacter  junii) displayed the highest reduction of surface tension (46.5 mn m(-1)). the emulsifying capacity evaluated by the e24 emulsification index was highest in the culture of isolate l5 (74%). no substantial emulsification was achieved with the  cell-free extracts, indicating that the emulsifying activity was not extracellular. based on surface tension and the e24 index results, isolates f1, f2, f3, f4, l1, l2, l3 and l4 were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing as bacillus cereus, bacillus sphaericus, b. fusiformis, acinetobacter junii, a non-cultured bacterium, pseudomonas sp. and b. pumilus, respectively. cluster analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences of the bacterial isolates revealed 70% similarity amongst hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial community present in both soils. five isolates (isolates f1, f2, f3, f4 and l4) belong to the firmicutes order, two isolates (l1 and l3) belong to the proteobacteria order and one isolate (l2) is an actinomyces sp. simpson's index (1 - d) and the shannon-weaver index (h) revealed more diversity of hdm in the hong kong soil, while evenness (e) and the equitability (j) data indicated that there was not a dominant population. bacterial isolates displaying substantial potential for production of biosurfactants can be applied in the bioremediation of soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons.

AB  == the strain lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bgbuk2-16. which was isolated from traditionally homemade white-pickled cheese, produces bacteriocin 217 (bac217; approximately 7 kda). the onset of bac217 biosynthesis was observed in the logarithmic phase of growth, and the production plateau was reached after 9 or 12 h of incubation at 37 and 30 degrees c, respectively, when culture entered  the early stationary phase. biochemical characterization showed that bac217 retained antimicrobial activity within the range of ph 3 to 12 or after treatment at 100 degrees c for 15 min. bac217 antimicrobial activity also remained unchanged after storage at 4 degrees c for 6 months or -20 degrees c for up to 12 months. however, bac217 activity was completely lost after treatment with different proteolytic enzymes. bgbuk2-16 contains only one plasmid about 80 kb in size. plasmid curing indicated that genes coding for bac217 synthesis and immunity seem to be located on this plasmid. bac217 exhibited antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. interestingly, bac217 showed activity against salmonella sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27853. the inhibitory effect of bgbuk2-16 on the growth of s. aureus in mixed culture was observed. s. aureus treatment with bac217 led to a considerable decrease (cfu/ml) within a short period of time. the mode of bac217 action on s. aureus was identified as bactericidal. it should be noted that the strain bgbuk2-16 was shown to be resistant to bacteriocin nisin, which is otherwise widely used as a food additive for fermented dairy products.

TI  == quorum quenching: enzymatic disruption of n-acylhomoserine lactone-mediated bacterial communication in burkholderia thailandensis.
AB  == many species of gram-negative bacteria communicate by synthesizing, secreting, and responding to n-acylhomoserine lactones (ahls), a mechanism termed quorum sensing. several investigations have characterized numerous ahl-degrading enzymes (aiia lactonases) encoded by environmental isolates of bacillus spp. the burkholderia thailandensis quorum system is comprised of at least three ahl synthases (ahss) and five transcriptional regulators belonging to the luxir class of proteins. expression of the bacillus anthracis (ames strain) aiia lactonase in b. thailandensis completely abolished the accumulation of n-decanoylhomoserine lactone (c(10)-hsl) and n-octanoylhomoserine lactone (c(8)-hsl), reduced n-hexanoylhomoserine lactone (c(6)-hsl) levels, altered both swarming and twitching motility, caused a significant increase in generation time, and affected carbon metabolism. in contrast, heterologous expression of the bacillus  cereus strain a24 aiia lactonase in b. thailandensis reduced the concentrations of c(6)-hsl, c(8)-hsl, and c(10)-hsl to nondetectable levels; altered both swarming and twitching motility; and caused fluctuations in carbon utilization. individual disruption of the b. thailandensis ahss, specifically disruption of the btai1 and btai3 genes, which encode the proteins that direct the synthesis of c(8)-hsl and c(6)-hsl, respectively, caused the hyper-beta-hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes on blood agar plates. in contrast, ahl cleavage in b. thailandensis  by the bacillus aiia lactonases failed to enhance beta-hemolytic activity. the results of this study demonstrate that heterologous expression of bacillus sp. aiia lactonases in b. thailandensis reduced ahl accumulation, affected both swarming and twitching motility, increased generation time, altered substrate utilization, and prevented the beta-hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes.

AB  == we found the occurrence of thermophilic reversible gamma-resorcylate decarboxylase (gamma-rdc) in the cell extract of a bacterium isolated from natural water, rhizobium sp. strain mtp-10005, and purified the enzyme to homogeneity. the molecular mass of the enzyme was determined to be about 151 kda  by gel filtration, and that of the subunit was 37.5 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; in other words, the enzyme was a homotetramer. the enzyme was induced specifically by the addition of gamma-resorcylate to the medium. the enzyme required no coenzyme and did not act  on 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate, 2-hydroxybenzoate, or 3-hydroxybenzoate. it was relatively thermostable to heat treatment, and its half-life at 50 degrees c was estimated to be 122 min; furthermore, it catalyzed the reverse carboxylation of resorcinol. the values of k(cat)/k(m) (mmu(-1) . s(-1)) for gamma-resorcylate and resorcinol  at 30 degrees c and ph 7 were 13.4 and 0.098, respectively. the enzyme contains 327 amino acid residues, and sequence identities were found with those of hypothetical protein agr c 4595p from agrobacterium tumefaciens strain c58 (96% identity), 5-carboxyvanillate decarboxylase from sphingomonas paucimobilis (32%), and 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde decarboxylases from bacillus cereus  atcc 10987 (26%), rattus norvegicus (26%), and homo sapiens (25%). the genes (graa [1,230 bp], grab [888 bp], and grac [1,056 bp]) that are homologous to those in the resorcinol pathway also exist upstream and downstream of the gamma-rdc gene. judging from these results, the resorcinol pathway also exists in rhizobium sp. strain mtp-10005, and gamma-rdc probably catalyzes a reaction just  before the hydroxylase in it does.

TI  == mesophilic aerobic degradation of a metal lubricant by a biological consortium.
AB  == the metal-forming industries require the use of greases to lubricate metal surfaces during manufacturing operations, and the residues of these lubricants must be removed prior to finishing processes to protect and improve the appearance of the final product. an aqueous, biological metal-cleaning process operating under mild conditions (ph 9, 42 degrees c) eliminates the use of environmentally unfriendly cleaning materials such as chlorinated solvents by employing microorganisms to degrade greases and oils naturally. this process was  characterized in terms of initial degradation rates of a representative metal lubricant and by phylogenetic identification of the active bacteria. the metal lubricant in a surfactant solution was degraded by a bacterial consortium, and its concentration was determined by a novel gas chromatography assay. the maximum degradation rate vmax and the apparent km were obtained as 45 mg/(day mg protein) and 24 g/l on cellular basis, and 4.6 g/(day l) and 33 g/l on a volumetric basis, respectively. mineralization of the metal lubricant was shown by analyzing the evolved co2 and cl-, and the bacterial consortium utilized the metal lubricant as a sole carbon and energy source (micro=0.05+/-0.01 h(-1) at 0.5 vol% lubricant concentration). the active bacteria in the biological metal-cleaning process were identified as bacillus licheniformis for the higher lubricant concentrations (3,  5, and 7.5 vol%), bacillus cereus at 1 vol%, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, rhizobiaceae strain m100, and achromobacter sp. lmg 5431 at 0.3 vol%.

AB  == the ability of numerous diverse compounds and ions to cross the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane by diffusion and active transport is highly dependent on cytoplasmic membrane fluidity, which can be measured using fluorescent probes to  estimate membrane polarization values. however, membrane polarization data are lacking for most bacterial species. the cytoplasmic membrane polarization values  for arthrobacter sp. atcc 21908, bacillus cereus nrc 3045, pseudomonas fluorescens r2f, pseudomonas putida nrc 2986 and escherichia coli c600 bacterial  cells were spectrofluorometrically measured over a temperature range from 10 to 50 degrees c, and in the absence and presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline, using  the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (dph) to obtain new information on their membrane fluidity. at an assay temperature of 10 degrees c,  e. coli cells grown in the absence of tetracycline exhibited the highest cytoplasmic membrane polarization value (least fluid membrane) of 0.446, followed by values of 0.392, 0.371, 0.344 and 0.293, respectively, for b. cereus, arthrobacter sp., p. fluorescens and p. putida. at an assay temperature of 30 degrees c, the polarization values ranged from 0.357 to 0.288 for cells grown in  the absence of tetracycline, regardless of the species. b. cereus grown in the presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline had lower polarization values than when grown in the absence of this antibiotic at all assay temperatures. regardless of  the absence or presence of 1 microg/ml tetracycline in the growth medium, all bacterial species generally exhibited a more fluid membrane as the assay temperature increased from 10 to 50 degrees c. to our knowledge, these are some of the first cytoplasmic membrane polarization values reported for these gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria over a broad temperature range and also  for cells grown in the presence of tetracycline.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == deciphering the molecular basis of the broad substrate specificity of alpha-glucosidase from bacillus sp. sam1606.
AB  == the alpha-glucosidase of bacillus sp. strain sam1606 is a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 13, and shows an extraordinarily broad substrate specificity and is one of very few alpha-glucosidases that can efficiently hydrolyze the alpha-1,1-glucosidic linkage of alpha,alpha'-trehalose (trehalose). phylogenetic  analysis of family-13 enzymes suggests that sam1606 alpha-glucosidase may be evolutionally derived from an alpha-1,6-specific ancestor, oligo-1,6-glucosidase  (o16g). indeed, replacement of pro(273*) and thr(342*) of b. cereus o16g by glycine and asparagine (the corresponding residues in the sam1606 enzyme), respectively, was found to cause 192-fold enhancement of the relative catalytic efficiency for trehalose, suggesting that o16g may easily "evolved" into an enzyme with an extended substrate specificity by substitution of a limited number of amino acids, including that at position 273* (an asterisk indicates the amino-acid numbering of the sam1606 sequence). to probe the role of the amino acid at position 273* of alpha-glucosidase in determination of the substrate specificity, the amino acid at position 273 of sam1606 alpha-glucosidase was replaced by all other naturally occurring amino acids, and the resultant mutants  were kinetically characterized. the results showed that substitution of bulky residues (e.g., isoleucine and methionine) for glycine at this position resulted  in large increases in the k(m) values for trehalose and maltose, whereas the affinity to isomaltose was only minimally affected by such an amino-acid substitution at this position. three-dimensional structural models of the enzyme-substrate complexes of the wild-type and mutant sam1606 alpha-glucosidases were built to explore the mechanism responsible for these observations. it is proposed that substitution by glycine at position 273* could eliminate steric hindrance around subsite +1 that originally occurred in parental o16g and is, at  least in part, responsible for the acquired broad substrate specificity of sam1606 alpha-glucosidase.

TI  == microbial diversity and prevalence of virulent pathogens in biofilms developed in a water reclamation system.
AB  == bacterial biofilm is a common phenomenon in both natural and engineered systems which often becomes a source of contamination and microbially influenced corrosion. it is thought that formation of biofilm in the monoculture of several  bacterial species is regulated by acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) quorum-sensing signals. in this study, we investigated the microbial diversity and existence of  ahl-producing and ahl-degrading bacterial species in the biofilm samples from a water reclamation system located in a tropical environment. 16s ribosomal dna sequencing analysis indicated the presence of at least 11 bacterial species, including the frequently encountered bacterial pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, and several rare pathogens. we showed that only two groups of isolates, belonging to p. aeruginosa and enterobacter agglomerans, produced ahl signals. we also found that three bacterial isolates, i.e., agrobacterium tumefaciens xj01, bacillus cereus xj08, and ralstonia sp. xj12, expressed ahl degradation enzymes. furthermore, we showed that p. aeruginosa isolate hl43 was virulent against animal model caenorhabditis elegans and released 2-6-fold more pyocyanin cytotoxin than p. aeruginosa strains pa01 and pa14, the two commonly used laboratory strains. these data indicate the complexity and importance of biofilm research in water reclamation.

TI  == cytotoxic potential of industrial strains of bacillus sp.
AB  == the cytotoxic potential of selected strains of bacillus licheniformis, bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and bacillus subtilis, used in the production of industrial enzyme products, has been assessed. cytotoxicity was determined in chinese hamster ovary (cho-k1) cells by measuring total cellular metabolic activity using the tetrazolium salt 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (mtt). initially the mtt assay was validated against toxigenic strains of bacillus cereus, to define the exact criteria for a toxigenic versus a nontoxigenic response. the assay proved sensitive to culture broths of both a diarrheagenic strain and an emetic strain of b. cereus. the enzyme-producing strains tested were nontoxic to cho-k1 cells. additionally it was demonstrated that our industrial strains did not react with antibodies against b. cereus enterotoxins by use of commercial antibody-based kits from oxoid and tecra. a short survey of the literature concerning the toxigenic potential of species within the subtilis group is included, as is a database search of known b. cereus enterotoxins against b. subtilis and b. licheniformis dna sequences.

TI  == diversity of endophytic bacterial populations and their interaction with xylella  fastidiosa in citrus plants.
AB  == citrus variegated chlorosis (cvc) is caused by xylella fastidiosa, a phytopathogenic bacterium that can infect all citrus sinensis cultivars. the endophytic bacterial communities of healthy, resistant, and cvc-affected citrus plants were studied by using cultivation as well as cultivation-independent techniques. the endophytic communities were assessed in surface-disinfected citrus branches by plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). dominant isolates were characterized by fatty-acid methyl ester analysis as bacillus pumilus, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium spp. (including methylobacterium extorquens, m. fujisawaense, m. mesophilicum, m. radiotolerans, and m. zatmanii), nocardia sp., pantoea agglomerans, and xanthomonas campestris. we observed a relationship between cvc symptoms and the frequency of isolation of species of methylobacterium, the genus that we most frequently isolated from symptomatic plants. in contrast, we isolated c. flaccumfaciens significantly more frequently from asymptomatic plants than from those with symptoms of cvc while p. agglomerans was frequently isolated from tangerine (citrus reticulata) and sweet-orange (c. sinensis) plants, irrespective of whether the plants were symptomatic or asymptomatic or showed symptoms of cvc. dgge analysis of 16s rrna gene fragments amplified from total plant dna resulted in several bands that matched those from the bacterial isolates, indicating that dgge profiles can be used to detect some endophytic bacteria of citrus plants. however, some bands had no match with any isolate, suggesting the occurrence of other, nonculturable or as yet uncultured, endophytic bacteria. a specific band with a high g+c ratio was observed only in asymptomatic plants. the higher frequency of c. flaccumfaciens in asymptomatic plants suggests a role for this organism in the resistance of plants to cvc.

TI  == large-scale screening of nasal swabs for bacillus anthracis: descriptive summary  and discussion of the national institutes of health's experience.
AB  == in october 2001, a letter containing a large number of anthrax spores was sent through the brentwood post office in washington, d.c., to a united states senate  office on capitol hill, resulting in contamination in both places. several thousand people who worked at these sites were screened for spore exposure by collecting nasal swab samples. we describe here a screening protocol which we, as a level a laboratory, used on very short notice to process a large number of specimens (3,936 swabs) in order to report preliminary results as quickly as possible. six isolates from our screening met preliminary criteria for bacillus anthracis identification and were referred for definitive testing. although none  of the isolates was later confirmed to be b. anthracis, we studied these isolates further to define their biochemical characteristics and 16s rrna sequences. four  of the six isolates were identified as bacillus megaterium, one was identified as bacillus cereus, and one was an unidentifiable bacillus sp. our results suggest that large-scale nasal-swab screening for potential exposure to anthrax spores, particularly if not done immediately postexposure, may not be very effective for  detecting b. anthracis but may detect a number of bacillus spp. that are phenotypically very similar to b. anthracis.

AB  == objective: bacteria and/or their antigens are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (rea). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the 16s ribosomal rna-pcr method was used to identify bacterial dna in synovial fluid (sf) and tissue (st) in a well defined group of patients with chronic rea.  in addition, species found were identified by means of sequence analysis. methods: we examined 15 st and 5 sf samples of 15 patients with rea, 5 st samples of 5 patients with osteoarthritis (oa), and 8 sf from 8 patients with closed traumatic knee injuries using a nested pcr with universal 16s rrna primers. in addition, a nested pcr was developed to detect dna sequences of salmonella sp. and mycoplasma sp. automated sequencing and comparative data analysis (genbank) were also performed to identify the species. results: bacterial dna was identified in 8 cases, 5 st and 3 sf; chlamydia trachomatis (n = 2), pseudomonas  sp. (n = 3), and bacillus cereus (n = 2) were the most common microorganisms identified. a variety of microorganisms including clostridium sp., lactobacillus  sp., pseudomonas migulae, p. fluorescens, and p. putida, and neisseria meningitidis serogroup b were also identified. in half of the cases (4/8) 2 to 3  bacterial antigens were identified simultaneously. conclusion: bacterial dna is present in the joints in patients with chronic rea. a wide spectrum of bacteria including some not previously associated with rea were identified. further studies are needed to establish their exact role in the pathogenesis of rea and related arthritides.

AB  == a chitin-degrading bacillus strain, designated as nctu2, was screened from soil and identified. an extracellular chitinase was purified to >90% homogeneity from  the culture filtrate. the purification involved hydrophobic-interaction and gel-filtration chromatographic separations with a yield of 58%. the purified enzyme (chinctu2) is a monomeric protein with an estimated molecular mass of 36.5 kda and a pi of 6.3. it is thermally stable at 60 degrees c and ph 6-8 for more than 3 h. the optimal activity is in the range of 50-60 degrees c at ph 7.0. chitobiose is the predominant product throughout the enzymic hydrolysis of the colloidal chitin, indicating that the purified chitinase is an exo-chitinase. chito-oligosaccharides [with degree of polymerization (dp) values of 4-6] are good substrates of the purified enzyme, whereas a dp3 oligomer was slowly hydrolysed to form dp1 and dp2 sugars. the first 15 n-terminal amino acids of the enzyme were determined to be annlgskllvgywhn, which is highly homologous to that  of chia from bacillus cereus. a pcr cloning technique was employed to obtain the  corresponding gene from bacillus nctu2. the gene sequence was determined to be 1080 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 360 amino acids with the first 27 amino acids  as the signal peptide.

AB  == a range of gram-negative bacterial species use n-acyl homoserine lactone (ahl) molecules as quorum-sensing signals to regulate different biological functions, including production of virulence factors. ahl is also known as an autoinducer. an autoinducer inactivation gene, aiia, coding for an ahl lactonase, was cloned from a bacterial isolate, bacillus sp. strain 240b1. here we report identification of more than 20 bacterial isolates capable of enzymatic inactivation of ahls from different sources. eight isolates showing strong ahl-inactivating enzyme activity were selected for a preliminary taxonomic analysis. morphological phenotypes and 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis indicated that these isolates probably belong to the species bacillus thuringiensis. enzymatic analysis with known bacillus strains confirmed that all  of the strains of b. thuringiensis and the closely related species b. cereus and  b. mycoides tested produced ahl-inactivating enzymes but b. fusiformis and b. sphaericus strains did not. nine genes coding for ahl inactivation were cloned either by functional cloning or by a pcr procedure from selected bacterial isolates and strains. sequence comparison of the gene products and motif analysis showed that the gene products belong to the same family of ahl lactonases.

TI  == modified blasticidin s resistance gene (bsrm) as a selectable marker for construction of retroviral vectors.
AB  == retroviral vectors are commonly used in ex vivo gene therapy protocols. the structure of vectors basically consists of one gene of interest and a selectable  marker gene. fast selection without damaging cells is a critical step for ex vivo gene therapy protocols. blasticidin s deaminase isolated from bacillus cereus has a neutralizing action on the highly toxic antibiotic blasticidin s (bs). a commercially available gene coding for blasticidin s deaminase (bsr) when used to construct retroviral vectors, lbsn and lnsb, provided very low levels of bs deaminase activity, precluding their routine use in gene transfer experiments. however, with the introduction of specific mutations into the bsr gene based on the kozak consensus sequences and deletion of a 5' untranslated sequence to generate bsrm, we were able to construct a retroviral vector encoding resistance  to high doses of bs (at least 16-fold above the usual lethal dose in nih3t3 cells), showing that bsrm/bs may provide a useful system for selection of transduced mammalian cells.

AB  == under alternating aerobic/anaerobic conditions and without additional carbon sources, a bacterial consortium consisting initially of 18 bacterial strains was  obtained in a sequence batch reactor. the phosphorus removal capability could only be maintained using sterile filtrate of activated sludge as medium. the addition of calcium and magnesium salts, as well as vitamins and trace elements,  to autoclaved sterile filtrate of activated sludge was not sufficient to achieve  stable phosphorus removal. a further enrichment by subcultivation on solid, agar, freezing, and shortening of the aerobic and anaerobic phases led to a defined bacterial consortium consisting of four strains. on the basis of physiological and chemotaxonomic characterization, and partial 16s rrna sequencing, one of the  organisms was identified as delftia acidovorans. a further isolate belonged to the bacillus cereus group, and the third isolate was identified as microbacterium sp.. the remaining strain seems to represent a new genus within the flavobacteriaceae. under continuous chemostat conditions, this consortium was able to remove up to 9.6 mg p/l phosphate in the aerobic phase and released up to 8.5 mg/l in the anaerobic phase. up to 25 mg p-polyphosphate/g dry mass was stored under aerobic conditions.

TI  == class ii broad-spectrum mercury resistance transposons in gram-positive bacteria  from natural environments.

TI  == comparative sensitivity to uv-b radiation of two bacillus thuringiensis subspecies and other bacillus sp.
AB  == susceptibility of bacillus thuringiensis spores and toxins to the uv-b range (280--330 nm) of the solar spectrum reaching earth's surface may be responsible for its inactivation and low persistence in nature. spores of the mosquito larvicidal b. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis were significantly more resistant  to uv-b than spores of the lepidopteran-active subsp. kurstaki. spores of subsp.  israelensis were as resistant to uv-b as spores of b. subtilis and more resistant than spores of the closely related b. cereus and another mosquito larvicidal species b. sphaericus. sensitivity of b. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis spores  to uv-b radiation depended upon their culture age; 24-h cultures, approaching maximal larvicidal activity, were still sensitive. maximal resistance to uv-b was achieved only at 48 h.

TI  == variability and interactions between endophytic bacteria and fungi isolated from  leaf tissues of citrus rootstocks.
AB  == fungi and bacteria were isolated from surface disinfected leaf tissues of several citrus rootstocks. the principal bacterial species isolated were alcaligenes sp., bacillus spp. (including b. cereus, b. lentus, b. megaterium, b. pumilus, and b.  subtilis), burkholderia cepacia, curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, enterobacter cloacae, methylobacterium extorquens, and pantoea agglomerans, with p. agglomerans and b. pumilus being the most frequently isolated species. the most abundant fungal species were colletotrichum gloeosporioides, guignardia citricarpa, and cladosporium sp. genetic variability between 36 endophytic bacterial isolates was analysed by the random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) technique, which indicated that b. pumilus isolates were more diverse than p. agglomerans isolates, although genetic diversity was not related to the host plants. in vitro interaction studies between g. citricarpa isolates and the most  frequently isolated endophytic bacteria showed that metabolites secreted by g. citricarpa have an inhibitory growth effect on some bacillus species, and a stimulatory growth effect on p. agglomerans.

TI  == microbiological survey of retail herbs and spices from mexican markets.
AB  == in the present study, 304 samples of herbs and spices (garlic powder, cumin seeds, black pepper, oregano, and bay leaves) widely used in mexico were analyzed for the presence of bacillus cereus, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae, escherichia coli, total and fecal coliforms, total mesophilic aerobic organisms,  and fungi. samples were nonpackaged or packaged in polyethylene bags or glass containers. high levels (10(5) to 10(7) cfu/g) of mesophilic aerobic microorganisms were found in most of the samples of garlic powder, cumin seed, and black pepper. lower levels (<102 cfu/g) were found in oregano and bay leaves. total and fecal coliforms counts were dependent on the type of packaging. more than 70% of the polyethylene-packaged samples had less than 10(3) cfu/g of microorganisms. glass and nonpackaged spices showed lower levels of these microorganisms. b. cereus was present in 32 samples of which most were polyethylene packaged. the other pathogenic bacteria were not detected. aspergillus niger was detected in 29% of the samples, rhizopus sp. in 19%, and penicillum sp. and cunninghamella in 8%.

TI  == bacterial spore inhibition and inactivation in foods by pressure, chemical preservatives, and mild heat.
AB  == sucrose laurates, sucrose palmitate, sucrose stearates, and monolaurin (lauricidin) were evaluated for inhibitory effects against spores of bacillus sp., clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and alicyclobacillus sp. in a model agar system. the combined treatment of sucrose laurate, high hydrostatic pressure, and mild heat was evaluated on spores of bacillus and alicyclobacillus in foods. the  minimum inhibitory concentrations of the sucrose esters were higher than that of  lauricidin for all spores tested in the model agar system, but lauricidin was not the most readily suspended in the test media. the sucrose laurates and sucrose palmitate were more effective and more readily suspended than the sucrose stearates. a combined treatment of sucrose laurate (<1.0%), 392 megapascals (mpa) at 45 degrees c for 10 to 15 min provided 3- to 5.5-log10 cfu/ml reductions from  initial populations of 10(6) cfu/ml for bacillus subtilis 168 in milk, bacillus cereus 14579 in beef, bacillus coagulans 7050 in tomato juice (ph 4.5), alicyclobacillus sp. n1089 in tomato juice (ph 4.5), and alicyclobacillus sp. n1098 in apple juice. the most notable change in the appearance of the products was temporary foaming during mixing of the sucrose laurate in the foods. the effect of sucrose laurate appeared to be inhibitory rather than lethal to the spores. the inhibitory effects observed on bacillus and alicyclobacillus spores by the combined treatment of pressure, mild heat, and sucrose laurate appear promising for food applications where alternatives to high heat processing are desired.

TI  == improvement of the detection of listeria monocytogenes by the application of aloa, a diagnostic, chromogenic isolation medium.
AB  == a new selective agar medium, aloa, for the selective and differential isolation of listeria monocytogenes has been evaluated. all stressed cultures of l. monocytogenes serovars tested grew on the medium as bluish colonies surrounded by a distinctive opaque halo and gave a productivity ratio of at least 0.95. non-pathogenic listeria sp. produced bluish colonies without a halo as was also the case for some enterococci and bacilli. special attention must be paid to some bacillus cereus strains and l. ivanovii since their colony appearance can be misleading. only some unidentified listeria-like bacteria gave false-positive results. aloa detected 4. 3% more positives from naturally contaminated dairy and meat samples compared with the iso procedure when used with genprobetm or vidastm for confirmation of presumptive colonies; 13.9% false negatives were found compared with 38.9% using palcam/oxford. aloa was also clearly superior to oxford and palcam when samples containing both l. monocytogenes and l. innocua were examined. the introduction of aloa in standard isolation procedures as an additional medium would enhance the detection ratio and reduce the time and cost  of analysis for l. monocytogenes.

TI  == two-enzyme system for the synthesis for 1-lauroyl-rac-glycerophosphate (lysophosphatidic acid) and 1-lauroyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate.
AB  == a combination of two enzymes, phospholipase d (pl d) and c (pl c), was investigated for the production of two lysophospholipids, 1-lauroyl-rac-glycerophosphate (1-lgp) and 1-lauroyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate (1-ldhap). the high transphosphatidylation ability of phospholipase d from streptomyces sp. allowed the formation of 1-lauroyl-phosphatidylglycerol (1-lpg)  and 1-lauroyl-phosphatidyldihydroxyacetone (1-lpdha) from phosphatidylcholine (pc) and 1-monolauroyl-rac-glycerol (1-mlg) and 1-lauroyl-dihydroxyacetone (1-mdha), respectively. a two-phase system, diethyl ether/water, was chosen for the convenience of the recovery of the water insoluble products. a similar two-phase system was used for hydrolysis of the complex phospholipids by phospholipase c form bacillus cereus, which released both lysophospholipids. only trace amounts of phosphatidic acid (pa) were detected showing that the enzyme is  highly selective for the release of the diacylglycerol and 1-lauroyl-rac-glycerophosphate and 1-lauroyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate.

TI  == [development from actions of bacterial phospholipases c on eucaryotic plasma membranes to molecular biology of gpi-anchored proteins].
AB  == bacterial phospholipases c are known to act on biomembranes, since they can cleave the phosphodiester linkage between the polar head and the hydrophobic moiety of each phospholipid in these membranes. these enzymes have been classified into three groups; phosphatidylcholine (pc)-, sphingomyelin (sm)- and  phosphatidylinositol (pi)-degrading phospholipases c. enzymatic properties and toxicities of these phospholipases c are reviewed, in relation to author's research. studies on the hemolytic phospholipases of clostridium sp., bacillus cereus etc., revealed that hydrolysis of choline-containing phospholipids such as pc and sm was responsible for the hemolysis of mammalian erythrocytes by these enzymes in the presence of ca2+ and/or mg2+. also, the studies on a structure-activity correlation of sm-hydrolyzing phospholipase c from b. cereus disclosed the similarity of active sites between this enzyme and bovine pancreatic dnase i. by action of pi-degrading phospholipases c, several membrane  proteins such as alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, vsg (protozoal surface glycoprotein) etc., were shown to be released from the plasma membranes of eucaryotic cells. from structural analysis, these proteins have been revealed to  be glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored proteins bound to the plasma membranes with carboxyl terminal-attached glycolipid. biochemistry and molecular  biology of gpi-anchored proteins, including the structures and biosynthetic routes of gpi glycolipids as well as the process of gpi attachment to proteins, requirements of c-terminal signal peptide for the protein modification by gpi, and distribution of gpi-anchored proteins in living world, are described in relation to our studies.

TI  == characterization, production, and purification of leucocin h, a two-peptide bacteriocin from leuconostoc mf215b.
AB  == leuconostoc mf215b was found to produce a two-peptide bacteriocin referred to as  leucocin h. the two peptides were termed leucocin halpha and leucocin hbeta. when acting together, they inhibit, among others, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and clostridium perfringens. production of leucocin h in growth medium takes place at temperatures down to 6 degrees c and at ph below 7. the highest activity of leucocin h in growth medium was demonstrated in the late exponential  growth phase. the bacteriocin was purified by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, ion-exchange (sp sepharose) and reverse phase chromatography. upon purification, specific activity increased 10(5)-fold, and the final specific activity was 2 x 10(7) bu/od280. amino acid composition analyses of leucocin halpha and leucocin hbeta indicated that both peptides consisted of around 40 amino acid residues. their n-termini were blocked for edman degradation, and the  methionin residues of leucocin hbeta did not respond to cyanogen bromide (cnbr) cleavage. absorbance at 280 nm indicated the presence of tryptophan residues and  tryptophan-fracturing opened for partial sequencing by edman degradation. from leucocin halpha, the sequence of 20 amino acids was obtained; from leucocin hbeta the sequence of 28 amino acid residues was obtained. no sequence homology to other known bacteriocins could be demonstrated. it also appeared that the two peptides themselves shared little or no sequence homology. the presence of soy oil did not affect the activity of leucocin h in agar.

AB  == a total of 316 bacterial strains, including psychrophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles, were isolated and identified from indoor dusts in schools, children's day care centres and animal sheds. several species which had not previously been reported from indoor environments were found: sphingomonas, brevibacterium, nocardiopsis, deinococcus and rhodococcus/gordona. a new psychrophilic actinomycete genus was also found in animal sheds, representing a new undescribed peptidoglycan type and an unusual whole-cell fatty acid composition. the indoor dusts of animal sheds contained mainly the gram-negative  genera pseudomonas, pantoea, flavobacterium and xanthomonas early in the indoor feeding season, but changed to a composition dominated by bacillus, micrococcus and mesophilic and thermophilic actinomycetes towards the end of the season. the  dust contained, and air-borne bacterial flora in schools and day care centres were dominated by, gram-positive bacilli and actinomycetes, notably bacillus cereus, brevibacillus brevis, b. licheniformis, b. subtilis and species of arthrobacter, corynebacterium, rhodococcus/gordona, nocardiopsis sp., deinococcus, staphylococcus and micrococcus. indoor air and dust contained klebsiella oxytoca, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, ac. lwoffi, bacillus cereus and  nocardiopsis dassonvillei with the status of hazard group ii. indoor dusts of animal sheds contained eight different 3-hydroxy fatty acids, the 2-hydroxy fatty acid 14:0 and two 10-methyl fatty acids, whereas in dusts from schools and day care centres, these were below the detection level (< 3.5 ng mg-1). the 3-and 2-hydroxy fatty acids could be assigned to one or more of the dust-contained cultivable strains, but 10-methyl c16:0 was not present in any of the strains isolated. the dusts from schools and children's day care centres contained 0.2-0.3 ng of endotoxin mg-1 and 0.5-1.4 ng of beta-d-glucan mg-1, whereas the dusts from animal sheds contained more 0.3-41 ng mg-1 and 8-35 ng mg-1, respectively.

TI  == bacillus weihenstephanensis sp. nov. is a new psychrotolerant species of the bacillus cereus group.
AB  == the bacillus cereus group comprises the four valid species bacillus cereus, bacillus mycoides, bacillus thuringiensis and bacillus anthracis. some isolates of b. cereus are known to be psychrotolerant (growth at 7 degrees c or below). here, specific sequence differences are described between the 16s rdna, the 23s rdna, the 16s-23s rdna spacer region and the genes of the major cold-shock protein homologue cspa in a variety of psychrotolerant and mesophilic b. cereus and b. mycoides strains. randomly amplified polymorphic dna analysis using three  different primers clearly separated psychrotolerant strains of both species from  the rest of the b. cereus group, as did inverse pcr patterns of the rdna operons. these data strongly support a hitherto unrecognized fifth sub-group within the b. cereus species group comprising psychrotolerant, but not mesophilic, b. cereus strains. despite the latter finding, the dna sequences investigated exhibited a high degree of sequence similarity indicating a close relationship between the species of the b. cereus group. considering the unusual importance of b. cereus in both food poisoning and food spoilage and to avoid merging all species of the  group, a new species, bacillus weihenstephanensis sp. nov., comprising psychrotolerant 'cereus' strains, is proposed. isolates of the new species grow at 4-7 degrees c but not at 43 degrees c and can be identified rapidly using rdna or cspa targeted pcr. the type strain is b. weihenstephanensis wsbc 10204t (= dsm 11821t).

TI  == studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

AB  == subtilisin-like serine protease, which is associated with the dormant spores of bacillus cereus, was solubilized by washing the spores with 2 m kcl and purified  to homogeneity by carbobenzoxy-d-phenylalanine-liganded affinity column chromatography and hydrophobic interaction column chromatography. enzyme activity was completely inhibited by reagents for sulfhydryl groups such as hgcl2 as well  as by conventional subtilisin inhibitors, suggesting the enzyme to be cysteine-dependent. the enzyme retained activity in 5 m urea at 4 degrees c for at least 2 months, and the specific activity was 50 times that of subtilisin bpn  when measured for a common chromogenic substrate, carbobenzoxy-glycyl-glycyl-l-leucine p-nitroanilide. the gene encoding this protease was cloned in escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed. the deduced amino acid sequence suggested that the protease is produced as a precursor comprising three portions; a signal sequence (28 amino acid residues), a prosequence (80 amino acid residues) and a mature enzyme (289 amino  acid residues). the mature region of the enzyme had high similarity with a thermitase from thermoactinomyces vulgaris (72% identity) and a thermostable alkaline protease from thermoactinomyces sp. e79 (66% identity), which have the n-terminal sequence showing scarcely noticeable similarity with corresponding stretches of subtilisins and mercuric ion-sensitive free cysteine in the equivalent position of the primary structure.

TI  == the arthromitus stage of bacillus cereus: intestinal symbionts of animals.
AB  == in the guts of more than 25 species of arthropods we observed filaments containing refractile inclusions previously discovered and named "arthromitus" in 1849 by joseph leidy [leidy, j. (1849) proc. acad. nat. sci. philadelphia 4, 225-233]. we cultivated these microbes from boiled intestines of 10 different species of surface-cleaned soil insects and isopod crustaceans. literature review and these observations lead us to conclude that arthromitus are spore-forming, variably motile, cultivable bacilli. as long rod-shaped bacteria, they lose their flagella, attach by fibers or fuzz to the intestinal epithelium, grow filamentously, and sporulate from their distal ends. when these organisms are incubated in culture, their life history stages are accelerated by light and inhibited by anoxia. characterization of new arthromitus isolates from digestive  tracts of common sow bugs (porcellio scaber), roaches (gromphodorhina portentosa, blaberus giganteus) and termites (cryptotermes brevis, kalotermes flavicollis) identifies these flagellated, spore-forming symbionts as a bacillus sp. complete  sequencing of the 16s rrna gene from four isolates (two sow bug, one hissing roach, one death's head roach) confirms these as the low-g+c gram-positive eubacterium bacillus cereus. we suggest that b. cereus and its close relatives, easily isolated from soil and grown on nutrient agar, enjoy filamentous growth in moist nutrient-rich intestines of healthy arthropods and similar habitats.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of food-related penicillium sp. against pathogenic bacteria in laboratory media and a cheese model system.
AB  == food-related penicillium species (n = 34) and geotrichum candidum (n = 11) grown  on czapek dox and brie agar were tested for their ability to suppress growth of pathogenic bacteria. ten out of 13 p. camemberti showed antagonistic activity while the other species did not interact significantly with the bacterial growth. the order of inhibition was: gram-negative bacteria and bacillus cereus > listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus sp. > micrococcus sp. whereas lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus aureus and some micrococcus sp. were unaffected. when salmonella typhimurium was inoculated together with p. camemberti p25 in brie agar, bacterial growth was inhibited during the first 6 d of incubation whereafter growth started. the inhibition of l. monocytogenes was similar but less pronounced. the antimicrobial activity produced by p. camemberti p25 and l84 was enhanced with increasing amount of sucrose in the medium. the activity was increased at low ph and destroyed at ph above 8. it was detectable at 15 degrees  c but not at 37 degrees c indicating that volatile metabolites might be involved. no significant accumulation of organic acids and no secondary metabolites such as mycotoxins were detected. hsgc-ms analysis indicated that acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal and 1-octen-3-ol were produced by p. camemberti during the period when inhibitory activity was observed. pure acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde were shown to be inhibitory to l. monocytogenes and salm. typhimurium when grown at 15 degrees c and ph 5.5 and 7.0.

TI  == the use of bacillus diarrhoeal enterotoxin (bde) detection using an elisa technique in the confirmation of the aetiology of bacillus-mediated diarrhoea.
AB  == a commercially available elisa kit was used for the detection of bacillus diarrhoeal enterotoxin (bde) in a variety of foods and faeces. the ability of isolates of bacillus spp., including bacillus cereus, to produce bde in brain heart infusion broth containing 0.1% glucose was also checked by use of the kit.  results show that 29 out of 31 b. cereus isolates were enterotoxigenic. foods positive for performed bde were always contaminated with > 10(5) b. cereus cfu g-1, but not all foods contaminated with large numbers of b. cereus were positive for bde. bacillus sp., other than one isolate which closely resembled b. subtilis, were negative for bde production. criteria for the confirmation of bacillus-mediated diarrhoea should now include reports of symptoms and incubation periods consistent with the diarrhoeal form of food-poisoning by bacillus spp., together with the results of tests for enterotoxigenicity of the bacillus isolate, and detection of bde in either the food and/or faeces.

TI  == three bacillus cereus bacteriophage endolysins are unrelated but reveal high homology to cell wall hydrolases from different bacilli.
AB  == the ply genes encoding the endolysin proteins from bacillus cereus phages bastille, tp21, and 12826 were identified, cloned, and sequenced. the endolysins  could be overproduced in escherichia coli (up to 20% of total cellular protein),  and the recombinant proteins were purified by a two-step chromatographical procedure. all three enzymes induced rapid and specific lysis of viable cells of  several bacillus species, with highest activity on b. cereus and b. thuringiensis. ply12 and ply21 were experimentally shown to be n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases (ec 3.5.1.28). no apparent holin genes were found adjacent to the ply genes. however, ply21 may be endowed with a signal peptide which could play a role in timing of cell lysis by the cytoplasmic phage  endolysin. the individual lytic enzymes (plyba, 41.1 kda; ply21, 29.5 kda, ply12, 27.7 kda) show remarkable heterogeneity, i.e., their amino acid sequences reveal  only little homology. the n-terminal part of ply21 was found to be almost identical to the catalytic domains of a bacillus sp. cell wall hydrolase (cwlsp)  and an autolysin of b. subtilis (cwla). the c terminus of plyba contains a 77-amino-acid sequence repeat which is also homologous to the binding domain of cwlsp. ply12 shows homology to the major autolysins from b. subtilis and e. coli. comparison with database sequences indicated a modular organization of the phage  lysis proteins where the enzymatic activity is located in the n-terminal region and the c-termini are responsible for specific recognition and binding of bacillus peptidoglycan. we speculate that the close relationship of the phage enzymes and cell wall autolysins is based upon horizontal gene transfer among different bacillus phages and their hosts.

TI  == altering substrate specificity of bacillus sp. sam1606 alpha-glucosidase by comparative site-specific mutagenesis.
AB  == the bacillus sp. sam1606 alpha-glucosidase with a broad substrate specificity is  the only known alpha-glucosidase that can hydrolyze alpha,alpha'-trehalose efficiently. the enzyme exhibits a very high sequence similarity to the oligo-1,6-glucosidases (o16g) of bacillus thermoglucosidasius and bacillus cereus which cannot act on trehalose. these three enzymes share 80% identical residues within the conserved regions (cr), which have been suggested to be located near or at the active site of the alpha-amylase family enzymes. to identify by site-specific mutagenesis the critical residues that determine the broad substrate specificity of the sam1606 enzyme we compared the cr sequences of these three glucosidases and selected five targets to be mutagenized in sam1606 alpha-glucosidase, met76, arg81, ala116, gly273, and thr342. these residues have  been specifically replaced by in vitro mutagenesis with asn, ser, val, pro, and asn, respectively, as in the bacillus o16g. the 12 mutant enzymes with single and multiple substitutions were expressed and characterized kinetically. the results  showed that the 5-fold mutation virtually abolished the affinity of the enzyme for alpha, alpha'-trehalose, whereas the specificity constant for the hydrolysis  of isomaltose, a good substrate for both the sam1606 enzyme and o16g, remained essentially unchanged upon the mutation. this loss in affinity for trehalose was  critically governed by a gly273 --> pro substitution, whose effect was specifically enhanced by the thr342 --> asn substitution in the 5-fold and quadruple mutants. these results provide evidence for the differential roles of the amino acid residues in the cr in determining the substrate specificity of the alpha-glucosidase.

TI  == risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  == the epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. from 1 january 1992 to 31 december 1994, the phls communicable disease surveillance centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in england and wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and s. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, clostridium perfringens in four, bacillus cereus in two, and campylobacter sp and escherichia coli in one each. no pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. the commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight  outbreaks. raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. inappropriate  storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.

TI  == selective killing of human monocytes and cytokine release provoked by sphingomyelinase (beta-toxin) of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the best-known activity of staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase c, alias beta-toxin, is as a hemolysin that provokes hot-cold lysis of erythrocytes which  contain substantial amounts of sphingomyelin in the plasma membrane. sheep erythrocytes are most susceptible, and we found that one hemolytic unit, representing the toxin concentration that elicits 50% hemolysis of 2.5 x 10(8) erythrocytes per ml, corresponds to 0.05 enzyme units or to approximately 0.25 microg of sphingomyelinase per ml. the cytotoxic action of beta-toxin on nucleated cells has not been described in any detail before, and the present investigation was undertaken to fill this information gap. we now identify beta-toxin as a remarkably potent monocytocidal agent. at a concentration of 0.001 u/ml, corresponding to approximately 5 ng/ml, beta-toxin killed over 50% of human monocytes (10(6) cells per ml) within 60 min. by contrast, 1 to 5 microg of beta-toxin per ml had no cytocidal effects on human granulocytes, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, or erythrocytes. a selective monocytocidal action was also observed  with sphingomyelinase c from bacillus cereus and a streptomyces sp., whereas phospholipase a2 and phospholipase d at 100 u/ml were without effect. monocytes succumbing to the action of beta-toxin processed and released interleukin-1beta,  soluble interleukin-6 receptor, and soluble cd14 into the supernatant. thus, monocyte killing by beta-toxin is associated with cytokine-related events that are important for the initiation and progression of infectious disease. these findings uncover a potentially important role for sphingomyelinase as a determinant of microbial pathogenicity.

AB  == a screening of microorganisms producing glutaryl-7adca acylase, an enzyme able to hydrolyse glutaric acid selectively from glutaryl-3-deacetoxy-7-aminocephalosporanic acid (glutaryl-7adca), has been carried out in soil samples. five microorganisms expressing acylase activity were isolated and classified as bacillus cereus, achromobacter xylosooxidans, bacillus sp., pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas paucimobilis. the screening was carried out  by preparing enrichment cultures containing glutaryl-7-adca or cephalosporin c as the selective carbon source. four model compounds (adipoyl-, glutamyl- and glutaryl-p-nitroanilide and glutarylcoumarin), mimicking the glutaryl-7adca beta-lactam moiety, were synthesized as substrates suitable for the rapid screening of the microorganisms (2500) isolated from the enrichment cultures. a total of 300 strains were active on the model substrates and only 5 displayed acylase activity on glutaryl-7adca. the fermentation parameters, such as ph and inducer concentration, for the optimal acylase expression and acylase specificity towards the model substrates were different for each strain.

AB  == the synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. a vector free digoxigenin-dutp-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the cloned plc gene of c.perfringens strain atcc 13124. in a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of c.perfringens were tested for plc. none of the strains failed in hybridization. presence of plc was even demonstrated in c.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. none different clostridia sp. tested, e.g. c.bifermentans, c.tertium, c.novyi, c.chauvoei, c.sporogenes, c.difficile, c.putrifucum, c.sordellii, c.botulinum, c. septicum and c.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with dna hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of c.perfringens plc.

TI  == glycan requirements of glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase c from trypanosoma brucei. glucosaminylinositol derivatives inhibit phosphatidylinositol phospholipase c.
AB  == glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase c (gpi-plc) from trypanosoma brucei and phosphatidylinositol phospholipase c (pi-plc) from bacillus sp. both cleave glycosylphosphatidylinositols (gpis). however, phosphatidylinositol, which is efficiently cleaved by pi-plc, is a very poor substrate for gpi-plc. we examined  gpi-plc substrate requirements using glycoinositol analogs of gpi components as potential inhibitors. glucosaminyl (alpha 1-->6)-d-myo-inositol (glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins), glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate, glcn(alpha 1-->6)-2-deoxy-ins, and glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate inhibited gpi-plc. glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins was as effective as man-(alpha 1-->4)glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins; we surmise that glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins is the crucial glycan motif for gpi-plc recognition. inhibition by glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate suggests product inhibition since gpis cleaved by gpi-plc possess a glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate at the terminus of the residual glycan. the effectiveness of glcn(alpha 1-->6)-2-deoxy-ins indicates that the d-myo-inositol  (ins) 2-hydroxyl is not required for substrate recognition, although it is probably essential for catalysis. glcn(alpha 1-->6)-2-deoxy-l-myo-inositol, unlike glcn(alpha 1-->6)-2- deoxy-ins, had no effect on gpi-plc; hence, gpi-plc can distinguish between the two enantiomers of ins. surprisingly, glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins 1,2-cyclic phosphate was not a potent inhibitor of bacillus cereus pi-plc, and glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins had no effect on the enzyme. however, both glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins 1-phosphate and glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins 1-dodecyl phosphonate were competitive inhibitors of pi-plc. these observations suggest an important role for a phosphoryl group at the ins 1-position in pi-plc recognition of gpis.  other studies indicate that abstraction of a proton from the ins 2-hydroxyl is not an early event in pi-plc cleavage of gpis. furthermore, both glcn(alpha 1-->6)-2-deoxy-ins 1-phosphate and glcn(alpha 1-->6)-2-deoxy-l- myo-inositol inhibited pi-plc without affecting gpi-plc. last, the aminoglycoside g418 stimulated pi-plc, but had no effect on gpi-plc. thus, these enzymes represent mechanistic subclasses of gpi phospholipases c, distinguishable by their sensitivity to glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins derivatives and aminoglycosides. possible allosteric regulation of pi-plc by glcn(alpha 1-->6)ins analogs is discussed.

TI  == structure and expression of a gene coding for thermostable alpha-glucosidase with a broad substrate specificity from bacillus sp. sam1606.

TI  == seasonal occurrence of psychrotrophic bacillus species in raw milk, and studies on the interactions with mesophilic bacillus sp.
AB  == mesophilic and psychrotrophic isolates of bacillus species displayed seasonal incidences in raw and pasteurised milk. the incidence of mesophilic isolates was  highest in the winter and lowest in the summer/autumn while pschrotroph incidence was conversely lowest in the winter and highest in the late summer/autumn. spores of bacillus sp. were isolated from raw milk taken from farm milk machines and bulk tanks, milk tankers, diary silos and pasteurised milk. a consistent seasonal fluctuation in incidence throughout these samples suggested that spores of bacillus sp. derived from the farm environment survived as important contaminants right through the milk chain to the pasteurised product. up to seven mesophilic bacillus sp. were isolated from a single sample with three species commonly occurring in most samples. the predominant mesophilic species isolated were b. pumilus, b. licheniformis and b. subtilis. the dominant psychrotrophic isolate was b. cereus. selected mesophilic isolates were examined for possible antagonistic effects on the growth of psychrotropic b. cereus and b. pumilus isolates. bacillus subtilis and b. licheniformis were found to produce antagonistic factors. it was considered that these factors may influence the incidence and growth of psychrotrophic isolates in the farm environment or in milk but the factors are not yet fully characterised or identified.

TI  == phospholipids chiral at phosphorus. stereochemical mechanism for the formation of inositol 1-phosphate catalyzed by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c.
AB  == the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c (pi-plc) from mammalian sources catalyzes the simultaneous formation of both inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate (icp)  and inositol 1-phosphate (ip). it has not been established whether the two products are formed in sequential or parallel reactions, even though the latter has been favored in previous reports. this problem was investigated by using a stereochemical approach. diastereomers of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-(1d- [16o,17o]phosphoinositol) ([16o,17o]dppi) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-(1d-thiophosphoinositol) (dppsi) were synthesized, the latter with known configuration. desulfurization of the dppsi isomers of known configurations in h2(18)o gave [16o,18o]dppi with known configurations, which allowed assignment of the configurations of [16o,17o]dppi on the basis of 31p nmr analyses of silylated [16o,18o]dppi and [16o,17o]dppi (the inositol moiety was fully protected in this operation). (rp)- and (sp)-[16o,17o]dppi were  then converted into trans- and cis-[16o,17o]icp, respectively, by pi-plc from bacillus cereus, which had been shown to proceed with inversion of configuration  at phosphorus [lin, g., bennett, f. c., & tsai, m.-d. (1990) biochemistry 29, 2747-2757]. 31p nmr analysis was again used to differentiate the silylated products of the two isomers of icp, which then permitted assignments of icp with  unknown configuration derived from transesterification of (rp)- and (sp)-[16o,17o]dppi by bovine brain pi-plc-beta 1. the results indicated inversion of configuration, in agreement with the steric course of the same reaction catalyzed by pi-plcs from b. cereus and guinea pig uterus reported previously. for the steric course of the formation of inositol 1-phosphate catalyzed by pi-plc, (rp)- and (sp)-[16o,17o]dppi were hydrolyzed in h2(18)o to afford 1-[16o,17o,18o]ip, which was then converted to icp chemically and analyzed by 31p nmr. the results indicated that both b. cereus pi-plc and the pi-plc-beta 1 from  bovine brain catalyze conversion of dppi to ip with overall retention of configuration at phosphorus. these results suggest that both bacterial and mammalian pi-plcs catalyze the formation of icp and ip by a sequential mechanism. however, the conversion of icp to ip was detectable by 31p nmr only for the bacterial enzyme. thus an alternative mechanism in which icp and ip are formed by totally independent pathways, with formation of ip involving a covalent enzyme-phosphoinositol intermediate, cannot be ruled out for the mammalian enzyme. it was also found that both pi-plcs displayed lack of stereo-specifically toward the 1,2-diacylglycerol moiety, which suggests that the hydrophobic part of phosphatidylinositol is not recognized by pi-plc.

TI  == phospholipids chiral at phosphorus. stereochemical mechanism of reactions catalyzed by phosphatidylinositide-specific phospholipase c from bacillus cereus  and guinea pig uterus.
AB  == (rp)- and (sp)-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-thiophosphoinositol (dppsi) were synthesized as a mixture and their configurations assigned on the basis of the stereospecific hydrolysis catalyzed by phospholipase a2 (pla2) from bee venom. pla2 is known to be stereospecific to the rp isomer of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-thiophosphocholine (dppsc) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-thiophosphoethanolamine (dppse). since the configurations of (rp)- and (sp)-dppsi correspond to those of (sp)- and (rp)-dppsc, respectively, due to a change in priority, the isomer specifically hydrolyzed by pla2 was assigned to (sp)-dppsi. the dppsi analogues were then used to probe the mechanism and to elucidate the steric course of the reaction catalyzed by phosphatidylinositide-specific phospholipase c (pi-plc) from bacillus cereus and for both isozyme i and isozyme ii of pi-plc from guinea pig uterus. it was found that the rp isomer of dppsi is the preferred substrate for all three pi-plcs. thus pi-plc shows the same stereospecificity as phosphatidylcholine-specific plc (pc-plc), which prefers the sp isomer of dppsc.  the ratio of the two products inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphorothioate (cips) and inositol phosphorothioate (ips) was not significantly perturbed by the use of phosphorothioate analogue for all three pi-plcs, which implies that ips is not produced by enzyme-mediated ring opening of cips and supports a parallel pathway  for the formation of both products. in order to elucidate the steric course of the cyclization reaction, exo and endo isomers of cips were synthesized and their absolute configurations at phosphorus were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance and other techniques. it was found that exo-cips is the product produced by all three pi-plcs. thus the steric course of the conversion dppsi to  cips catalyzed by all three pi-plcs was inversion of configuration at phosphorus. these results taken together suggest that the reaction catalyzed by pi-plc most likely proceeds via direct attack by the 2-oh group to generate the cyclic product, and parallelly by water to generate the noncyclic inositol phosphates, without involving a covalent enzyme-phosphoinositol intermediate.

AB  == a screening test of antimicrobial activities for some of the isoquinoline alkaloids and their first and second hofmann elimination products was conducted in this study. results showed that (+)-actinodaphnine (1), (+)-n-me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), (-)-xylopine (19) and (-)-n-me-xylopine mei (20), had the strongest inhibitory activities against three g(+) bacteria (bacillus cereus, micrococcus sp. and staphylococcus aureus) mic greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml). whereas anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine mei (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), dicentrine methine (23), roemerine methine (26), dicentrine bismethine (29) and o-me-armepavine methine (48) also had antibacterial effects against these same three g(+) bacteria (mic = 50-300 micrograms/ml). however, only (+)-actinodaphnine (1) and roemerine methine (26) showed weak effects against two g(-) bacteria (escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonia) (mic = 300 micrograms/ml). (+)-actinodaphnine(1),  (+)-n-me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine mei (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), o-me-armepavine methine (48) and o,o-di-et-n-me-coclaurine methine (49) had potent antifungal activities  against candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans and other candida species (mic  = 62.5-1000 micrograms/ml).

TI  == the nucleotide sequence of the lipo-penicillinase gene of alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain 170.
AB  == the lipo-penicillinase (lipen) gene from an alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain 170  was cloned in escherichia coli using the vector phsg399. a plasmid, pfap121, was  isolated from an ampicillin resistant transformant and the cloned lipen gene was  found to be in a 2.2 kb dna fragment. the nucleotide sequence of a 1.9 kb segment encoding the lipen was determined. this segment showed an open reading frame which would encode a polypeptide of 310 amino acids. the amino acid sequence of this lipen gene product has strong homology with those of the bacillus cereus beta-lactamase iii and bacillus licheniformis penicillinase.

TI  == the biosynthetic implications of acetate and glutamate incorporation into (3r,5r)-carbapenam-3-carboxylic acid and (5r)-carbapen-2-em-3-carboxylic acid by  serratia sp.
AB  == two new beta-lactams have been isolated from strains of serratia and erwinia sp.  and identified as (3r,5r)- and (3s,5r)-carbapenam-3-carboxylic acid. these novel  carbapenams lack antibacterial activity, are resistant to both beta-lactamases i  and ii from bacillus cereus and are not detected by the lactamase induction assay. radiolabelled and stable isotope experiments have established that both metabolites together with the antibiotic 5r-carbapenem-3-carboxylic acid are glutamate and acetate derived. a number of possible pathways for the biosynthesis of these compounds as well as their relationship to the more complex members of the carbapenem family of beta-lactam antibiotics are discussed.

TI  == surface-active agents from two bacillus species.
AB  == two bacillus species were studied which produced bioemulsifiers; however, they were distinctly different compounds. bacillus sp. strain iaf 343 produced unusually high yields of extracellular biosurfactant when grown on a medium containing only water-soluble substrates. the yield of 1 g/liter was appreciably  better than those of most of the biosurfactants reported previously. this neutral lipid product, unlike most lipid biosurfactants, had significant emulsifying properties. it did not appreciably lower the surface tension of water. on the same medium, bacillus cereus iaf 346 produced a more conventional polysaccharide  bioemulsifier, but it also produced a monoglyceride biosurfactant. the bioemulsifier contained substantial amounts of glucosamine and originated as part of the capsule layer. the monoglyceride lowered the surface tension of water to 28 mn/m. it formed a strong association with the polysaccharide, and it was necessary to use ultrafiltration to effect complete separation. the removal of the monoglyceride caused the polysaccharide to precipitate. it is suggested that  earlier reports of biopolymers which both stabilized emulsions and lowered surface tension were actually similar aggregates of lipid and bioemulsifier.

TI  == plaster-associated bacillus cereus wound infection. a case report.
AB  == plaster of paris and nonsterile cast padding have previously been implicated in wound infections. the observation of three pin site infections with bacillus cereus following pin placement and plaster fixation of an open forearm fracture led to an epidemiologic investigation. two hundred sixty-one bacterial cultures were taken from materials in the steinmann pin application and plaster fixation procedures. b. cereus with a similar antibiogram and biotype as was identified in the pin site cultures was recovered from three of the 22 (14%) plaster-impregnated gauze rolls and six of seven (81%) tapwater samples. the bacillus sp contamination rate of plaster when dry or wetted with sterile water or tapwater was 58%, 25% and 40% respectively. all cultures of plaster samples were negative after steam or gas sterilization. these results suggest that the patient may have acquired the infection from the plaster-impregnated gauze wetted in tapwater. in this case, the steinmann pins may have facilitated infection by guiding the plaster-associated bacteria to the pin insertion site. the use of gas sterilized plaster materials should be considered in certain circumstances.

TI  == [biochemical characterization of bacillus benzoevorans sp. nov., a new filamentous, sheathed mesophilic species, degrading various aromatic acids and phenols].
AB  == the eleven strains studied were prototrophic and did not grow in media containing only 1% bacto-peptone or bacto-tryptone; they grew rapidly in media containing 0.4% yeast extract and 0.2% sodium acetate or benzoate. the maximal growth temperature ranged from 39 to 45 degrees c. six aliphatic acids, four aromatic acids and five phenols were used as sole carbon and energy sources by the 11 strains. carbohydrates and amino acids (except for glycine) were not used as carbon and energy sources. nitrate (but not nitrite) was used anaerobically as a  respiratory electron acceptor. nitrous oxide was used and reduced to n2 by only 3 strains. the mean guanine-plus-cytosine content of the dna was 41.3 +/- 1.1 mol %. morphologically and nutritionally, the bacteria described are clearly different from the 5 known species of the first morphological group whose cells have a diameter greater than 1 micrometer: bacillus megaterium, b. cereus, b. cereus var. mycoides, b. macroides, b. badius, and b. fastidiosus. strain b1 (=ccm 3364) is the holotype of bacillus benzoevorans sp. nov.

TI  == [spoilage microorganisms encountered in ultra-high temperature processed milk].
AB  == 40 strains of aerobic or facultative anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from  a total of 37 spoiled ultra high temperature processed milk. 13 of them were identified as the genus bacillus. they were 6 b. cereus, 5 b. licheniformis, 1 b. brevis and 1 b. pumilus. the other 27 strains were nonsporeforming microorganisms, which included 5 yeasts, 2 pseudomonas sp., 3 streptococcus sp.,  12 lactobacillus sp., 1 shigella sp., 1 aeromonas sp. and 3 micrococcus sp. results indicate that the spoilage of milk sample was caused mainly by the contamination during the filling operation. the bacillus strains isolated were mesophilic or thermophilic, and some of them, were also psychrotrophic.

TI  == influence of environmental factors on antagonism of fungi by bacteria in soil: clay minerals and ph.
AB  == the soil replica plating technique was used to evaluate the influence of clay minerals and ph on antagonistic interactions between fungi and bacteria in soil.  in general, the antagonistic activity of bacteria towards filamentous fungi was greater in soil than on agar. the spread of aspergillus niger through soil was inhibited by serratia marcescens when the organisms were inoculated into separate sites in soil, and this antagonistic effect was maintained when the soil was amended with 3, 6, 9, or 12% (vol/vol) montmorillonite, whereas the addition of kaolinite at a concentration of 3% reduced the antagonism and at 6, 9, or 12% totally eliminated it. similar results were obtained with the inhibition of a. niger by agrobacterium radiobacter and of penicillium vermiculatum by either s. marcescens or nocardia paraffinae. when a. niger and s. marcescens were inoculated into the same soil site, a. niger was inhibited in all soils, regardless of clay content, although the extent of inhibition was greater as the  concentration of montmorillonite, but not of kaolinite, increased. a. niger was inhibited more when inoculated as spores than as mycelial fragments and when inoculated 96 h after s. marcescens, but a 1% glucose solution reduced the amount of inhibition when the fungus was inoculated 96 h after the bacterium. when the ph of the soil-clay mixtures was altered, the amount of antagonism usually increased as the ph increased. antagonism appeared to be related to the cation-exchange capacity and the ph of the soil-clay mixtures. bacillus cereus and another species of bacillus showed no activity in soil towards a. niger under any of the environmental conditions tested, even though the bacillus sp. significantly inhibited a. niger and seven other fungi on agar.

AB  == steady-state continuous culture was used to optimize lean chemically defined media for a cellulomonas sp. and bacillus cereus strain t. both organisms were extremely sensitive to variations in trace-metal concentrations. however, medium  optimization by this technique proved rapid, and multifactor screening was easily conducted by using a minimum of instrumentation. the optimized media supported critical dilution rates of 0.571 and 0.467 h for cellulomonas and bacillus, respectively. these values approximated maximum growth rate values observed in batch culture.

TI  == production of l-glutamic acid by a bacillus sp.
AB  == a strain of bacillus cereus var. mycoides isolated from burdwan soil produces l-glutamate in the medium. the strain is able to grow and produce in a synthetic  medium but supplementation with casamino acid or yeast extract improves the yield. maintenance of ph of the fermentation medium near neutrality prolongs the  active growth period and improves the yield. glucose and ammonium nitrate were found to be most suitable carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. cane sugar molasses (as a substitute for glucose) significantly stimulated the growth but glutamate production was less. various b vitamins stimulate the growth and glutamate yield. the yield of glutamate under optimal condition is 5.2 g/l.

TI  == microbiological transformations of delta6a10a-tetrahydrocannabinol.
AB  == a screening program was conducted to find microorganisms that catalyze transformation reactions with cannabinoids. three hundred fifty-eight cultures, consisting of 97 bacteria, 175 actinomycetes, and 86 molds, were incubated in media containing 0.5 mg of delta(6a,10a)-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta(6a,10a)-thc) per ml. after 120 h of cultivation, ethyl acetate extracts of the cultures were examined by thin-layer chromatography (tlc) for transformation products. about 18% of the cultures modified delta(6a,10a)-thc. the ability to modify the substrate did not predominate among any particular group of microorganisms. after purification, the products from three cultures were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry, 100-mhz proton magnetic resonance spectrometry, ultraviolet spectrometry, and infrared spectrometry. these spectral data indicated that a mycobacterium sp. oxidized delta(6a,10a)-thc to cannabinol and a diastereomeric pair of 6a-hydroxy-delta(10,10a)-thc isomers; a streptomyces sp. and a bacillus sp. oxidized delta(6a,10a)-thc to 7-keto-delta(6a,10a)-thc and 4'-hydroxy-delta(6a,10a)-thc, respectively. the occurrence of these products and  the presence of others that have not yet been isolated or identified indicate that microbial transformation may be a useful tool for the preparation of new cannabinoids that have desirable pharmacological properties.

AB  == fungi (rhizopus stolonifer, trichoderma viride, fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans, cunninghamella echinulata, and several species of aspergillus and penicillium) tolerated higher concentrations of cadmium (cd) when grown in soil than when grown on laboratory media, indicating that soil mitigated the toxic effects of cd. in soil amended with clay minerals, montmorillonite provided partial or total protection against fungistatic effects of cd, whereas additions  of kaolinite provided little or no protection. growth rates of aspergillus niger  were inhibited to a greater extent by 100 or 250 mug of cd per g in soil adjusted to ph 7.2 than in the same soil at its natural ph of 5.1. however, there were no  differences in the growth rates of aspergillus fischeri with 100 or 250 mug of cd per g in the same soil, whether at ph 5.1 or adjusted to ph 7.2. growth of a. niger and a. fischeri in a soil contaminated with a low concentration of cd (i.e., 28 mug/g), obtained from a site near a japanese smelter, did not differ significantly from growth in a soil collected some distance away and containing 4 mug of cd per g. growth of a. niger in sterile soil amended with 100 mug of cd per g and inoculated with bacillus cereus or agrobacterium tumefaciens was reduced to a greater extent than in the same soil containing 100 mug of cd per g  but no bacteria. the inhibitory effects of agrobacterium radiobacter to a. niger  were slightly reduced in the presence of 100 mug of cd per g, whereas the inhibitory effects of serratia marcescens were enhanced.
