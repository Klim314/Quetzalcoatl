synthesis, characterization, antimicrobial activity and mechanism of a novel hydroxyapatite whisker/nano zinc oxide biomaterial.
postoperative infections remain a risk factor that leads to failures in oral and  maxillofacial artificial bone transplantation. this study aimed to synthesize and evaluate a novel hydroxyapatite whisker (hapw) / nano zinc oxide (n-zno) antimicrobial bone restorative biomaterial. a scanning electron microscope (sem), energy dispersive spectroscopy (eds) and x-ray diffraction (xrd) were employed to characterize and analyze the material. antibacterial capabilities against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, candida albicans and streptococcus mutans were determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc), and kinetic growth inhibition assays were performed under darkness and simulated solar irradiation. the mode of antibiotic action was observed by transmission electron microscopy (tem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). the mic and mbc were 0.078-1.250 mg ml(-1) and 0.156-2.500 mg ml(-1), respectively. the inhibitory function on the growth of the microorganisms was achieved even under darkness, with gram-positive bacteria found to be more sensitive than gram-negative, and enhanced antimicrobial activity was exhibited under simulated solar excitation compared to darkness. tem and clsm images revealed a certain level of bacterial cell membrane destruction after treatment with 1 mg ml(-1) of the material for 12 h, causing the leakage of intracellular contents and bacteria death. these results suggest favorable antibiotic properties and a probable mechanism of the biomaterial for the first time, and further studies are needed to determine its potential application as a postoperative anti-inflammation method in bone transplantation.
[evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s. salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

background: sortase a is an enzyme responsible for the covalent attachment of pac proteins to the cell wall in streptococcus mutans. it has been shown to play a role in modulating the surface properties and the biofilm formation and influence the cariogenicity of s. mutans. curcumin, an active ingredient of turmeric, was reported to be an inhibitor for staphylococcus aureus sortase a. the aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory ability of curcumin against s. mutans sortase a and the effect of curcumin for biofilm formation. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the curcumin to the s. mutans and inhibitory ability of the curcumin against the purified sortase a in vitro were detected. western-blot and real-time pcr were used to analysis the sortase a mediated pac protein changes when the s. mutans was cultured with curcumin. the curcumin on the s. mutans biofilm formation was determined by biofilm formation analysis. results: curcumin can inhibit purified s. mutans sortase a with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic50) of (10.2+/-0.7)mumol/l, which is lower than minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 175mumol/l. curcumin (15mumol/l) was found to release the pac protein to the supernatant and reduce s. mutans biofilm formation. conclusions: these results indicated that curcumin is an s. mutans sortase a inhibitor and has promising anti-caries characteristics through an anti-adhesion-mediated mechanism.
anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial evaluation of neovestitol and vestitol isolated from brazilian red propolis.
the objective of this study was to evaluate anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities of neovestitol and vestitol isolated from brazilian red propolis (brp). brp ethanolic extract (eep), neovestitol, and vestitol were evaluated by anti-inflammatory properties using a neutrophil migration assay. the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (mic and mbc) against streptococcus mutans , streptococcus sobrinus , staphylococcus aureus , and actinomyces naeslundii . neovestitol, vestitol, and eep inhibited neutrophil migration at a dose of 10 mg/kg. regarding antimicrobial activity, neovestitol showed mics ranging from <6.25 to 25-50 mug/ml and mbcs ranging from 25-50 to 50-100 mug/ml, while vestitol showed mics ranging from 25-50 to 50-100 mug/ml and mbcs ranging from 25-50 to 50-100 mug/ml. both isoflavonoids neovestitol and vestitol are consistent bioactive compounds displaying anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities that can strongly act in a low dose and concentration and have a promising potential to be applied in the pharmaceutical and food industries.
antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities of stingless bee melipona scutellaris geopropolis.
background: geopropolis is a type of propolis containing resin, wax, and soil, collected by threatened stingless bee species native to tropical countries and used in folk medicine. however, studies concerning the biological activity and chemical composition of geopropolis are scarce. in this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of the ethanolic extract of geopropolis (eegp) collected by melipona scutellaris and its bioactive fraction against important clinical microorganisms as well as their in vitro cytotoxicity and chemical profile. methods: the antimicrobial activity of eegp and fractions was examined by determining their minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against six bacteria strains as well as their ability to inhibit streptococcus mutans biofilm adherence. total growth inhibition (tgi) was chosen to assay the antiproliferative activity of eegp and its bioactive fraction against normal and cancer cell lines. the chemical composition of m. scutellaris geopropolis was identified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. results: eegp significantly inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus strains and s. mutans at low concentrations, and its hexane fraction (hf) presented the highest antibacterial activity. also, both eegp and hf inhibited s. mutans biofilm adherence (p < 0.05) and showed selectivity against human cancer cell lines, although only hf demonstrated selectivity at low concentrations. the chemical analyses performed suggest the absence of flavonoids and the presence of benzophenones as geopropolis major compounds. conclusions: the empirical use of this unique type of geopropolis by folk medicine practitioners was confirmed in the present study, since it showed antimicrobial and antiproliferative potential against the cancer cell lines studied. it is possible that the major compounds found in this type of geopropolis are responsible for its properties.

objective: to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and surface properties of an acrylic resin containing the biocide polymer poly (2-tert-butylaminoethyl) methacrylate (ptbaema). background: several approaches have been proposed to prevent oral infections, including the incorporation of antimicrobial agents to acrylic resins. materials and methods: specimens of an acrylic resin (lucitone 550) were divided into two groups: 0% (control) and 10% ptbaema. antimicrobial activity was assessed by adherence assay of one of the microorganisms, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans and candida albicans. surface topography was characterised by atomic force microscopy and wettability properties determined by contact angle measurements. results: data of viable cells (log (cfu + 1)/ml) for s. aureus (control: 7.9 +/- 0.8; 10%: 3.8 +/- 3.3) and s. mutans (control: 7.5 +/- 0.7; 10%: 5.1 +/- 2.7) showed a significant decrease with 10% of ptbaema (mann-whitney, p < 0.05). for c. albicans (control: 6.6 +/- 0.2; 10%: 6.6 +/- 0.4), there was no significant difference between control and 10% of ptbaema (kruskal-wallis, p > 0.05). incorporating 10% ptbaema increased surface roughness and decreased contact angles. conclusion: incorporating 10% ptbaema into acrylic resins increases wettability and roughness of acrylic resin surface; and decreases the adhesion of s. mutans and s. aureus on acrylic surface, but did not exhibit antimicrobial effect against c. albicans.
the antimicrobial effects of propolis collected in different regions in the basque country (northern spain).
the antimicrobial activity of 19 propolis extracts prepared in different solvents (ethanol and propylene glycol) (eep/pep), was evaluated against some bacterial and fungal isolates using the agar-well diffusion method. it was verified that all the samples tested showed antimicrobial activity, although results varied considerably between samples. results revealed that both types of propolis extracts showed highly sensitive antimicrobial action against gram-positive bacteria and fungi at a concentration of 20% (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisae) with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, with a moderate effect against streptococcus pyogenes (mic from 17 to 26 mg/ml). to our knowledge, this is the first study showing elevated antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria [salmonella enterica (mic from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/ml)] and lesser activity against helicobacter pylori (mic from 6 to 14 mg/ml), while escherichia coli was resistant. this concluded that the basque propolis had a strong and dose-dependent activity against most of the microbial strains tested, while database comparison revealed that phenolic substances were responsible for this inhibition, regardless of their geographical origin and the solvent employed for extraction. statistical analysis showed no significant differences (p </= 0.05) between eep and pep extracts.

isolation and characterization of signermycin b, an antibiotic that targets the dimerization domain of histidine kinase walk.
the walk (histidine kinase)/walr (response regulator) two-component signal transduction system is a master regulatory system for cell wall metabolism and growth. this system is conserved in low g+c gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus mutans. in this study, we found the first antibiotic that functions as a walk inhibitor (signermycin b) by screening 10,000 streptomyces extracts. the chemical structure (c(23)h(35)no(4); molecular weight, 389.5) comprises a tetramic acid moiety and a decalin ring. signermycin b exhibited antimicrobial activity, with mic values ranging from 3.13 mug/ml (8 mum) to 6.25 mug/ml (16 mum) against gram-positive bacteria that possess the walk/walr two-component signal transduction system, including the drug-resistant bacteria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of signermycin b against walk in these organisms ranged from 37 to 61 mum. to determine the mechanism of action of signermycin b, surface plasmon resonance response analysis with the two walk domains of bacillus subtilis and competition assay with atp were performed. the results showed that signermycin b binds to the dimerization domain but not the atp-binding domain of walk. in the presence of the cross-linker glutaraldehyde, signermycin b did not cause protein aggregation but interfered with the cross-linking of walk dimers. these results suggest that signermycin b targets the conserved dimerization domain of walk to inhibit autophosphorylation. in bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, signermycin b preferentially controlled the walr regulon, thereby inhibiting cell division. these phenotypes are consistent with those of cells starved for the walk/walr system.
antibacterial activity of a new mineral trioxide aggregate-based root canal sealer.
objectives: to compare the antibacterial effect of ah-26, white-coloured mineral  trioxide aggregate (wmta) and cpm sealer against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans after 24 h and 1 week. materials and methods: all materials were prepared according to the manufacturers' directions immediately before testing. the antibacterial effect of each agent was determined by measuring the diameter of the zone of inhibition in millimetres after incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 h and 7 days in a humid atmosphere. each test was repeated three times. results: in the 24-h and 7-day samples, the antibacterial activity of ah-26 was significantly greater than that of the two other materials tested against both bacteria (p < 0.05). the antibacterial activities of cpm sealer and wmta against s. aureus were not significantly different (p > 0.05) in 24-h or 7-day samples, but cpm sealer demonstrated a significantly greater effect than wmta against s. mutans (p < 0.05). conclusion: all products studied exhibited antibacterial activity. however, in 24-h and 7-day samples, ah-26 exerted the greatest activity against both organisms tested.

evaluating the in-vitro antibacterial effect of iranian propolis on oral microorganisms.
propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. there have been few studies on the effects of iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. in this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of tehran was evaluated. susceptibility of the oral strains tested (streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 9222; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis atcc 9854 and lactobacillus casei atcc 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/ml of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at different concentrations of propolis. the ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with mic and mbc ranges of 250-500 microg/ml. the mic concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/ml against s. mutans and e. faecalis. the water extract showed bactericidal activity only against s. mutans (20 mg/ml). these results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. however, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.
antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite-based irrigating solutions.
purpose: the objective of the present study was the in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of three different naocl-based endodontic irrigating solutions: a 5.25% conventional sodium hypochlorite solution; and two new irrigating solutions, a 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with the addition of a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant; and a 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate. methods: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans strains were selected to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the endodontic irrigating solutions by the agar disc diffusion test. paper disks were saturated with each one of the tested solutions (at room temperature and pre-warmed at 45 degrees c) and placed onto culture agar-plates pre-adsorbed with bacterial cells and further incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees c. the growth inhibition zones around each irrigating solution were recorded and compared for each bacterial strain. results: the results were significantly different among the tested irrigating solutions: 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution produced the highest inhibition areas; 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate showed the lowest zones of inhibition. conclusions: even if all tested irrigating solution possessed antibacterial activity versus all tested bacterial strains, 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate showed lower in vitro efficacy than 5.25% conventional sodium hypochlorite solution.

ten silver(i) cyanoximates of agl composition (l = nc-c(no)-r, where r is electron withdrawing groups: -cn, -c(o)nr(2), -c(o)r' (alkyl), -c(o)oet, 2-heteroaryl fragments such as 2-pyridyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 2-benzoxazolyl, 2-benzthiazolyl) were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods and x-ray analysis. crystal structures of four complexes were determined and revealed the formation of two-dimensional (2d) coordination polymers of different complexity in which anions exhibit bridging or combined chelate and bridging binding modes. in these compounds, anions are in the nitroso form. all studied agl complexes are sparingly soluble in water and are thermally stable to 150 degrees c. synthesized compounds demonstrated remarkable insensitivity toward visible light and uv-radiation, which was explained based on their polymeric structures with multiple covalent bonds between bridging cyanoxime ligands and ag(i) centers. all 10 silver(i) cyanoximates were tested in vitro on the subject of their antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus hirae, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and mycobacterium fortuitum as well as against candida albicans in solutions, and in the solid state as pressed pellets and dried filter paper disks presoaked with solutions of agl in dmf. results showed pronounced antimicrobial activity for all investigated complexes. a combination of five factors: (1) light insensitivity, (2) poor water solubility, (3) high thermal stability, (4) lack of toxicity of organic ligands, and (5) in vitro antimicrobial activity allows development of silver(i) cyanoximates for medical applications. these include antimicrobial additives to acrylate glue, cured by uv-radiation, used in introduction of prosthetic joints and dental implants, and prevention of biofilm formation on several types of indwelling medical devices.
in vitro antimicrobial activity of brazilian medicinal plant extracts against pathogenic microorganisms of interest to dentistry.
this study evaluated the susceptibility of oral pathogenic microorganisms candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to brazilian medicinal plant extracts of schinus terebinthifolius (aroeira), croton campestris (velame), lafoensia pacari (pacari), centaurium erythraea (centaurea), stryphnodendron adstringens (barbatimao), and anacardium humile (cajuzinho-docerrado), as compared to standardized antimicrobial agents (nystatin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline hydrochloride). ethanol, hexane and butane fractions from stem barks, rinds, leaves, and/or roots were extracted and tested. antimicrobial diffusion agar test and mic were performed according to clsi. after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees c, the diameter of inhibition zones and spectrophotometer readings were measured and compared. the results were reported as means +/- standard deviation (m +/- sd). with the exception of five extracts that showed no antimicrobial activity, all the extracts tested showed antimicrobial activity, in different levels. this study suggests that extracts from the plants tested could be an alternative therapeutic option for infectious conditions of the oral cavity, such as denture stomatitis, dental caries, and periodontitis.
antibacterial activity of root canal filling materials for primary teeth: zinc oxide and eugenol cement, calen paste thickened with zinc oxide, sealapex and endorez.
this study evaluated in vitro the antibacterial activity of 4 root canal filling  materials for primary teeth - zinc oxide and eugenol cement (zoe), calen paste thickened with zinc oxide (calen/zo), sealapex sealer and endorez sealer - against 5 bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections (kocuria rhizophila, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus) using the agar diffusion test (agar-well technique). calen paste, 1% chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) and distilled water served as controls. seven wells per dish were made at equidistant points and immediately filled with the test and control materials. after incubation of the plates at 37 degrees c for 24 h, the diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a digital caliper under reflected light. data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). there were statistically significant differences (p<0.0001) among the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced by the different materials against all target microorganisms. k. rhizophila was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by zoe, while calen/zo had its highest antibacterial activity against e. faecalis (p<0.05). s. mutans was inhibited by calen/zo, sealapex and zoe in the same intensity (p>0.05). e. coli was inhibited more effectively (p<0.05) by zoe, followed by calen/zo and sealapex. calen/zo and zoe were equally effective (p>0.05) against s. aureus, while sealapex had the lowest antibacterial efficacy (p<0.05) against this microorganism. endorez presented antibacterial activity only against k. rhizophila and s. aureus. the calen paste and calen/zo produced larger zones of inhibition than 1% chx when the marker microorganism was e faecalis. in conclusion, the in vitro antibacterial activity of the 4 root canal filling materials for primary teeth against bacterial strains commonly found in endodontic infections can be presented in a decreasing order of efficacy as follows: zoe>calen/zo>sealapex>endorez.
antimicrobial activity and stability of rhinacanthins-rich rhinacanthus nasutus extract.
rhinacanthins-rich rhinacanthus nasutus (rrn) extract was prepared and standardized to contain total rhinacantins not less than 70% w/w. in this study, antimicrobial activities of the rrn extract as well as rhinacanthin-c against streptococcus mutans, propionibacterium acnes, helicobacter pylori, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans were evaluated by microdilution assay. it was found that the rrn extract exhibited potent bactericidal activity against s. mutans with mic and mbc of 4 microg/ml, and potent bacteriostatic activity against s. epidermidis, p. acnes and s. aureus with the mics of 8-16 microg/ml. however, the rrn extract was not active against c. albicans at concentration up to 2000 microg/ml. the antimicrobial activities of the rrn extract was almost equal to those of rhinacanthin-c. stability evaluations of the rrn extract through a period of 4 months found that the rrn extracts were stable when kept in a well-closed container protected from light and stored either under 4+/-2 degrees c or 30+/-2 degrees c. the rrn extracts that were exposed to light were not stable after 1 week of storage. under accelerated conditions at 45 degrees c with 75% relative humidity, the rrn extracts were not stable after 8 weeks of storage. study on the effect of ph on the stability of the aqueous methanolic solution of the rrn extract found that the solutions were not stable at ph 5.5, ph 7.0, and ph 8.0. however, the rhinacanthin solution at ph 5.5 was more stable than those at ph 7.0 and ph 8.0.
identification of a bioactive compound isolated from brazilian propolis type 6.
a prenylated benzophenone, hyperibone a, was isolated from the hexane fraction of brazilian propolis type 6. its structure was determined by spectral analysis including 2d nmr. this compound exhibited cytotoxic activity against hela tumor cells (ic(50)=0.1756microm), strong antimicrobial activity (mic range-0.73-6.6microg/ml; mbc range-2.92-106microg/ml) against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus oralis, staphylococcus aureus, and actinomyces naeslundii, and the results of its cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities were considered good.
in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a new resin-based endodontic sealer against endodontic pathogens.
the purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activities of a new resin-based superbond (sb) sealer and five other sealers/cements against endodontic pathogens. the antimicrobial activities of sb sealer, sealapex, ah plus, roeko seal automix, canals n, and proroot mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) were examined using a double-layered method. the microorganisms staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguinis were used. live microorganisms were stained using triphenyltetrazolium chloride, and the zones of inhibition of microorganism growth were measured. the antimicrobial activity of sb sealer was significantly lower than that of the other sealers, except for pro root mta, against s. aureus, c. albicans, s. mutans, and s. sanguinis, but no activity against e. faecalis was detected. on the other hand, ah plus exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity. pro root mta showed no antimicrobial activity against any of the microorganisms tested. sb sealer offered no antimicrobial advantage over the other sealers tested except for pro root mta.
[characterization and antibacterial effect of ag-nha-ntio2/polyamide 66 nanocomposite membrane on oral bacteria].
objective: undried silver-hydroxyapatite-titania (ag-nha-ntio2) nanoparticles slurry was used to make membrane with polyamide 66 (pa66) by co-polymerization method. the purpose of this study is to test the physical and chemical characteristics and antibacterial ability. methods: the morphology, chemical components and structures of the membrane were characterized by atomic absorption spectrometer (aas), x-ray diffraction (xrd), scanning electron microscope (sem) and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis (edx). staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), escherichia coli (e. coli), porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) were utilized to test the antibacterial effect. results: xrd results demonstrated that the membrane have characteristic diffraction peaks of pure hydroxyapatite (ha). a homogeneous distribution of the ca, p, ti and ag element in the membrane was confirmed by edx. both surface and section showed porous structure which was confirmed by sem and the average hole size was 20-30 microm. the bacteria assay reflected to the antibacterial effect, 50.10% of s. aureus and 56.31% of e. coli were killed. however, 91.84% of p. gingivalis, 90.64% of f. nucleatum and 90.49% of s. mutans were killed and pictures of sem showed obviously fewer cells on the surface. conclusion: the nanocomposite membrane could be one of the bioactive materials with antibacterial properties for oral guided bone regeneration technique.
in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
purification of bacteriocin ls1 produced by human oral isolate lactobacillus salivarius bgho1.
introduction: lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, and salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. the objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named ls1, produced by l. salivarius bgho1. methods: a simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. results: the supernatant of l. salivarius bgho1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees c in an autoclave. bacteriocin ls1 was purified to homogeneity. the molecular mass of bacteriocin ls1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kda, based on tricine sds-page. during purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by l. salivarius bgho1, was detected. the molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kda, based on tricine sds-page. conclusion: our results imply that ls1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by l. salivarius strains. the purification of bacteriocin ls1 enabled the further characterization of ls1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.
evaluation of the antibacterial activity of new root canal sealers.
objective: the purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial effect of ah-26, realseal (rs), and guttaflow after 24 hours and after one week. methodology: all sealers were prepared according to the manufacturers' directions immediately before testing. the microorganisms used in this assay included staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans, which were prepared from isolated species in the microbiology laboratory. the antimicrobial effects of each sealer were determined by measuring the diameter of the zone of inhibition in millimeters after incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 hours and for seven days in a humid atmosphere. each test was repeated three times. results: in the 24-hour samples, as well as in seven-day samples, the antibacterial activity of ah-26 was significantly greater than two other materials tested against both bacteria (p < 0.05). the antibacterial activities of rs and guttaflow against staphylococcus aureus were not significantly different from each other (p > 0.05) in 24-hour as well as seven-day samples, but rs had significantly greater effect against streptococcus mutans than guttaflow (p < 0.05). conclusion: the products studied exhibited some variable antibacterial properties. in 24 hours, as well as in seven days, the ah-26 exerted the greatest activity against both organisms tested.
molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
antimicrobial activity of substance p and neuropeptide y against laboratory strains of bacteria and oral microorganisms.
infection and inflammation of mucosal tissue may induce the production of neuropeptides, specifically substance p and neuropeptide y. since these neuropeptides are similar to antimicrobial peptides in their amino acid composition, amphipathic design, cationic charge, and size, we wanted to determine if they had antimicrobial activity against a panel of common bacteria and oral microorganisms using the radial diffusion assay. neuropeptide y and substance p had antimicrobial activity against e. coli (mic 20.6+/-5.5 microg/ml sem and 71.5+/-15 sem microg/ml, respectively), but did not have activity against laboratory strains of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens (mic>500 microg/ml) nor oral strains of streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (mic>500 microg/ml). while substance p and neuropeptide y did not have direct antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested, they still may stimulate local epithelial cells to produce other innate immune factors like defensins and cathelicidins. however, this remains to be determined.
streptococcus rattus strain bht produces both a class i two-component lantibiotic and a class ii bacteriocin.
streptococcus rattus strain bht is a species representative and strong bacteriocin producer. here we report that s. rattus bht produces two quite different types of bacteriocin activity, named bht-a and bht-b. the two bacteriocins were purified and analysed for activity and by maldi-tof mass spectrophotometry. bht-a was found to be a variant of the two-component lantibiotic, smb. bht-b is a non-modified 5195da peptide with some similarity to the tryptophan-rich staphylococcus aureus bacteriocin, aureocin a53. six s. rattus and two s. mutans strains were found to contain both the bht-a and bht-b genetic loci.

[the antimicrobial effects of chitosans on oral pathogenic microbes in vitro].
purpose: to study the antimicrobial activities of chitosans of different molecular weights and concentrations on oral pathogenic microbes under ph 6.5 in vitro. methods: the inhibition effects of chitosans of different molecular weights and different concentrations (2.0%, 1.5%, 1.0%, 0.5%) on staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, helicobacter pylori, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis in culture were investigated, and the differences of their antimicrobial activities under high temperature and after filtering were compared. one way analysis of variance, randomized block design analysis of variance and t test were used for statistical analysis. results: chitosans of different molecular weights all showed bacteriostatic effects on staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, helicobacter pylori, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis. low molecular weight chitosans showed the strongest effects, but the high molecular weight ones had strong effects on streptococcus mutans (p<0.05,0.01). the bacteriostatic effects of chitosans were not affected by high temperatures (p>0.05). conclusion: chitosans have inhibitory effects on oral pathogenic microbes under ph 6.5.
different bacteriocin activities of streptococcus mutans reflect distinct phylogenetic lineages.
bacteriocins produced by mutans streptococci are known as mutacins. in this study 16 broadly active mutacin-producing streptococcus mutans strains from new zealand, north america and europe were classified into four groups (a-d) on the basis of differences in their activity in deferred antagonism tests against either the homologous producer strain (to test for presence of self-immunity) or indicator strains staphylococcus aureus 46 and enterococcus faecium te1. two of the strains included in the study (ua140 and ua96) were representatives of the group i and ii mutacin producer strains previously described by caufield and co-workers. one of the new zealand isolates of group a (s. mutans strain n) appeared to produce inhibitory activity similar to that of the group i prototype strain ua140. four other new zealand isolates of group b (s. mutans strains m19, m34, b34 and d14) had mutacin ii-like activity. the group b mutacin producers differed from the group a mutacin producers in their additional activity against staph. aureus 46. seven s. mutans strains (m46, b46, b57, m12, m28, b28 and 13m) were distinguished from the group a and group b mutacin producers in that they inhibited e. faecium te1. these were called group c mutacin producers. strains h7 and h23 resembled the group c strains in their action on both indicator strains te1 and 46. however, these two strains failed to exhibit immunity to their own inhibitory products in the deferred antagonism test and were separately classified as group d mutacin producers. phylogenetic analysis of the strains by several genotypic and phenotypic characteristics revealed that the mutacin groups were associated with distinct evolutionary lineages of s. mutans.
[antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides in human parotid saliva].
two ultrasensitive antibacterial assays were applied to determine the antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides (hrps) in human parotid saliva. the results not only confirmed the potent antibacterial activity of hrps against streptococcus mutans mt6r, but also showed for the first time that hrps were effectively antibacterial to staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli ml-35p and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853. among hrps, hrp3, hrp5 and hrp6 were the major antibacterial components which were active against s. mutans, s. aureus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, whereas hrp1 was only effective against e. coli. s. sanguis was resistant to the action of hrps. these results suggest that hrps are actually a family of endogenous antibiotic peptides with broad antimicrobial spectrum including fungi, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and may play an important role in the prevention of various infection diseases in the oral cavity as well as in the resistance to caries.
effect of static magnetic fields on bacteria: streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli.
biological effect of static magnetic field was investigated by using ferrite magnets to conduct a magnetic field exposure experiment on three species of bacteria: streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the effects were evaluated by culturing the bacteria and determining their growth rate, the maximum numbers of bacteria, and [3h]-thymidine incorporation. the results showed that the ferrite magnet caused strength-dependent decreases in the growth rate and growth maximum number of bacteria for s. mutans and s. aureus when cultured under anaerobic conditions, but that their growth was not inhibited under aerobic conditions. in addition, [3h]-thymidine was added after culturing each of the species of bacteria for 18 h. after that, culture was continued until 24 h, and changes in [3h]-thymidine incorporation were investigated. but no effect of the magnetic fields was detected. these findings suggested that oxygen related to growth the cases of s. mutans, s. aureus. however, no growth effects were detected on e. coli cultures.
antimicrobial effect of six endodontic sealers: an in vitro evaluation.
the aim of this study was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial effect of six endodontic sealers after 2, 20 and 40 days. the sealers studied were apexit, endion, ah26, ah-plus. procosol and ketac endo. the microorganisms used were candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces israelii. petri dishes were filled with sterile agar and 0.1-ml wells were prepared and filled with the sealers. the agar plates were stored for 24 h at 37 degrees c. the samples were then removed, immersed in 4.5 ml of culture medium and divided into three groups. the samples in group 1 were stored for 2 days at 37 degrees c whereas the samples of groups 2 and 3 were stored at 4 degrees c for 20 and 40 days respectively. the samples were then removed and discarded, and 0.1 ml of the culture medium was seeded on the agar plates in order to perform colony forming unit counts. apexit, endion and ah-plus produced slight inhibition on streptococcus mutans at 20 days and on actinomyces israelii at every time interval. no effect was found on candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. ketac endo only produced an antimicrobial effect on actinomyces israelii at 2 and 40 days. ah26 and procosol showed antimicrobial effect at 40 days on candida albicans, at 20 and 40 days on streptococcus mutans and staphylococcus aureus, and an effective inhibition on actinomyces israelii at every time interval. statistical analysis revealed both sealers and microorganisms to be significant factors affecting results in groups 2 and 3. in conclusion, the sealers evaluated in this study showed different inhibitory effects depending on time span. overall, sealers containing cugenol and formaldehyde proved to be most effective against the microorganisms at the time intervals studied.
purification and properties of a bacteriocin of staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque.
an extracellular bacteriocin of staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from dental plaque was purified and characterized. its molecular mass was 3500 da and pi was 10.5. this bacteriocin inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus mitis, but streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis and other oral indigenous bacterial species examined were not inhibited. the mode of inhibition was found to be bacteriostatic.
synthetic histatin analogues with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.
histatins are salivary histidine-rich cationic peptides, ranging from 7 to 38 amino acid residues in length, that exert a potent killing effect in vitro on candida albicans. starting from the c-terminal fungicidal domain of histatin 5 (residues 11-24, called dh-5) a number of substitution analogues were chemically synthesized to study the effect of amphipathicity of the peptide in helix conformation on candidacidal activity. single substitutions in dh-5 at several positions did not have any effect on fungicidal activity. however, multi-site substituted analogues (dhvar1 and dhvar2) exhibited a 6-fold increased activity over dh-5. in addition, dhvar1 and dhvar2 inhibited the growth of the second most common yeast found in clinical isolates, torulopsis glabrata, of oral- and non-oral pathogens such as prevotella intermedia and streptococcus mutans, and of a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. in their broad-spectrum activity, dhvar1 and dhvar2 were comparable to magainins (pgla and magainin 2), antimicrobial peptides of amphibian origin. both the fungicidal and the haemolytic activities of dhvar1, dhvar2 and magainins increased at decreasing ionic strength.
antagonistic effect of oral bacteria towards treponema denticola.
this study was designed to isolate oral bacteria exhibiting antagonism towards treponema denticola and to characterize the inhibitory activity. eleven bacterial isolates obtained from subgingival sites and identified as either staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus mutans were found to inhibit the growth of t. denticola. when the activity spectra of these isolates were analyzed, two additional periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) were found to be affected, whereas most gram-positive bacteria were not. strains of s. aureus produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (heat stable and protease sensitive), whereas the inhibitory effect of s. mutans appears to be related to the production of lactic acid. the negative interactions reported in this paper may govern population shifts observed in subgingival sites.
isolation, partial purification and preliminary characterization of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans rm-10.
an extracellular bactericidal substance was isolated from the supernatant of streptococcus mutans rm-10 culture fluid and partially purified with 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, differential centrifugation, and gel filtration on sephadex g-200. there was a good correlation of the sensitivity profiles of indicator strains whether assayed on solid medium or with purified material from cell-free culture fluid, indicating that the same inhibitory substance is produced on solid medium and in broth. vapor from organic solvents such as chloroform, acetone, ethanol, and ether as well as heat treatment at 100 degrees c for 30 min had little effect on the bactericidal factor. it was sensitive to trypsin and pronase and resistant to deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, lysozyme, and phospholipase c. the inhibitor was not infective, and electron microscopic studies failed to reveal phage or phage-like particles in concentrated solutions of the bactericidal material. the results indicate that the extracellular bactericidal substance is indeed a bacteriocin. activity in broth cultures reached a maximum only after exponential growth had ceased. it was active against other streptococcal strains as well as strains of actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, but not against strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli.
production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
