TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == bacterial species-characteristic profiles of molecular species, and the antigenicity of phospholipids and glycolipids in symbiotic lactobacillus, staphylococcus and streptococcus species.
AB  == human symbiotic bacteria, lactobacillus reuteri (lr) in the intestines, staphylococcus epidermidis (se) in skin and streptococcus salivalis (ss) in the oral cavity, contain dihexaosyl diglycerides (dh-dg) in concentrations equivalent to those of phosphatidyl glycerol (pg) and cardiolipin (cl), together with mono-  to tetrahexaosyl dgs. the molecular species, as the combination of fatty acids in the dg moiety, were revealed to be bacterial species-characteristic, but to be similar between glycolipids and phospholipids in individual bacteria, the major ones being 16:0 and cy19:0 for lr, ai15:0 and ai17:0 for se, and 16:0 and 18:1 for ss, respectively. the carbohydrate structures of dh-dgs were also bacterial species-characteristic, being galalpha1-2glcalpha for lr, glcbeta1-6glcbeta for se, and glcalpha1-2glcalpha for ss, respectively. also, bacterial glycolipids were revealed to provide antigenic determinants characteristic of bacterial species on immunization of rabbits with the respective bacteria. anti-l. johnsonii antiserum intensely reacted with tri- and tetrahexaosyl dgs, in which galalpha was bound to dh-dg through an alpha1-6 linkage, as well as with dh-dg from lr. although anti-se antiserum preferentially reacted with dh-dg from se, anti-ss antiserum reacted with dh-dg from ss and, to a lesser extent, with dh-dgs from lr and se. but, both anti-se and anti-ss antiserum did not react at all with monohexaosyl dg or glycosphingolipids with the same carbohydrates at the nonreducing terminals. in addition, 75 % of human sera, irrespective of the abo blood group, were found to contain igm to tri- and tetrahexaosyl dgs from lr, but not to dh-dgs from lr, se and ss.

TI  == characterization of novel glycolipid antigens with an alpha-galactose epitope in  lactobacilli detected with rabbit anti-lactobacillus antisera and occurrence of antibodies against them in human sera.
AB  == anti-lactobacillus johnsonii (lj) antisera generated by immunization of rabbits with lj reacted with glyceroglycolipids in lj, i.e. dihexaosyl diacylglycerol (dh-dg), trihexaosyl dg (th-dg) and tetrahexaosyl dg (teth-dg), whose reactivities with antisera increased proportionally with longer carbohydrate chains of glycolipids. structural analyses of glycolipids from lj revealed that dh-dg was galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg, and th-dg and teth-dg were novel derivatives of it with alpha-gal at the non-reducing terminal, i.e. galalpha1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg and galalpha1-6galalpha1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg, respectively. dh-dg was commonly present in several lactobacilli examined, but teth-dg was restricted to lj, l. intestinalis and l. reuteri, while the th-dgs from l. casei were glc1-6galalpha1-2glcalpha1-3'dg and an esterified derivative of it, glc1-6galalpha1-2glc(6-fatty acid)alpha1-3'dg, as reported in the literature. anti-lj antisera reacted with th-dg and esterified th-dg from l. casei to lesser  extents, but not at all with gentibiosyl dg from staphylococcus epidermidis or kojibiosyl dg from streptococcus salivalis or sphingoglycolipids containing alpha-gal residues. the major molecular species of glycolipids obtained from lactobacilli were 11-octadecenoic and 11,12-methylene-octadecanoic acids-containing ones. also, human igm antibodies against th-dg and teth-dg from  lj were detected in human sera, with various antibody titres, indicating that an  immune reaction to symbiotic lactobacilli occurs against their glycolipid antigens, th-dg and teth-dg.
