faecalibacterium prausnitzii upregulates regulatory t cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines in treating tnbs-induced colitis.
background and aims: faecalibacterium prausnitzii (f. prausnitzii) is a common anaerobic bacteria colonized in the human gut and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) patients are usually lack of f. prausnitzii. the aims of this study were to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory capacity of f. prausnitzii by comparing it with bifidobacterium longum (b. longum) in both cellular and animal experiments. methods: human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) and 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (tnbs)-induced colitis rat models were treated with f. prausnitzii, b. longum, f. prausnitzii supernatant or f. prausnitzii medium, respectively. interleukin (il)-10, tgf-beta1 and il-12p70 in human pbmcs culture supernatant and rat blood serum were detected. the frequency of cd25(+)foxp3(+)treg in human pbmcs, rat pbmcs and rat splenocytes were investigated. besides, the t-bet, gata-3, ror-gammat and foxp3 mrna in human pbmcs, histopathologic characteristics of the intestinal mucosal and weight loss in the rat models were examined. results: f. prausnitzii, b. longum and f. prausnitzii supernatant clearly facilitated the induction of il-10 and tgf-beta1, while induced relatively mild production of il-12p70 in both cellular and animal models. the f. prausnitzii, b. longum and supernatant differed in their capacity to induce t-bet, gata-3 and ror-gammat mrna expression in human pbmcs (both bacterial strains inhibited the expression of ror-gammat while supernatant inhibited the t-bet and gata-3). however, all of them induced the foxp3 and treg production and ameliorated the tnbs-induced colitis. in addition, f. prausnitzii supernatant exhibited the supreme anti-inflammatory capacity. conclusions: f. prausnitzii and its unidentified metabolites in the supernatant are promising candidates in treating ibd, and further research remains necessary to elucidate the safety, efficacy, optimum and mechanism of this bacterium in the clinical practice.
effects of a gluten-free diet on gut microbiota and immune function in healthy adult human subjects.
diet influences the composition of the gut microbiota and host's health, particularly in patients suffering from food-related diseases. coeliac disease (cd) is a permanent intolerance to cereal gluten proteins and the only therapy for the patients is to adhere to a life-long gluten-free diet (gfd). in the present preliminary study, the effects of a gfd on the composition and immune function of the gut microbiota were analysed in ten healthy subjects (mean age 30.3 years) over 1 month. faecal microbiota was analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) and quantitative pcr (qpcr). the ability of faecal bacteria to stimulate cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) was determined by elisa. no significant differences in dietary intake were found before and after the gfd except for reductions (p = 0.001) in polysaccharides. bifidobacterium, clostridium lituseburense and faecalibacterium prausnitzii proportions decreased (p = 0.007, p = 0.031 and p = 0.009, respectively) as a result of the gfd analysed by fish. bifidobacterium, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium longum counts decreased (p = 0.020, p = 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively), while enterobacteriaceae and escherichia coli counts increased (p = 0.005 and p = 0.003) after the gfd assessed by qpcr. tnf-alpha, interferon-gamma, il-10 and il-8 production by pbmc stimulated with faecal samples was also reduced (p = 0.021, p = 0.037, p = 0.002 and p = 0.007, respectively) after the diet. therefore, the gfd led to reductions in beneficial gut bacteria populations and the ability of faecal samples to stimulate the host's immunity. thus, the gfd may constitute an environmental variable to be considered in treated cd patients for its possible effects on gut health.
