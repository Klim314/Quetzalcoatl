TI  == recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the strains formerly classified as streptococcus anginosus or "streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius. streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus gemella. four new species within the genus peptostreptococcus were recently named. a recent addition to the genus clostridium is clostridium argentinense, which includes clostridium botulinum type g. two new species of actinomyces have been introduced: actinomyces georgiae and actinomyces gerencseriae. arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed propionibacterium propionicum. eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube  brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. lactobacillus uli and lactobacillus  rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. wolinella recta and wolinella  curva are now included in the genus campylobacter. the taxonomic position of mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.

TI  == susceptibility of anaerobic microorganisms to hypothiocyanite produced by lactoperoxidase.
AB  == the susceptibility of capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, eubacterium yurii, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas sputigena, wolinella recta to hypothiocyanite (oscn-) produced by the lactoperoxidase system was tested. results showed a decrease of bacterial survival rate after oscn- exposure, with an intra- and inter-species variability  from 0 to 95% for c. ochracea, 34-100% for e. corrodens, 0-83% for e. yurii, 1-15% for f. nucleatum, 8-61% for p. micros, 0-100% for p. intermedia, 0-44% for  s. sputigena and 0-8% for w. recta. the survival rate did not correlate with the  nadh/oscn- oxidoreductase activity present in the lysed bacteria (r = -0.3248; n  = 15; ns).
