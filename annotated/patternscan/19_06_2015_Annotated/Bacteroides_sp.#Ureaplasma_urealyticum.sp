TI  == infection and labor. vii. microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in spontaneous rupture of membranes at term.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency, microbiologic characteristics, and clinical significance of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in women with premature rupture of membranes at term. study design: amniocentesis was performed in 32 women with term premature rupture of membranes and amniotic fluid cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and mycoplasmas. results: the prevalence of positive amniotic fluid cultures was 34.3% (11/32). the most common isolates were ureaplasma urealyticum, peptostreptococcus sp., lactobacillus sp., bacteroides fragilis, and fusobacterium sp. clinical chorioamnionitis occurred only in one patient with a positive amniotic fluid culture. her neonate had ophthalmitis. three patients (9.4%) had endometritis. among women who were delivered vaginally, those with a positive amniotic fluid culture had a significantly higher rate of endometritis than those with a negative culture (33% [3/9] vs 0% [0/20], respectively, p = 0.023). conclusions: these data indicate that microbial invasion of the amniotic  cavity occurs in approximately one third of patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes. microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity is a risk factor  for endometritis in women with term premature rupture of membranes.

TI  == risk factors for prematurity and premature rupture of membranes: a prospective study of the vaginal flora in pregnancy.
AB  == prematurity remains a major cause of perinatal mortality in the united states. some research has indicated that infectious agents play a role in either initiating preterm labor, causing premature rupture of the membranes, or preventing tocolysis. this study attempted to determine if the presence of various vaginal pathogens in early pregnancy was associated with the subsequent development of premature rupture of membranes or preterm labor. we found that among 233 evaluable patients those with trichomonas vaginalis were significantly  more likely to have premature rupture of the membranes (p less than 0.03), and those with bacteroides sp. were more likely to be delivered of their infants before 37 weeks (p less than 0.03) and to have infants weighing less than 2500 gm (p less than 0.05). those with ureaplasma urealyticum more frequently began preterm labor (p less than 0.05). preterm premature rupture of the membranes was  found significantly more often among patients with bacteroides sp. stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that those associations were not  related to the number of previous abortions, deliveries, or preterm deliveries or to maternal age. we conclude that microbiologic screening in early pregnancy may  aid in the assessment of patient risk for preterm delivery.
