TI  - A rare case of infectious colitis.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is responsible for numerous infectious processes. Gastrointestinal tract involvement is rather rare and only a handful of cases of MRSA colitis have been reported in North America. We present a case of MRSA colitis in an adult without apparent risk factors. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed thickening of the sigmoid colon, indicative of colitis, and empiric therapy with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole was started. Initial work-up for infection-including blood and stool cultures, and stool Clostridium difficile toxin assay-was negative. The patient's clinical status improved but his diarrhea did not abate. Repetition of stool culture demonstrated luxuriant growth of MRSA sensitive to vancomycin. Oral vancomycin was administered and the patient's symptoms promptly ceased.
TI  - Pathogen transfer and high variability in pathogen removal by detergent wipes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rise in health care-associated infections has placed a greater emphasis on cleaning and disinfection practices. The majority of policies advocate using detergent-based products for routine cleaning, with detergent wipes increasingly being used; however, there is no information about their ability to remove and subsequently transfer pathogens in practice. METHODS: Seven detergent wipes were tested for their ability to remove and transfer Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Clostridium difficile spores using the 3-stage wipe protocol. RESULTS: The ability of the detergent wipes to remove S aureus, A baumannii, and C difficile spores from a stainless steel surface ranged from 1.50 log10 (range, 0.24-3.25), 3.51 log10 (range, 3.01-3.81), and 0.96 log10 (range, 0.26-1.44), respectively, following a 10-second wiping time. All wipes repeatedly transferred significant amounts of bacteria/spores over 3 consecutive surfaces, although the percentage of total microorganisms transferred from the wipes after wiping was low for a number of products. CONCLUSIONS: Detergent-based wipe products have 2 major drawbacks: their variability in removing microbial bioburden from inanimate surfaces and a propensity to transfer pathogens between surfaces. The use of additional complementary measures such as combined detergent/disinfectant-based products and/or antimicrobial surfaces need to be considered for appropriate infection control and prevention.
TI  - Case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by Staphylococcus aureus enterocolitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: A case of Staphylococcus aureus enterocolitis (SEC) misdiagnosed as toxin-negative Clostridium difficile is reported. SUMMARY: An 82-year-old white man weighing 50 kg (body mass index, 16.8 kg/m(2)) was transported from an assisted living facility to the emergency department with the chief complaints of weakness, nausea, and diarrhea for one week and one bright-red stool on the morning of admission. Before hospital admission, he was treated for a urinary tract infection with ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 10 days. Stool cultures were negative for C. difficile but positive for S. aureus. The antimicrobial stewardship pharmacist recommended treatment with vancomycin 125 mg orally every 6 hours for staphylococcal colitis. Oral vancomycin was discontinued after three doses on the morning of hospital day 8 after a gastroenterology consultation. Within 48 hours of the discontinuation of oral vancomycin, the patient had eight stools per day. Vancomycin was reinitiated and the patient's symptoms began to again improve. On hospital day 19, the patient was discharged with a prescription for 7 more days of therapy with vancomycin (to complete a 15-day course) and a diagnosis of toxin-negative C. difficile, despite having symptoms consistent with SEC and an enteric culture positive for S. aureus. CONCLUSION: An 82-year-old man was transferred from an assisted living facility to the hospital with profuse diarrhea and dehydration. Enteric cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant S. aureus with multiple negative C. difficile toxin B assays. Appropriate therapy was delayed and the patient potentially misdiagnosed with toxin-negative C. difficile when the clinical symptoms and diagnostic testing were consistent with SEC.
TI  - Intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: A systematic review.
AB  - Evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. Although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. Therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. Twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. In the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of Firmicutes; a higher count of Bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, and Lactobacillus. In the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of Bacteroides; a lower count of Akkermansia muciniphila, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Clostridium; a higher prevalence of B. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of B. catenulatum and Staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.
TI  - Infectious disease outbreaks and increased complexity of care.
AB  - AIM: This study examined the effects of healthcare-associated infectious disease  outbreaks on nurses' work in a large acute care hospital in Ontario, Canada. BACKGROUND: The incidence of healthcare-associated infections has increased. Previous research focuses on epidemiology, healthcare systems, and the economic burden of outbreaks. Few published studies focus on the impact of outbreaks on nurses' work in acute care facilities. INTRODUCTION: Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003, combating infectious diseases has become a key issue. Hospitals have implemented measures related to healthcare-associated infections. However, nurses experience challenges in preventing, controlling, and contending with outbreaks. METHODS: A retrospective exploratory case study approach was used. Data were collected over a 4-month period in 2012. The incidence rates of site-specific HAIs were analysed, and individual interviews were held with 23 bedside nurses and five nurse managers. FINDINGS: Five themes emerged from the interviews: comparison of healthcare-associated infections outbreaks; the nature of nurses' work; impact of outbreaks on patient care; innovation and quality control in clinical practice; and increased and expanded IPAC measures. The incidence rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci at the study site decreased, but remained above provincial benchmarks. Nurses experienced workload challenges, time pressures and psychological effects stemming from outbreaks and developed various innovations in response. Patient care was also affected. CONCLUSION: Nurses' work has been impacted by healthcare-associated infectious disease outbreaks. Nursing workloads should be quantified to facilitate the development of guidelines for optimum nurse-patient ratio during outbreaks. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND/OR HEALTH POLICY: A strong evidence-based policy framework is required to address healthcare-associated infectious disease outbreaks. Infection prevention and control guidelines and procedures should be established provincially and nationally. An interdisciplinary approach is essential for the creation of comprehensive and innovative strategies. Nursing research has increased understanding of the implications of infectious diseases in hospitals. Building on the literature, findings from this study can be used to influence policies on the care of patients who have secondary infections. Nurse-driven protocols are important and can lead to the creation of best practice guidelines that can be implemented across settings.
TI  - The livestock reservoir for antimicrobial resistance: a personal view on changing patterns of risks, effects of interventions and the way forward.
AB  - The purpose of this review was to provide an updated overview on the use of antimicrobial agents in livestock, the associated problems for humans and current knowledge on the effects of reducing resistance in the livestock reservoir on both human health and animal production. There is still limiting data on both use of antimicrobial agents, occurrence and spread of resistance as well as impact on human health. However, in recent years, emerging issues related to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli and horizontally transferred genes indicates that the livestock reservoir has a more significant impact on human health than was estimated 10 years ago, where the focus was mainly on resistance in Campylobacter and Salmonella. Studies have indicated that there might only be a marginal if any benefit from the regular use of antibiotics and have shown that it is possible to substantially reduce the use of antimicrobial agents in livestock production without compromising animal welfare or health or production. In some cases, this should be done in combination with other measures such as biosecurity and use of vaccines. To enable better studies on both the global burden and the effect of interventions, there is a need for global harmonized integrated and continuous surveillance of antimicrobial usage and antimicrobial resistance, preferably associated with data on production and animal diseases to determine the positive and negative impact of reducing antimicrobial use in livestock.
TI  - An assessment of antimicrobial resistant disease threats in Canada.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of infectious agents is a growing concern for public health organizations. Given the complexity of this issue and how widespread the problem has become, resources are often insufficient to address all concerns, thus prioritization of AMR pathogens is essential for the optimal allocation of risk management attention. Since the epidemiology of AMR pathogens differs between countries, country-specific assessments are important for the determination of national priorities. OBJECTIVE: To develop a systematic and transparent approach to AMR risk prioritization in Canada. METHODS: Relevant AMR pathogens in Canada were selected through a transparent multi-step consensus process (n=32). Each pathogen was assessed using ten criteria: incidence, mortality, case-fatality, communicability, treatability, clinical impact, public/political attention, ten-year projection of incidence, economic impact, and preventability. For each pathogen, each criterion was assigned a numerical score of 0, 1, or 2, and multiplied by criteria-specific weighting determined through researcher consensus of importance. The scores for each AMR pathogen were summed and ranked by total score, where a higher score indicated greater importance. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the effects of changing the criteria-specific weights. RESULTS: The AMR pathogen with the highest total weighted score was extended spectrum B-lactamase-producing (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae (score=77). When grouped by percentile, ESBL Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridium difficile, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were in the 80-100th percentile. CONCLUSION: This assessment provides useful information for prioritising public health strategies regarding AMR resistance at the national level in Canada. As the AMR environment and challenges change over time and space, this systematic and transparent approach can be adapted for use by other stakeholders domestically and internationally. Given the complexity of influences, resource availability and multiple stakeholders, regular consideration of AMR activities in the public health realm is essential for appropriate and responsible prioritisation of risk management that optimises the health and security of the population.
TI  - Sanitary status and incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and  Clostridium difficile within Canadian hotel rooms.
AB  - The study described in this article aimed at establishing a baseline assessment of the sanitary status of ice and guest rooms within Canadian hotels. Collectively, 54 hotel rooms belonging to six different national chains were sampled. High-contact surfaces (comforter, alarm clock, bedside lamp, TV remote, bathroom countertop, faucet, and toilet seat) were sampled using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) swabs and replicate organism detection and counting plates. ATP swab readings ranged from 2.12 to 4.42 log relative light units. Coliforms were recovered from 36% of surfaces with high prevalence being recovered from the comforter, TV remote, bathroom countertop, faucet, and toilet seat. Oxacillin-resistant bacteria were recovered from 19% of surfaces with 46% of isolates confirmed as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Two toxigenic Clostridium difficile isolates were recovered in the course of the study. Collectively, 24% of the ice samples harbored coliforms with a single sample testing positive for E. coli. The authors' study demonstrates that hotel rooms represent a potential source of community-acquired infections and the need for enhanced sanitation practices.
TI  - Kibdelomycin is a bactericidal broad-spectrum aerobic antibacterial agent.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. Kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial DNA replication enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. It was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic Gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium difficile. We have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. We report the MIC50s, MIC90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. We confirm the Gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (MIC90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the Gram-negative nonfermenter Acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. We also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in Pseudomonas, though it is in Escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.
TI  - Structure and function of a Clostridium difficile sortase enzyme.
AB  - Sortase enzymes are responsible for covalent anchoring of specific proteins to the peptidoglycan of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. In some gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus), sortases have been found to be essential for pathogenesis and their inhibitors are under development as potential novel therapeutics. Here we provide the first report on the structural characterisation of the C. difficile sortase. An active site mutant was crystallised and its structure determined to 2.55 A by X-ray diffraction to provide structural insight into its catalytic mechanism. In order to elucidate the role of the sortase in the cell wall biogenesis, a C. difficile sortase knockout strain was constructed by intron mutagenesis. Characterisation of this mutant led to the discovery that the putative adhesin CD0386 is anchored to the peptidoglycan of C. difficile by the sortase SrtB and that an SPKTG peptide motif is involved in the transpeptidation reaction with the C. difficile peptidoglycan. In an animal model for C. difficile infection, the SrtB mutant caused disease at a similar rate of onset as the wild type strain. In conclusion, our detailed study shows that the SrtB enzyme from C. difficile does not play an essential role in pathogenesis.
TI  - Healthcare-Associated Pathogens and Nursing Home Policies and Practices: Results  From a National Survey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE To examine the prevalence of healthcare-associated pathogens and the infection control policies and practices in a national sample of nursing homes (NHs). METHODS In 2012, we conducted a national survey about the extent to which NHs follow suggested infection control practices with regard to 3 common healthcare-associated pathogens: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and their prevalence in NHs. We adapted a previously used and validated NH infection control survey, including questions on prevalence, admission and screening policies, contact precautions, decolonization, and cleaning practices. RESULTS A total of 1,002 surveys were returned. Of the responding NHs, 14.2% were less likely to accept residents with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, with the principal reason being lack of single or cohort rooms. NHs do not routinely perform admission screening (96.4%) because it is not required by regulation (56.2%) and would not change care provision (30.7%). Isolation strategies vary substantially, with gloves being most commonly used. Most NHs (75.1%) do not decolonize carriers of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but some (10.6%) decolonize more than 90% of residents. Despite no guidance on how resident rooms on contact precautions should be cleaned, 59.3% of NHs report enhanced cleaning for such rooms. CONCLUSION Overall, NHs tend to follow voluntary infection control guidelines only if doing so does not require substantial financial investment in new or dedicated staff or infrastructure.

TI  - Metronidazole toxicity presenting with acute onset of aphasia and right sided weakness.
AB  - We report a 37-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia who presented from a nursing home with 1week of progressive confusion followed by acute onset of aphasia, forced left eye deviation and right sided weakness. While clinical presentation was concerning for a left middle cerebral artery stroke, MRI was consistent with leukoencephalopathy. The man had been on metronidazole for 2months for treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. This case exemplifies a stroke mimic to be considered when a patient presents with an acute focal neurological deficit.
TI  - Regional infection control assessment of antibiotic resistance knowledge and practice.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are an increasing burden among healthcare facilities. We assessed facility-level perceived importance of and responses to various MDROs. DESIGN: A pilot survey to assess staffing, knowledge, and the perceived importance of and response to various multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs) SETTING: Acute care and long-term healthcare facilities METHODS: In 2012, a survey was distributed to infection preventionists at ~300 healthcare facilities. Pathogens assessed were Clostridium difficile, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, multidrug-resistant (defined as bacterial resistance to >/=3 antibiotic classes) Pseudomonas, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. RESULTS: A total of 74 unique facilities responded, including 44 skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and 30 acute care facilities (ACFs). While ACFs consistently isolated patients with active infections or colonization due to these MDROs, SNFs had more variable responses. SNFs had more multi-occupancy rooms and reported less specialized training in infection control and prevention than did ACFs. Of all facilities with multi-occupancy rooms, 86% employed a cohorting practice for patients, compared with 50% of those without multi-occupancy rooms; 20% of ACFs and 7% of SNFs cohorted staff while caring for patients with the same MDRO. MRSA and C. difficile were identified as important pathogens in ACFs and SNFs, while CRE importance was unknown or was considered important in <50% of SNFs. CONCLUSION: We identified stark differences in human resources, knowledge, policy, and practice between ACFs and SNFs. For regional control of emerging MDROs like CRE, there is an opportunity for public health officials to provide targeted education and interventions. Education campaigns must account for differences in audience resources and baseline knowledge.
TI  - In Vitro Selection of a Single-Stranded DNA Molecular Recognition Element against Clostridium difficile Toxin B and Sensitive Detection in Human Fecal Matter.
AB  - Toxin B is one of the major virulence factors of Clostridium difficile, a bacterium that is responsible for a significant number of diarrhea cases in acute care settings. Due to the prevalence of C. difficile induced diarrhea, rapid and correct diagnosis is crucial in the disease management. In this study, we have employed a stringent in vitro selection method to identify single-stranded DNA molecular recognition elements (MRE) specific for toxin B. At the end of the 12-round selection, one MRE with high affinity (K d = 47.3 nM) for toxin B was identified. The selected MRE demonstrated low cross binding activities on negative targets: bovine serum albumin, Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, and cholera toxin of Vibrio cholera. A modified sandwich ELISA assay was developed utilizing the selected ssDNA MRE as the antigen capturing element and achieved a sensitive detection of 50 nM of toxin B in human fecal preparations.
TI  - Is the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms changing in Canadian hospitals? Comparison of point-prevalence survey results in 2010 and 2012.
AB  - A national point-prevalence survey for infection or colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) was done in Canadian hospitals in 2010. A follow-up survey was done in November 2012 to determine whether there were any changes in the prevalence of these organisms; we also determined the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CREs). Associations between prevalence and infection prevention and control policies were evaluated in logistic regression models. A total of 143 (67% of eligible facilities) hospitals with 29 042 adult inpatients participated in the survey, with representation from all 10 provinces; 132 hospitals participated in 2010 and 2012. There were no significant changes in the median prevalence of MRSA in 2010 (4.3%) compared to 2012 (3.9%), or of CDI in 2010 (0.8%) compared to 2012 (0.9%). A higher median prevalence of VRE was identified in 2012 (1.3%) compared to 2010 (0.5%) (p 0.04), despite decreased VRE screening in 2012. The median prevalence of ESBLs was 0.7% and was 0 for CREs; CREs were reported from only 10 hospitals (7.0%). A policy of routinely caring for patients with MRSA or VRE in a private isolation room was associated with lower prevalence of these organisms. Targeted screening of high-risk patients at admission was associated with lower MRSA prevalence; better hand hygiene compliance was associated with lower VRE prevalence. These data provide national prevalence rates for antibiotic-resistant organisms among adults hospitalized in Canadian hospitals. Certain infection prevention and control policies were associated with prevalence.
TI  - ClonalFrameML: efficient inference of recombination in whole bacterial genomes.
AB  - Recombination is an important evolutionary force in bacteria, but it remains challenging to reconstruct the imports that occurred in the ancestry of a genomic sample. Here we present ClonalFrameML, which uses maximum likelihood inference to simultaneously detect recombination in bacterial genomes and account for it in phylogenetic reconstruction. ClonalFrameML can analyse hundreds of genomes in a matter of hours, and we demonstrate its usefulness on simulated and real datasets. We find evidence for recombination hotspots associated with mobile elements in Clostridium difficile ST6 and a previously undescribed 310kb chromosomal replacement in Staphylococcus aureus ST582. ClonalFrameML is freely available at http://clonalframeml.googlecode.com/.
TI  - Evaluation of a pulsed xenon ultraviolet disinfection system for reduction of healthcare-associated pathogens in hospital rooms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of a pulsed xenon ultraviolet (PX-UV) disinfection device for reduction in recovery of healthcare-associated pathogens. SETTING Two acute-care hospitals. METHODS We examined the effectiveness of PX-UV for killing of Clostridium difficile spores, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) on glass carriers and evaluated the impact of pathogen concentration, distance from the device, organic load, and shading from the direct field of radiation on killing efficacy. We compared the effectiveness of PX-UV and ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation, each delivered for 10 minutes at 4 feet. In hospital rooms, the frequency of native pathogen contamination on high-touch surfaces was assessed before and after 10 minutes of PX-UV irradiation. RESULTS On carriers, irradiation delivered for 10 minutes at 4 feet from the PX-UV device reduced recovery of C. difficile spores, MRSA, and VRE by 0.55+/-0.34, 1.85+/-0.49, and 0.6+/-0.25 log10 colony-forming units (CFU)/cm2, respectively. Increasing distance from the PX-UV device dramatically reduced killing efficacy, whereas pathogen concentration, organic load, and shading did not. Continuous UV-C achieved significantly greater log10CFU reductions than PX-UV irradiation on glass carriers. On frequently touched surfaces, PX-UV significantly reduced the frequency of positive C. difficile, VRE, and MRSA culture results. CONCLUSIONS The PX-UV device reduced recovery of MRSA, C. difficile, and VRE on glass carriers and on frequently touched surfaces in hospital rooms with a 10-minute UV exposure time. PX-UV was not more effective than continuous UV-C in reducing pathogen recovery on glass slides, suggesting that both forms of UV have some effectiveness at relatively short exposure times.
TI  - Supervised self-administration of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy: a report from a large tertiary hospital in Australia.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) has become established as a standard of care in most Australian hospitals to treat a variety of infections. Since 1998, the Alternate Site Infusion Service (ASIS) has provided an OPAT service to five hospitals in southern Brisbane, Queensland, using predominantly a patient or carer administration model (self-administered, S-OPAT). The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of our S-OPAT programme. METHODS: Consecutive patients treated by ASIS at the Princess Alexandra Hospital from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011 were reviewed. Data on patient demographics, diagnoses, microbiology, antimicrobial therapy, duration, outcome, and complications were sourced from a prospectively collected database and from patient medical records. RESULTS: There were 150 episodes involving 144 patients resulting in 3520 days of OPAT; the median duration on the programme was 22 days (range 4-106 days). Patient or carer administration occurred in the majority of episodes. The most common indication by far was bone or joint infection (47% of patients), followed by infective endocarditis (9%). Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently treated organism. The overall cure rate was 93%. On multivariate analysis, patients with two or more comorbidities had an increased risk of failure. Line-related complications occurred in 1.4/1000 catheter-days. Rash was the most common drug-related event. Despite the extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics there were no cases of Clostridium difficile infection during therapy and for up to 28 days post cessation of intravenous antibiotics. The cost of OPAT per patient excluding drug administration and home visits was approximately A$ 150.00/day, significantly lower than the cost of an inpatient bed, which is estimated to be A$ 500-800/day.5 CONCLUSION: OPAT using a patient or carer administration model is an effective and safe option for the management of selected patients with infection requiring intravenous antibiotics.
TI  - Evaluation of hydrogen peroxide vapor for the inactivation of nosocomial pathogens on porous and nonporous surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile spores and multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, are important nosocomial pathogens that are difficult to eliminate from the hospital environment. We evaluated the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV), a no-touch automated room decontamination system, for the inactivation of a range of pathogens dried onto hard nonporous and porous surfaces in an operating room (OR). METHODS: Stainless steel and cotton carriers containing >4 log10 viable MRSA, VRE, or MDR A baumannii were placed at 4 locations in the OR along with 7 pouched 6 log10Geobacillus stearothermophilus spore biologic indicators (BIs). HPV was then used to decontaminate the OR. The experiment was repeated 3 times. RESULTS: HPV inactivated all spore BIs (>6 log10 reduction), and no MRSA, VRE, or MDR A baumannii were recovered from the stainless steel and cotton carriers (>4-5 log10 reduction, depending on the starting inoculum). HPV was equally effective at all carrier locations. We did not identify any difference in efficacy for microbes dried onto stainless steel or cotton surfaces, indicating that HPV may have a role in the decontamination of both porous and nonporous surfaces. CONCLUSION: HPV is an effective way to decontaminate clinical areas where contamination with bacterial spores and MDR organisms is suspected.
TI  - Long-term effects of an antimicrobial stewardship programme at a tertiary-care teaching hospital.
AB  - Antimicrobial stewardship has been shown to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, but there are few data on the long-term benefits of such a programme. Antimicrobial use over a 13-year period since implementing an antimicrobial stewardship programme (ASP) at our institution was examined. Nosocomial rates of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of common nosocomial micro-organisms over the same period were also reviewed. Total antimicrobial use decreased by 62.8% (P<0.0001). There were decreases in use of aminoglycosides (-91.3%; P<0.0001), cephalosporins (-68.3%; P<0.0001), extended-spectrum penicillins (-77.7%; P<0.0001), macrolides (-27.2%; P=0.002), clindamycin (-95.9%; P<0.0001) and quinolones (-78.7%; P<0.0001). Antifungal use decreased by 71.0% (P<0.0001). There were increases in the use of carbapenems (+736%, P<0.0001) and anti-MRSA drugs (+73.3%; P<0.0001). There was a 56.7% (P=0.007) reduction in nosocomial MRSA infections. Nosocomial CDI rates decreased by 42.6% (P=0.005) between 2003 and 2010 and then increased to near baseline levels following implementation of more sensitive testing for detection of CDI in 2011. There were decreases in the rate (-71.9%; P=0.001) and percentage (-51.4%; P<0.0001) of quinolone-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There were decreases in the rate (P<0.0001) and percentage (P=0.02) of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa following implementation of a policy restricting ciprofloxacin use. We have demonstrated sustained reductions in both antimicrobial use and drug-resistant organisms following implementation of an ASP.
TI  - Spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-Clostridium activity from Actinomadura sp. 2EPS.
AB  - The rare actinomycetes strain 2EPS was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell wall, and 16S rRNA gene sequence indicates that 2EPS belongs to genus Actinomadura. In addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the relationships of this strain to other members of Actinomadura. A butanol extract with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. The structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR) and mass spectrometric analysis (HR-TOF-MS). Compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the Japanese patent number JP 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are BE-45722A (1), BE-45722B (2) and BE-45722C (3), respectively. All compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, and B. subtilis ATCC 6633) with low MIC values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. Moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar MIC values, against Clostridium perfringens S107 at 0.63 microg/ml and C. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. These results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of Clostridium infections. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Use of a daily disinfectant cleaner instead of a daily cleaner reduced hospital-acquired infection rates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Documenting effective approaches to eliminate environmental reservoirs and reduce the spread of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) has been difficult. This was a prospective study to determine if hospital-wide implementation of a disinfectant cleaner in a disposable wipe system to replace a cleaner alone could reduce HAIs over 1 year when housekeeping compliance was >/=80%. METHODS: In this interrupted time series study, a ready-to-use accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant cleaner in a disposable wipe container system (DCW) was used once per day for all high-touch surfaces in patient care rooms (including isolation rooms) to replace a cleaner only. The HAI rates for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and Clostridium difficile were stratified by housekeeping cleaning compliance (assessed using ultraviolet-visible marker monitoring). RESULTS: When cleaning compliance was >/=80%, there was a significant reduction in cases/10,000 patient days for MRSA (P = .0071), VRE (P < .0001), and C difficile (P = .0005). For any cleaning compliance level there was still a significant reduction in the cases/10,000 patient days for VRE (P = .0358). CONCLUSION: Our study data showed that daily use of the DCW applied to patient care high-touch environmental surfaces with a minimum of 80% cleaning compliance was superior to a cleaner alone because it resulted in significantly reduced rates of HAIs caused by C difficile, MRSA, and VRE.
TI  - Changes to clinician attire have done more harm than good.
AB  - The introduction of 'bare below the elbows' policies to facilitate handwashing led to the disappearance of the white coat from medical and surgical wards. While rates of key healthcare acquired infections in hospitals, e.g. Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, have fallen, argument continues around the contribution of hand hygiene and dress codes to these changes. Conversely, the number of complaints against clinicians continues to rise, and respect for medical staff is falling. Are these phenomena linked to the disappearance of the white coat? Here, we debate the effects of these changes to clinician attire and ask whether the putative benefits in terms of infection control are outweighed by the possible harms to the doctor-patient relationship alleged to be caused by the loss of the white coat.
TI  - Differential impact of infection control strategies on rates of resistant hospital-acquired pathogens in critically ill surgical patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There were two major outbreaks of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter  baumannii (MDRA) in our general surgery and trauma intensive care units (ICUs) in 2004 and 2011. Both required aggressive multi-faceted interventions to control. We hypothesized that the infection control response may have had a secondary benefit of reducing rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). METHODS: We analyzed data retrospectively from a prospective infection control database at a major university hospital and calculated the incidence rates of nosocomial MRSA, VRE, and C. diff before and after the two MDRA outbreaks (2004 and 2011) in the general surgery and trauma ICUs, and two unaffected control ICUs: thoracic surgery ICU and medical ICU. We tracked incidence rates in 6 mos segments for 24 mos per outbreak and created a composite variable of "any resistant pathogen" for comparison. RESULTS: The incidence rates of "any resistant pathogen" were significantly lower in the general surgery ICU after both outbreaks (24 to 11 cases per 1000 patient days in 2004, p=0.045 and 7.7 ->4.0 cases per 1000 patient days in 2011, p=0.04). This did not persist after 6 mos. The trauma ICU's rate of "any resistant pathogen" did not change after either outbreak (16 ->16.5 cases per 1000 patient days in 2004, p=0.44 and 4.6 ->1.9 cases per 1000 patient days in 2011, p=0.41). The rates in the control ICUs were unchanged during the study periods. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of resistant pathogens were lower in the general surgery ICU after response to MDRA outbreaks in both 2004 and 2011 although the rates increased again with time. There were no changes in rates of resistant pathogens in the trauma ICU after MDRA outbreaks in 2004 and 2011. Outbreak responses may have a differential impact in general surgery ICU versus trauma ICUs.
TI  - Adult vaccination.
AB  - Vaccination of children has had a major impact on the morbidity and mortality of  many infectious diseases globally. However, with age, immune responses to vaccines can be less robust, which can be further enhanced by underlying diseases that are common in the older adult. In many countries around the globe booster vaccinations against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are recommended for adults. For the older adult, vaccination against pneumococcal diseases, influenza and herpes zoster are also recommended. Despite these recommendations, the widespread use of these vaccines in the adult population clearly lags behind the vaccine uptake and successes documented for pediatric vaccination programs. Furthermore, extensive and sometimes inappropriate use of antibiotics have fostered the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (e.g., methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) as well as increased susceptibility in the elderly to bacterial species such as Clostridium difficile. Infectious diseases remain an important unmet medical need and new concepts to successfully implement vaccination of adults are urgently needed.
TI  - Influence of sequence mismatches on the specificity of recombinase polymerase amplification technology.
AB  - Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) technology relies on three major proteins, recombinase proteins, single-strand binding proteins, and polymerases, to specifically amplify nucleic acid sequences in an isothermal format. The performance of RPA with respect to sequence mismatches of closely-related non-target molecules is not well documented and the influence of the number and distribution of mismatches in DNA sequences on RPA amplification reaction is not well understood. We investigated the specificity of RPA by testing closely-related species bearing naturally occurring mismatches for the tuf gene sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Mycobacterium tuberculosis and for the cfb gene sequence of Streptococcus agalactiae. In addition, the impact of the number and distribution of mismatches on RPA efficiency was assessed by synthetically generating 14 types of mismatched forward primers for detecting five bacterial species of high diagnostic relevance such as Clostridium difficile, Staphylococcus aureus, S. agalactiae, P. aeruginosa, and M. tuberculosis as well as Bacillus atropheus subsp. globigii for which we use the spores as internal control in diagnostic assays. A total of 87 mismatched primers were tested in this study. We observed that target specific RPA primers with mismatches (n > 1) at their 3'extrimity hampered RPA reaction. In addition, 3 mismatches covering both extremities and the center of the primer sequence negatively affected RPA yield. We demonstrated that the specificity of RPA was multifactorial. Therefore its application in clinical settings must be selected and validated a priori. We recommend that the selection of a target gene must consider the presence of closely-related non-target genes. It is advisable to choose target regions with a high number of mismatches (>/=36%, relative to the size of amplicon) with respect to closely-related species and the best case scenario would be by choosing a unique target gene.
TI  - Novel receptors for bacterial protein toxins.
AB  - While bacterial effectors are often directly introduced into eukaryotic target cells by various types of injection machines, toxins enter the cytosol of host cells from endosomal compartments or after retrograde transport via Golgi from the ER. A first crucial step of toxin-host interaction is receptor binding. Using optimized protocols and new methods novel toxin receptors have been identified, including metalloprotease ADAM 10 for Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin, laminin receptor Lu/BCAM for Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor CNF1, lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) for Clostridium difficile transferase CDT and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 1 for Clostridium perfringens TpeL toxin.
TI  - Long-term efficacy of a self-disinfecting coating in an intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cleaning and disinfecting fomites can effectively remove/kill pathogens on surfaces, but studies have shown that more than one-half the time, surfaces are not adequately cleaned or are recontaminated within minutes. This study evaluated a product designed to create a long-lasting surface coating that provides continuous disinfecting action. METHODS: This study was performed in an intensive care unit (ICU) in a major hospital. Various sites within the ICU were cultured before treatment and then at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 15 weeks after application of an antimicrobial coating. Samples were cultured for total bacteria, as well as Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and carbapenemase-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. RESULTS: The average bacterial count on all treated surfaces was reduced by >99% (2 logs) for at least 8 weeks after treatment. Overall, average levels of bacteria never returned to those observed before treatment even after 15 weeks. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found on 25% of the sites tested before treatment, but were isolated at only 1 site during the 15 weeks after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The product assessed in this study was found to have persisted over 15 weeks in reducing the total number of bacteria and antibiotic resistant bacteria on surfaces within an ICU.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of AZD0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against Gram-positive, fastidious Gram-Negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  - AZD0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious Gram-negative (Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (Legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (Clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. AZD0914 works via inhibition of DNA biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. AZD0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken DNA under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved DNA to form fused circular DNA. Whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. AZD0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in S. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrB. Additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for AZD0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. AZD0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. In in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. The potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of AZD0914 support its continued development.
TI  - Implementing an intensified antibiotic stewardship programme targeting cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone use in a 200-bed community hospital in Germany.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prescription of third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones  has been linked to an increasing incidence of gram-negative bacteria producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and nosocomial infection with Clostridium difficile. Antibiotic stewardship (ABS) programmes offer evidence-based tools to control antibiotic prescription rates and thereby influence the incidence of nosocomial infection and contain the development of multidrug-resistant bacteria, but there is limited experience with such programmes at community hospitals. METHODS: We implemented an ABS programme at a 200-bed community hospital and aimed at a > 30 % reduction of cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone consumption within 1 year. Pharmacy data were obtained to estimate hospital-wide drug use density expressed in WHO-ATC-defined daily doses (DDD) or hospital-adapted recommended daily doses (RDD) per 1,000 patient days. The effect of the ABS intervention on drug use density was analysed using interrupted time-series analysis for the periods between January 2011 and March 2013 as pre-intervention, and between April 2013 and March 2014 as post-intervention period. The CDI incidence was calculated based on microbiology laboratory data. RESULTS: Cephalosporin use (measured in RDD/1,000 patient days) decreased by 33 %, and fluoroquinolone use decreased by 31 %, respectively. Interrupted time-series analysis confirmed significant changes in the drug use density trends for both cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones after the intervention as well as for total antibiotic use that decreased by 11 % while no significant effect was noted for CDI incidence rates. CONCLUSION: ABS programmes can be effective in community hospitals and may help establish ecologically advantageous antibiotic strategies when needed.
TI  - Differences in hospital-associated multidrug-resistant organisms and Clostridium  difficile rates using 2-day versus 3-day definitions.
AB  - We surveyed infection prevention programs in 16 hospitals for hospital-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter acquisition, as well as hospital-associated MRSA bacteremia and Clostridium difficile infection based on defining events as occurring >2 days versus >3 days after admission. The former resulted in significantly higher median rates, ranging from 6.76% to 45.07% higher.
TI  - Evaluation of a sporicidal peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide-based daily disinfectant cleaner.
AB  - OxyCide Daily Disinfectant Cleaner, a novel peracetic acid/hydrogen peroxide-based sporicidal disinfectant, was as effective as sodium hypochlorite for in vitro killing of Clostridium difficile spores, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomcyin-resistant enterococci. OxyCide was minimally affected by organic load and was effective in reducing pathogen contamination in isolation rooms.
TI  - Mini-review: Epidemiology and zoonotic potential of multiresistant bacteria and Clostridium difficile in livestock and food.
AB  - AIM: Information on the epidemiology of multiresistant bacteria (MRB) with zoonotic potential is growing but still remains quite incomplete. This narrative mini-review provides a general overview of the epidemiology of the most important zoonotic MRB in cattle, swine and poultry in Europe. METHODS: A literature search was conducted mainly on the PubMed website including articles published until April 2012. RESULTS: Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) especially poses a zoonotic risk to people working in close contact with livestock. These people may become carriers themselves and the hazard of transmission into health-care facilities needs surveillance. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producing bacteria are widely spread in both humans and livestock, sharing similar genotypes, especially of the CTX-M-group, which makes a zoonotic transfer very likely. Identical strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were found both in humans and animals, after ingestion of animal strains transient colonization of the human gut may be possible. Only a few data are available on the transmission of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS) between humans and animals. Direct contact to colonized animals may be a risk factor as well as the exchange of resistance genes between human and animal staphylococci. Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) ribotype 078 emerges in livestock and humans and a zoonotic transmission seems probable as genotypes and diseases resemble each other. CONCLUSION: All discussed MRB and C. difficile are important nosocomial agents which also occur in livestock and were found in foods of animal origin. Further analysis is needed to reveal the exact transmission routes and to perform a reliable risk assessment.
TI  - Controlling hospital-acquired infection: focus on the role of the environment and new technologies for decontamination.
AB  - There is increasing interest in the role of cleaning for managing hospital-acquired infections (HAI). Pathogens such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multiresistant Gram-negative bacilli, norovirus, and Clostridium difficile persist in the health care environment for days. Both detergent- and disinfectant-based cleaning can help control these pathogens, although difficulties with measuring cleanliness have compromised the quality of published evidence. Traditional cleaning methods are notoriously inefficient for decontamination, and new approaches have been proposed, including disinfectants, steam, automated dispersal systems, and antimicrobial surfaces. These methods are difficult to evaluate for cost-effectiveness because environmental data are not usually modeled against patient outcome. Recent studies have reported the value of physically removing soil using detergent, compared with more expensive (and toxic) disinfectants. Simple cleaning methods should be evaluated against nonmanual disinfection using standardized sampling and surveillance. Given worldwide concern over escalating antimicrobial resistance, it is clear that more studies on health care decontamination are required. Cleaning schedules should be adapted to reflect clinical risk, location, type of site, and hand touch frequency and should be evaluated for cost versus benefit for both routine and outbreak situations. Forthcoming evidence on the role of antimicrobial surfaces could supplement infection prevention strategies for health care environments, including those targeting multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Prevention of health care-associated infections.
AB  - Health care-associated infections cause approximately 75,000 deaths annually, in  addition to increasing morbidity and costs. Over the past decade, a downward trend in health care-associated infections has occurred nationwide. Basic prevention measures include administrative support, educating health care personnel, and hand hygiene and isolation precautions. Prevention of central line- or catheter-associated infections begins with avoidance of unnecessary insertion, adherence to aseptic technique when inserting, and device removal when no longer necessary. Specific recommendations for preventing central line-associated bloodstream infections include use of chlorhexidine for skin preparation, as a component of dressings, and for daily bathing of patients in intensive care units. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections are the most common device-related health care-associated infection. Maintaining a closed drainage system below the patient reduces the risk of infection. To prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, which is associated with high mortality, mechanically ventilated patients should be placed in the semirecumbent position and receive antiseptic oral care. Prevention of surgical site infections includes hair removal using clippers, glucose control, and preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Reducing transmission of Clostridium difficile and multidrug-resistant organisms in the hospital setting begins with hand hygiene and contact precautions. Institutional efforts to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing are also strongly recommended. Reducing rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection can be achieved through active surveillance cultures and decolonization therapy with mupirocin.
TI  - Racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare-associated infections in the United States, 2009-2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about racial and ethnic disparities in the occurrence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether racial/ethnic disparities exist in the rate of occurrence of HAIs captured in the Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System (MPSMS). METHODS: Chart-abstracted MPSMS data from randomly selected all-payer hospital discharges of adult patients (18 years old or above) between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2011, for 3 common medical conditions: acute cardiovascular disease (composed of acute myocardial infarction and heart failure), pneumonia, and major surgery for 6 HAI measures (hospital-acquired antibiotic-associated Clostridium difficile, central line-associated bloodstream infections, postoperative pneumonia, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and ventilator-associated pneumonia). RESULTS: The study sample included 79,019 patients who had valid racial/ethnic information divided into 6 racial/ethnic groups-white non-Hispanic (n = 62,533), black non-Hispanic (n = 9,693), Hispanic (n = 4,681), Asian (n = 1,225), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (n = 94), and other (n = 793)-who were at risk for at least 1 HAI. The occurrence rate for HAIs was 1.1% for non-Hispanic white patients, 1.3% for non-Hispanic black patients, 1.5% for Hispanic patients, 1.8% for Asian patients, 1.7% for Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander patients, and 0.70% for other patients. Compared with white patients, the age/gender/comorbidity-adjusted odds ratios of occurrence of HAIs were 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.23), 1.3 (95% CI, 1.15-1.53), 1.4 (95% CI, 1.07-1.75), and 0.7 (95% CI, 0.40-1.12) for black, Hispanic, Asian, and a combined group of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and other patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with acute cardiovascular disease, pneumonia, and major surgery, Asian and Hispanic patients had significantly higher rates of HAIs than white non-Hispanic patients.
TI  - Hand-hygiene compliance does not predict rates of resistant infections in critically ill surgical patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our institution had a major outbreak of multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter (MDRA) in its general surgical and trauma intensive care units (ICUs) in 2011, requiring implementation of an aggressive infection-control response. We hypothesized that poor hand-hygiene compliance (HHC) may have contributed to the outbreak of MDRA. A response to the outbreak including aggressive environmental cleaning, cohorting, and increased hand hygiene compliance monitoring may have led to an increase in HHC after the outbreak and to a consequent decrease in the rates of infection by the nosocomial pathogens methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and Clostridium difficile. METHODS: Hand-hygiene compliance, tracked in monthly audits by trained and anonymous observers, was abstracted from an infection control database. The incidences of nosocomial MRSA, VRE, and C. difficile were calculated from a separate prospectively collected data base for 6 mo before and 12 mo after the 2011 outbreak of MDRA in the institution's general surgical and trauma ICUs, and data collected prospectively from two unaffected ICUs (the thoracic surgical ICU and medical intensive care unit [MICU]). We created a composite endpoint of "any resistant pathogen," defined as MRSA, VRE, or C. difficile, and compared incidence rates over time, using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient to measure the correlations among these rates. RESULTS: Rates of HHC before and after the outbreak of MDRA were consistently high in both the general surgical (median rates: 100% before and 97.6% after the outbreak, p=0.93) and trauma ICUs (median rates: 90% before and 96.75% after the outbreak, p=0.14). In none of the ICUs included in the study did the rates of HHC increase in response to the outbreak of MDRA. The incidence of "any resistant pathogen" decreased in the general surgical ICU after the outbreak (from 6.7/1,000 patient-days before the outbreak to 2.7/1,000 patient-days after the outbreak, p=0.04), but this decrease did not correlate with HHC (trauma ICU: Pearson correlation [rho]=-0.34, p=0.28; general surgical ICU: rho=0.52, p=0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The 2011 outbreak of MDRA at our institution occurred despite high rates of HHC. Notwithstanding stable rates of HHC, the rates of infection with MRSA, VRE and C. difficile decreased in the general surgical ICU after the outbreak. This suggests that infection control tactics other than HHC play a crucial role in preventing the transmission of nosocomial pathogens, especially when rates of HHC have been maximized.
TI  - Antiinfective therapy with a small molecule inhibitor of Staphylococcus aureus sortase.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the most frequent cause of  hospital-acquired infection, which manifests as surgical site infections, bacteremia, and sepsis. Due to drug-resistance, prophylaxis of MRSA infection with antibiotics frequently fails or incites nosocomial diseases such as Clostridium difficile infection. Sortase A is a transpeptidase that anchors surface proteins in the envelope of S. aureus, and sortase mutants are unable to cause bacteremia or sepsis in mice. Here we used virtual screening and optimization of inhibitor structure to identify 3-(4-pyridinyl)-6-(2-sodiumsulfonatephenyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazo le and related compounds, which block sortase activity in vitro and in vivo. Sortase inhibitors do not affect in vitro staphylococcal growth yet protect mice against lethal S. aureus bacteremia. Thus, sortase inhibitors may be useful as antiinfective therapy to prevent hospital-acquired S. aureus infection in high-risk patients without the side effects of antibiotics.
TI  - Ramoplanin at bactericidal concentrations induces bacterial membrane depolarization in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ramoplanin is an actinomycetes-derived antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive bacteria that has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of gastrointestinal vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and Clostridium difficile infections. Recent studies have proposed that ramoplanin binds to bacterial membranes as a C2 symmetrical dimer that can sequester Lipid II, which causes inhibition of cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis and cell death. In this study, ramoplanin was shown to bind to anionic and zwitterionic membrane mimetics with a higher affinity for anionic membranes and to induce membrane depolarization of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) ATCC 25923 at concentrations at or above the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). The ultrastructural effects of ramoplanin on S. aureus were also examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and this showed dramatic changes to bacterial cell morphology. The correlation observed between membrane depolarization and bacterial cell viability suggests that this mechanism may contribute to the bactericidal activity of ramoplanin.
TI  - [Validation of the structure and resources of nosocomial infection control team in hospitals ascribed to VINCat program in Catalonia, Spain].
AB  - The main objective of this study was to validate the structure of the infection control team (ICT) in the hospitals adhered to VINCat program and secondary objective was to establish the consistency of resources of each center with the requirements established by the program. Qualitative research consisting of an ethnographic study using participant observation during the years 2008-2010. The centers were stratified in three groups by complexity and beds. The instrument was a semistructured interview to members of the ICT. The transcription of the interview was sent to informants for validation. In November 2010 a questionnaire regarding human resources and number hours dedicated to the ICT was sent. During 2008-2010, 65 centers had been adhered to VINCat program. In 2010, the ICT of Group I hospitals had a mean of two physician, one in full-time and one nurse for every 230 beds. In Group II, one physician part-time and one nurse per 180 beds and in Group III a physician and a nurse for every 98 beds, both part-time. In 2010, all hospitals had a structured ICT, an operative infection committee, and a hospital member representing the center at the program as well as enough electronic resources. The hospitals participating in the program have now VINCat an adequate surveillance structure and meet the minimum technical and human resources required to provide high-quality data. However human resources are not guaranteed.

TI  - Clostridium difficile infections in Veterans Health Administration acute care facilities.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: An initiative was implemented in July 2012 to decrease Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) in Veterans Affairs (VA) acute care medical centers nationwide. This is a report of national baseline CDI data collected from the 21 months before implementation of the initiative. METHODS: Personnel at each of 132 data-reporting sites entered monthly retrospective CDI case data from October 2010 through June 2012 into a central database using case definitions similar to those of the National Healthcare Safety Network multidrug-resistant organism/CDI module. RESULTS: There were 958,387 hospital admissions, 5,286,841 patient-days, and 9,642 CDI cases reported during the 21-month analysis period. The pooled CDI admission prevalence rate (including recurrent cases) was 0.66 cases per 100 admissions. The nonduplicate/nonrecurrent community-onset not-healthcare-facility-associated (CO-notHCFA) case rate was 0.35 cases per 100 admissions, and the community-onset healthcare facility-associated (CO-HCFA) case rate was 0.14 cases per 100 admissions. Hospital-onset healthcare facility-associated (HO-HCFA), clinically confirmed HO-HCFA (CC-HO-HCFA), and CO-HCFA rates were 9.32, 8.40, and 2.56 cases per 10,000 patient-days, respectively. There were significant decreases in admission prevalence (P = .0006, Poisson regression), HO-HCFA (P = .003), and CC-HO-HCFA (P = .004) rates after adjusting for type of diagnostic test. CO-HCFA and CO-notHCFA rates per 100 admissions also trended downward (P = .07 and .10, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: VA acute care medical facility CDI rates were higher than those reported in other healthcare systems, but unlike rates in other venues, they were decreasing or trending downward. Despite these downward trends, there is still a substantial burden of CDI in the system supporting the need for efforts to decrease rates further.
TI  - Gut microbiome in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) differs from that in healthy comparison babies and offers an explanation for the risk factor of prone position.
AB  - The role of bacteria in the causation of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is gaining acceptance. Mainstream research favouring respiratory compromise has failed to provide a plausible pathogenetic mechanism despite many years of investigation and thousands of research papers. Bacterial colonisation of the colon of the human infant is influenced by many factors including age, mode of delivery, diet, environment, and antibiotic exposure. The gut microbiome influences development of the immune system. The gut microflora could be important in protection against the bacteria and/or their toxins purportedly involved in SIDS pathogenesis. The aim was to perform a preliminary investigation of the gut microflora in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) compared with live comparison babies. The intestinal contents from 52 SIDS, and 102 faecal samples from age-matched live comparison infants were screened by PCR to target 16s RNA genes of Clostridium innocuum, Cl. Perfringens, Cl. difficile, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Staphylococcus aureus. Gut colonisation of the babies with these bacteria was analysed in relation to age, gender and type of feeding; and for SIDS babies sleeping position. Cl. difficile, Cl. innocuum and B. thetaiotaomicron were significantly associated with SIDS with 25%, 46% and 30% of cases PCR positive for these respective bacteria compared with only 6%, 23% and 8.8% respectively in the comparison group. SIDS babies had dual colonisation by both Cl. perfringens and Cl. difficile significantly more often than comparison babies and also with triple colonisation by Cl. perfringens, Cl. difficile and Cl. innocuum. SIDS babies were more often colonised by S. aureus than comparison babies. In addition, SIDS babies found prone were significantly more likely to be colonised by S. aureus than for other positions recorded (OR = infinity; CI = 2.04 - infinity). No significant differences between breast and bottle-fed SIDS babies was observed in regard to each clostridial bacterium, or S. aureus, however Cl. innocuum was found to be significantly associated with formula feeding in the comparison cohort. Comparison of breast and formula feeding of SIDS babies with live comparison babies revealed significant differences with regards to some of the clostridial bacteria. Age-specific differences in gut bacterial microbiome were observed in both SIDS and comparison healthy babies. This study gives an insight into differences in the gut bacterial microbiome of SIDS babies compared with healthy babies. These differences could be important in contributing to a baby's susceptibility to infection and therefore to SIDS. The association of S. aureus colonisation with prone sleep position supports the hypothesis that prone sleep position could increase the risk of ingestion/inhalation of bacteria contaminating the sleeping surface and could account for the increased risk of SIDS in babies who are put to sleep prone. The study provides impetus for broader studies into the gut microbiome of babies and could lead to effective approaches to SIDS prevention.
TI  - State-Mandated Reporting of Health Care-Associated Infections in the United States: Trends Over Time.
AB  - Over the past decade, most US states and territories began mandating that acute care hospitals report health care-associated infections (HAIs) to their departments of health. Trends in state HAI law enactment and data submission requirements were determined through systematic legal review; state HAI coordinators were contacted to confirm collected data. As of January 31, 2013, 37 US states and territories (71%) had adopted laws requiring HAI data submission, most of which were enacted and became effective in 2006 and 2007. Most states with HAI laws required reporting of central line-associated bloodstream infections in adult intensive care units (92%), and about half required reporting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile infections (54% and 51%, respectively). Overall, data submission requirements were found to vary across states. Considering the facility and state resources needed to comply with HAI reporting mandates, future studies should focus on whether these laws have had the desired impact of reducing infection rates.
TI  - Despite progress, more work still needed to prevent infections.

TI  - Importance of antimicrobial stewardship to the English National Health Service.
AB  - Antimicrobials are an extremely valuable resource across the spectrum of modern medicine. Their development has been associated with dramatic reductions in communicable disease mortality and has facilitated technological advances in cancer therapy, transplantation, and surgery. However, this resource is threatened by the dwindling supply of new antimicrobials and the global increase in antimicrobial resistance. There is an urgent need for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) to protect our remaining antimicrobials for future generations. AMS emphasizes sensible, appropriate antimicrobial management for the benefit of the individual and society as a whole. Within the English National Health Service (NHS), a series of recent policy initiatives have focused on all aspects of AMS, including best practice guidelines for antimicrobial prescribing, enhanced surveillance mechanisms for monitoring antimicrobial use across primary and secondary care, and new prescribing competencies for doctors in training. Here we provide a concise summary to clarify the current position and importance of AMS within the NHS and review the evidence base for AMS recommendations. The evidence supports the impact of AMS strategies on modifying prescribing practice in hospitals, with beneficial effects on both antimicrobial resistance and the incidence of Clostridium difficile, and no evidence of increased sepsis-related mortality. There is also a promising role for novel diagnostic technologies in AMS, both in enhancing microbiological diagnosis and improving the specificity of sepsis diagnosis. More work is needed to establish an evidence base for interventions to improve public and patient education regarding the role of antibiotics in common clinical syndromes, such as respiratory tract infection. Future priorities include establishing novel approaches to antimicrobial management (eg, duration of therapy, combination regimens) to protect against resistance and working with the pharmaceutical industry to promote the development of new antimicrobials.
TI  - Establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. Final rule.
AB  - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. This final rule implements a provision of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA). GAIN is intended to encourage development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. Based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, FDA has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' Acinetobacter species, Aspergillus species, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Campylobacter species, Candida species, Clostridium difficile, Coccidioides species, Cryptococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae), Enterococcus species, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, Non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and Vibrio cholerae. The preamble to the proposed rule described the factors the Agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. As described in the preamble of this final rule, FDA applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.
TI  - Evaluation of dedicated infectious diseases pharmacists on antimicrobial stewardship teams.
AB  - PURPOSE: Patient care improvements and cost savings achieved by a large integrated health system through the implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) at two hospitals are reported. METHODS: A pre-post analysis was conducted to evaluate cost and quality outcomes at the two ASP sites and three similar sites within the same health system not included in the ASP initiative. The utilization of 15 targeted antimicrobials and associated costs at the five sites during designated preimplementation and postimplementation periods were compared; changes in Hospital Standardized Mortality Ratio (HSMR) values for specific infections among Medicare patients were also assessed. RESULTS: In the year after ASP implementation, aggregate direct antimicrobial acquisition costs at the two study sites decreased 17.3% from prior-year levels and increased by 9.1% at the three comparator sites. Significant decreases in the consumption of targeted antimicrobial classes (antipseudomonals, quinolones, and agents active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) were observed at the ASP sites. Among the 2446 ASP interventions recorded, 72% involved discontinuing or narrowing the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Although rates of health care-associated Clostridium difficile infection were little changed at both study sites after ASP implementation, HSMR data indicated substantial gains in combating sepsis and C. difficile and respiratory infections. CONCLUSION: After implementation of ASPs at two study sites, the utilization of all classes of antibiotics decreased and antimicrobial costs per 1000 patient-days decreased. While HSMR values for sepsis (including C. difficile-associated cases) and respiratory infections improved, the rate of C. difficile infections stayed the same.
TI  - Serum bacterial toxins are related to the progression of inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and  ulcerative colitis (UC), is an autoimmune disease. Disorder of intestinal microbes is thought to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of IBD. Detection of bacterial toxins could become a new approach to judge the situation of this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 142 IBD patients and 40 healthy donors as well as 15 CD patients with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) monoclonal antibody (infliximab [IFX]). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli O157, salmonella, and Staphylococcus aureus were used to analyze these bacterial toxins in sera. RESULTS: The positive rates of bacterial toxins from C. difficile, E. coli O157, salmonella, and S. aureus in the IBD patients were found in low incidences and associated with disease duration, colonic involvement, and treatment with prednisone and immunomodulators. The active CD and UC patients had significant higher positive rates of these bacterial toxins than those in remission or healthy controls. Blockage of TNF with IFX in CD patients resulted in significant decreases of the levels of toxins of C. difficile, E. coli O157, salmonella, and S. aureus in sera. CONCLUSIONS: Some bacterial toxins are present in the sera of active IBD patients, and patients with long disease duration, colonic involvement, or treatment with prednisone and immunomodulators are more susceptible to bacterial infection. Inhibition of inflammation with IFX would reduce the bacterial toxins via improvement of intestinal inflammation. Detecting bacteria-derived toxins in sera can be used to predict the progression of IBD.
TI  - Funding healthcare-associated infection research: a systematic analysis of UK research investments, 1997-2010.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) are a cause of high health and economic burden in the UK. The number of HCAI research studies funded in the UK, and the associated amount of investment, has not previously been analysed. AIM: To assess the level of research funding awarded to UK institutions for HCAI research and the relationship of funded research to clinical and public health burden of HCAIs. METHODS: Databases and websites were systematically searched for information on how infectious disease research studies were funded for the period 1997-2010. Studies specifically related to HCAI research were identified and categorized in terms of funding by pathogen, disease, and by a research and development value chain describing the type of science. FINDINGS: The overall dataset included 6165 studies (total investment pound2.6 billion) of which pound57.7 million was clearly directed towards HCAI research across 297 studies (2.2% of total spend, 2.1% of total studies). Of the HCAI-related projects, 45 studies had a specific focus on MRSA ( pound10.3 million), 14 towards Clostridium difficile ( pound10.7 million), two towards pneumonia ( pound0.3 million) and 103 studies related to surgical infections ( pound14.1 million). Mean and median study funding was pound194,129 (standard deviation: pound429,723) and pound52,684 (interquartile range: pound9,168 to pound201,658) respectively. Award size ranged from pound108 to pound50.0 million. CONCLUSIONS: Research investment for HCAIs has gradually increased in the study period, but remains low due to the health, economic, and social burden of HCAI. Research for hospital-acquired pneumonia, behavioural interventions, economic analyses, and research on emerging pathogens exhibiting antimicrobial resistance remain underfunded.
TI  - Urinary Tract Infections: Leading Initiatives in Selecting Empiric Outpatient Treatment (UTILISE).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overuse of fluoroquinolone antibiotics is associated with outbreaks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and increasing resistance in gram-negative organisms. Over the past decade, resistance of Escherichia coli to ciprofloxacin has increased in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region. In August 2011, an exploratory audit of the Regina General Hospital (RGH) emergency department showed that 20% of new antibiotic orders were for fluoroquinolones, and 60% of these new fluoroquinolone orders were for ciprofloxacin. It was postulated that ciprofloxacin was predominantly prescribed for outpatients with urinary tract infection. OBJECTIVE: To develop, implement, and evaluate a best-practice algorithm for the empiric treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in the RGH emergency department, as part of an educational initiative for emergency physicians. METHODS: A literature review was conducted and local antibiogram data were analyzed to establish a best-practice algorithm for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in outpatients seen in the emergency department. A chart review was conducted from January to March 2011 to establish a baseline of empiric antibiotic use. An educational strategy targeting emergency physicians described changes in antibiotic resistance patterns in the health region, principles of antimicrobial stewardship, drivers of resistance, and the results of a literature review of best practice for urinary tract infection in outpatients. A post-intervention audit was conducted from January to March 2012 to determine changes in practice. RESULTS: Comparison of results from the post-intervention audit with baseline data showed that adherence to best practice increased significantly, from 41% (39/96) before the intervention to 66% (50/76) after the intervention (odds ratio [OR] 2.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51-5.25; p < 0.001). There was also a significant change in overall antibiotic selection (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11-0.58; p < 0.001). Further analysis suggested that this significant change was driven by a decrease in use of ciprofloxacin, from 32% (31/96) to 11% (8/76). CONCLUSION: Creation of a best-practice algorithm and education focused on emergency physicians significantly increased adherence to best practice and optimized antibiotic prescribing for outpatients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection by limiting overuse of fluoroquinolones, primarily ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Outcomes of a ventilator-associated pneumonia bundle on rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia and other health care-associated infections in a long-term acute care hospital setting.
AB  - Long-term trends in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) rates, and other health care-associated infections, were examined prior to, during, and after introduction of a VAP bundle in a long-term acute care hospital setting. VAP incidence rate declined in a step-wise fashion and reached a null value. Incidence rates of bacteremia from any cause declined in a similar fashion. The incidence rates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization or infection rates also decreased, but that of Clostridium difficile infection did not. VAP in the long-term acute care hospital setting can be controlled over time with implementation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-based VAP bundle. This outcome also may decrease certain other health care-associated infections.
TI  - Environmental cleaning resources and activities in Canadian acute care hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental cleaning interventions have increased cleaning effectiveness and reduced antibiotic-resistant organisms in hospitals. This study examined cleaning in Canadian acute care hospitals with the goal of developing strategies to improve cleaning and reduce antibiotic-resistant organism rates. METHODS: Managers most responsible for environmental services (EVS) completed an extensive online survey that assessed EVS resources and cleaning practices. RESULTS: The response rate was 50.5%; 96 surveys were completed, representing 103 of 204 hospitals. Whereas 86.3% (82/95) of managers responsible for EVS reported their staff was adequately trained and 76.0% (73/96) that supplies and equipment budgets were sufficient, only 46.9% (45/96) reported that EVS had enough personnel to satisfactorily clean their hospital. A substantial minority (36.8%, 35/95) of EVS departments did not audit the cleaning of medical surgical patient rooms on at least a monthly basis. Cleaning audits of medical surgical patient rooms frequently included environmental marking methods in only one third (33.3%, 31/93) of hospitals and frequently included the measurement of residual bioburden in only 13.8% (13/94). CONCLUSION: There was a general need for increased and improved auditing of environmental cleaning in Canadian hospitals, and there were perceived EVS staffing deficits in the majority of hospitals.
TI  - Epidemiological surveillance of bacterial nosocomial infections in the surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intensive care units (ICUs) are associated with a greater risk of developing nosocomial infections (NIs) than other departments. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the rate, the site and causative organisms of NIs in the surgical ICU at University Clinical Center Tuzla. METHODS: All patients admitted to the surgical ICU were followed prospectively, for the development of NIs (January-December 2010). Determination of NIs was performed using standardized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. RESULTS: 94 out of 834 patients (11.27%) developed NIs. Respiratory tract infections were seen in 56 (60%), urinary tract infections in 15 (16%) and gastrointestinal tract infections in 8 (9%) patients. Other infections identified were surgical site, bloodstream and skin infections. Gram-negative organisms were reported in approximately 75% of cases (78.7% extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producers). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the commonest (51.0%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (21.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.6%). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (16%), and Clostridium difficile (9.6%) were the commonest among gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSION: Respiratory and urinary tract infections made up the great majority of NIs. ICU patients are more susceptible to NIs, emphasizing the importance of continuous surveillance and enforcement of specific infection control measures.
TI  - Disinfecting the iPad: evaluating effective methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tablet computers are increasingly used in healthcare, but they may carry nosocomial pathogens. There are few data available on how to clean an iPad effectively for use in the clinical setting. AIM: We aimed to identify the most effective method of decontaminating the Apple iPad, without causing damage, and establish the duration of any residual effect. METHODS: Following contamination with a microbial broth (meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and Clostridium difficile), we examined efficacy of iPad disinfection in the laboratory using six different disinfectant wipes: Sani-Cloth CHG 2% (chlorhexidine 2%/alcohol 70%), Clorox, Tristel, Trigene, soap and water, and plain cloth. Following cleaning, iPads were recontaminated to examine residual activity. After 480 Sani-Cloth CHG 2% disinfecting episodes, functional and visual analysis of iPads was performed by blinded subjects. FINDINGS: With the exception of Clostridium difficile, Sani-Cloth CHG 2% and Clorox wipes were most effective against MRSA and VRE, and they were significantly better than the Apple-recommended plain cloth (P </= 0.001). A substantial residual antimicrobial effect was seen for >6h after wiping the iPad with Sani-Cloth CHG 2% despite repeated recontamination and without further disinfection. The functionality or visual appearance of the iPad was not damaged by repeated use of Sani-Cloth CHG 2% wipes. CONCLUSIONS: Sani-Cloth CHG 2% wipes effectively disinfect the iPad against MRSA and VRE, with a residual antibacterial effect and without causing damage.
TI  - The silver lining of disposable sporicidal privacy curtains in an intensive care  unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The environment is a well-known source of health care-acquired infection. Because of the known risk of contamination, patient privacy curtains require frequent changes to decrease the risk of spread from patients to curtain and visa versa. METHODS: Fourteen disposable sporicidal privacy curtains were tested from December 2012 to June 2013 while hanging in a busy intensive care unit. Significant bacterial pathogens were identified and total bacteria enumerated as colony-forming units. Antimicrobial activity of curtain swatches was also tested against a range of bacteria in the laboratory. Measurements were recorded as zone of inhibition and contact inhibition. A cost analysis to replace standard curtains with disposable sporicidal curtains was also undertaken. RESULTS: Cultures grew low numbers of skin and environmental microorganisms with no methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or Clostridium difficile detected. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci were recovered in very low numbers from 2 curtains where vancomycin-resistant enterococci-infected patients had been located. Privacy curtains demonstrated antimicrobial activity against C difficile and 13 additional bacterial pathogens. CONCLUSION: We conclude that disposable sporicidal privacy curtains are cost-effective and best replaced at 6 months in a high-risk area such as an intensive care unit.
TI  - Working relationships of infection prevention and control programs and environmental services and associations with antibiotic-resistant organisms in Canadian acute care hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental contamination in hospitals with antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) is associated with patient contraction of AROs. This study examined the working relationship of Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) and Environmental Services and the impact of that relationship on ARO rates. METHODS: Lead infection control professionals completed an online survey that assessed the IPAC and Environmental Services working relationship in their acute care hospital in 2011. The survey assessed cleaning collaborations, staff training, hospital cleanliness, and nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infection, and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). RESULTS: The survey was completed by 58.3% of hospitals (119 of 204). Two-thirds (65.8%; 77 of 117) of the respondents reported that their cleaners were adequately trained, and 62.4% (73 of 117) reported that their hospital was sufficiently clean. Greater cooperation between IPAC and Environmental Services was associated with lower rates of MRSA infection (r = -0.22; P = .02), and frequent collaboration regarding cleaning protocols was associated with lower rates of VRE infection (r = -0.20; P = .03) and CDI (r = -0.31; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Canadian IPAC programs generally had collaborative working relationships with Environmental Services, and this was associated with lower rates of ARO. Deficits in the adequacy of cleaning staff training and hospital cleanliness were identified. The promotion of collaborative working relationships and additional training for Environmental Services workers would be expected to lower ARO rates.
TI  - Variability of contact precaution policies in US emergency departments.
AB  - Contact precautions policies in US emergency departments have not been studied. We surveyed a structured random sample and found wide variation; for example, 45% required contact precautions for stool incontinence or diarrhea, 84% for suspected Clostridium difficile, and 79% for suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. Emergency medicine departments and organizations should enact policies.
TI  - Protection from Clostridium difficile infection in CD4 T Cell- and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor-deficient mice.
AB  - Clostridium difficile rivals methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the primary hospital-acquired infection. C. difficile infection (CDI) caused by toxins A and/or B can manifest as mild diarrhea to life-threatening pseudomembranous colitis. Although most patients recover fully from CDI, ~20% undergo recurrent disease. Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between anti-toxin antibody (Ab) and decreased recurrence; however, the contributions of the systemic and mucosal Ab responses remain unclear. Our goal was to use the CDI mouse model to characterize the protective immune response to C. difficile. C57BL/6 mice infected with epidemic C. difficile strain BI17 developed protective immunity against CDI and did not develop CDI upon rechallenge; they generated systemic IgG and IgA as well as mucosal IgA Ab to toxin. To determine if protective immunity to C. difficile could be generated in immunodeficient individuals, we infected CD4(-/-) mice and found that they generated both mucosal and serum IgA anti-toxin Abs and were protected from CDI upon rechallenge, with protection dependent on major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) expression; no IgG anti-toxin Ab was found. We found that protection was likely due to neutralizing mucosal IgA Ab. In contrast, pIgR(-/-) mice, which lack the receptor to transcytose polymeric Ab across the epithelium, were also protected from CDI, suggesting that although mucosal anti-toxin Ab may contribute to protection, it is not required. We conclude that protection from CDI can occur by several mechanisms and that the mechanism of protection is determined by the state of immunocompetence of the host.
TI  - A case study of a real-time evaluation of the risk of disease transmission associated with a failure to follow recommended sterilization procedures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Failures to follow recommendations for reprocessing of surgical instruments may place patients at risk for exposure to pathogenic microorganisms. When such failures occur, medical facilities often face considerable uncertainty and challenges in assessing the actual risks of disease transmission. METHODS: In 2011, staff at an Ohio hospital determined that surgical instruments inside a Steriset Container had inadvertently been autoclaved on a gravity cycle rather than on the recommended pre-vacuum cycle, potentially exposing 72 patients who underwent surgery with the instruments to risk of infection. To provide an assessment of the level of risk, we tested the effectiveness of the machine washer/disinfector step and of the sterilization process inside the Steriset Container on the gravity cycle for killing of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores, Clostridium difficile spores, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Based on the test results, the risk of transmission of MRSA by the instruments was calculated and the risk of transmission of hepatitis B virus was estimated. RESULTS: The machine washer/disinfector consistently reduced MRSA recovery by a factor of 1:100,000. The sterilization process inside the Steriset Container consistently reduced MRSA concentrations by a factor of >1:10,000,000 and killed 105C. difficile spores and 105G. stearothermophilus spores. The risk of MRSA transmission due to the incident was calculated to be 1 in 100 trillion. CONCLUSIONS: The risk for transmission of infection due to the failure to follow recommended sterilization processes was negligible based upon complete killing of G. stearothermophilus biological indicator spores, C. difficile spores, and MRSA under conditions that replicated the incident where proper procedures were not followed. Such real-time assessments of the risks associated with specific incidents may provide evidence-based information that can be used to inform decisions regarding disclosure of the incident to patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs: Appropriate Measures and Metrics to Study their Impact.
AB  - Antimicrobial stewardship is a new field that struggles to find the right balance between meaningful and useful metrics to study the impact of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs). ASP metrics primarily measure antimicrobial use, although microbiological resistance and clinical outcomes are also important measures of the impact an ASP has on a hospital and its patient population. Antimicrobial measures looking at consumption are the most commonly used measures, and are focused on defined daily doses, days of therapy, and costs, usually standardized per 1,000 patient-days. Each measure provides slightly different information, with their own upsides and downfalls. Point prevalence measurement of antimicrobial use is an increasingly used approach to understanding consumption that does not entirely rely on sophisticated electronic information systems, and is also replicable. Appropriateness measures hold appeal and promise, but have not been developed to the degree that makes them useful and widely applicable. The primary reason why antimicrobial stewardship is necessary is the growth of antimicrobial resistance. Accordingly, antimicrobial resistance is an important metric of the impact of an ASP. The most common approach to measuring resistance for ASP purposes is to report rates of common or important community- or nosocomial-acquired antimicrobial-resistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile. Such an approach is dependent on detection methods, community rates of resistance, and co-interventions, and therefore may not be the most accurate or reflective measure of antimicrobial stewardship interventions. Development of an index to reflect the net burden of resistance holds theoretical promise, but has yet to be realized. Finally, programs must consider patient outcome measures. Mortality is the most objective and reliable method, but has several drawbacks. Disease- or organism-specific mortality, or cure, are increasingly used metrics.
TI  - Medication risk factors associated with healthcare-associated Clostridium difficile infection: a multilevel model case-control study among 64 US academic medical centres.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this study was to determine patient- and hospital-level medication risk factors associated with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) occurrence among patients clustered within hospitals using a multilevel model. METHODS: Patients with healthcare-associated (HA)-CDI were identified from among 64 academic medical centres in 2009. A frequency match was conducted; for each case, up to two controls were selected, matched on similar pre-infection length of stay and clinical service line. Patient- and hospital-level medication use, including antibacterial and gastric acid-suppressant agents, was assessed using a two-level logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 5967 CDI cases and 8167 controls were included in the analysis. The odds of acquiring HA-CDI increased with the following medications [OR (95% CI)]: anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus agents [1.38 (1.22-1.56)]; third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins [1.75 (1.62-1.89)]; carbapenems [1.60 (1.44-1.79)]; beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations [1.49 (1.36-1.64)]; vancomycin [1.73 (1.57-1.89)]; and proton pump inhibitors [1.43 (1.30-1.57)]. The odds of acquiring HA-CDI decreased with the following medications: clindamycin [0.74 (0.63-0.87)]; and macrolides [0.88 (0.77-0.99)]. Controlling for patient-level covariates, no hospital-level medication covariates that we analysed had statistically significant effects on HA-CDI. The odds of acquiring HA-CDI increased with the hospital proportion of patients aged >/= 65 years [1.01 (1.00-1.02)]. CONCLUSIONS: We found several medications that were associated with the risk of patients developing HA-CDI, including beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, vancomycin, proton pump inhibitors and anti-methicillin-resistant S. aureus agents. There were no medication effects significant at the hospital level.
TI  - Accuracy of administrative code data for the surveillance of healthcare-associated infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - Administrative code data (ACD), such as International Classifications of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes, are widely used in surveillance and public reporting programs that seek to identify healthcare-associated infections (HAIs); however, little is known about their accuracy. This systematic review summarizes evidence for the accuracy of ACD for the detection of selected HAIs, including catheter-associated urinary tract infection, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), central line-associated bloodstream infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia/events, postprocedure pneumonia, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and surgical site infections (SSIs). We conducted meta-analysis for SSIs and CDIs, where acceptable numbers of primary studies were available. For these 2 conditions, ACD have moderate sensitivity and high specificity, but evidence for detection of other HAIs is limited. With current low prevalence of HAIs, the positive predictive value of ACD algorithms would be low. ACD may be inaccurate for detection of many HAIs and should be used cautiously for surveillance and reporting purposes.
TI  - Health care use and serious infection prevalence associated with penicillin "allergy" in hospitalized patients: A cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Penicillin is the most common drug "allergy" noted at hospital admission, although it is often inaccurate. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine total hospital days, antibiotic exposures, and the prevalence rates of Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in patients with and without penicillin "allergy" at hospital admission. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, matched cohort study of subjects admitted to Kaiser Foundation hospitals in Southern California during 2010 through 2012. RESULTS: It was possible to match 51,582 (99.6% of all possible cases) unique hospitalized subjects with penicillin "allergy" to 2 unique discharge diagnosis category-matched, sex-matched, age-matched, and date of admission-matched control subjects each. Cases with penicillin "allergy" averaged 0.59 (9.9%; 95% CI, 0.47-0.71) more total hospital days during 20.1 +/- 10.5 months of follow-up compared with control subjects. Cases were treated with significantly more fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and vancomycin (P < .0001) for each antibiotic compared with control subjects. Cases had 23.4% (95% CI, 15.6% to 31.7%) more C difficile, 14.1% (95% CI, 7.1% to 21.6%) more MRSA, and 30.1% (95% CI, 12.5% to 50.4%) more VRE infections than expected compared with control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: A penicillin "allergy" history, although often inaccurate, is not a benign finding at hospital admission. Subjects with a penicillin "allergy" history spend significantly more time in the hospital. Subjects with a penicillin "allergy" history are exposed to significantly more antibiotics previously associated with C difficile and VRE. Drug "allergies" in general, but most those notably to penicillin, are associated with increased hospital use and increased C difficile, MRSA, and VRE prevalence.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - Trends in orthopaedic antimicrobial prophylaxis in the UK between 2005 and 2011.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial prophylaxis remains the most powerful tool used to reduce infection rates in orthopaedics but the choice of antibiotic is complex. The aim of this study was to examine trends in antimicrobial prophylaxis in orthopaedic surgery involving the insertion of metalwork between 2005 and 2011. METHODS: Two questionnaires (one in 2008 and one in 2011) were sent to all National Health Service trusts in the UK using the Freedom of Information Act. RESULTS: In total, 87% of trusts that perform orthopaedic surgery responded. The use of cefuroxime more than halved between 2005 and 2011 from 80% to 36% and 78% to 26% in elective surgery and trauma surgery respectively. Combination therapy with flucloxacillin and gentamicin rose from 1% to 32% in elective and 1% to 34% in trauma surgery. Other increasingly popular regimes include teicoplanin and gentamicin (1% to 10% in elective, 1% to 6% in trauma) and co-amoxiclav (3% to 8% in elective, 4% to 14% in trauma). The majority of changes occurred between 2008 and 2010. Over half (56%) of the trusts stated that Clostridium difficile was the main reason for changing regimes. CONCLUSIONS: In 2008 a systematic review involving 11,343 participants failed to show a difference in surgical site infections when comparing different antimicrobial prophylaxis regimes in orthopaedic surgery. Concerns over C difficile and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus have influenced antimicrobial regimes in both trauma and elective surgery. Teicoplanin would be an appropriate choice for antimicrobial prophylaxis in both trauma and elective units but this is not reflected in its current level of popularity.
TI  - Growth-Inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in Asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. METHOD: A microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the test materials against the organisms. RESULTS: delta-3-Carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium difficile ATCC 9689, Clostridium paraputrificum ATCC 25780, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 and Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 0.18-0.70 mg/mL) except for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 13311 (MIC, 2.94 mg/mL). The MIC of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/mL against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against C. difficile (0.70 mg/mL); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/mL) and 4 (5.80 mg/mL) against C. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/mL), 4 (12.0 mg/mL), and 7 (0.70 mg/mL) against C. perfringens); compound 1 against E. coli (7.20 mg/mL) and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (12.0 mg/mL). Overall, all of the constituents were less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (MIC, 0.063-0.25 mg/ mL). The lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium Clostridium butyricum ATCC 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (B. fragilis and E. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. Beneficial Gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful Gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria was not observed. Scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. CONCLUSION: A. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
TI  - Structures of a bifunctional cell wall hydrolase CwlT containing a novel bacterial lysozyme and an NlpC/P60 DL-endopeptidase.
AB  - Tn916-like conjugative transposons carrying antibiotic resistance genes are found in a diverse range of bacteria. Orf14 within the conjugation module encodes a bifunctional cell wall hydrolase CwlT that consists of an N-terminal bacterial lysozyme domain (N-acetylmuramidase, bLysG) and a C-terminal NlpC/P60 domain (gamma-d-glutamyl-l-diamino acid endopeptidase) and is expected to play an important role in the spread of the transposons. We determined the crystal structures of CwlT from two pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus Mu50 (SaCwlT) and Clostridium difficile 630 (CdCwlT). These structures reveal that NlpC/P60 and LysG domains are compact and conserved modules, connected by a short flexible linker. The LysG domain represents a novel family of widely distributed bacterial lysozymes. The overall structure and the active site of bLysG bear significant similarity to other members of the glycoside hydrolase family 23 (GH23), such as the g-type lysozyme (LysG) and Escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase MltE. The active site of bLysG contains a unique structural and sequence signature (DxxQSSES+S) that is important for coordinating a catalytic water. Molecular modeling suggests that the bLysG domain may recognize glycan in a similar manner to MltE. The C-terminal NlpC/P60 domain contains a conserved active site (Cys-His-His-Tyr) that appears to be specific to murein tetrapeptide. Access to the active site is likely regulated by isomerism of a side chain atop the catalytic cysteine, allowing substrate entry or product release (open state), or catalysis (closed state).
TI  - Biological evaluation of benzothiazole ethyl urea inhibitors of bacterial type II topoisomerases.
AB  - The type II topoisomerases DNA gyrase (GyrA/GyrB) and topoisomerase IV (ParC/ParE) are well-validated targets for antibacterial drug discovery. Because of their structural and functional homology, these enzymes are amenable to dual targeting by a single ligand. In this study, two novel benzothiazole ethyl urea-based small molecules, designated compound A and compound B, were evaluated for their biochemical, antibacterial, and pharmacokinetic properties. The two compounds inhibited the ATPase activity of GyrB and ParE with 50% inhibitory concentrations of <0.1 mug/ml. Prevention of DNA supercoiling by DNA gyrase was also observed. Both compounds potently inhibited the growth of a range of bacterial organisms, including staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, Clostridium difficile, and selected Gram-negative respiratory pathogens. MIC90s against clinical isolates ranged from 0.015 mug/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae to 0.25 mug/ml for Staphylococcus aureus. No cross-resistance with common drug resistance phenotypes was observed. In addition, no synergistic or antagonistic interactions between compound A or compound B and other antibiotics, including the topoisomerase inhibitors novobiocin and levofloxacin, were detected in checkerboard experiments. The frequencies of spontaneous resistance for S. aureus were <2.3 x 10(-10) with compound A and <5.8 x 10(-11) with compound B at concentrations equivalent to 8x the MICs. These values indicate a multitargeting mechanism of action. The pharmacokinetic properties of both compounds were profiled in rats. Following intravenous administration, compound B showed approximately 3-fold improvement over compound A in terms of both clearance and the area under the concentration-time curve. The measured oral bioavailability of compound B was 47.7%.
TI  - A systematic literature review and meta-analysis of factors associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization at time of hospital or intensive care unit admission.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Screening for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in high-risk patients is a legislative mandate in 9 US states and has been adopted by many hospitals. Definitions of high risk differ among hospitals and state laws. A systematic evaluation of factors associated with colonization is lacking. We performed a systematic review of the literature to assess factors associated with MRSA colonization at hospital admission. DESIGN: We searched MEDLINE from 1966 to 2012 for articles comparing MRSA colonized and noncolonized patients on hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Data were extracted using a standardized instrument. Meta-analyses were performed to identify factors associated with MRSA colonization. RESULTS: We reviewed 4,381 abstracts; 29 articles met inclusion criteria (n = 76,913 patients). MRSA colonization at hospital admission was associated with recent prior hospitalization (odds ratio [OR], 2.4 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.3-4.7]; P < .01), nursing home exposure (OR, 3.8 [95% CI, 2.3-6.3]; P < .01), and history of exposure to healthcare-associated pathogens (MRSA carriage: OR, 8.0 [95% CI, 4.2-15.1]; Clostridium difficile infection: OR, 3.4 [95% CI, 2.2-5.3]; vancomycin-resistant Enterococci carriage: OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 2.5-4.0]; P < .01 for all). Select comorbidities were associated with MRSA colonization (congestive heart failure, diabetes, pulmonary disease, immunosuppression, and renal failure; P < .01 for all), while others were not (human immunodeficiency virus, cirrhosis, and malignancy). ICU admission was not associated with an increased risk of MRSA colonization (OR, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.6-1.8]; P = .87). CONCLUSIONS: MRSA colonization on hospital admission was associated with healthcare contact, previous healthcare-associated pathogens, and select comorbid conditions. ICU admission was not associated with MRSA colonization, although this is commonly used in state mandates for MRSA screening. Infection prevention programs utilizing targeted MRSA screening may consider our results to define patients likely to have MRSA colonization.
TI  - Cyclodextrin derivatives as anti-infectives.
AB  - Cyclodextrin derivatives can be utilized as anti-infectives with pore-forming proteins as the targets. The highly efficient selection of potent inhibitors was achieved because per-substituted cyclodextrins have the same symmetry as the target pores. Inhibitors of several bacterial toxins produced by Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, and Clostridium difficile were identified from a library of approximately 200 CD derivatives. It was demonstrated that multi-targeted inhibitors can be found using this approach and could be utilized for the development of broad-spectrum drugs against various pathogens.

TI  - One-day point prevalence of emerging bacterial pathogens in a nationwide sample of 62 German hospitals in 2012 and comparison with the results of the one-day point prevalence of 2010.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is an emerging problem worldwide. To combat multidrug resistant organisms (MRDOs) networks of care providers have been established in all states in Germany. The HICARE-network, a project to combat MRDOs, founded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, has published data from 2010 of a voluntary, German-wide, multicenter point-prevalence survey in 2011 conducted in collaboration with the German Society of Hospital Hygiene. The aim of the present survey was the re-evaluation of the situation in 2012. METHOD: The survey was conducted as a voluntary, anonymous, point-prevalence in May 2012 using routine data of microbiological diagnostics of the hospitals. As in the former survey of 2010 it was differentiated between primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals and only data from intensive care units, surgical and medical wards were collected. Based on the survey form used in 2010, an updated version was used including more pathogens and corrected issues observed in the former survey. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (total as well as separated in hospital-acquired (HA), community-acquired (CA) and lifestock-associated (LA) MRSA), vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA/GRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis resp. Enterococcus faecium (VR-E. faecalis resp. VR-E. faecium), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-building (ESBL) E. coli (ESBL-EC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP), multiresistant Acinetobacter spp. (MAB), multiresistant Pseudomonas spp. (MRP), carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) as well as Clostridium difficile (CD) infections and severe infections requiring ICU-treatment were included in the survey along with additional data on screening strategy, the equipment with infection control staff and possible confounders. RESULTS: Out of 1,550 hospitals asked to participate, 62 returned data (4%). Data from 56 hospitals including primary (26), secondary (20) and tertiary (10) care hospitals were analyzable (3.6%). The most frequently reported organisms were MRSA 1.53% [CI95: 1.32-1.75], followed by CDAD 1.30% [CI95: 1.11-1.50], ESBL-EC 0.97% [CI95: 0.80-1.14], and ESBL-KP 0.27% [CI95: 0.18-0.36], regardless of the level of care. Prevalence of MRDOs depended on the level of care and on the type of ward, as expected. Overall prevalence was highest on intensive care wards, and prevalences were remarkably high on medical wards compared to surgical wards. All tertiary care providers employed their own infection control nurse, while only ~70% of the secondary and primary care hospitals did. Surprisingly, in two of the ten participating tertiary care providers neither an internal nor an external infection control doctor was available. DISCUSSION: With more than 13,000 patients in 56 hospitals distributed all over Germany, the survey included more than three times as many patients as the first survey and therefore not only adds valuable information about the epidemiology of emerging nosocomial pathogens, but also helps to raise awareness of the problem of antibacterial resistance in Germany. The prevalences reported seem to be comparable to the results of the former survey and of other surveys published. Some hospitals reported to have no infection control personnel available at all. This statement is in line with another survey published in this issue.
TI  - A severe case of rat lungworm disease in Hawa'i.
AB  - A 23-year-old man living on the island of Hawa'i developed a life threatening case of eosinophilic meningitis caused by infection with Angiostrongylus cantonensis (rat lungworm disease: RLWD). He was comatose for 3 months, incurring brain and nerve damage sufficiently extensive that he was not expected to recover. The case was complicated by secondary infections of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, and pneumonia, which resulted in an empyema requiring a thoracoscopy and decortication. He was treated with prednisone, mebendozal, and pain medication for RLWD, and antibiotics and antifungal medications for the secondary infections. The administration of herbal supplements was requested by the family and approved, and these were administered through a gastric tube. Less than a month after being declared in a persistent vegetative state the man was able to talk, eat, and had regained some muscle functions. After release from the hospital he continued the use of supplements and received treatments of intravenous vitamin therapy. Four years after onset of the illness he is able to ride a bicycle, is a part time student, plays guitar, and is fluent in two foreign languages. RLWD is an emerging tropical disease of growing importance in Hawa'i.
TI  - The anticancer drug tirapazamine has antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Rapidly increasing bacterial resistance to existing therapies creates an urgent need for the development of new antibacterials. Tirapazamine (TPZ, 3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine 1,4 dioxide) is a prodrug undergoing clinical trials for various types of cancers. In this study, we showed that TPZ has antibacterial activity, particularly at low oxygen levels. With Escherichia coli, TPZ was bactericidal under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Escherichia coli mutants deficient in homologous recombination were hypersusceptible to TPZ, suggesting that drug toxicity may be due to DNA damage. Moreover, E. coli strains deleted for genes encoding putative reductases were resistant to TPZ, implying that these enzymes are responsible for conversion of the prodrug to a toxic compound. Fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli strains were as susceptible to TPZ as a wild-type strain. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were also susceptible to TPZ (MIC = 0.5 mug mL(-1) ), as were pathogenic strains of Clostridium difficile (MIC = 7.5 ng mL(-1) ). TPZ may merit additional study as a broad-spectrum antibacterial, particularly for anaerobes.
TI  - The identification and epidemiology of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile in patient rooms and the ward environment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research has indicated that the environment may play an important role in the transmission of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile in healthcare facilities. Despite the significance of this finding, few data exist from longitudinal studies investigating MRSA and C. difficile contamination, concurrently, in both patient rooms and the general ward environment. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of MRSA and C. difficile contamination in patient rooms and the ward environment and identify risk factors associated with a surface being contaminated with these pathogens. METHODS: Environmental surfaces in patient rooms and the general environment in the medical and surgical wards of a community hospital were sampled six times over a 15 week period. Sterile electrostatic cloths were used for sampling and information pertaining to the surface sampled was recorded. MRSA isolates and C. difficile specimens were obtained from hospitalized patients.Enrichment culture was performed and spa typing or ribotyping was conducted for MRSA or C. difficile, respectively. Exact logistic regression models were constructed to examine risk factors associated with MRSA and C. difficile contamination. RESULTS: Sixteen (41%) patient rooms had >/= 1 surfaces contaminated with MRSA and/or C. difficile. For 218 surfaces investigated, 3.2% and 6.4% were contaminated with MRSA or C. difficile, respectively. Regression models indicated that surfaces in rooms exposed to a C. difficile patient had significantly increased odds of being contaminated with C. difficile, compared to surfaces in unexposed patient rooms. Additionally, compared to plastic surfaces, cork surfaces had significantly increased odds of being contaminated with C. difficile. For 236 samples collected from the ward environment, MRSA and C. difficile were recovered from 2.5% and 5.9% of samples, respectively. Overall, the majority of MRSA and C. difficile strains were molecularly identified as spa type 2/t002 (84.6%, n = 11) and ribotype 078 (50%, n = 14), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patient rooms and the ward environment, specific materials and locations were identified as being contaminated with MRSA or C. difficile. These sites should be cleaned and disinfected with increased vigilance to help limit the transmission and dissemination of MRSA and C. difficile within the hospital.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of SMT19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against Clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  - The comparative in vitro activity of SMT19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined Clostridium difficile strains, 174 Gram-positive and 136 Gram-negative intestinal anaerobes, and 40 Gram-positive aerobes. SMT19969 was one dilution more active against C. difficile isolates (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; MIC90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. SMT19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes, especially the Bacteroides fragilis group species, than vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that SMT19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. SMT19969 showed limited activity against other Gram-positive anaerobes, including Bifidobacteria species, Eggerthella lenta, Finegoldia magna, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with MIC90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. Clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with C. innocuum being susceptible (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) and C. ramosum and C. perfringens being nonsusceptible (MIC90, >512 mug/ml). Activity against Lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; MIC90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and streptococci) showed high SMT19969 MIC90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).
TI  - Reducing health care-associated infections: patients want to be engaged and learn about infection prevention.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are common in health care-associated infection (HAI). The aim of this study was to examine patient's willingness to learn about MDROs and HAIs and their preferred ways of education about MDRO HAIs. METHODS: Interviewer-administered questionnaire at a tertiary care academic medical center. We recruited a sample of 100 adult patients who had HAI and were placed in contact precautions. RESULTS: Ninety-six percent of patients had heard of MDROs. Ninety-eight percent of patients thought that their involvement in learning about MDROs was very important or important. Most of the patients thought that receiving information about MDROs would probably or definitely help them to make choices that would improve their health care. Patients expressed interest in more than 1 form of educational material: 70% chose written material, 57% verbal information, 53% an informational video, and 50% Internet-based material. Patients with a higher level of education were more likely to prefer written material. Patients emphasized simple language and incorporation of actual patient stories. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized patients with MDROs in our study believed that involvement on their part was important. Individuals' level of education affected their preference regarding choice of educational material, but most patients prefered receiving written or verbal information. Patient preferences must be incorporated into education to increase engagement for prevention of MDROs and HAIs.
TI  - Horizontal gene transfer in human pathogens.
AB  - Horizontal gene transfer has a tremendous impact on the genome plasticity, adaptation and evolution of bacteria. Horizontally transferred mobile genetic elements are involved in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, thus contributing to the emergence of novel "superbugs". This review provides update on various mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer and examines how horizontal gene transfer contributes to the evolution of pathogenic bacteria. Special focus is paid to the role horizontal gene transfer plays in pathogenicity of the emerging human pathogens: hypervirulent Clostridium difficile and Escherichia coli (including the most recent haemolytic uraemic syndrome outbreak strain) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which have been associated with largest outbreaks of infection recently.
TI  - Major infection events over 5 years: how is media coverage influencing online information needs of health care professionals and the public?
AB  - BACKGROUND: The last decade witnessed turbulent events in public health. Emerging infections, increase of antimicrobial resistance, deliberately released threats and ongoing battles with common illnesses were amplified by the spread of disease through increased international travel. The Internet has dramatically changed the availability of information about outbreaks; however, little research has been done in comparing the online behavior of public and professionals around the same events and the effect of media coverage of outbreaks on information needs. OBJECTIVE: To investigate professional and public online information needs around major infection outbreaks and correlate these with media coverage. Questions include (1) How do health care professionals' online needs for public health and infection control information differ from those of the public?, (2) Does dramatic media coverage of outbreaks contribute to the information needs among the public?, and (3) How do incidents of diseases and major policy events relate to the information needs of professionals? METHODS: We used three longitudinal time-based datasets from mid-2006 until end of 2010: (1) a unique record of professional online behavior on UK infection portals: National electronic Library of Infection and National Resource of Infection Control (NeLI/NRIC), (2) equivalent public online information needs (Google Trends), and (3) relevant media coverage (LexisNexis). Analysis of NeLI/NRIC logs identified the highest interest around six major infectious diseases: Clostridium difficile (C difficile)/Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), tuberculosis, meningitis, norovirus, and influenza. After pre-processing, the datasets were analyzed and triangulated with each other. RESULTS: Public information needs were more static, following the actual disease occurrence less than those of professionals, whose needs increase with public health events (eg, MRSA/C difficile) and the release of major national policies or important documents. Media coverage of events resulted in major public interest (eg, the 2007/2008 UK outbreak of C difficile/MRSA). An exception was norovirus, showing a seasonal pattern for both public and professionals, which matched the periodic disease occurrence. Meningitis was a clear example of a disease with heightened media coverage tending to focus on individual and celebrity cases. Influenza was a major concern during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak creating massive public interest in line with the spring and autumn peaks in cases; although in autumn 2009, there was no corresponding increase in media coverage. Online resources play an increasing role in fulfilling professionals' and public information needs. CONCLUSIONS: Significant factors related to a surge of professional interest around a disease were typically key publications and major policy changes. Public interests seem more static and correlate with media influence but to a lesser extent than expected. The only exception was norovirus, exhibiting online public and professional interest correlating with seasonal occurrences of the disease. Public health agencies with responsibility for risk communication of public health events, in particular during outbreaks and emergencies, need to collaborate with media in order to ensure the coverage is high quality and evidence-based, while professionals' information needs remain mainly fulfilled by online open access to key resources.
TI  - [Multiresistant Organisms.]
AB  - Infections caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms are becoming more frequently in daily practice and are associated with an increase in duration of treatment and mortality. During the past decades, particular attention in the field of MDR pathogens was paid to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For the last years, MDR gram-negative organisms, with e.g., "extended-spectrum beta-lactamases" (ESBL), have been gaining a growing significance. Currently, treatment of infections with these organisms displays a greater challenge for the clinician compared to MRSA infections. This review illustrates the emergence of antibiotic resistance, provides information on the most important gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, Clostridium difficile and measures to prevent their further spread.
TI  - Nutritional and microbial analysis of bully sticks and survey of opinions about pet treats.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to measure the caloric density of bully sticks, to analyze the bully sticks for bacterial contamination, and to assess owner opinions about these and other pet treat products. Mean caloric density was 15 kcal/inch (38 kcal/cm) [range: 9 to 22 kcal/inch (23 to 56 kcal/cm), 2.96 to 3.07 kcal/g]. Of 26 bully sticks that were tested for bacterial contamination 1 (4%) was contaminated with Clostridium difficile, 1 was contaminated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and 1 with a tetracycline resistant Escherichia coli.

TI  - Ceftaroline fosamil: a review of its use in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil (Zinforo, Teflaro), is an advanced-generation, parenteral cephalosporin with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ceftaroline has demonstrated a low potential for the selection of resistance in vitro for drug-resistant Gram-positive organisms, including MRSA, as well as for Gram-negative respiratory pathogens. In pivotal phase III studies, intravenous ceftaroline fosamil demonstrated noninferiority to intravenous vancomycin plus aztreonam in patients hospitalized with complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTIs) and intravenous ceftriaxone in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) risk class III or IV]; however, patients with CAP admitted to the intensive care unit were not evaluated. Ceftaroline fosamil was generally well tolerated in these trials, with an adverse event profile similar to that of other cephalosporins. Diarrhoea was the most commonly reported adverse event; however, the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea with ceftaroline fosamil appeared to be low. Potential limitations of the drug include the lack of an oral formulation and the requirement for twice-daily administration. Nonetheless, ceftaroline fosamil represents an attractive option (either alone or in combination with other agents) for the initial empirical treatment of patients hospitalized with cSSTIs (including those with suspected MRSA infection) or CAP (PORT risk class III or IV) who require intravenous antimicrobial therapy. As with all antibacterial agents, ceftaroline fosamil should be used in accordance with good antimicrobial stewardship.
TI  - Clostridium difficile infections in South East Scotland: mortality and recurrence in a region without PCR ribotype 027.
AB  - Three hundred and thirty-five patients with laboratory-confirmed Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) were studied for epidemiological features, clinical presentation and laboratory markers. They were followed up for 1 year to determine recurrence and mortality. Four hundred and thirty-two episodes were recorded. One year mortality was 41.8 % of which CDI was listed on 20 % of the death certificates. One year recurrence rate was 22.9 %. PCR ribotype 001 was the commonest epidemiological type and ribotype 027 was not detected. High total leucocyte count and low albumin were significantly associated with mortality, as was the absence of a GI-invasive procedure in the 12 weeks preceding CDI diagnosis, probably due to patients being unfit for the procedure. No association with acid suppressants, deletion in the tdcC anti-sigma factor or vancomycin-resistant enterococcus/methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus co-infection was detected. One year mortality was higher in patients who developed recurrent infections (P<0.001). Differences in ribotype were observed in 2.3 %, 11.11 %, 20 % and 32.4 % isolates with time intervals between sampling of 0-20, 21-40, 41-60 and >60 days, respectively, suggesting that the arbitrary cut-off of 28 days to call a repeat infection a reinfection may not be correct in some cases.
TI  - The agr locus regulates virulence and colonization genes in Clostridium difficile 027.
AB  - The transcriptional regulator AgrA, a member of the LytTR family of proteins, plays a key role in controlling gene expression in some Gram-positive pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. AgrA is encoded by the agrACDB global regulatory locus, and orthologues are found within the genome of most Clostridium difficile isolates, including the epidemic lineage 027/BI/NAP1. Comparative RNA sequencing of the wild type and otherwise isogenic agrA null mutant derivatives of C. difficile R20291 revealed a network of approximately 75 differentially regulated transcripts at late exponential growth phase, including many genes associated with flagellar assembly and function, such as the major structural subunit, FliC. Other differentially regulated genes include several involved in bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) synthesis and toxin A expression. C. difficile 027 R20291 agrA mutant derivatives were poorly flagellated and exhibited reduced levels of colonization and relapses in the murine infection model. Thus, the agr locus likely plays a contributory role in the fitness and virulence potential of C. difficile strains in the 027/BI/NAP1 lineage.
TI  - Evaluation of the effect of oritavancin on Clostridium difficile spore germination, outgrowth and recovery.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Previous work suggests oritavancin may be inhibitory to Clostridium difficile spores. We have evaluated the effects of oritavancin exposure on C. difficile spore germination, outgrowth and recovery. METHODS: Germination and outgrowth of C. difficile spores exposed to different concentrations of oritavancin, vancomycin, or metronidazole (0.1-10 mg/L) were monitored at 0, 2, 4, 6, 24 and 48 h using phase-contrast microscopy. Recovery of antimicrobial-exposed spores was determined by viable counting on Brazier's modified CCEYL agar. Persistence of oritavancin activity on spores after washing was determined by measuring activity against a Staphylococcus aureus lawn. RESULTS: Oritavancin, vancomycin and metronidazole exposure did not prevent germination of phase-bright spores to phase-dark spores, but did inhibit further outgrowth into vegetative cells. The inhibitory effect of oritavancin persisted after washing, whereas the inhibitory effects of vancomycin and metronidazole did not. Oritavancin exposure affected spore recovery; fewer spores were recovered after washing following oritavancin exposure than vancomycin exposure. The extent of this effect was dependent on PCR ribotype, with recovery of ribotype 078 spores completely prevented, but recovery of ribotype 001 spores only slightly affected. Spores exposed to oritavancin, but not vancomycin, retained antimicrobial activity after washing, indicating adherence of oritavancin, but not vancomycin, to the spore surface CONCLUSIONS: Oritavancin may adhere to spores, potentially causing early inhibition of germinated cells, preventing subsequent vegetative outgrowth and spore recovery. This may prevent some recurrences of symptomatic C. difficile infection that are due to germination of residual spores following antibiotic therapy.
TI  - The role of the surface environment in healthcare-associated infections.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the evidence demonstrating the importance of contamination of hospital surfaces in the transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens and interventions scientifically demonstrated to reduce the levels of microbial contamination and decrease healthcare-associated infections. RECENT FINDINGS: The contaminated surface environment in hospitals plays an important role in the transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. (VRE), Clostridium difficile, Acinetobacter spp., and norovirus. Improved surface cleaning and disinfection can reduce transmission of these pathogens. 'No-touch' methods of room disinfection (i.e., devices which produce ultraviolet light or hydrogen peroxide) and 'self-disinfecting' surfaces (e.g., copper) also show promise to decrease contamination and reduce healthcare-associated infections. SUMMARY: Hospital surfaces are frequently contaminated with important healthcare-associated pathogens. Contact with the contaminated environment by healthcare personnel is equally as likely as direct contact with a patient to lead to contamination of the healthcare provider's hands or gloves that may result in patient-to-patient transmission of nosocomial pathogens. Admission to a room previously occupied by a patient with MRSA, VRE, Acinetobacter, or C. difficile increases the risk for the subsequent patient admitted to the room to acquire the pathogen. Improved cleaning and disinfection of room surfaces decreases the risk of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - Impact of electronic surveillance on isolation practices.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of an electronic surveillance system on isolation practices and rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). DESIGN: A pre-post test intervention. SETTING: Inpatient units (except psychiatry and labor and delivery) in 4 New York City hospitals. PATIENTS: All patients for whom isolation precautions were indicated, May 2009-December 2011. METHODS: Trained observers assessed isolation sign postings, availability of isolation carts, and staff use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Infection rates were obtained from the infection control department. Regression analyses were used to examine the association between the surveillance system, infection prevention practices, and MRSA infection rates. RESULTS: A total of 54,159 isolation days and 7,628 staff opportunities for donning PPE were observed over a 31-month period. Odds of having an appropriate sign posted were significantly higher after intervention than before intervention (odds ratio [OR], 1.10 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.01-1.20]). Relative to baseline, postintervention sign posting improved significantly for airborne and droplet precautions but not for contact precautions. Sign posting improved for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.23-1.86]; [Formula: see text]), Clostridium difficile (OR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.27-2.02]; [Formula: see text]), and Acinetobacter baumannii (OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.21-1.64]; [Formula: see text]) precautions but not for MRSA precautions (OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.89-1.39]; [Formula: see text]). Staff and visitor adherence to PPE remained low throughout the study but improved from 29.1% to 37.0% after the intervention (OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.01-1.29]). MRSA infection rates were not significantly different after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: An electronic surveillance system resulted in small but statistically significant improvements in isolation practices but no reductions in infection rates over the short term. Such innovations likely require considerable uptake time.
TI  - Prevalence of colonization and infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and of Clostridium difficile infection in Canadian hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in Canadian hospitals. DESIGN: National point prevalence survey in November 2010. SETTING: Canadian acute care hospitals with at least 50 beds. PATIENTS: Adult inpatients colonized or infected with MRSA or VRE or with CDI. METHODS: The prevalence (per 100 inpatients) of MRSA, VRE, and CDI was determined. Associations between prevalence and institutional characteristics and infection control policies were evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six hospitals (65% of those eligible) participated. The median (range) prevalence rates for MRSA and VRE colonization or infection and CDI were 4.2% (0%-22.1%), 0.5% (0%-13.1%), and 0.9% (0%-8.6%), respectively. Median MRSA and VRE infection rates were low (0.3% and 0%, respectively). MRSA, VRE, and CDI were thought to have been healthcare associated in 79%, 96%, and 84% of cases, respectively. In multivariable analysis, routine use of a private room for colonized/infected patients was associated with lower median MRSA infection rate (prevalence ratio [PR], 0.44 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.22-0.88]) and VRE prevalence (PR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.12-0.57]). Lower VRE rates were also associated with enhanced environmental cleaning (PR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.36-0.75]). Higher bed occupancy rates were associated with higher rates of CDI (PR, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01-1.03]). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first national prevalence estimates for MRSA, VRE, and CDI in Canadian hospitals. Certain infection prevention and control policies were found to be associated with prevalence and deserve further investigation.

TI  - Impact of intensive infection control team activities on the acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated disease.
AB  - The transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) is an emerging problem  in acute healthcare facilities. To reduce this transmission, we introduced intensive infection control team (ICT) activities and investigated the impact of their introduction. This study was conducted at a single teaching hospital from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2012. During the intervention period, all carbapenem use was monitored by the ICT, and doctors using carbapenems inappropriately were individually instructed. Information related to patients with newly identified MDROs was provided daily to the ICT and instructions on the appropriate infection control measures for MDROs were given immediately with continuous monitoring. The medical records of newly hospitalized patients were reviewed daily to check previous microbiological results and infection control intervention by the ICT was also performed for patients with a previous history of MDROs. Compared with the pre-intervention period, the antimicrobial usage density of carbapenems decreased significantly (28.5 vs. 17.8 defined daily doses/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001) and the frequency of use of sanitary items, especially the use of aprons, increased significantly (710 vs 1854 pieces/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001). The number of cases with hospital-acquired MRSA (0.66 vs. 0.29 cases/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001), hospital-acquired drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.23 vs. 0.06 cases/1000 inpatient days; p = 0.006) and nosocomial Clostridium difficile-associated disease (0.47 vs. 0.11 cases/1000 inpatient days; p < 0.001) decreased significantly during the intervention period. Our study showed that proactive and continuous ICT interventions were effective for reduction of MDRO transmission.

TI  - [Antibiotic-associated diarrhea in clinical practice].
AB  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is considered to mean at least 3 shapeless stool episodes within 2 or more consecutive days when using antibacterial agents. Due to the fact that antibiotics are used most commonly to treat many diseases, AAD is one of the topical problems for different clinical specialists. There has recently been increased interest in this condition due to its higher morbidity and mortality rates and the emergence of novel treatment-resistant virulent strains of Clostridium difficile 027 and 078/126. The paper discusses the possible risk of developing AAD depending on the class of the antibiotic used, as well as the mechanisms of its development. Infectious diarrhea most frequently results from bacterial overgrowth due to that the obligate intestinal microflora is suppressed by antibacterial drugs. C. difficile, Clostridium perfringers, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella oxytoca, and Candida spp. are etiological factors in the development of this diarrhea. The severest intestinal lesions include pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) caused by C. difficile. The clinical and endoscopic picture and methods for the diagnosis and treatment of PMC are described. Therapy for this menacing condition is traditionally based on the use of metronidazole and vancomycin. In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the new drug fidaxomycin whose superiority over vancomycin has been demonstrated by a recurrence criterion. The paper discusses in detail other treatment options, including the use of probiotics.
TI  - Has improved hand hygiene compliance reduced the risk of hospital-acquired infections among hospitalized patients in Ontario? Analysis of publicly reported patient safety data from 2008 to 2011.
AB  - DESIGN: Prospective, observational, ecological, time series, cross-sectional study examining the association between hand hygiene compliance (HHC) rates and the incidence of hospital-acquired infections. SETTING: Acute care hospitals (N = 166) located in the province of Ontario, Canada. METHODS: All data were extracted from the Ontario patient safety indicator database ( http://www.hqontario.ca/public-reporting/patient-safety). Complete data were available for 166 acute care hospitals from October 1, 2008, to December 31, 2011. The rates of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) are reported monthly, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia quarterly, and HHC rates yearly. Trends and associations for each indicator were evaluated by ordinary least squares regression (HHC), zero-inflated Poisson regression (MRSA bacteremia), or Poisson regression (CDI). Dependent variables included in the regression analyses were extracted from the same database and included year, healthcare region, and type of hospital (teaching or small or large community). RESULTS: Compared to those in 2008, reported HHC rates improved every year both before and after environment/patient contact (range, 10.6%-25.3%). Compared to those in 2008, there was no corresponding change in the rates of MRSA bacteremia; however, the rates of CDI decreased in 2009 but were not statistically significantly decreased from baseline in either 2010 or 2011. No consistent association was demonstrated between changes in the rates of HHC and these two healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant improvements in reported rates of HHC among healthcare personnel in Ontario's hospitals, we could not demonstrate a positive ecological impact on rates of these two HAIs.
TI  - Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for hospital inpatients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The first publication of this review in Issue 3, 2005 included studies up to November 2003. This update adds studies to December 2006 and focuses on application of a new method for meta-analysis of interrupted time series studies and application of new Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Risk of Bias criteria to all studies in the review, including those studies in the previously published version. The aim of the review is to evaluate the impact of interventions from the perspective of antibiotic stewardship. The two objectives of antibiotic stewardship are first to ensure effective treatment for patients with bacterial infection and second support professionals and patients to reduce unnecessary use and minimize collateral damage. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effectiveness of professional interventions that, alone or in combination, are effective in antibiotic stewardship for hospital inpatients, to evaluate the impact of these interventions on reducing the incidence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens or Clostridium difficile infection and their impact on clinical outcome. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE from 1980 to December 2006 and the EPOC specialized register in July 2007 and February 2009 and bibliographies of retrieved articles. The main comparison is between interventions that had a restrictive element and those that were purely persuasive. Restrictive interventions were implemented through restriction of the freedom of prescribers to select some antibiotics. Persuasive interventions used one or more of the following methods for changing professional behaviour: dissemination of educational resources, reminders, audit and feedback, or educational outreach. Restrictive interventions could contain persuasive elements. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCT), controlled before-after (CBA) and interrupted time series studies (ITS). Interventions included any professional or structural interventions as defined by EPOC. The intervention had to include a component that aimed to improve antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients, either by increasing effective treatment or by reducing unnecessary treatment. The results had to include interpretable data about the effect of the intervention on antibiotic prescribing or microbial outcomes or relevant clinical outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors extracted data and assessed quality. We performed meta-regression of ITS studies to compare the results of persuasive and restrictive interventions. Persuasive interventions advised physicians about how to prescribe or gave them feedback about how they prescribed. Restrictive interventions put a limit on how they prescribed; for example, physicians had to have approval from an infection specialist in order to prescribe an antibiotic. We standardized the results of some ITS studies so that they are on the same scale (percent change in outcome), thereby facilitating comparisons of different interventions. To do this, we used the change in level and change in slope to estimate the effect size with increasing time after the intervention (one month, six months, one year, etc) as the percent change in level at each time point. We did not extrapolate beyond the end of data collection after the intervention. The meta-regression was performed using standard weighted linear regression with the standard errors of the coefficients adjusted where necessary. MAIN RESULTS: For this update we included 89 studies that reported 95 interventions. Of the 89 studies, 56 were ITSs (of which 4 were controlled ITSs), 25 were RCT (of which 5 were cluster-RCTs), 5 were CBAs and 3 were CCTs (of which 1 was a cluster-CCT).Most (80/95, 84%) of the interventions targeted the antibiotic prescribed (choice of antibiotic, timing of first dose and route of administration). The remaining 15 interventions aimed to change exposure of patients to antibiotics by targeting the decision to treat or the duration of treatment. Reliable data about impact on antibiotic prescribing data were available for 76 interventions (44 persuasive, 24 restrictive and 8 structural). For the persuasive interventions, the median change in antibiotic prescribing was 42.3% for the ITSs, 31.6% for the controlled ITSs, 17.7% for the CBAs, 3.5% for the cluster-RCTs and 24.7% for the RCTs. The restrictive interventions had a median effect size of 34.7% for the ITSs, 17.1% for the CBAs and 40.5% for the RCTs. The structural interventions had a median effect of 13.3% for the RCTs and 23.6% for the cluster-RCTs. Data about impact on microbial outcomes were available for 21 interventions but only 6 of these also had reliable data about impact on antibiotic prescribing.Meta-analysis of 52 ITS studies was used to compare restrictive versus purely persuasive interventions. Restrictive interventions had significantly greater impact on prescribing outcomes at one month (32%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2% to 61%, P = 0.03) and on microbial outcomes at 6 months (53%, 95% CI 31% to 75%, P = 0.001) but there were no significant differences at 12 or 24 months. Interventions intended to decrease excessive prescribing were associated with reduction in Clostridium difficile infections and colonization or infection with aminoglycoside- or cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Meta-analysis of clinical outcomes showed that four interventions intended to increase effective prescribing for pneumonia were associated with significant reduction in mortality (risk ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.97), whereas nine interventions intended to decrease excessive prescribing were not associated with significant increase in mortality (risk ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results show that interventions to reduce excessive antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients can reduce antimicrobial resistance or hospital-acquired infections, and interventions to increase effective prescribing can improve clinical outcome. This update provides more evidence about unintended clinical consequences of interventions and about the effect of interventions to reduce exposure of patients to antibiotics. The meta-analysis supports the use of restrictive interventions when the need is urgent, but suggests that persuasive and restrictive interventions are equally effective after six months.
TI  - The antimicrobial effects of helium and helium-air plasma on Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Healthcare-associated infections (HCAI) affect 5-10% of acute hospital admissions. Environmental decontamination is an important component of all strategies to prevent HCAI as many bacterial causes survive and persist in the environment, which serve as ongoing reservoirs of infection. Current approaches such as cleaning with detergents and the use of chemical disinfectant are suboptimal. We assessed the efficacy of helium and helium-air plasma in killing Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile on a glass surface and studied the impact on bacterial cells using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Both plasma types exhibited bactericidal effects on Staph. aureus (log3.6 - >log7), with increased activity against methicillin-resistant strains, but had a negligible effect on Cl. difficile spores (<1log). AFM demonstrated cell surface disruption. The addition of air increased the microbicidal activity of the plasma and decreased the exposure time required for an equivalent log reduction. Further evaluation of cold plasma systems is warranted with, for example, different bacteria and on surfaces more reminiscent of the health care environment as this approach has potential as an effective decontaminant. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Many bacterial causes of healthcare infection can survive in the inanimate environment for lengthy periods and be transmitted to patients. Furthermore, current methods of environmental decontamination such as detergents, chemical disinfectants or gaseous fumigation are suboptimal for a variety of reasons. We assessed the efficacy of helium and helium-air plasma as a decontaminant and demonstrated a significant reduction in bacterial counts of Staphylococcus aureus on a glass surface. Atomic force microscopy morphologically confirmed the impact on bacterial cells. This approach warrants further study as an alternative to current options for hospital hygiene.
TI  - Site-directed mutations in the lanthipeptide mutacin 1140.
AB  - The oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans, strain JH1140, produces the antibiotic mutacin 1140. Mutacin 1140 belongs to a group of antibiotics called lanthipeptides. More specifically, mutacin 1140 is related to the epidermin type A(I) lanthipeptides. Mutagenesis experiments of this group of lanthipeptides have been primarily restricted to the posttranslationally modified meso-lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine residues. Site-directed mutagenesis of the core peptide of mutacin 1140 was performed using the suicide vector pVA891. Substitutions of the N-terminal residue, the charged residue in the hinge region, and residues in ring A and intertwined rings C and D were investigated. A truncation and insertion of residues in ring A and intertwined rings C and D were also performed to determine whether or not they would alter the antimicrobial activity of the producing strain. Bioassays revealed that five of 14 mutants studied had improved antimicrobial activity against the indicator strain Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240. MICs against Streptococcus mutans UA159, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 27336, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Clostridium difficile UK1, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240 were determined for three mutacin 1140 variants that had the most significant increases in bioactivity in the M. luteus bioassay. This mutagenesis study of the epidermin group of lanthipeptides shows that antimicrobial activity can be significantly improved.
TI  - Longitudinal study of Clostridium difficile and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus associated with pigs from weaning through to the end of processing.
AB  - There has been a recent increase in community-associated infections linked to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile. It is established that both pathogens can be recovered from retail pork, although it is unclear to what degree contamination is acquired at the farm in comparison to that acquired during processing. To address this gap, the following study reports on the carriage of MRSA and C. difficile on pigs from birth through to the end of processing. C. difficile was isolated from 28 (93%) of 30 pigs at 1 day of age, but prevalence declined sharply to 1 of 26 by market age (188 days). MRSA prevalence peaked at 74 days of age, with 19 (68%) of 28 pigs testing positive, but declined to 3 of 26 at 150 days of age, with no pig being detected as positive at market age. At the processing facility, C. difficile was isolated from the holding area, with a single carcass testing positive for the pathogen at preevisceration. MRSA was primarily isolated from nasal swabs with 8 (31%) carcasses testing positive at postbleed, which increased to 14 (54%) positive at postscald tanks. Only one carcass (sampled at postbleed) tested positive for MRSA, with no recovery of the pathogen from environmental samples taken. C. difficile ribotype 078 predominated in the longitudinal portion of the study, accounting for all of the 68 isolates recovered from pigs. Only three C. difficile isolates, which were identified as ribotype 078, were recovered at the slaughterhouse. MRSA spa type 539 (t034) predominated in pigs on the farm and samples taken at the slaughterhouse, accounting for 80% of all isolates recovered. The study demonstrated that both C. difficile and MRSA acquired on the farm can be transferred through to processing, although no evidence for significant cross-contamination between carcasses or the slaughterhouse environment was evident.
TI  - Rapid hospital room decontamination using ultraviolet (UV) light with a nanostructured UV-reflective wall coating.
AB  - We tested the ability of an ultraviolet C (UV-C)-reflective wall coating to reduce the time necessary to decontaminate a room using a UV-C-emitting device (Tru-D SmartUVC). The reflective wall coating provided the following time reductions for decontamination: for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, from 25 minutes 13 seconds to 5 minutes 3 seconds ([Formula: see text]), and for Clostridium difficile spores, from 43 minutes 42 seconds to 9 minutes 24 seconds ([Formula: see text]).
TI  - Chlorhexidine to maintain cleanliness of laryngoscope handles: an audit and laboratory study.
AB  - CONTEXT: Laryngoscope handles are a potential vector for infection transmission and require adequate decontamination. OBJECTIVE: To establish an effective cleaning regimen for laryngoscope handles. DESIGN: Three laboratory studies and an audit cycle. SETTING: The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn, UK. MATERIALS: Twenty Heine laryngoscope handles. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty laryngoscope handles were contaminated with microbial broth and then disinfected with chemical wipes, either using Sani-Cloth CHG 2% (chlorhexidine 2%/alcohol 70%) or Tuffie 5 wipes. This was repeated with an interval of 24 h between cleaning and contamination. A further experiment repeatedly re-contaminated the handles at varying time intervals after cleaning. The audit established the current level of contamination of laryngoscope handles within the hospital, and this was repeated following a change in cleaning protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacterial growth on agar plates was counted as the number of colony forming units. RESULTS: Both Sani-Cloth CHG 2% and Tuffie 5 wipes were effective against microorganisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, immediately following wiping (P = 0.002). However, the chlorhexidine wipes also had a residual effect such that after wiping, the handle remained sterile following further contamination and this effect persisted for 24 h. Audit following the introduction of this practice showed significant improvements in the incidence and extent of contamination compared with the previous disinfection practice (P<0.002). CONCLUSION: Decontamination with Sani-Cloth CHG 2% wipes confers additional advantages over routine autoclaving or handle disposal, due to a residual effect. Autoclaving handles may be desirable on a scheduled basis and if Clostridium difficile is encountered.
TI  - Understanding factors that impact on health care professionals' risk perceptions  and responses toward Clostridium difficile and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a structured literature review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is the most common health care-associated infection. Despite considerable efforts to prevent and manage C difficile, poor clinical practice and nonadherence to policy continues to compromise patient safety. Risk perception research is essential in gaining understanding about how health care professionals respond. METHODS: A structured literature review examined empirical evidence regarding health care professionals' risk perceptions and responses toward C difficile. Because of limited evidence available, the review was extended to include other health care-associated infections. Only studies related to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) could be identified. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included. Four were specific to C difficile and 7 to MRSA. All studies found that technical understanding of C difficile was poor and that staff were concerned about risks to patients and themselves. Technical understanding for MRSA, however, was good, and staff were less concerned about their own health. Information provision was perceived to be inadequate and untrustworthy, which included the media. Practice in most studies was poor. CONCLUSION: There is a need to build on the efforts of risk perception research from other disciplines to understand how health care professionals think and make decisions about C difficile. This can help inform the development of effective management and communication strategies to maximize the quality of care provided.

TI  - In vitro biological effects of two anti-diabetic medicinal plants used in Benin as folk medicine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracts from Polygonum senegalensis (Polygonaceae) and Pseudocedrela kotschyi (Meliaceae) are two important traditionally used medicinal plants in rural Benin to treat many diseases and notably type 2 diabetes. The aim of the study was to investigate the alpha-glucosidase inhibition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of those plants extract: Polygonum senegalensis leaves, and Pseudocedrela kotschyi root. METHODS: Hydro-alcoholic (50%) extracts were analyzed for their phytochemical content and tested for their inhibition potency on alpha-glucosidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Antioxidant activities were assessed using the DPPH, ORAC, FRAP and DCFH-DA (cell based) assay. Finally, the antibacterial activity was evaluated using MIC determination on four Gram-positive cocci (Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium difficile, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus), three Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and the yeast Candida albicans. RESULTS: Each extract presented significant alpha-glucosidase inhibition and antioxidant activities. Polygonum senegalensis leaf extracts were the most active in each in vitro assay with an IC50 = 1.5 mug/ml for alpha-glucosidase inhibition and an IC50 = 6.8 mug/ml for DPPH scavenging, - 4.5 mumol Fe II/g of dry matter - 9366 mumol Trolox / g DW - for FRAP and ORAC values, respectively. IC50 = 2.3 mug GA / ml for DCFH-DA assay. Concerning its antibacterial activity, a growth inhibitory effect was observed only against three Gram negative bacilli: B. subtilis, E. faecalis, S. aureus and the yeast C. albicans at high concentration. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the semi alcoholic extract of the two studied plants possess alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, antioxidant potency, and low antibacterial effect.
TI  - Rifaximin in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: is there a high risk for  development of antimicrobial resistance?
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic, nonfatal illness is commonly encountered in clinical practice; however, treatment options are limited and often ineffectual. Despite this, there is increasing evidence that bacterial overgrowth in the bowel (dysbiosis) may be an etiological factor in IBS. This has lead to studies in which the antibiotic agent rifaximin has been used to reduce the microbial burden in the bowel, to some extent alleviating the symptoms of IBS. Rifaximin is a member of the rifamycin class of antibiotics, which when administered orally has the distinctions of being gut specific coupled with poor systemic absorption, characteristics that are suggested to limit the development of bacterial resistance. The rifamycins are currently used to treat serious human diseases including tuberculosis, meningococcal disease, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile infections. The use of rifamycins in the treatment of these diseases is associated with the development of antibiotic resistance over time. When considering the importance of the rifamycins in the treatment of serious human diseases, the large number of patients affected by IBS, and the lack of scientific evidence available on the development of antibiotic resistance to rifaximin over the long-term when used in the gut, it is advisable that the use of rifaximin as a therapy for IBS should be limited to single, acute, short-term treatment.
TI  - American Journal of Gastroenterology Lecture: Intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) in treatment of C. difficile infection.
AB  - The vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. Starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. Moreover, vital interactions of the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. A perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). It has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic CDI, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. In addition, FMT has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-CDI diseases is in its infancy. More work needs to be done with FMT to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. There is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. Future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to cure disease. FMT is but the first step in this journey.
TI  - Approaching zero: temporal effects of a restrictive antibiotic policy on hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing coliforms and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - A restrictive antibiotic policy banning routine use of ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin was implemented in a 450-bed district general hospital following an educational campaign. Monthly consumption of nine antibiotics was monitored in defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1000 patient-occupied bed-days (1000 pt-bds) 9 months before until 16 months after policy introduction. Hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing coliform cases per month/1000 pt-bds were identified and reviewed throughout the hospital. Between the first and final 6 months of the study, average monthly consumption of ceftriaxone reduced by 95% (from 46.213 to 2.129 DDDs/1000 pt-bds) and that for ciprofloxacin by 72.5% (109.804 to 30.205 DDDs/1000 pt-bds). Over the same periods, hospital-acquisition rates for C. difficile reduced by 77% (2.398 to 0.549 cases/1000 pt-bds), for MRSA by 25% (1.187 to 0.894 cases/1000 pt-bds) and for ESBL-producing coliforms by 17% (1.480 to 1.224 cases/1000 pt-bds). Time-lag modelling confirmed significant associations between ceftriaxone and C. difficile cases at 1 month (correlation 0.83; P<0.005), and between ciprofloxacin and ESBL-producing coliform cases at 2 months (correlation 0.649; P=0.002). An audit performed 3 years after the policy showed sustained reduction in C. difficile rates (0.259 cases/1000 pt-bds), with additional decreases for MRSA (0.409 cases/1000 pt-bds) and ESBL-producing coliforms (0.809 cases/1000 pt-bds). In conclusion, banning two antibiotics resulted in an immediate and profound reduction in hospital-acquired C. difficile, with possible longer-term effects on MRSA and ESBL-producing coliform rates. Antibiotic stewardship is fundamental in the control of major hospital pathogens.
TI  - Sequencing of bacterial genomes: principles and insights into pathogenesis and development of antibiotics.
AB  - The impact of bacterial diseases on public health has become enormous, and is partly due to the increasing trend of antibiotic resistance displayed by bacterial pathogens. Sequencing of bacterial genomes has significantly improved our understanding about the biology of many bacterial pathogens as well as identification of novel antibiotic targets. Since the advent of genome sequencing two decades ago, about 1,800 bacterial genomes have been fully sequenced and these include important aetiological agents such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Vibrio cholerae, Clostridium difficile and Staphylococcus aureus. Very recently, there has been an explosion of bacterial genome data and is due to the development of next generation sequencing technologies, which are evolving so rapidly. Indeed, the field of microbial genomics is advancing at a very fast rate and it is difficult for researchers to be abreast with the new developments. This highlights the need for regular updates in microbial genomics through comprehensive reviews. This review paper seeks to provide an update on bacterial genome sequencing generally, and to analyze insights gained from sequencing in two areas, including bacterial pathogenesis and the development of antibiotics.
TI  - UK Renal Registry 16th annual report: chapter 15 epidemiology of reported infections amongst patients receiving dialysis for established renal Failure in England from May 2011 to April 2012: a joint report from Public Health England and the UK renal registry.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infection remains one of the leading causes of mortality in established renal failure patients receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT). Since 2007, centres providing RRT in England have been asked to provide additional data on patients with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia. Since 2011, the option to provide data on methicillin sensitive Stapylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Escherichia coli bacteraemia, as well as Clostridium difficile infection has also been available. METHODS: Data were submitted to Public Health England by laboratories via HCAI-DCS including whether the patients were receiving dialysis. Individual renal centres then confirmed the record either directly via the database or after being contacted. Data were collected for the period of the 1st May 2011 to the 30th April 2012. RESULTS: There were 49 episodes of MRSA bacteraemia, an overall rate of 0.22 per 100 dialysis patients per year, representing a further year on year fall in MRSA rate. There were a higher number of MSSA episodes, 322 in total, with an overall rate of 1.15 per 100 dialysis patients per year. The number of episodes and overall rate of E. coli and C. difficile were 284 and 0.92 per 100 prevalent dialysis patients per year and 172 and 0.61 per 100 prevalent dialysis patients per year respectively. In each infection type the presence of a central venous catheter appeared to correlate with an elevated risk. CONCLUSIONS: Data are presented from one year of infections reported to PHE. The rate of MRSA bacteraemia episodes in England continues to fall. There was a higher rate of MSSA infections amongst renal dialysis patients. Findings from the first year of E. coli and C. difficile data collection are also reported. Future cycles will give us a further idea of the trend in incidences of these infections.
TI  - Patient-days used for isolation in a community hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isolation of patients with known or suspected infection strains the resources of hospitals, but little information exists on the actual utilization of isolation beds. METHODS: The infection control team of a community hospital keeps a log of hospital days used for isolation. We obtained information from this log for August 2009 through August 2010 on hospital days for isolation due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Clostridium difficile, other multidrug-resistant organisms, and disorders necessitating droplet or airborne isolation, such as tuberculosis, meningococcal meningitis, varicella, and influenza. We also included days of isolation used to rule out the presence of these infections. All data from the medical-surgical and intensive care units were included unless the start date or end date of isolation was missing. Utilization percentages (isolation days divided by total hospital days) were calculated for the total period, for each month, and for each category of isolation. RESULTS: During the study period, 18.1% of hospital days were devoted to isolation (13.7% for definite infection and 4.4% to rule out infection). Monthly utilization ranged from 13.4% to 22%. Patients with confirmed methicillin-resistant S aureus or C difficile infections and patients with possible C difficile infection accounted for 75% of the isolation days. CONCLUSIONS: Isolation beds were required for a substantial portion of total patient-days in our study. Our data may help hospitals use hospital beds efficiently and predict nursing needs, hospital supply needs, and workload for environmental services.
TI  - Retrospective analysis of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant are at a high risk for infection-related mortality in the immediate post-transplantation phase. Prophylaxis with a fluoroquinolone is now recommended to reduce this risk with the stipulation that surveillance for increased fluoroquinolone resistance Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea be conducted. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 48 patients who underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and received a fluoroquinolone for prophylaxis and 48 patients who underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant who did not receive a fluoroquinolone for prophylaxis. All patients received the same standard antifungal, antiviral and anti-pneumocystis prophylaxis. RESULTS: Patients receiving fluoroquinolone prophylaxis had a lower incidence of febrile neutropenia than those not receiving prophylaxis, though the difference was not found to be statistically significant (83% vs. 67%, p = 0.098). Similar non-significant improvements in the number of positive cultures recovered during an episode of febrile neutropenia and antimicrobial days were noted. No significant increase in fluoroquinolone resistance, Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, or in methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections were noted. CONCLUSION: Our single institution experience with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients supports continuation of this practice. Expansion to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients may be appropriate based on guideline recommendations and our institution-specific experience with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis.
TI  - Broad-substrate screen as a tool to identify substrates for bacterial Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferases with unknown substrate specificity.
AB  - Due to a combination of efforts from individual laboratories and structural genomics centers, there has been a surge in the number of members of the Gcn5-related acetyltransferasesuperfamily that have been structurally determined within the past decade. Although the number of three-dimensional structures is increasing steadily, we know little about the individual functions of these enzymes. Part of the difficulty in assigning functions for members of this superfamily is the lack of information regarding how substrates bind to the active site of the protein. The majority of the structures do not show ligand bound in the active site, and since the substrate-binding domain is not strictly conserved, it is difficult to predict the function based on structure alone. Additionally, the enzymes are capable of acetylating a wide variety of metabolites and many may exhibit promiscuity regarding their ability to acetylate multiple classes of substrates, possibly having multiple functions for the same enzyme. Herein, we present an approach to identify potential substrates for previously uncharacterized members of the Gcn5-related acetyltransferase superfamily using a variety of metabolites including polyamines, amino acids, antibiotics, peptides, vitamins, catecholamines, and other metabolites. We have identified potential substrates for eight bacterial enzymes of this superfamily. This information will be used to further structurally and functionally characterize them.
TI  - Biocidal activity of metalloacid-coated surfaces against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial effects of a coating of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)  has been recently described. The metalloacid material produces oxonium ions (H3O+), which creates an acidic pH that is an effective, non specific antimicrobial. We determined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of molybdenum trioxide metalloacid-coated surfaces. METHODS: Metalloacid-coated and non-coated (control) surfaces were contaminated by exposing them for 15 minutes to microbial suspensions containing 105 cfu/mL. Eleven microorganisms responsible for nosocomial infections were tested: two Staphylococcus aureus strains (the hetero-vancomycin intermediate MRSA Mu50 strain and a ST80-PVL-producing MRSA strain); a vancomycin-resistant vanA Enterococcus faecium strain; three extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains; a MBL-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain; a multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain; a toxin-producing Clostridium difficile strain; and two fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus). The assay tested the ability of the coated surfaces to kill microorganisms. RESULTS: Against all non-sporulating microorganisms tested, metalloacid-coated surfaces exhibited significant antimicrobial activity relative to that of the control surfaces within two to six hours after contact with the microorganisms (p < 0.001). Microorganism survival on the coated surfaces was greatly impaired, whereas microorganism survival on control surfaces remained substantial. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that, facing the continuing shedding of microorganisms in the vicinity of colonized or infected patients, the continuous biocidal effect of hydroxonium oxides against multidrug-resistant microorganisms may help limit environmental contamination between consecutive cleaning procedures.

TI  - A prospective study to examine the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile contamination in the general environment of three community hospitals in southern Ontario, Canada.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The hospital environment has been suggested as playing an important role in the transmission of hospital-associated (HA) pathogens. However, studies investigating the contamination of the hospital environment with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Clostridium difficile have generally focused on point prevalence studies of only a single pathogen. Research evaluating the roles of these two pathogens, concurrently, in the general hospital environment has not been conducted. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence and identify risk factors associated with MRSA and C. difficile contamination in the general environment of three community hospitals, prospectively. METHODS: Sampling of environmental surfaces distributed over the medicine and surgical wards at each hospital was conducted once a week for four consecutive weeks. Sterile electrostatic cloths were used for environmental sampling and information regarding the surface sampled was recorded. For MRSA, air sampling was also conducted. Enrichment culture was performed and spa typing was performed for all MRSA isolates. For C. difficile, isolates were characterized by ribotyping and investigated for the presence of toxin genes by PCR. Using logistic regression, the following risk factors were examined for MRSA or C. difficile contamination: type of surface sampled, surface material, surface location, and the presence/absence of the other HA pathogen under investigation. RESULTS: Overall, 11.8% (n=612) and 2.4% (n=552) of surfaces were positive for MRSA and C. difficile, respectively. Based on molecular typing, five different MRSA strains and eight different C. difficile ribotypes, including ribotypes 027 (15.4%) and 078 (7.7%), were identified in the hospital environment. Results from the logistic regression model indicate that compared to computer keyboards, the following surfaces had increased odds of being contaminated with MRSA: chair backs, hand rails, isolation carts, and sofas. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA and C. difficile were identified from a variety of surfaces in the general hospital environment.Several surfaces had an increased risk of being contaminated with MRSA but further studies regarding contact rates, type of surface material, and the populations using these surfaces are warranted.
TI  - Clostridium difficile infection: new insights into management.
AB  - Clostridium difficile was first described as a cause of diarrhea in 1978 and is now among the leading 3 hospital-acquired infections in the United States, along with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. In the past 2 decades, there has been an increase in the incidence, severity, and recurrence rates of C difficile infection, all of which are associated with poor outcomes. In addition, several novel risk factors and newer treatment methods are emerging, including fidaxomicin therapy, treatment using monoclonal antibodies, and fecal microbiota transplantation, that have shown promise for the treatment of C difficile infection. This review focuses on the changing epidemiology, risk factors, and newer methods for treatment of C difficile infection.

AB  
TI  - Current and future challenges in the development of antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Micro-organisms exist to survive. Even in the absence of antimicrobial agents, many have determinants of resistance that may be expressed phenotypically, should the need arise. With the advent of the antibiotic age, as more and more drugs were developed to treat serious infections, micro-organisms (particularly bacteria) rapidly developed resistance determinants to prevent their own demise.The most important determinants of resistance have been in the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Among Gram-positive bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) have taxed researchers and pharmaceutical companies to develop new agents that are effective against these resistant strains. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes, carbapenemases (CREs) and the so-called amp-C enzymes that may be readily transferred between species of enterobacteriaceae and other facultative species have created multi-drug resistant organisms that are difficult to treat. Other resistance determinants have been seen in other clinically important bacterial species such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Clostridium difficile, Haemophilus influenzae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These issues have now spread to fungal agents of infection.A variety of modalities have been used to stem the tide of resistance. These include the development of niche compounds that target specific resistance determinants. Other approaches have been to find new targets for antimicrobial activity, use of combination agents that are effective against more than one target in the cell, or new delivery mechanism to maximize the concentration of antimicrobial agents at the site of infection without causing toxicity to the host. It is important that such new modalities have been proved effective for clinical therapy. Animal models and non-mammalian systems have been developed to determine if new agents will reach sufficient concentrations at infection sites to predict clinical efficacy without toxicity. It will also be key to consider antimicrobial stewardship as an important component of the continuing battle to prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  - Activity of the thiopeptide antibiotic nosiheptide against contemporary strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The rapid rise in antimicrobial resistance in bacteria has generated an increased demand for the development of novel therapies to treat contemporary infections, especially those caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, antimicrobial development has been largely abandoned by the pharmaceutical industry. We recently isolated the previously described thiopeptide antibiotic nosiheptide from a marine actinomycete strain and evaluated its activity against contemporary clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. Nosiheptide exhibited extremely potent activity against all contemporary MRSA strains tested including multiple drug-resistant clinical isolates, with MIC values </=0.25 mg l(-1). Nosiheptide was also highly active against Enterococcus spp. and the contemporary hypervirulent BI/NAP1/027 strain of Clostridium difficile but was inactive against most Gram-negative strains tested. Time-kill analysis revealed nosiheptide to be rapidly bactericidal against MRSA in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with a nearly 2-log kill noted at 6 h at 10 x MIC. Furthermore, nosiheptide was found to be non-cytotoxic against mammalian cells at >>100 x MIC, and its anti-MRSA activity was not inhibited by 20% human serum. Notably, nosiheptide exhibited a significantly prolonged post-antibiotic effect against both healthcare- and community-associated MRSA compared with vancomycin. Nosiheptide also demonstrated in vivo activity in a murine model of MRSA infection, and therefore represents a promising antibiotic for the treatment of serious infections caused by contemporary strains of MRSA.
TI  - An evaluation of environmental decontamination with hydrogen peroxide vapor for reducing the risk of patient acquisition of multidrug-resistant organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Admission to a room previously occupied by a patient with certain multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) increases the risk of acquisition. Traditional cleaning strategies do not remove all environmental MDROs. We evaluated the environmental and clinical impact of hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) room disinfection. METHODS: We performed a 30-month prospective cohort intervention study on 6 high-risk units in a 994-bed tertiary care hospital. Following a 12-month preintervention phase, HPV was implemented on 3 units to decontaminate the rooms of patients known to be infected or colonized with epidemiologically important MDROs, following their discharge. Monthly environmental samples for MDROs were collected on all study units for 3 preintervention and 6 intervention months. The risk of MDRO acquisition in patients admitted to rooms decontaminated using HPV was compared with rooms disinfected using standard methods. RESULTS: The prior room occupant was known to be infected or colonized with an MDRO in 22% of 6350 admissions. Patients admitted to rooms decontaminated using HPV were 64% less likely to acquire any MDRO (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], .19-.70; P < .001) and 80% less likely to acquire VRE (IRR, 0.20; 95% CI, .08-.52; P < .001) after adjusting for other factors. The risk of acquiring Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and multidrug-resistant gram-negative rods individually was reduced, but not significantly. The proportion of rooms environmentally contaminated with MDROs was reduced significantly on the HPV units (relative risk, 0.65, P = .03), but not on non-HPV units. CONCLUSIONS: HPV decontamination reduced environmental contamination and the risk of acquiring MDROs compared with standard cleaning protocols.
TI  - Equal efficacy of glucoprotamin and an aldehyde product for environmental disinfection in a hematologic transplant unit: a prospective crossover trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The inanimate hospital environment has emerged as an important reservoir of nosocomial pathogens. In particular, multidrug-resistant pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter species, and Clostridium difficile, play a major role in the transmission of hospital-acquired infections. In Europe, aldehydes, chlorine, and quaternary ammonium compounds have been commonly used for environmental disinfection. Glucoprotamin, a newer active compound for disinfectants, has been clinically tested for disinfection of instruments but not for environmental disinfection. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the antimicrobial effectiveness of a glucoprotamin-containing product (Incidin) compared with that of an aldehyde-containing product (Deconex), the current standard at our institution. METHODS: This prospective crossover study was conducted in our access-restricted hematologic transplant unit. A total of 3,086 samples from the environment were processed and examined for overall bacterial burden as well as selectively for S. aureus, C. difficile, and gram-negative bacteria. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in residual bacteria after disinfection between the 2 products in terms of overall burden and selected pathogens. Enterococci were the predominant pathogens recovered from surfaces, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were recovered. Similarly, C. difficile could not be found in the patients' environment, even in rooms, despite the use of selective media. CONCLUSION: The aldehyde-containing product (Deconex) and the glucoprotamin-containing product (Incidin) demonstrated similar efficacy against environmental contamination in a hematologic transplant unit with the application of selective media for C. difficile, S. aureus, and gram-negative bacteria in addition to standard medium.
TI  - Wide variation in adoption of screening and infection control interventions for multidrug-resistant organisms: a national study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We performed a survey of National Healthcare Safety Network hospitals in 2008 to describe adoption of screening and infection control policies aimed at multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) in intensive care units (ICUs) and identify predictors of their presence, monitoring, and implementation. METHODS: Four hundred forty-one infection control directors were surveyed using a modified Dillman technique. To explore differences in screening and infection control policies by setting characteristics, bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed. RESULTS: In total, 250 hospitals participated (57% response rate). Study ICUs (n = 413) routinely screened for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (59%); vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (22%); multidrug-resistant, gram-negative rods (12%); and Clostridium difficile (11%). Directors reported ICU policies to screen all admissions for any MDRO (40%), screen periodically (27%), utilize presumptive isolation/contact precautions pending a screen (31%), and cohort colonized patients (42%). Several independent predictors of the presence and implementation of different interventions including mandatory reporting and teaching status were identified. CONCLUSION: This study found wide variation in adoption of MDRO screening and infection control interventions, which may reflect differences in published recommendations or their interpretation. Further research is needed to provide additional insight on effective strategies and how best to promote compliance.
TI  - Associations between nosocomial meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and nosocomial Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea in 89 German hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is mainly considered as a hospital-acquired pathogen causing diarrhoea in healthcare settings. AIM: To quantify and compare the incidence density of hospital-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and C. difficile-associated infection (CDI) in a network of German hospitals; also to assess whether there is an association between nosocomial MRSA and nosocomial CDI. METHODS: Acute hospitals reported data on the number of patients, patient-days and MRSA and/or CDI cases to the German nosocomial infection surveillance system (KISS). Cases were classified as nosocomial or imported. Nosocomial incidences and incidence densities (per 1000 patient-days) of MRSA and CDI were calculated by Spearman correlation index. RESULTS: In 2010, a total of 89 hospitals reported hospital-wide MRSA and CDI cases. The analysis included 1,536,031 patients, 11,138,496 patient-days, 5183 nosocomial CDI cases and 2233 nosocomial MRSA cases. The pooled incidence density of nosocomial CDI was 0.47, more than two-fold higher than that of nosocomial MRSA (0.20). Correlation of nosocomial incidences of MRSA and CDI was statistically significant [correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.515]. Correlation of incidence densities was likewise significant with a CC of 0.484. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of nosocomial CDI was twice as high as nosocomial MRSA incidence among our database and with the definitions used. High nosocomial MRSA or CDI cases might be indicators for deficits in infection control and/or selection pressure of antibiotics.
TI  - A pilot randomised controlled trial in intensive care patients comparing 7 days'  treatment with empirical antibiotics with 2 days' treatment for hospital-acquired infection of unknown origin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Management of cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) sepsis is complicated by the high incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which mimics sepsis but without an infective cause. This pilot randomised trial investigated whether or not, in the ICU, 48 hours of broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment was adequate to safely treat suspected sepsis of unknown and unproven origin and also the predictive power of newer biomarkers of sepsis. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this pilot study was to provide preliminary data on the likely safety and efficacy of a reduced course of antibiotics for the treatment of ICU infections of unknown origin. DESIGN: A pilot, single-centre, open-label randomised trial. SETTING: This study was carried out in the ICU of a tertiary heart and chest hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients being treated within the ICU were recruited into the trial if the intensivist was planning to commence antibiotics because of evidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and a strong suspicion of infection but there was no actual known source for that infection. INTERVENTIONS: Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment administered for 48 hours (experimental) compared with treatment for 7 days (control). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite outcome of the rate of death or initiation of antibiotic therapy after the completion of the treatment schedule allocated at randomisation. Secondary outcomes included the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU and hospital stay; the incidence of infection with Clostridium difficile (B. S. Weeks & E. Alcamo) Jones & Bartlett International Publishers, 2008, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (B. S. Weeks & E. Alcamo) Jones & Bartlett International Publishers, 2008; resource utilisation and costs associated with each of the two pilot arms; the ratio of patients screened to patients eligible to patients randomised; the incidence of crossover between groups; and the significance of newer biomarkers for sepsis for predicting patients' need for further antibiotics. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were recruited into the trial, with 23 randomised to each group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the composite primary outcome measure. The risk difference was 0.12 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.13; p = 0.3]. In the 2-day group, four patients (17.4%) required further antibiotics compared with three (13%) in the 7-day group. Four patients died within the trial period and the deaths were not trial related. Patients who died during the trial period received no additional antibiotics in excess of their trial allocation. There were no documented incidences of MRSA or C. difficile infection in either group. No significant differences in adverse events were observed between the groups. Key economic findings were mean antibiotic costs per patient of pound168.97 for the 2-day group and pound375.86 for the 7-day group. The potential per annum cost saving for the ICU of 2-day treatment was estimated to range from pound108,140 to pound126,060. Patient screening was considered the biggest barrier to recruitment. There was no crossover between the two randomised groups. Data verification ascertained > 98% accuracy in data collection. Baseline procalcitonin was found to be predictive of the composite outcome (death and needing further antibiotics) (odds ratio 1.79, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.67; p = 0.005). Analysis of baseline procalcitonin also indicated a trend towards it being a predictor of restarting antibiotics, with an odds ratio of 1.45 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.02; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this pilot study suggest that there could be significant benefits of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use in the ICU without it undermining patient safety, with a potential cost saving in our unit of over pound100,000 per year. Evidence from this pilot trial is not definitive but warrants further investigation using a large randomised controlled trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN82694288.

TI  - Comparison of bacterial quantities in left and right colon biopsies and faeces.
AB  - AIM: To compare quantities of predominant and pathogenic bacteria in mucosal and  faecal samples. METHODS: Twenty patients undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy with endoscopically and histologically normal mucosa were recruited to the study, 14 subjects of which also supplied faecal (F) samples between 15 d to 105 d post colonoscopy. Mucosal biopsies were taken from each subject from the midportion of the ascending colon (right side samples, RM) and the sigmoid (left side samples, LM). Predominant intestinal and mucosal bacteria including clostridial 16S rRNA gene clusters IV and XIVab, Bacteroidetes, Enterobacteriaceae, Bifidobacterium spp., Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), Veillonella spp., Collinsella spp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (F. prausnitzii) and putative pathogens such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Host DNA was quantified from the mucosal samples with human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene targeting qPCR. Paired t tests and the Pearson correlation were applied for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The most prominent bacterial groups were clostridial groups IV and XIVa+b and Bacteroidetes and bacterial species F. prausnitzii in both sample types. H. pylori and S. aureus were not detected and C. difficile was detected in only one mucosal sample and three faecal samples. E. coli was detected in less than half of the mucosal samples at both sites, but was present in all faecal samples. All detected bacteria, except Enterobacteriaceae, were present at higher levels in the faeces than in the mucosa, but the different locations in the colon presented comparable quantities (RM, LM and F followed by P(1) for RM vs F, P(2) for LM vs F and P(3) for RM vs LM: 4.17 +/- 0.60 log(10)/g, 4.16 +/- 0.56 log(10)/g, 5.88 +/- 1.92 log(10)/g, P(1) = 0.011, P(2) = 0.0069, P(3) = 0.9778 for A. muciniphila; 6.25 +/- 1.3 log(10)/g, 6.09 +/- 0.81 log(10)/g, 8.84 +/- 1.38 log(10)/g, P(1) < 0.0001, P(2) = 0.0002, P(3) = 0.6893 for Bacteroidetes; 5.27 +/- 1.68 log(10)/g, 5.38 +/- 2.06 log(10)/g, 8.20 +/- 1.14 log(10)/g, P(1) < 0.0001, P(2) </= 0.0001, P(3) = 0.7535 for Bifidobacterium spp.; 6.44 +/- 1.15 log(10)/g, 6.07 +/-1.45 log(10)/g, 9.74 +/-1.13 log(10)/g, P(1) < 0.0001, P(2) </= 0.0001, P(3) = 0.637 for Clostridium cluster IV; 6.65 +/- 1.23 log(10)/g, 6.57 +/- 1.52 log(10)/g, 9.13 +/- 0.96 log(10)/g, P(1) < 0.0001, P(2) </= 0.0001, P(3) = 0.9317 for Clostridium cluster XIVa; 4.57 +/- 1.44 log(10)/g, 4.63 +/- 1.34 log(10)/g, 7.05 +/- 2.48 log(10)/g, P(1) = 0.012, P(2) = 0.0357, P(3) = 0.7973 for Collinsella spp.; 7.66 +/- 1.50 log(10)/g, 7.60 +/- 1.05 log(10)/g, 10.02 +/- 2.02 log(10)/g, P(1) </= 0.0001, P(2) = 0.0013, P(3) = 0.9919 for F. prausnitzsii; 6.17 +/- 1.3 log(10)/g, 5.85 +/- 0.93 log(10)/g, 7.25 +/- 1.01 log(10)/g, P(1) = 0.0243, P(2) = 0.0319, P(3) = 0.6982 for Veillonella spp.; 4.68 +/- 1.21 log(10)/g, 4.71 +/- 0.83 log(10)/g, 5.70 +/- 2.00 log(10)/g, P(1) = 0.1927, P(2) = 0.0605, P(3) = 0.6476 for Enterobacteriaceae). The Bifidobacterium spp. counts correlated significantly between mucosal sites and mucosal and faecal samples (Pearson correlation coefficients 0.62, P = 0.040 and 0.81, P = 0.005 between the right mucosal sample and faeces and the left mucosal sample and faeces, respectively). CONCLUSION: Non-invasive faecal samples do not reflect bacterial counts on the mucosa at the individual level, except for bifidobacteria often analysed in probiotic intervention studies.
TI  - The impact of infection on population health: results of the Ontario burden of infectious diseases study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence-based priority setting is increasingly important for rationally distributing scarce health resources and for guiding future health research. We sought to quantify the contribution of a wide range of infectious diseases to the overall infectious disease burden in a high-income setting. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used health-adjusted life years (HALYs), a composite measure comprising premature mortality and reduced functioning due to disease, to estimate the burden of 51 infectious diseases and associated syndromes in Ontario using 2005-2007 data. Deaths were estimated from vital statistics data and disease incidence was estimated from reportable disease, healthcare utilization, and cancer registry data, supplemented by local modeling studies and national and international epidemiologic studies. The 51 infectious agents and associated syndromes accounted for 729 lost HALYs, 44.2 deaths, and 58,987 incident cases per 100,000 population annually. The most burdensome infectious agents were: hepatitis C virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Staphylococcus aureus, influenza virus, Clostridium difficile, and rhinovirus. The top five, ten, and 20 pathogens accounted for 46%, 67%, and 75% of the total infectious disease burden, respectively. Marked sex-specific differences in disease burden were observed for some pathogens. The main limitations of this study were the exclusion of certain infectious diseases due to data availability issues, not considering the impact of co-infections and co-morbidity, and the inability to assess the burden of milder infections that do not result in healthcare utilization. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Infectious diseases continue to cause a substantial health burden in high-income settings such as Ontario. Most of this burden is attributable to a relatively small number of infectious agents, for which many effective interventions have been previously identified. Therefore, these findings should be used to guide public health policy, planning, and research.
TI  - Daily disinfection of high-touch surfaces in isolation rooms to reduce contamination of healthcare workers' hands.
AB  - In a randomized nonblinded trial, we demonstrated that daily disinfection of high-touch surfaces in rooms of patients with Clostridium difficile infection and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization reduced acquisition of the pathogens on hands after contacting high-touch surfaces and reduced contamination of hands of healthcare workers caring for the patients.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a range of probiotics against pathogens: evidence for the effects of organic acids.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of fifteen  selected strains belonging to the Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Streptococcus and Bacillus genera against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. In vitro antibacterial activity was initially investigated by an agar spot method. Results from the agar spot test showed that most of the selected strains were able to produce active compounds on solid media with antagonistic properties against Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile. These results were also confirmed when cell-free culture supernatants (CFCS) from the putative probiotics were used in an agar well diffusion assay. Neutralization of the culture supernatants with alkali reduced the antagonistic effects. These experiments are able to confirm the capacity of potential probiotics to inhibit selected pathogens. One of the main inhibitory mechanisms may result from the production of organic acids from glucose fermentation and consequent lowering of culture pH. This observation was confirmed when the profile of organic acids was analysed demonstrating that lactic and acetic acid were the principal end products of probiotic metabolism. Furthermore, the assessment of the haemolytic activity and the susceptibility of the strains to the most commonly used antimicrobials, considered as basic safety aspects, were also studied. The observed antimicrobial activity was mainly genus-specific, additionally significant differences could be observed among species.
TI  - National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Funding for Studies  of Hospital-Associated Bacterial Pathogens: Are Funds Proportionate to Burden of Disease?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital-associated infections (HAIs) are associated with a considerable burden of disease and direct costs greater than $17 billion. The pathogens that cause the majority of serious HAIs are Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species, referred as ESCKAPE. We aimed to determine the amount of funding the National Institute of Health (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) allocates to research on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, particularly ESCKAPE pathogens. METHODS: The NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT) database was used to identify NIAID antimicrobial resistance research grants funded in 2007-2009 using the terms "antibiotic resistance," "antimicrobial resistance," and "hospital-associated infection." RESULTS: Funding for antimicrobial resistance grants has increased from 2007-2009. Antimicrobial resistance funding for bacterial pathogens has seen a smaller increase than non-bacterial pathogens. The total funding for all ESKCAPE pathogens was $ 22,005,943 in 2007, $ 30,810,153 in 2008 and $ 49,801,227 in 2009. S. aureus grants received $ 29,193,264 in FY2009, the highest funding amount of all the ESCKAPE pathogens. Based on 2009 funding data, approximately $1,565 of research money was spent per S. aureus related death and $750 of was spent per C. difficile related death. CONCLUSIONS: Although the funding for ESCKAPE pathogens has increased from 2007 to 2009, funding levels for antimicrobial resistant bacteria-related grants is still lower than funding for antimicrobial resistant non-bacterial pathogens. Efforts may be needed to improve research funding for resistant-bacterial pathogens, particularly as their clinical burden increases.
TI  - Is prophylactic Gentamicin associated with acute kidney injury in patients undergoing surgery for fractured neck of femur?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Single dose Gentamicin (240 mg) has been shown to reduce postoperative wound infection in patients with fractured neck of femur when used in a combined antibiotic regimen. However, concerns have arisen about the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the use of prophylactic Gentamicin is associated with AKI in fractured neck of femur patients. METHODS: A historical cohort study. Pre- and post-operative creatinine mmol/l of 100 successive fractured neck of femur patients admitted from September 2010 were compared to a control of 100 age, sex and procedure matched individuals operated upon before the introduction of prophylactic Gentamicin (2005). AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine by over 50% of base line. Statistical significance was regarded as p<0.05. RESULTS: A significant rise in creatinine levels was observed in both control (p=0.005) and study groups (p=0.001). There was neither a significant difference in peak creatinine between groups (p=0.87) nor in rates of AKI (p=0.568) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Single preoperative doses of Gentamicin (240 mg) have no detrimental impact on renal function in this group. There is, however, a significant rise in creatinine following fractured neck of femur surgery, independent of Gentamicin.
TI  - Empiric antibiotics pending bronchoalveolar lavage data in patients without pneumonia significantly alters the flora, but not the resistance profile, if a subsequent pneumonia develops.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) occurs in up to 25% of mechanically ventilated patients, with an associated mortality up to 50%. Early diagnosis and appropriate empiric antibiotic coverage of VAP are crucial. Given the multitude of noninfectious clinical and radiographic anomalies within trauma patients, microbiology from bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) is often needed. Empiric antibiotics are administered while awaiting BAL culture data. Little is known about the effects of these empiric antibiotics on patients with negative BAL microbiology if a subsequent VAP occurs during the same hospital course. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of intubated trauma patients undergoing BAL for suspected pneumonia over a 3-y period at a Level 1 trauma center. All patients with suspected VAP undergoing a BAL receive empiric antibiotics. If microbiology data are negative at 72 h, all antibiotics are stopped; however, if the BAL returns with >/=10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter, the diagnosis of VAP is confirmed. We divided patients into three groups. Group 1 consisted of patients in whom the initial BAL was positive for VAP. Group 2 consisted of patients with an initial negative BAL, who subsequently developed VAP at a later point in the hospital course. Group 3 consisted of patients with negative BAL who did not develop a subsequent VAP. RESULTS: We obtained 499 BAL specimens in 185 patients over the 3-y period. A total of 14 patients with 23 BAL specimens initially negative for VAP subsequently developed VAP later during the same hospital stay. These patients did not have an increase in the hospital length of stay, intensive care unit days, ventilator days, or mortality compared with those who had a positive culture on the first suspicion of VAP. There was a significant increase in the percentage of Enterobacter (21% versus 8%) and Morganella (8% versus 0%) as the causative organism in these 14 patients when the VAP occurred. Furthermore, the profile of the top two organisms in each group changed. Enterobacter (21%) and Pseudomonas (17%) were the principal organisms in the initial BAL-negative group, whereas the two predominant strains in the initial positive BAL group were methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (21%) and Haemophilus influenza (11%). Interestingly, methicillin-resistant S. aureus remained the third most common organism in both groups. Empiric antibiotics also did not seem to induce the growth of multidrug-resistant organisms, and there was no increased rate of secondary infections such as Clostridium difficile. CONCLUSIONS: Ventilator-associated pneumonia remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in mechanically ventilated trauma patients. The diagnosis and treatment of VAP continue to be challenging. Once clinically suspected, empiric coverage decreases morbidity and mortality. Our data demonstrate that patients who receive empiric coverage exhibit a significantly different microbiologic profile compared with those who had an initial positive BAL culture. Initial empiric antibiotics in BAL-negative patients were not associated with an increase in multidrug-resistant organisms, hospital, or intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator days, and mortality or secondary infections.
TI  - Clinical and economic outcomes of a prospective antimicrobial stewardship program.
AB  - PURPOSE: A pre-post analysis of an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) involving the use of data-mining software to prospectively identify cases for ASP intervention was conducted. METHODS: The investigators evaluated clinical outcomes and cost metrics before and after implementation of the ASP, which entailed daily physician review of summary reports on all adult inpatients receiving antimicrobial therapy. The primary outcome measures were annual antimicrobial expenditures and rates of infections due to common nosocomial pathogens; secondary outcome measures included patient survival and length of stay (LOS) in cases involving the indicator diagnoses of pneumonia and abdominal sepsis. RESULTS: Antimicrobial expenditures, which had increased by an average of 14.4% annually in the years preceding ASP implementation, decreased by 9.75% in the first year of the program and remained relatively stable in subsequent years, with overall cumulative cost savings estimated at $1.7 million. Rates of nosocomial infections involving Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci all decreased after ASP implementation. A pre-post comparison of survival and LOS in patients with pneumonia (n = 2186) or abdominal sepsis (n = 225) showed no significant differences in those outcomes in either patient group, possibly due to the hospital's initiation of other, concurrent infection-control programs during the study period. CONCLUSION: A prospective collaborative ASP employed automated reports to efficiently identify key data for ASP review. After ASP implementation, antimicrobial expenditures and rates of nosocomial infections caused by resistant pathogens dropped without significant changes in patient survival, LOS, and readmissions for the two studied illness categories.
TI  - Engaging patients in the prevention of health care-associated infections: a survey of patients' awareness, knowledge, and perceptions regarding the risks and consequences of infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections and Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) are major health care-associated infections (HAIs). Little is known about patients' knowledge of these HAIs. Therefore, we surveyed patients to determine awareness, knowledge, and perceptions of MRSA infections and CDI. DESIGN: An interviewer-administered questionnaire. SETTING: A tertiary care academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients who met at least one of the following criteria: at risk of CDI or MRSA infection, current CDI or colonization or current MRSA infection or colonization, or history of CDI or MRSA infection. METHODS: Two unique surveys were developed and administered to 100 patients in 2011. RESULTS: Overall, 76% of patients surveyed were aware of MRSA, whereas 44% were aware of C difficile. The strongest predictor of patients' awareness of these infections was having a history of HAI. Patients with a history of HAI were significantly more likely to have heard of both MRSA (odds ratio, 13.29; 95% confidence interval, 2.84-62.14; P = .001) and C difficile (odds ratio, 9.78; 95% confidence interval, 2.66-35.95; P = .001), than those patients without a history of HAI. There was also a significant positive association between having a history of HAI and greater knowledge of the risk factors, health consequences, and prevention techniques relative to CDI and MRSA infections. CONCLUSIONS: There are additional opportunities to engage patients about the risks and consequences of MRSA and CDIs, particularly those without a history of HAI.
TI  - Current challenges in antimicrobial resistance and healthcare-associated infections: role and organization of ARHAI.
AB  - The UK Government Specialist Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-Associated Infections (ARHAI) was established in 2007. It has responsibility for providing practical and scientific advice to government on healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) and to maintain the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in the treatment and prevention of infection in man and animals. The manner in which this has been approached by ARHAI is described. In essence, key themes have been defined and issues dealt with through 'Focus Sessions', Subgroups and Working Groups. This Supplement reports on a selection of the key issues that have been addressed and the resulting recommendations and actions. Topics featured include: educational initiatives that target healthcare professionals and the public; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile infections; surveillance priorities; healthcare management and HCAI and antimicrobial resistance (AMR); AMR in pathogens involving man and animals; technological innovation to support the control of AMR and HCAI; antimicrobial stewardship; and issues dealing with antiviral drug resistance.
TI  - Addressing healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance from an  organizational perspective: progress and challenges.
AB  - This paper explores the progress and challenges associated with the application of organizational factors and approaches to infection prevention and control (IPC) and antibiotic stewardship (AS) in England, many of which have been considered and supported by the Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-associated Infections (ARHAI). An organizational perspective is described and the wider macro context and socio-political forces that shape an organizational approach are considered. Factors that drive organizational change in IPC and AS are discussed. The tensions, constraints and dilemmas that can occur are identified and outstanding challenges are debated. Some recommendations for the future direction of IPC and AS organizationally focused strategies and research are proposed.
TI  - Recommendations for surveillance priorities for healthcare-associated infections  and criteria for their conduct.
AB  - Surveillance and feedback of results to clinical teams is central to performance  improvement in managing healthcare-acquired infections. A major role of the Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-Associated Infections (ARHAI) is to advise on surveillance priorities. A sub-committee was set up to systematically review existing UK surveillance schemes. The following three systems were examined in detail: mandatory reporting of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia and Clostridium difficile infection to the HPA; surveillance of surgical site infection undertaken by the HPA; and surgical site infection surveillance undertaken at University College London Hospital. Recommendations included the extension of mandatory reporting to include bacteraemia due to Escherichia coli and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), post-discharge surveillance of surgical site infection, the need for validation of surveillance systems and mandatory reporting of Caesarean section wound infections. Mandatory reporting of bacteraemia due to E. coli and MSSA were introduced during 2011 and further extension of surveillance is likely.
TI  - Impact of a hospital-wide hand hygiene initiative on healthcare-associated infections: results of an interrupted time series.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence that hand hygiene (HH) reduces healthcare-associated infections has been available for almost two centuries. Yet HH compliance among healthcare professionals continues to be low, and most efforts to improve it have failed. OBJECTIVE: To improve healthcare workers' HH, and reduce healthcare-associated infections. DESIGN: 3-year interrupted time series with multiple sequential interventions and 1-year post-intervention follow-up. SETTING: Teaching hospital in rural New Hampshire. INTERVENTIONS: In five categories: (1) leadership/accountability; (2) measurement/feedback; (3) hand sanitiser availability; (4) education/training; and (5) marketing/communication. MEASUREMENT: Monthly changes in observed HH compliance (%) and rates of healthcare-associated infection (including Staphylococcus aureus infections, Clostridium difficile infections and bloodstream infections) per 1000 inpatient days. The subset of S aureus infections attributable to the operating room served as a tracer condition. We used statistical process control charts to identify significant changes. RESULTS: HH compliance increased significantly from 41% to 87% (p<0.01) during the initiative, and improved further to 91% (p<0.01) the following year. Nurses achieved higher HH compliance (93%) than physicians (78%). There was a significant, sustained decline in the healthcare-associated infection rate from 4.8 to 3.3 (p<0.01) per 1000 inpatient days. The rate of S aureus infections attributable to the operating room rose, while the rate of other S aureus infections fell. CONCLUSIONS: Our initiative was associated with a large and significant hospital-wide improvement in HH which was sustained through the following year and a significant, sustained reduction in the incidence of healthcare-associated infection. The observed increased incidence of the tracer condition supports the assertion that HH improvement contributed to infection reduction. Persistent variation in HH performance among different groups requires further study.
TI  - Antibiotic optimization and chemical structure stabilization of thiomuracin A.
AB  - Synthetic studies of the antimicrobial secondary metabolite thiomuracin A (1) were initiated to improve chemical stability and physicochemical properties. Functional group modifications of 1 included removing the C2-C7 side chain, derivatizing the C84 epoxide region, and altering the C44 hydroxyphenylalanine motif. The resulting derivatives simplified and stabilized the chemical structure and were evaluated for antibacterial activity relative to 1. The simplified structure and improved organic solubility of the derivatives facilitated isolation yields from fermentation broths and simplified the procedures involved for the process. These advancements increased material supply for continued medicinal chemistry optimization and culminated in the identification of 2, a structurally simplified and chemically stable analogue of 1 which retained potent antibiotic activity.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM), linezolid (LZD) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 microg/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. Cefpirome, carbapenems, VCM, teicoplanin (TEIC), LZD and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of E. faecalis strains and 1.2% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate to LZD. 17.1% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM was under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity. Carbapenems showed good activity against Clostridiales, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp., but one strain of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. And so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting continuously.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo characterization of CB-183,315, a novel lipopeptide antibiotic for treatment of Clostridium difficile.
AB  - CB-183,315 is a novel lipopeptide antibiotic structurally related to daptomycin currently in phase 3 clinical development for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). We report here the in vitro mechanism of action, spontaneous resistance incidence, resistance by serial passage, time-kill kinetics, postantibiotic effect, and efficacy of CB-183,315 in a hamster model of lethal infection. In vitro data showed that CB-183,315 dissipated the membrane potential of Staphylococcus aureus without inducing changes in membrane permeability to small molecules. The rate of spontaneous resistance to CB-183,315 at 8x the MIC was below the limit of detection in C. difficile. Under selective pressure by serial passage with CB-183,315 against C. difficile, the susceptibility of the bacteria changed no more than 2-fold during 15 days of serial passages. At 16x the MIC, CB-183,315 produced a >/=3-log reduction of C. difficile in the time-kill assay. The postantibiotic effect of CB-183,315 at 8x the MIC was 0.9 h. At 80x the MIC the postantibiotic effect was more than 6 h. In the hamster model of CDAD, CB-183,315 and vancomycin both demonstrated potent efficacy in resolving initial disease onset, even at very low doses. After the conclusion of dosing, CB-183,315 and vancomycin showed a similar dose- and time-dependent pattern with respect to rates of CDAD recurrence.
TI  - The use of ceftaroline fosamil in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis and deep-seated MRSA infections: a retrospective case series of 10 patients.
AB  - There are many limitations to the current antibiotics used for the treatment of severe methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Ceftaroline is a new fifth-generation cephalosporin approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections caused by MRSA and community-acquired pneumonia. We propose that ceftaroline can also be used successfully in more severe MRSA infections, including endocarditis. We conducted a retrospective chart review in a university-affiliated Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in San Diego, California (USA) of ten inpatients treated with ceftaroline for severe MRSA infection, including five cases of probable endocarditis (including two endocardial pacemaker infections), one case of pyomyositis with possible endocarditis, two cases of pneumonia (including one case of empyema), two cases of septic arthritis (including one case of prosthetic joint infection), and two cases of osteomyelitis. Seven of the 10 patients achieved microbiological cure. Six of the 10 patients achieved clinical cure. Seven patients were discharged from the hospital. Three patients were placed on comfort care and expired in the hospital; one achieved microbiological cure before death, and two remained bacteremic at time of death. In most patients, ceftaroline was effective for treatment of MRSA bacteremia and other severe MRSA infections. Adverse effects seen included rash, eosinophilia, pruritus, and Clostridium difficile infection. Ceftaroline can be a safe and effective drug for treatment of severe MRSA infections, and further comparative studies are warranted.

TI  - Nosocomial diarrhea: evaluation and treatment of causes other than Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Diarrhea is common among hospitalized patients but the causes are distinct from those of diarrhea in the community. We review existing data about the epidemiology of nosocomial diarrhea and summarize recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of diarrhea. Clinicians should recognize that most cases of nosocomial diarrhea have a noninfectious etiology, including medications, underlying illness, and enteral feeding. Apart from Clostridium difficile, the frequency of infectious causes such as norovirus and toxigenic strains of Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis remains largely undefined and test availability is limited. Here we provide a practical approach to the evaluation and management of nosocomial diarrhea when tests for C. difficile are negative.
TI  - A pilot study of rapid benchtop sequencing of Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile for outbreak detection and surveillance.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prospects of newly available benchtop sequencers to provide rapid whole-genome data in routine clinical practice. Next-generation sequencing has the potential to resolve uncertainties surrounding the route and timing of person-to-person transmission of healthcare-associated infection, which has been a major impediment to optimal management. DESIGN: The authors used Illumina MiSeq benchtop sequencing to undertake case studies investigating potential outbreaks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile. SETTING: Isolates were obtained from potential outbreaks associated with three UK hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Isolates were sequenced from a cluster of eight MRSA carriers and an associated bacteraemia case in an intensive care unit, another MRSA cluster of six cases and two clusters of C difficile. Additionally, all C difficile isolates from cases over 6 weeks in a single hospital were rapidly sequenced and compared with local strain sequences obtained in the preceding 3 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Whole-genome genetic relatedness of the isolates within each epidemiological cluster. RESULTS: Twenty-six MRSA and 15 C difficile isolates were successfully sequenced and analysed within 5 days of culture. Both MRSA clusters were identified as outbreaks, with most sequences in each cluster indistinguishable and all within three single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Epidemiologically unrelated isolates of the same spa-type were genetically distinct (>/=21 SNVs). In both C difficile clusters, closely epidemiologically linked cases (in one case sharing the same strain type) were shown to be genetically distinct (>/=144 SNVs). A reconstruction applying rapid sequencing in C difficile surveillance provided early outbreak detection and identified previously undetected probable community transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This benchtop sequencing technology is widely generalisable to human bacterial pathogens. The findings provide several good examples of how rapid and precise sequencing could transform identification of transmission of healthcare-associated infection and therefore improve hospital infection control and patient outcomes in routine clinical practice.
TI  - Clinical negligence, litigation and healthcare-associated infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Litigation costs resulting from clinical negligence claims involving  healthcare-associated infections are a significant but underappreciated cost to healthcare organizations. In England these claims are handled on behalf of the National Health Service (NHS) organizations by the NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA). The total number of claims and the amounts awarded have increased significantly in recent years. AIM: To determine whether the recent significant reductions in meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection (BSI) and Clostridium difficile infections in England have had an effect on the number and value of NHSLA claims relating to these infections. METHODS: Data obtained from the NHSLA relating to claims mentioning C. difficile or MRSA from 2003 to 2010 were correlated with mandatory surveillance data from the Health Protection Agency for these infections. FINDINGS: The rate of NHSLA claims for MRSA has decreased in line with reductions in BSI for this infection (0.007 per BSI between 2003/4-2006/7 to 0.0017 per BSI between 2007/8 and 2010/11), but there was no significant change in claims relating to C. difficile infection. Overall the amounts awarded for successful claims have decreased significantly from a total of pound76,846 for the period 1997/8-2006/7 to pound24,821 for the period 2007/8-2010/11. CONCLUSIONS: The number of litigation claims involving MRSA has recently decreased significantly in line with surveillance data. There was no observed effect on claims involving C. difficile. The amounts awarded for successful claims for both infections have also fallen, although the reasons for this are not clear.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant organisms, wounds and topical antimicrobial protection.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are increasingly implicated in both acute and chronic wound infections. The limited therapeutic options are further compromised by the fact that wound bacteria often co-exist within a biofilm community which enhances bacterial tolerance to antibiotics. As a consequence, topical antiseptics may be an important consideration for minimising the opportunity for wound infections involving MDROs. The objective of this research was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of a silver-containing gelling fibre dressing against a variety of MDROs in free-living and biofilm states, using stringent in vitro models designed to simulate a variety of wound conditions. MDROs included Acinetobacter baumannii, community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Clostridium difficile was also included in the study because it carries many of the characteristics seen in MDROs and evidence of multidrug resistance is emerging. Sustained in vitro antimicrobial activity of the silver-containing dressing was shown against 10 MDROs in a simulated wound fluid over 7 days, and inhibitory and bactericidal effects against both free-living and biofilm phenotypes were also consistently shown in simulated colonised wound surface models. The in vitro data support consideration of the silver-containing gelling fibre dressing as part of a protocol of care in the management of wounds colonised or infected with MDROs.
TI  - Evaluation of a hand-held far-ultraviolet radiation device for decontamination of Clostridium difficile and other healthcare-associated pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental surfaces play an important role in transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens. There is a need for new disinfection methods that are effective against Clostridium difficile spores, but also safe and rapid. The Sterilray Disinfection Wand device is a hand-held room decontamination technology that utilizes far-ultraviolet radiation (185-230 nm) to kill pathogens. METHODS: We examined the efficacy of disinfection using the Sterilray device in the laboratory, in rooms of hospitalized patients, and on surfaces outside of patient rooms (i.e. keyboards and portable medical equipment). Cultures for C. difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) were collected from commonly-touched surfaces before and after use of the Sterilray device. RESULTS: On inoculated surfaces in the laboratory, application of the Sterilray device at a radiant dose of 100 mJ/cm(2) for ~ 5 seconds consistently reduced recovery of C. difficile spores by 4.4 CFU log10, MRSA by 5.4 log(10)CFU and of VRE by 6.9 log10CFU. A >3 log10 reduction of MRSA and VRE was achieved in ~2 seconds at a lower radiant dose, but killing of C. difficile spores was significantly reduced. On keyboards and portable medical equipment that were inoculated with C. difficile spores, application of the Sterilray device at a radiant dose of 100 mJ/cm(2) for ~ 5 seconds reduced contamination by 3.2 log10CFU. However, the presence of organic material reduced the lethal effect of the far-UV radiation. In hospital rooms that were not pre-cleaned, disinfection with the Sterilray device significantly reduced the frequency of positive C. difficile and MRSA cultures (P =0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The Sterilray Disinfection Wand is a novel environmental disinfection technology that rapidly kills C. difficile spores and other healthcare-associated pathogens on surfaces. However, the presence of organic matter reduces the efficacy of far-UV radiation, possibly explaining the more modest results observed on surfaces in hospital rooms that were not pre-cleaned.
TI  - Healthcare-associated infection and hospital readmission.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hospital readmissions are a current target of initiatives to reduce healthcare costs. This study quantified the association between having a clinical culture positive for 1 of 3 prevalent hospital-associated organisms and time to hospital readmission. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Adults admitted to an academic, tertiary care referral center from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2008. METHODS: The primary exposure of interest was a clinical culture positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), or Clostridium difficile obtained more than 48 hours after hospital admission during the index hospital stay. The primary outcome of interest was time to readmission to the index facility. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to model the adjusted association between positive clinical culture result and time to readmission and to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Among 136,513 index admissions, the prevalence of hospital-associated positive clinical culture result for 1 of the 3 organisms of interest was 3%, and 35% of patients were readmitted to the index facility within 1 year after discharge. Patients with a positive clinical culture obtained more than 48 hours after hospital admission had an increased hazard of readmission (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.33-1.46) after adjusting for age, sex, index admission length of stay, intensive care unit stay, Charlson comorbidity index, and year of hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with healthcare-associated infections may be at increased risk of hospital readmission. These findings may be used to impact health outcomes after discharge from the hospital and to encourage better infection prevention efforts.
TI  - Evaluation of the national Cleanyourhands campaign to reduce Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia and Clostridium difficile infection in hospitals in England and Wales by improved hand hygiene: four year, prospective, ecological, interrupted time series study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the Cleanyourhands campaign on rates of hospital procurement of alcohol hand rub and soap, report trends in selected healthcare associated infections, and investigate the association between infections and procurement. DESIGN: Prospective, ecological, interrupted time series study from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2008. SETTING: 187 acute trusts in England and Wales. INTERVENTION: Installation of bedside alcohol hand rub, materials promoting hand hygiene and institutional engagement, regular hand hygiene audits, rolled out nationally from 1 December 2004. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quarterly (that is, every three months) rates for each trust of hospital procurement of alcohol hand rub and liquid soap; Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (meticillin resistant (MRSA) and meticillin sensitive (MSSA)) and Clostridium difficile infection for each trust. Associations between procurement and infection rates assessed by mixed effect Poisson regression model (which also accounted for effect of bed occupancy, hospital type, and timing of other national interventions targeting these infections). RESULTS: Combined procurement of soap and alcohol hand rub tripled from 21.8 to 59.8 mL per patient bed day; procurement rose in association with each phase of the campaign. Rates fell for MRSA bacteraemia (1.88 to 0.91 cases per 10,000 bed days) and C difficile infection (16.75 to 9.49 cases). MSSA bacteraemia rates did not fall. Increased procurement of soap was independently associated with reduced C difficile infection throughout the study (adjusted incidence rate ratio for 1 mL increase per patient bed day 0.993, 95% confidence interval 0.990 to 0.996; P < 0.0001). Increased procurement of alcohol hand rub was independently associated with reduced MRSA bacteraemia, but only in the last four quarters of the study (0.990, 0.985 to 0.995; P < 0.0001). Publication of the Health Act 2006 was strongly associated with reduced MRSA bacteraemia (0.86, 0.75 to 0.98; P = 0.02) and C difficile infection (0.75, 0.67 to 0.84; P < 0.0001). Trust visits by Department of Health improvement teams were also associated with reduced MRSA bacteraemia (0.91, 0.83 to 0.99; P=0.03) and C difficile infection (0.80, 0.71 to 0.90; P=0.01), for at least two quarters after each visit. CONCLUSIONS: The Cleanyourhands campaign was associated with sustained increases in hospital procurement of alcohol rub and soap, which the results suggest has an important role in reducing rates of some healthcare associated infections. National interventions for infection control undertaken in the context of a high profile political drive can reduce selected healthcare associated infections.
TI  - Fluoroquinolones in the treatment of severe community-acquired.
AB  
TI  - The implications of hospital acquired adverse events on mortality, length of stay and costs for patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.
AB  - PURPOSE: The incidence of hospital acquired adverse events in radical cystectomy  and their implications for hospital outcomes and costs remain poorly described. We describe the incidence of hospital acquired adverse events in radical cystectomy, and characterize its relationship with in-hospital mortality, length of stay and hospitalization costs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 10,856 patients who underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer at 1,175 hospitals in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2001 to 2008. We used hospital claims to identify adverse events for accidental puncture, decubitus ulcer, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, surgical site infection and sepsis. Logistic regression and generalized estimating equation models were used to test the associations of hospital acquired adverse events with mortality, predicted prolonged length of stay and total hospitalization costs. RESULTS: Hospital acquired adverse events occurred in 11.3% of all patients undergoing radical cystectomy (1,228). Adverse events were associated with a higher odds of in-hospital death (OR 8.07, p<0.001), adjusted prolonged length of stay (41.3%) and total costs ($54,242 vs $26,306; p<0.001) compared to no adverse events on multivariate analysis. The incremental total costs attributable to hospital acquired adverse events were $43.8 million. Postoperative sepsis was associated with the highest risk of mortality (OR 17.56, p<0.001), predicted prolonged length of stay (62.22%) and adjusted total cost ($79,613). CONCLUSIONS: With hospital acquired adverse events occurring in approximately 11% of radical cystectomy cases, they pose a significant risk of in-hospital mortality and higher hospitalization costs. Therefore, increased attention is needed to reduce adverse events by improving patient safety, while understanding the economic implications for tertiary referral centers with possible policy changes such as denial of payment for hospital acquired adverse events.
TI  - In vivo activity of oritavancin in animal infection models and rationale for a new dosing regimen in humans.
AB  - Oritavancin is a novel glycopeptide antibiotic with concentration-dependent killing of Gram-positive cocci and pharmacokinetics characterized by extensive tissue distribution and a long terminal half-life. Its development was hindered by a 16- to 32-fold underestimation of activity against staphylococci and enterococci because of oritavancin's sticking to vials and tubes. Dose-fractionation studies in animal models suggested the peak concentration was the major index for efficacy. Once-daily intravenous administration of oritavancin was effective in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) endocarditis, penicillin-susceptible and cephalosporin-resistant pneumococcal meningitis in rabbits, staphylococcal and enterococcal central venous catheter infections in rats, and 24-hour postprophylaxis of inhaled anthrax in mice. Orally administered oritavancin was more effective than vancomycin in Clostridium difficile infection in hamsters. Pharmacodynamics suggested that a single dose of oritavancin at 1200 mg would be efficacious in humans. Simulation of this dose in neutropenic mice was highly effective in methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and MRSA thigh and bacteremia infections and pneumococcal lung infections.
TI  - Activity of a novel cyclic lipopeptide, CB-183,315, against resistant Clostridium difficile and other Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic intestinal pathogens.
AB  - We evaluated the activity of CB-183,315 against Clostridium difficile, including  strains that are resistant to fluoroquinolones and metronidazole and with elevated MICs to vancomycin as well as other Gram-positive intestinal pathogens. The MICs of CB-183,315 against all C. difficile isolates were </= 1 mug/ml. CB-183,315 had greater activity than vancomycin and metronidazole against C. difficile isolates and was more active than the comparators against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE). CB-183,315 also had excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), other Clostridium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - Certification in infection control matters: Impact of infection control department characteristics and policies on rates of multidrug-resistant infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study objective is to describe infection control policies aimed at multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) in California hospitals and assess the relationship among these policies, structural characteristics, and rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bloodstream infections and Clostridium difficile infections. METHODS: Data on infection control policies, structural characteristics, and MDRO rates were collected through a 2010 survey of California infection control departments. Bivariate and multivariable Poisson and negative binomial regressions were conducted. RESULTS: One hundred eighty hospitals provided data (response rate, 54%). Targeted MRSA screening upon admission was reported by the majority of hospitals (87%). The majority of hospitals implemented contact precautions for confirmed MDRO and C difficile patients; presumptive isolation/contact precautions for patients with pending screens were less frequently implemented. Few infection control policies were associated with lower MDRO rates. Hospitals with a certified infection control director had significantly lower rates of MRSA bloodstream infections (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Although most California hospitals are involved in activities to decrease MDRO, there is variation in specific activities utilized with the most focus placed on MRSA. This study highlights the importance of certification and its significant impact on infection rates. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings.
TI  - Discovery of LFF571: an investigational agent for Clostridium difficile infection.
AB  - Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a Gram positive, anaerobic bacterium that infects the lumen of the large intestine and produces toxins. This results in a range of syndromes from mild diarrhea to severe toxic megacolon and death. Alarmingly, the prevalence and severity of C. difficile infection are increasing; thus, associated morbidity and mortality rates are rising. 4-Aminothiazolyl analogues of the antibiotic natural product GE2270 A (1) were designed, synthesized, and optimized for the treatment of C. difficile infection. The medicinal chemistry effort focused on enhancing aqueous solubility relative to that of the natural product and previous development candidates (2, 3) and improving antibacterial activity. Structure-activity relationships, cocrystallographic interactions, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in animal models of infection were characterized. These studies identified a series of dicarboxylic acid derivatives, which enhanced solubility/efficacy profile by several orders of magnitude compared to previously studied compounds and led to the selection of LFF571 (4) as an investigational new drug for treating C. difficile infection.
TI  - Efficacy, efficiency and safety aspects of hydrogen peroxide vapour and aerosolized hydrogen peroxide room disinfection systems.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This was a head-to-head comparison of two hydrogen-peroxide-based room decontamination systems. AIM: To compare the efficacy, efficiency and safety of hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV; Clarus R, Bioquell, Andover, U.K.) and aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP; SR2, Sterinis, now supplied as Glosair, Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP), Johnson & Johnson Medical Ltd, Wokingham, U.K.) room disinfection systems. METHOD: Efficacy was tested using 4- and 6-log Geobacillus stearothermophilus biological indicators (BIs) and in-house prepared test discs containing approximately 10(6) meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile and Acinetobacter baumannii. Safety was assessed by detecting leakage of hydrogen peroxide using a hand-held detector. Efficiency was assessed by measuring the level of hydrogen peroxide using a hand-held sensor at three locations inside the room, 2 h after the start of the cycles. FINDINGS: HPV generally achieved a 6-log reduction, whereas aHP generally achieved less than a 4-log reduction on the BIs and in-house prepared test discs. Uneven distribution was evident for the aHP system but not the HPV system. Hydrogen peroxide leakage during aHP cycles with the door unsealed, as per the manufacturer's operating manual, exceeded the short-term exposure limit (2 ppm) for more than 2 h. When the door was sealed with tape, as per the HPV system, hydrogen peroxide leakage was <1 ppm for both systems. The mean concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the room 2 h after the cycle started was 1.3 [standard deviation (SD) 0.4] ppm and 2.8 (SD 0.8) ppm for the four HPV and aHP cycles, respectively. None of the readings were <2 ppm for the aHP cycles. CONCLUSION: The HPV system was safer, faster and more effective for biological inactivation.
TI  - Frequency of outbreak investigations in US hospitals: results of a national survey of infection preventionists.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A survey of infection preventionists was conducted to determine the frequency of outbreak investigations in US hospitals. METHODS: A 2-part electronic survey was sent to Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc, members in US hospitals in January 2010. Part 1 of the survey tool involved hospital demographics and the infection prevention/control program. Part 2 explored specific outbreak investigations allowing responses for up to 8 investigations within the previous 24 months. RESULTS: A final sample of 822 responses was analyzed representing 386 outbreak investigations in 289 US hospitals. Nearly 60% of the outbreaks were caused by 4 organisms: norovirus (18%), Staphylococcus aureus (17%), Acinetobactor spp (14%), and Clostridium difficile (10%). Norovirus occurred most often in behavioral health and rehabilitation/long-term acute care units, whereas the other organisms occurred in medical/surgical units. Unit/department closure was reported in 22.6% of investigations and most often associated with norovirus. Outbreak investigations are triggered by unusual organisms, rate above baseline for specific site of infection, and rate above baseline for specific unit. Investigations were most frequently conducted in community/nonteaching hospitals and facilities with 201 to 300 beds. Mean number of confirmed cases was 10; mean duration was 58 days. CONCLUSION: Norovirus is emerging as an increasingly common hospital-associated organism causing outbreaks in nonacute settings and may lead to unit/department closures.
TI  - Clostridium difficile: the anaerobe that made the grade.
AB  - Unlike other anaerobic bacteria of clinical importance, Clostridium difficile has managed to enter into the realm of public awareness. Following the trail blazed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), C. difficile has made the transition from being an obscure anaerobic bacterium, mainly of interest to specialist anaerobic microbiologists, to that of an infamous "superbug" responsible for outbreaks of hospital-acquired infection that commonly result in serious disease and death. This report picks out key moments, particularly in the UK, which tracked the rise in both the public and political awareness of this organism.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of LFF571 against Clostridium difficile and 630 other intestinal strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of LFF571, a novel analog of GE2270A that inhibits bacterial growth by binding with high affinity for protein synthesis elongation factor Tu, fidaxomicin, and 10 other antimicrobial agents were determined against 50 strains of Clostridium difficile and 630 other anaerobic and aerobic organisms of intestinal origin. LFF571 possesses potent activity against C. difficile and most other Gram-positive anaerobes (MIC(90), </= 0.25 mug/ml), with the exception of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. The MIC(90)s for aerobes, including enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus (as well as methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA] isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, and other streptococci were 0.06, 0.125, 2, and 8 mug/ml, respectively. Comparatively, fidaxomicin showed variable activity against Gram-positive organisms: MIC(90)s against C. difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Bifidobacterium spp. were 0.5, </= 0.015, and 0.125 mug/ml, respectively, but >32 mug/ml against Clostridium ramosum and Clostridium innocuum. MIC(90) for S. pyogenes and other streptococci was 16 and >32 mug/ml, respectively. LFF571 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against Gram-negative anaerobes.
TI  - Clostridium difficile infection prevention: biotherapeutics, immunologics, and vaccines.
AB  - We are in the midst of a resurgence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in North America and Europe for which morbidity and mortality are higher than ever seen. C. difficile has risen in frequency to become the most common healthcare-associated infection pathogen, exceeding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in many hospitals. Protection against CDI is thought to be mediated first by the normal bacterial microbiota, supplemented by an adaptive immune antibody response directed primarily at C. difficile toxins. Treatment of CDI is with antimicrobials that also further disrupt the protective bacterial microbiota leaving the patient susceptible to recurrent CDI. In addition, patients most susceptible to CDI, the advanced elderly, may already have a limited immune response and fail to increase their adaptive immune response with infection. The importance of both of these protective modalities has been demonstrated by 1) the success of fecal microbiota to restore "colonization resistance" for patients with multiple recurrences of CDI, and 2) the marked reduction in CDI recurrences with the use of intravenous monoclonal antibodies directed against toxin A and toxin B as an adjunct to antimicrobial treatment. Anti-toxin vaccines, passive monoclonal anti-toxin antibodies, and non-toxigenic C. difficile (to restore colonization resistance) are already undergoing patient clinical trials. The opportunity to prevent CDI is compelling and future research should focus on understanding the critical elements of the microbiota needed to restore colonization resistance and on development of novel immunologic strategies that include systemic and mucosal vaccines and passive immune modulators.
TI  - Evaluation of stethoscopes as vectors of Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  
TI  - Application of activity-based protein profiling to the study of microbial pathogenesis.
AB  - Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) is a powerful technology for the dissection of dynamic and complex enzyme interactions. The mechanisms involved in microbial pathogenesis are an example of just such a system, with a plethora of highly regulated enzymatic interactions between the infecting organism and its host. In this review we will discuss some of the cutting-edge applications of ABPP to the study of bacterial and parasitic pathogenesis and virulence, with an emphasis on Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, quorum sensing, and malaria.
TI  - Durability of silver nanoparticulate films within a silica matrix by flame assisted chemical vapour deposition for biocidal applications.
AB  - Healthcare acquired infection (HCAI) rates have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years and been a major priority for health professionals in the UK and elsewhere. Of particular concern is the rise of so called 'superbugs', or those resistant to conventional antibiotics, such as Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The reasons for this rise are many and complex, but one important factor is bacterial survival rates on wards and other hospital areas. In this respect, nanostructured biocidal surfaces offer a potentially powerful weapon in the fight against HCAI. In addition to providing a toxic environment to a range of infectious disease-causing bacteria (while remaining harmless to human health), any potential bioactive coated surface is required to be durable enough to withstand regular hospital cleaning methods without a reduction in biocidal activity over time and be economically viable to mass produce. The flame assisted chemical vapour deposition (FACVD) of silver and silver/silica films offer a means of producing such surfaces. In this work, we report investigations into a wide range of experimental factors and parameters affecting film durability, including burner head design and relative water vapour content in the flame environment. The produced films were assessed in terms of durability (by scratch testing) and relative silver content using glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES).
TI  - Recognition of greater diversity of Bacillus species and related bacteria in human faeces.
AB  - In a study looking at culturable aerobic Actinobacteria associated with the human gastrointestinal tract, the vast majority of isolates obtained from dried human faeces belonged to the genus Bacillus and related bacteria. A total of 124 isolates were recovered from the faeces of 10 healthy adult donors. 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses showed the majority belonged to the families Bacillaceae (n=81) and Paenibacillaceae (n=3), with Bacillus species isolated from all donors. Isolates tentatively identified as Bacillus clausii (n=32) and Bacillus licheniformis (n=28) were recovered most frequently, with the genera Lysinibacillus, Ureibacillus, Oceanobacillus, Ornithinibacillus and Virgibacillus represented in some donors. Phenotypic data confirmed the identities of isolates belonging to well-characterized species. Representatives of the phylum Actinobacteria were recovered in much lower numbers (n=11). Many of the bacilli exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more strains of Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, with some (n=12) found to have no detectable cytopathic effect on HEp-2 cells. This study has revealed greater diversity within gut-associated aerobic spore-formers than previous studies, and suggests that bacilli with potential as probiotics could be isolated from the human gut.
TI  - The anti-sigma factor TcdC modulates hypervirulence in an epidemic BI/NAP1/027 clinical isolate of Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Nosocomial infections are increasingly being recognised as a major patient safety issue. The modern hospital environment and associated health care practices have provided a niche for the rapid evolution of microbial pathogens that are well adapted to surviving and proliferating in this setting, after which they can infect susceptible patients. This is clearly the case for bacterial pathogens such as Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) species, both of which have acquired resistance to antimicrobial agents as well as enhanced survival and virulence properties that present serious therapeutic dilemmas for treating physicians. It has recently become apparent that the spore-forming bacterium Clostridium difficile also falls within this category. Since 2000, there has been a striking increase in C. difficile nosocomial infections worldwide, predominantly due to the emergence of epidemic or hypervirulent isolates that appear to possess extended antibiotic resistance and virulence properties. Various hypotheses have been proposed for the emergence of these strains, and for their persistence and increased virulence, but supportive experimental data are lacking. Here we describe a genetic approach using isogenic strains to identify a factor linked to the development of hypervirulence in C. difficile. This study provides evidence that a naturally occurring mutation in a negative regulator of toxin production, the anti-sigma factor TcdC, is an important factor in the development of hypervirulence in epidemic C. difficile isolates, presumably because the mutation leads to significantly increased toxin production, a contentious hypothesis until now. These results have important implications for C. difficile pathogenesis and virulence since they suggest that strains carrying a similar mutation have the inherent potential to develop a hypervirulent phenotype.
TI  - Fluoroquinolones, antimicrobial resistance and neutropenic cancer patients.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are widely used in our communities and healthcare facilities. This review focuses upon the relationship between fluoroquinolone use and the rising prevalence in neutropenic cancer patients of multidrug resistant pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Clostridium difficile, and aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. RECENT FINDINGS: Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin are efficacious for the prevention and treatment of neutropenic fever syndromes, including infections due to aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. Recent clinical practice guidelines recommend their prophylactic use in acute leukaemia patients receiving intensive remission-induction, postremission consolidation, or salvage induction therapy, and haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients during pre-engraftment when the duration of profound neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <0.1 x 10(9)/l) is at least 7 days. These same agents combined with amoxicillin/clavulanate are recommended for oral outpatient empirical antibacterial treatment of febrile neutropenic patients at low risk for medical complications. Fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae is linked to community fluoroquinolone consumption. Prophylaxis efficacy is reduced when the prevalence of fluoroquinolone Gram-negative bacillary resistance exceeds 20%. Widespread use encourages the transmissibility of multiclass antimicrobial resistance genes among Gram-negative bacilli. Fluoroquinolone-driven colonization with MRSA enhances the risk of subsequent infection, the use of vancomycin, and risk of colonization by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. The relative roles of widespread fluoroquinolone use and ineffective infection prevention and control practices in encouraging the spread of virulent C. difficile-associated diarrhoea in healthcare facilities remain controversial. SUMMARY: Widespread use of antibacterial agents of one class can encourage multiclass drug resistance, which reduces prophylaxis and treatment efficacy in neutropenic cancer patients.
TI  - Implementation and outcomes of a hospital-wide computerised antimicrobial stewardship programme in a large medical centre in Taiwan.
AB  - Antibiotic stewardship is important to address the problem of antimicrobial resistance, but a practical and sustainable strategy to provide stewardship in a large hospital setting is lacking. We developed a hospital-wide computerised antimicrobial approval system (HCAAS) to guide the use of antimicrobial agents in late 2004 in a 3500-bed medical centre in Taiwan. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of HCAAS on the hospital from 2003 to 2009. Following HCAAS deployment, the gradients of consumption over time during the study period of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides fell significantly, whilst that of carbapenems increased. The amount and expenditure of antimicrobial use did not increase with the overall healthcare-associated infection rate, and inpatient mortality rate remained stable with a slight decreasing trend. The rate of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus started to decline in 2002 and continued after HCAAS deployment. There was an increasing isolation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, presumably leading to the increased use of carbapenems. The isolation rate of Clostridium difficile from patients who developed diarrhoea after antimicrobial therapy did not change over the years, with a mean annual rate of 10.0% after the implementation of HCAAS. HCAAS along with strict infection control measures is necessary to reduce the spread of resistant organisms within the hospital. HCAAS is a sustainable system for providing antibiotic stewardship and exerts a positive impact on the hospital by reducing antimicrobial consumption and expenditure whilst not compromising healthcare quality.
TI  - Relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens by infection site at a university hospital from 1980 to 2008.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We describe the relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens by infection site over 29 years using hospital-wide surveillance data from a large academic hospital. METHODS: Comprehensive hospital-wide surveillance was provided by trained infection preventionists using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions. Five 5-year blocks and one 4-year block were created for each site: bloodstream infections (BSI), urinary tract infections (UTI), respiratory tract infections (RTI), and surgical site infections (SSI). The blocks of relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens were compared by chi(2) analysis, and trends for each pathogen were estimated by regression analysis. RESULTS: At least 1 pathogen was isolated from 28,208 (83.5%) of 33,797 health care-associated infections (HAI). Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Enterococcus species, and Clostridium difficile and other anaerobes significantly increased, whereas Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, and other streptococci significantly decreased in the relative proportion of pathogens during the study period. By infection site, results showed significant increasing trends of S aureus in UTI, RTI, and SSI; CoNS in BSI and SSI; Candida in SSI; and Enterococcus in BSI and UTI. CONCLUSION: Significant changes in relative frequency of health care-associated pathogens by infection site occurred over the 29-year period. These findings have implications for implementation of infection prevention strategies.
TI  - Trends in antimicrobial resistance in intensive care units in the United States.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Antimicrobial resistance and a paucity of new antimicrobial agents are ongoing challenges. This review focuses on the major epidemiologic trends and novel treatments, when available, for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, Clostridium difficile, and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in the United States during 2010-2011. RECENT FINDINGS: MRSA bloodstream infection rates have declined, primarily due to interventions aimed at decreasing vascular catheter infections. The proportion of MRSA due to the community-associated strain USA300 continues to increase. Recent studies of active surveillance and contact isolation for MRSA prevention provide conflicting views of efficacy. Two novel treatments for recurrent C. difficile infection, monoclonal antibodies and fidaxomicin, show promising results. Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-negative bacilli has become widespread; extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are now commonly found among Escherichia coli causing community-acquired infections in the United States. Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases have spread beyond the northeast, and the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase has been reported in multiple countries within a few years of its discovery. SUMMARY: Antimicrobial resistance, particularly among Gram-negative bacilli, continues to increase at a rapid rate. Given the frequent transfer of patients between outpatient and acute care settings, as well as between different geographic regions, coordinated infection control interventions are warranted.
TI  - Control of an outbreak of diarrhoea in a vascular surgery unit caused by a high-level clindamycin-resistant Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 106.
AB  - This report describes an outbreak of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in a vascular surgery ward in 2009 caused by a high-level clindamycin-resistant ribotype 106. A case of CDI was defined as a patient with diarrhoea, positive for C. difficile toxin and negative for other enteric pathogens. Cultures were sent to the Scottish Salmonella Shigella and Clostridium difficile Reference Laboratory (SSSCDRL) for PCR ribotyping, antibiotic susceptibility testing and PCR detection of ermB. The mean age of the nine patients was 73 years (range: 38-90 years). All had received clindamycin and ciprofloxacin. All cases were typed as PCR ribotype 106 and they showed high-level resistance to clindamycin. Five of these isolates were tested by PCR for the presence of the ermB gene and no amplification was detected. This strain has rarely been isolated from patients on this ward. The outbreak was controlled successfully by closure of the ward with terminal cleaning, reinforcement of infection control precautions and the introduction of a new antibiotic policy. It is notable that this outbreak was caused by a strain with high-level clindamycin resistance not mediated by ermB. It also re-emphasizes that outbreaks of CDI can be caused by C. difficile PCR ribotypes other than 027. The outbreak was most likely associated with the use of clindamycin and ciprofloxacin cross-infection with spores in this environment. Implementation of strict infection control precautions, antimicrobial stewardship and enhanced environmental cleaning are key components in managing such an outbreak successfully. The number of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acquisitions also fell substantially after these interventions.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - Early colonization with a group of Lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. The aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of age. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. DNA was extracted from the fecal samples and Real time PCR, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of Bifidobacterium (B.) adolescentis, B. breve, B. bifidum, Clostridium (C.) difficile, a group of Lactobacilli (Lactobacillus (L.) casei, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus) as well as Staphylococcus (S.) aureus. Infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by Lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). However, non-allergic five-year olds acquired Lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). Further the non-allergic children were colonized with Lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). Also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with B. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: In this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early Lactobacilli (L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus) colonization seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
TI  - Fidaxomicin: first-in-class macrocyclic antibiotic.
AB  - The incidence of Clostridium difficile has doubled over the past 15 years, and rising mortality rates associated with this infection have followed in its wake. C. difficile infection (CDI) has supplanted methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the major cause of nosocomial infection. An insufficient response rate to currently available CDI therapies has prompted the search for new and alternative treatment modalities for this disease. The investigational pipeline includes evaluation of new antimicrobial agents that exhibit good activity against C. difficile without altering normal gut flora, C. difficile toxin-absorbing compounds, and preformed antibodies and vaccines against C. difficile toxin. In two robust clinical trials comparing fidaxomicin to vancomycin in the treatment of CDI, treatment with fidaxomicin demonstrated a superior global cure (cure without recurrence) rate compared with the current gold standard, vancomycin. Fidaxomicin, the first of a new class of macrocyclic antimicrobial agents, represents an advance in the management of CDI.
TI  - A call to arms: the imperative for antimicrobial stewardship.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a major public health crisis. The prevalence of drug-resistant organisms, such as the emerging NAP1 strain of Clostridium difficile, now highly resistant to fluoroquinolones, Acinetobacter species, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is increasing nationwide. The sources of antimicrobial resistance are manifold, but there is a well-documented causal relationship between antimicrobial use and misuse and the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. As the development of new antimicrobial agents is on the decline, the medical community, across all specialties and in conjunction with public health services, must develop and implement programs and strategies designed to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of the existing antimicrobial armamentarium. Such strategies are collectively known as antimicrobial stewardship programs and have the potential to minimize the emergence of resistant pathogens.
TI  - Mortality and associated risk factors in consecutive patients admitted to a UK NHS trust with community acquired bacteraemia.
AB  - PURPOSE: Within the UK, there is lack of contemporary data on clinical outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with severe community acquired infection. The purpose of this study was to determine outcomes and risk factors associated with mortality in consecutive patients admitted to a UK NHS trust with community acquired infections that cause bacteraemia. METHODS: From September 2007 to August 2008, demographic, clinical and microbiological data were collected on patients with laboratory confirmed bacteraemia. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between predicted variables and likelihood of death. RESULTS: 686 bacteraemic episodes occurred in 681 patients. The most common sites of infection were non-catheter associated urinary tract infections (140, 20.4%) and biliary tract infections (62, 9.1%). The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (238, 34.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (84, 12.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (40, 5.8%). Of the E coli infections, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers accounted for 21/238 (8.8%), and of the S aureus infections, methicillin resistant S aureus (MRSA) accounted for 14/84 (16.7%). 124 (18.2%, 95% CI 15.3% to 21.1%) people died within 7 days and 170 (25.0%, 95% CI 21.7% to 28.2%) within 30 days. Age (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.54 to 3.06), Charlson comorbidity index (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.34), and Pitt score (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.67) were highly significantly associated with 30 day mortality (p<0.001). Delay in appropriate antibiotic treatment (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.75) and an undefined site of infection (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.53) were less significantly associated with 30 day mortality (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The 30 day mortality rate in consecutive patients with community acquired bacteraemic infection was 25.0%. These figures could be used as performance indicators to compare outcomes in different UK NHS trusts. With the exception of delay in appropriate antibiotic treatment, predictors of mortality at 30 days were non-modifiable.
TI  - Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus shedding by slaughter-age pigs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are critical human pathogens and of increasing concern in food animals. Because of the apparent impact of age on prevalence of these organisms, studies of slaughter age pigs are important when considering the potential for contamination of food. This study evaluated C. difficile and MRSA shedding by slaughter age pigs from farms across Canada. RESULTS: Clostridium difficile was isolated from 30/436 (6.9%) samples from 15/45 (33%) farms. After adjusting for clustering at the herd level, the prevalence was 3.4%. Ribotype 078 (toxinotype V, North American Pulsotype 7) was the most common strain, accounting for 67% of isolates. MRSA was isolated from 21/460 (4.6%) pigs from 5/46 (11%) farms. The prevalence in pigs after adjusting for clustering at the herd level was 0.2%. Seven different spa types were identified, with 3 related spa types (t011, t034, new) accounting for 16 (76%) consistent with ST398 predominating. Both MRSA and C. difficile samples were collected from 45 farms. Both MRSA and C. difficile were detected on 2 (4.4%), with C. difficile only on 13 (29%), MRSA only on 3 (6.7%) and neither on 27 (60%). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of C. difficile and MRSA in slaughter age pigs was relatively low, particularly in comparison with studies involving younger pigs. The predominance of C. difficile ribotype 078 and MRSA ST398 was not surprising, but there was diversity in strain types and the majority of isolates of both organisms were strains that can be found in humans. While the prevalence of C. difficile and MRSA in slaughter age pigs was relatively low, there is clearly potential for contamination of meat from healthy pigs carrying this pathogen into slaughterhouses.
TI  - The impact of recombination on dN/dS within recently emerged bacterial clones.
AB  - The development of next-generation sequencing platforms is set to reveal an unprecedented level of detail on short-term molecular evolutionary processes in bacteria. Here we re-analyse genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets for recently emerged clones of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile. We note a highly significant enrichment of synonymous SNPs in those genes which have been affected by recombination, i.e. those genes on mobile elements designated "non-core" (in the case of S. aureus), or those core genes which have been affected by homologous replacements (S. aureus and C. difficile). This observation suggests that the previously documented decrease in dN/dS over time in bacteria applies not only to genomes of differing levels of divergence overall, but also to horizontally acquired genes of differing levels of divergence within a single genome. We also consider the role of increased drift acting on recently emerged, highly specialised clones, and the impact of recombination on selection at linked sites. This work has implications for a wide range of genomic analyses.
TI  - [The use of immunoglobulins in the treatment of infectious diseases].
AB  - The use of immunoglobulins in the treatment of infectious diseases has a long tradition. Initially immunoglobulins from hyperimmunised animals were used for their antitoxic and antimicrobial activity. The development of preparations of human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and the observations of their long-term use enabled to assess their usefulness in the treatment of the diseases of proven or probable infectious etiology. In the treatment of infectious diseases IVIG are currently used as immunomodulating drugs or immunosuppressive therapy, more frequently than the specific antibodies against the viruses, bacteria or their toxins. In practice of the infectious ward IVIG are used as a drug of choice in the treatment of Kawasaki disease, in toxic epidermolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. As adjunctive therapy IVIG are used in the infection with parvovirus B19, in hemophagocytic syndrome, for treatment of infections presenting with a severe toxemia caused by Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The rationale for the use of IVIG may be also serious infections caused by enteroviruses, particularly neuroinfections. The use of IVIG in the treatment of sepsis is controversial, since their effectiveness is not proven.
TI  - Evaluation of hospitalization for infections that are present on admission.
AB  - Hospitals have experienced increasing requirements for public reporting of various infection rates using clinical and administrative data. Until recently, such reports have not included analysis of "present on admission" (POA), an indicator designed to assess whether such infections are hospital acquired. The authors evaluated the frequency of the POA coding designation for 167 University HealthSystem Consortium hospitals for sepsis/septicemia (S-S), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The authors found that 70% of hospitalizations of patients with S-S, 86% of patients with MRSA, and 67% of patients with CDI had these conditions coded POA. The authors recommend that public reporting of hospital infection rates include POA status and that all health care organizations and providers should work more closely together to identify early and prevent such serious infections.
TI  - The role played by contaminated surfaces in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - Studies in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that environmental surface contamination played a negligible role in the endemic transmission of healthcare-associated infections. However, recent studies have demonstrated that several major nosocomial pathogens are shed by patients and contaminate hospital surfaces at concentrations sufficient for transmission, survive for extended periods, persist despite attempts to disinfect or remove them, and can be transferred to the hands of healthcare workers. Evidence is accumulating that contaminated surfaces make an important contribution to the epidemic and endemic transmission of Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and norovirus and that improved environmental decontamination contributes to the control of outbreaks. Efforts to improve environmental hygiene should include enhancing the efficacy of cleaning and disinfection and reducing the shedding of pathogens. Further high-quality studies are needed to clarify the role played by surfaces in nosocomial transmission and to determine the effectiveness of different interventions in reducing associated infection rates.
TI  - Tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. It is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant Clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). Conjugative transposons of the Tn916/Tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. The ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.
TI  - Advantages and challenges of increased antimicrobial copper use and copper mining.
AB  - Copper is a highly utilized metal for electrical, automotive, household objects,  and more recently as an effective antimicrobial surface. Copper-containing solutions applied to fruits and vegetables can prevent bacterial and fungal infections. Bacteria, such as Salmonellae and Cronobacter sakazakii, often found in food contamination, are rapidly killed on contact with copper alloys. The antimicrobial effectiveness of copper alloys in the healthcare environment against bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Clostridium difficile has been described recently. The use of copper and copper-containing materials will continue to expand and may lead to an increase in copper mining and production. However, the copper mining and manufacturing industry and the consumer do not necessarily enjoy a favorable relationship. Open pit mining, copper mine tailings, leaching products, and deposits of toxic metals in the environment often raises concerns and sometimes public outrage. In addition, consumers may fear that copper alloys utilized as antimicrobial surfaces in food production will lead to copper toxicity in humans. Therefore, there is a need to mitigate some of the negative effects of increased copper use and copper mining. More thermo-tolerant, copper ion-resistant microorganisms could improve copper leaching and lessen copper groundwater contamination. Copper ion-resistant bacteria associated with plants might be useful in biostabilization and phytoremediation of copper-contaminated environments. In this review, recent progress in microbiological and biotechnological aspects of microorganisms in contact with copper will be presented and discussed, exploring their role in the improvement for the industries involved as well as providing better environmental outcomes.
TI  - Country-to-country transfer of patients and the risk of multi-resistant bacterial infection.
AB  - Management of patients with a history of healthcare contact in multiple countries is now a reality for many clinicians. Leisure tourism, the burgeoning industry of medical tourism, military conflict, natural disasters, and changing patterns of human migration may all contribute to this emerging epidemiological trend. Such individuals may be both vectors and victims of healthcare-associated infection with multiresistant bacteria. Current literature describes intercountry transfer of multiresistant Acinetobacter spp and Klebsiella pneumoniae (including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase- and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and hypervirulent Clostridium difficile. Introduction of such organisms to new locations has led to their dissemination within hospitals. Healthcare institutions should have sound infection prevention strategies to mitigate the risk of dissemination of multiresistant organisms from patients who have been admitted to hospitals in other countries. Clinicians may also need to individualize empiric prescribing patterns to reflect the risk of multiresistant organisms in these patients.
TI  - Reduction in the microbial load on high-touch surfaces in hospital rooms by treatment with a portable saturated steam vapor disinfection system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent scientific literature suggests that portable steam vapor systems are capable of rapid, chemical-free surface disinfection in controlled laboratory studies. This study evaluated the efficacy of a portable steam vapor system in a hospital setting. METHODS: The study was carried out in 8 occupied rooms of a long-term care wing of a hospital. Six surfaces per room were swabbed before and after steam treatment and analyzed for heterotrophic plate count (HPC), total coliforms, methicillin-intermediate and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MISA and MRSA), and Clostridium difficile. RESULTS: The steam vapor device consistently reduced total microbial and pathogen loads on hospital surfaces, to below detection in most instances. Treatment reduced the presence of total coliforms on surfaces from 83% (40/48) to 13% (6/48). Treatment reduced presumptive MISA (12/48) and MRSA (3/48) to below detection after cleaning, except for 1 posttreatment isolation of MISA (1/48). A single C difficile colony was isolated from a door push panel before treatment, but no C difficile was detected after treatment. CONCLUSION: The steam vapor system reduced bacterial levels by >90% and reduced pathogen levels on most surfaces to below the detection limit. The steam vapor system provides a means to reduce levels of microorganisms on hospital surfaces without the drawbacks associated with chemicals, and may decrease the risk of cross-contamination.
TI  - Use of alternative or adjuvant pharmacologic treatment strategies in the prevention and treatment of Clostridium difficile infection.
AB  - Infection with Clostridium difficile is currently the leading cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients, and recent surveillance data indicate that C. difficile has surpassed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the number one cause of hospital-acquired infections in some areas of the USA. In addition, concern over C. difficile has increased over the past decade due to the appearance of new hypervirulent strains. Metronidazole and vancomycin have remained the treatments of choice for initial therapy of primary infection with C. difficile for the past 25 years, but the persistence of spores leads to a recurrence of infection in an estimated 20-25% of patients. Patients who have one recurrent episode have up to a 65% chance of having additional recurrence. While the judicious use of antimicrobials in accordance with antibiotic stewardship guidelines remains the most effective method for the control of C. difficile, the high recurrence rate, increasing incidence, and changing epidemiology of C. difficile has led to an increased interest in the study of alternative strategies for the prevention and treatment of C. difficile disease. These alternative strategies attempt to eliminate C. difficile spores, replenish the normal gut flora, reduce the C. difficile toxin load in the bowel, or bolster the patient's own immune response to the C. difficile toxins. To evaluate the available evidence on these alternative strategies, we conducted a literature search of MEDLINE (1966-March 2011) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-March 2011). Available citations from these articles were also utilized. The aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence for alternative treatment strategies for C. difficile disease and to make recommendations for their place in therapy.
TI  - Effectiveness of a novel ozone-based system for the rapid high-level disinfection of health care spaces and surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vapor-based fumigant systems for disinfection of health care surfaces and spaces is an evolving technology. A new system (AsepticSure) uses an ozone-based process to create a highly reactive oxidative vapor with broad and high-level antimicrobial properties. METHODS: Ozone gas at 50-500 ppm was combined with 3% hydrogen peroxide vapor in a test chamber and upscaled in rooms measuring 82 m3 and 90 m3 in area. Test organisms included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium difficile, and Bacillus subtilis spores dried onto steel discs or cotton gauze pads. RESULTS: The combination of 80-ppm ozone with 1% hydrogen peroxide vapor achieved a very high level of disinfection, with a >/=6 log10 reduction in the bacteria and spores tested on steel discs and MRSA tested on cotton gauze during a 30- to 90-minute exposure. The entire system was scalable such that it achieved the same high level of disinfection in both the 81-m3 and 90-m3 rooms in 60-90 minutes. CONCLUSION: The ozone hydrogen peroxide vapor system provides a very high level of disinfection of steel and gauze surfaces against health care-associated bacterial pathogens. The system is an advanced oxidative process providing a rapid and effective means of disinfecting health care surfaces and spaces.
TI  - Providers' beliefs and behaviors regarding antibiotic prescribing and antibiotic  resistance in persons with spinal cord injury or disorder.
AB  - CONTEXT: Persons with spinal cord injury or disorder (SCI/D) are at increased risk for antibiotic resistance because of recurrent infections and subsequent use of antibiotics. However, there are no studies focused on providers who care for these patients and their perceptions regarding antibiotic use and resistance. OBJECTIVE: To characterize SCI/D provider behavior and attitudes about antibiotic prescribing and resistance. DESIGN/METHODS: Anonymous internet-based, cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 314 SCI/D clinicians who prescribe antibiotics (physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners). RESULTS: A total of 118 providers responded (37.6% response rate) including 80 physicians, 20 nurse practitioners, and 18 physician assistants. The majority of respondents agreed with statements regarding the societal impact of antibiotic resistance; only 17.8% agreed that they prescribed antibiotics more than they should, but 61.0% agreed that patient demand was a major reason for prescribing unnecessary antibiotics. The most frequent problematic organisms reported were: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (83.1%), multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas (61.0%), and Clostridium difficile (57.6%). The most frequent antibiotics selected for outpatient treatment of community-acquired pneumonia treatment, based on a clinical scenario were azithromycin (36.4%) and respiratory fluoroquinolones (22.9%). CONCLUSION: These data show that the respondents are aware of and concerned with the problem of antibiotic resistance in their practice. Clinician respondents also endorsed the need to improve their own knowledge and that of their colleagues regarding appropriate antibiotic prescribing. These findings suggest that interventions should focus on provider education, particularly regarding appropriate antibiotic prescribing.
TI  - Systematic review of measurement and adjustment for colonization pressure in studies of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and clostridium difficile acquisition.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Colonization pressure is an important infection control metric. The aim of this study was to describe the definition and measurement of and adjustment for colonization pressure in nosocomial-acquisition risk factor studies of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and Clostridium difficile. METHODS: We performed a computerized search of studies of nosocomial MRSA, VRE, and C. difficile acquisition published before July 1, 2009, through MEDLINE. Studies were included if a study outcome was MRSA, VRE, or C. difficile acquisition; the authors identified risk factors associated with MRSA, VRE, or C. difficile acquisition; and the study measured colonization pressure. RESULTS: The initial MEDLINE search yielded 505 articles. Sixty-six of these were identified as studies of nosocomial MRSA, VRE, or C. difficile acquisition; of these, 18 (27%) measured colonization pressure and were included in the final review. The definition of colonization pressure varied considerably between studies: the proportion of MRSA- or VRE-positive patients (5 studies), the proportion of MRSA- or VRE-positive patient-days (6 studies), or the total or mean number of MRSA-, VRE-, or C. difficile-positive patients or patient-days (7 studies) in the unit over periods of varying length. In 10 of 13 studies, colonization pressure was independently associated with MRSA, VRE, or C. difficile acquisition. CONCLUSION: There is a need for a simple and consistent method to quantify colonization pressure in both research and routine clinical care to accurately assess the effect of colonization pressure on cross-transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Infectious diseases in the critically ill patients.
AB  - Infection is common in the critically ill and often results due to the severity of the patient's illness. Recent data suggest 51% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients are infected, and 71% receive antimicrobial therapy. Bacterial infection is the primary concern, although some fungal infections are opportunistic. Infection more than doubles the ICU mortality rate, and the costs associated with infection may be as high as 40% of total ICU expenditures. There are many contemporary antimicrobial resistance concerns that the critical care clinician must consider in managing the pharmacotherapy of infection. Methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin resistance in Enterococci, beta-lactamase resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species, fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia coli, and fungal resistance are among the most common issues ICU clinician's must face in managing infection. Critical illness causes changes in pharmacokinetics that influence drug and dosing considerations. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion may all be affected by the various disease states that define critical illness. Several specific diseases are discussed, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, various fungal infections, gastrointestinal infections due to Clostridium difficile, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections. Within each disease section, discussion includes causes and prevention strategies, microbiology, evidence-based guidelines, and important caveats.
TI  - Assessing the efficacy of different microfibre cloths at removing surface micro-organisms associated with healthcare-associated infections.
AB  - This study investigated the ability of 10 different microfibre cloths to remove microbial contamination from three surfaces commonly found in hospital settings (stainless steel, furniture laminate and ceramic tile), under controlled laboratory conditions. Tests were conducted using organisms known to cause healthcare-associated infections, i.e. meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile (in spore form) and Escherichia coli. For all the cloths tested, there was significant statistical evidence to suggest a difference in cleaning performance between them on first and single use (P<0.001). However, the overall performance of the nine re-useable cloths did not differ in practice with differences in log(1)(0) reductions of <1. The performance of the disposable microfibre cloth was notably worse. The performance of all cloths decreased with repeated use on a succession of contaminated surfaces. After repeated washing, re-usable cloth performance improved at 75 washes, and reduced after 150 washes, although, in most instances, performance after 150 washes was better than at first wash. For all cloths, price was not an indication of performance. Based on these laboratory findings, it is concluded that use of the microfibre cloths investigated is an effective way to reduce the levels of MRSA, E. coli and C. difficile (in spore form) on a range of surfaces found in the clinical environment and could therefore be of benefit to these environments.
TI  - Impact of chlorhexidine bathing on hospital-acquired infections among general medical patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A paucity of data exists regarding the effectiveness of daily chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) bathing in non-intensive care unit (ICU) settings. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of daily CHG bathing in a non-ICU setting to reduce methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enteroccocus (VRE) hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), compared with daily bathing with soap and water. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental study design; the primary outcome was the composite incidence of MRSA and VRE HAIs. Clostridium difficile HAI incidence was measured as a nonequivalent dependent variable with which to assess potential confounders. SETTING: Four general medicine units, with a total of 94 beds, at a 719-bed academic tertiary-care facility in Providence, Rhode Island. PATIENTS: A total of 7,102 and 7,699 adult patients were admitted to the medical service in the control and intervention groups, respectively. Patients admitted from January 1 through December 31, 2008, were bathed daily with soap and water (control group), and those admitted from February 1, 2009, through March 31, 2010, were bathed daily with CHG-impregnated cloths (intervention group). RESULTS: Daily bathing with CHG was associated with a 64% reduced risk of developing the primary outcome, namely, the composite incidence of MRSA and VRE HAIs (hazard ratio, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.2-0.8]; P = .01). There was no change in the incidence of C. difficile HAIs (P = .6). Colonization with MRSA was associated with an increased risk of developing a MRSA HAI (hazard ratio, 8 [95% CI, 3-19]; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Daily CHG bathing was associated with a reduced HAI risk, using a composite endpoint of MRSA and VRE HAIs, in a general medical inpatient population.
TI  - Comparison of the burdens of hospital-onset, healthcare facility-associated Clostridium difficile Infection and of healthcare-associated infection due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in community hospitals.
AB  - We sought to determine the burden of nosocomial Clostridium difficile infection in comparison to other healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in community hospitals participating in an infection control network. Our data suggest that C. difficile has replaced MRSA as the most common etiology of HAI in community hospitals in the southeastern United States.
TI  - Implications for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus colonization associated with Clostridium difficile infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) colonization of the gastrointestinal tract shares similar risk factors with Clostridium difficile infection. We sought to elucidate the prevalence and risk factors of VRE colonization associated with C difficile infection. METHODS: All adult inpatients with C difficile infection from July 2006 to October 2006 were prospectively evaluated. All C difficile toxin-positive stool samples were screened for detection of VRE. Risk factors for VRE colonization were compared in patients with C difficile infection with and without VRE colonization. RESULTS: Of the 158 cases of C difficile infection evaluated, 88 (55.7%) involved VRE colonization. Independent risk factors for VRE colonization were admission from long-term care facilities (P = .013), dementia (P = .017), and hospitalization in the previous 2 months (P = .014). No statistically significant difference between C difficile infection cases with and without VRE colonization in terms of previous receipt (within 1 month) of antibiotics, including metronidazole and vancomycin, was found on multivariate analysis. C difficile infection cases with VRE colonization had a higher prevalence of coinfection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (P = .002) and Acinetobacter spp (P = .006). CONCLUSION: VRE colonization was associated with >50% of C difficile infection cases and with a higher rate of coinfection with multidrug-resistant pathogens. Given the high rate of C difficile infection associated with VRE colonization, active surveillance of VRE in patients with C difficile infection is reasonable in high-risk settings.
TI  - Diversity and antimicrobial activity of Pseudovibrio spp. from Irish marine sponges.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the diversity and antimicrobial activity present among Pseudovibrio spp. isolated from marine sponges. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventy-three bacterial isolates from the marine sponges Polymastia boletiformis, Axinella dissimilis and Haliclona simulans were identified as Pseudovibrio spp. using phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. Genetic diversity among these isolates was estimated using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and 33 RAPD types were identified among the 73 Pseudovibrio isolates. These Pseudovibrio spp. were assayed for the production of compounds with antimicrobial activity against various clinically relevant pathogens. Sixty-two (85%) of the isolates showed activity against at least one of the pathogens tested, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Clostridium difficile. PCR screens of the Pseudovibrio isolates also revealed the presence of potential antibiotic-producing polyketide synthase genes. CONCLUSIONS: Marine sponges harbour a diverse population of Pseudovibrio spp., the majority of which demonstrate antimicrobial activity. The identification of several different antimicrobial activity spectra suggests that the Pseudovibrio isolates may produce a suite of antimicrobial compounds. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first study in which an extended population of Pseudovibrio isolates from marine sponges has been analysed and establishes the little-studied Pseudovibrio as a potentially important genus in the search for antimicrobial compounds of clinical relevance.
TI  - An integrative review of infection prevention and control programs for multidrug-resistant organisms in acute care hospitals: a socio-ecological perspective.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The infection rates of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) are increasing in Canada and the United States. The prevention and control of MDRO infections remain an important issue in acute care hospitals. Although comprehensive infection prevention and control programs have been recommended, there is little evidence to date of their effectiveness or of what aspects are most important. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to review and critique the literature on the relationship between an MDRO infection and control program and MDRO rates in acute care hospitals. METHODS: Studies including original research published between January 1, 1998, and May 14, 2009, were identified through MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PUBMED, The Cochrane Library, and expert consultation. A comprehensive search strategy was developed with a librarian to find studies that covered the main subject areas of this integrative review. RESULTS: Of the 1,382 papers retrieved, 47 were reviewed, and 32 studies met the inclusion criteria. The interventions in the included studies were assessed using the tier 1/tier 2 framework. A total of 18 (56.25%) studies had an administrative measure as an intervention; 20 (62.5%) studies had education and training of health care personnel; 8 (25.0%) studies had judicious use of antimicrobial agents; 17 (53.1%) studies used surveillance; 24 (75.0%) studies had infection control precautions to prevent transmission; 7 studies (21.9%) introduced environmental measures; and 9 (28.1%) studies used patient decolonization. Although all the 32 studies were quasiexperimental studies, only 2 (5.9%) studies provided sample size calculations, and only 5 studies reported confounding factors. Whereas 27 used an interrupted time series design and 2 were controlled pre- and post-intervention designs, 3 were pre- and post-intervention without control groups. CONCLUSION: This integrative review demonstrated that the evidence of the relationship between MDRO infection prevention and control programs and the rates of MDRO is weak. Although major methodologic weaknesses exist in the published literature making it not possible to exclude other plausible explanations for the reduction of the acquisition of MDRO, the overall evidence does support the use of multiple interventions to reduce the rates of MDRO in acute care hospitals. Whereas it is unclear which bundles of interventions are effective, there is a clear suggestion that multiple simultaneous interventions can be effective in reducing MDRO infections. In addition, despite the limitations of interrupted time series, multiple studies employing active surveillance cultures were associated with reduced MDRO infections. Future individual reports of outbreaks and intervention studies should be written in a standardized manner using the recommended Outbreak Reports and Intervention Studies of Nosocomial Infection (ORION) guidelines. Further research is needed on the proposed tier 1/tier 2 framework clearly indicating all the interventions implemented.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 micrcog/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. Ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, VCM, teicoplanin, linezolid(LZD) and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of E. faecalis strains or 3.5% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to LZD. 24.4% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM were under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity against C. difficile. Carbapenems showed good activity against Peptococcaceae, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp. However since several strains of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future.
TI  - Airborne hydrogen peroxide for disinfection of the hospital environment and infection control: a systematic review.
AB  - We reviewed the effectiveness of airborne hydrogen peroxide as an environmental disinfectant and infection control measure in clinical settings. Systematic review identified ten studies as eligible for inclusion. Hydrogen peroxide was delivered in the form of vapour and dry mist in seven and three studies, respectively. Pathogens evaluated included meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile and multiple bacterial types, in five, three, and two studies, respectively. Before the application of any cleaning intervention, 187/480 (39.0%; range: 18.9-81.0%) of all sampled environmental sites were found to be contaminated by the studied pathogens in nine studies that reported specific relevant data. After application of terminal cleaning and airborne hydrogen peroxide, 178/630 (28.3%; range: 11.9-66.1%) of the sampled sites in six studies and 15/682 (2.2%; range: 0-4.0%) of the sampled sites in ten studies, respectively, remained contaminated. Four studies evaluated the use of hydrogen peroxide vapour for infection control. This was associated with control of a nosocomial outbreak in two studies, eradication of persistent environmental contamination with MRSA and decrease in C. difficile infection in each of the remaining two studies.
TI  - Nosocomial infections and multidrug-resistant organisms in Germany: epidemiological data from KISS (the Hospital Infection Surveillance System).
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 800 hospitals and 586 intensive care units (ICUs) in Germany currently participate in a nationwide surveillance system for nosocomial infections (Krankenhaus-Infektions-Surveillance-System, KISS), which collects data on the frequency of nosocomial infections and pathogens and on the appearance of pathogens of special epidemiological importance. METHODS: Data were collected from ICUs regarding lower respiratory tract infections, primary sepsis, and urinary tract infections and on the temporal relation of these types of infection to the use of specific medical devices (invasive ventilation, central venous catheters, and urinary catheters). On the basis of these data, device-associated infection rates (number of infection per 1000 device days) were calculated for different types of ICUs. KISS also collected data on all ICU patients colonized or infected with selected multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) and on all hospitalized patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). RESULTS: Device-associated infection rates ranged from 0.9 to 9.6 per 1000 device-days, depending on the type of infection and the type of ICU. An extrapolation from these figures yields an estimate of 57 900 ICU-acquired infections occurring in Germany each year. The most common MDRO in ICU patients is MRSA. The frequency of MRSA has remained stable in recent years, but that of other MDROs among ICU patients is rising. Hospitalized patients are twice as likely to acquire CDAD as they are to acquire MRSA. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial infections are common in the ICU. The percentage of ICU patients with MDRO is low, but rising. Future preventive strategies must address this development.
TI  - [Surfaces of the hospital environment as possible deposits of resistant bacteria: a review].
AB  - The main objective of this study is to identify, in the literature, articles about the occurrence of contamination from inanimate surfaces and a possible dissemination of resistant bacteria in the hospital environment. A bibliographic survey was performed with articles published in the databases LILACS, MEDLINE, Science Direct, SCOPUS and ISI Web of Knowledge, between 2000 and 2008. Twenty-one articles were selected and analyzed. The analyzed studies highlighted the presence of bacteria on monitors, bed grids, tables, faucets, telephones, keyboards and other objects. There was a prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, Clostridium difficile, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus resistant to vancomycin, being the predictive factor the previous occupation of patients colonized by these microorganisms. There was a similarity observed among the isolated strains of colonized and/or infected patients and the strains of the environment by molecular typification. These evidences reinforce the need for knowledge and control of the sources of pathogens in the hospital environment.
TI  - Healthcare-associated infections in rheumatology in Japan.
AB  - Prospective observational study was performed to elucidate the incidence and characteristics of healthcare-associated infections in a university hospital for rheumatology care. In this study, a total of 1,226 patients were prospectively enrolled between March 2004 and February 2006 and between April 2008 and December 2008. Healthcare-associated infection was defined as an infection developing after the third day of admission to the rheumatology ward. We detected the following 54 healthcare-associated infections in 49 patients: respiratory tract infection, 14 cases; Clostridium difficile infection, 2 cases; urinary tract infection, 4 cases; bloodstream infection, 9 cases; skin infection, 2 cases; reactivation of latent cytomegalovirus infection, 6 cases; herpes zoster infection, 5 cases; Candida infection, 7 cases; others, 4 cases. The incidence rate of respiratory tract infection was the highest. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the causative bacterium in 21% of respiratory tract infections cases. Bloodstream infection due to the insertion of a catheter and opportunistic infection by a latent virus were also occurred commonly. Respiratory tract infection, bloodstream infection and opportunistic infection by a latent virus were the most common causes of healthcare-associated infection in rheumatology. It is important to pay more attention to healthcare-associated infection.
TI  - Common approaches to the control of multidrug-resistant organisms other than methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
AB  - Curbing antibiotic resistance is a challenge in health care today. Infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms are estimated to cause 12,000 deaths and cost 3.5 billion dollars in excess health care costs in the United States annually. This article focuses on relevant infection control measures for vancomycin-resistant enterococci, multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections, and Clostridium difficile. Common control strategies targeting these pathogens are reviewed and opportunities for research and more effective deployment of existing tools are highlighted. When there is less extensive evidence available from the published literature, the experience with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is discussed as it might apply to other pathogens.
TI  - Challenges and advances in infection control of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  - Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) has revolutionized the outcome of  many malignant and non-malignant disorders; however, infection still accounts for a substantial number of deaths after both allogeneic and autologous transplants. Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) such as bloodstream infections, pneumonias, and diarrhea are common in this population and account for significant morbidity and cost of care. Also, there is renewed focus on epidemiologically important organisms as the cause of HAI, most notably methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, multi-drug resistant gram-negative bacilli, and Clostridium difficile. We review the infectious risks of HSCT, including those due to HAI as well as measures to decrease these infectious complications. This includes discussion of measures to implement prior to transplant and measures to implement during the pre-engraftment phase, post-engraftment phase, and late phase after transplantation. Additionally, general infection control measures related to healthcare worker behavior as well as environmental control are reviewed. Despite the marked advances in the field of HSCT, challenges remain for clinicians and researchers to conduct properly designed studies to better describe the epidemiology of, risks for, and measures for prevention of transplant related infections.
TI  - Multiple component patient safety intervention in English hospitals: controlled evaluation of second phase.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To independently evaluate the impact of the second phase of the Health Foundation's Safer Patients Initiative (SPI2) on a range of patient safety measures. Design A controlled before and after design. Five substudies: survey of staff attitudes; review of case notes from high risk (respiratory) patients in medical wards; review of case notes from surgical patients; indirect evaluation of hand hygiene by measuring hospital use of handwashing materials; measurement of outcomes (adverse events, mortality among high risk patients admitted to medical wards, patients' satisfaction, mortality in intensive care, rates of hospital acquired infection). Setting NHS hospitals in England. PARTICIPANTS: Nine hospitals participating in SPI2 and nine matched control hospitals. INTERVENTION: The SPI2 intervention was similar to the SPI1, with somewhat modified goals, a slightly longer intervention period, and a smaller budget per hospital. RESULTS: One of the scores (organisational climate) showed a significant (P = 0.009) difference in rate of change over time, which favoured the control hospitals, though the difference was only 0.07 points on a five point scale. Results of the explicit case note reviews of high risk medical patients showed that certain practices improved over time in both control and SPI2 hospitals (and none deteriorated), but there were no significant differences between control and SPI2 hospitals. Monitoring of vital signs improved across control and SPI2 sites. This temporal effect was significant for monitoring the respiratory rate at both the six hour (adjusted odds ratio 2.1, 99% confidence interval 1.0 to 4.3; P = 0.010) and 12 hour (2.4, 1.1 to 5.0; P = 0.002) periods after admission. There was no significant effect of SPI for any of the measures of vital signs. Use of a recommended system for scoring the severity of pneumonia improved from 1.9% (1/52) to 21.4% (12/56) of control and from 2.0% (1/50) to 41.7% (25/60) of SPI2 patients. This temporal change was significant (7.3, 1.4 to 37.7; P = 0.002), but the difference in difference was not significant (2.1, 0.4 to 11.1; P = 0.236). There were no notable or significant changes in the pattern of prescribing errors, either over time or between control and SPI2 hospitals. Two items of medical history taking (exercise tolerance and occupation) showed significant improvement over time, across both control and SPI2 hospitals, but no additional SPI2 effect. The holistic review showed no significant changes in error rates either over time or between control and SPI2 hospitals. The explicit case note review of perioperative care showed that adherence rates for two of the four perioperative standards targeted by SPI2 were already good at baseline, exceeding 94% for antibiotic prophylaxis and 98% for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Intraoperative monitoring of temperature improved over time in both groups, but this was not significant (1.8, 0.4 to 7.6; P = 0.279), and there were no additional effects of SPI2. A dramatic rise in consumption of soap and alcohol hand rub was similar in control and SPI2 hospitals (P = 0.760 and P = 0.889, respectively), as was the corresponding decrease in rates of Clostridium difficile and meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection (P = 0.652 and P = 0.693, respectively). Mortality rates of medical patients included in the case note reviews in control hospitals increased from 17.3% (42/243) to 21.4% (24/112), while in SPI2 hospitals they fell from 10.3% (24/233) to 6.1% (7/114) (P = 0.043). Fewer than 8% of deaths were classed as avoidable; changes in proportions could not explain the divergence of overall death rates between control and SPI2 hospitals. There was no significant difference in the rate of change in mortality in intensive care. Patients' satisfaction improved in both control and SPI2 hospitals on all dimensions, but again there were no significant changes between the two groups of hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Many aspects of care are already good or improving across the NHS in England, suggesting considerable improvements in quality across the board. These improvements are probably due to contemporaneous policy activities relating to patient safety, including those with features similar to the SPI, and the emergence of professional consensus on some clinical processes. This phenomenon might have attenuated the incremental effect of the SPI, making it difficult to detect. Alternatively, the full impact of the SPI might be observable only in the longer term. The conclusion of this study could have been different if concurrent controls had not been used.
TI  - Sternal surgical site infection prevention - is there any room for improvement?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this multicenter study are to evaluate current clinical practices in cardiac surgery concerning the prevention and management of sternal wound infections, to identify room for improvement, and to support implementation of systematic measures. METHODS: As a part of a campaign for infection prevention in cardiac surgery in Germany, a multiple-choice questionnaire with two main sections was developed and submitted to all cardiac surgery units in Germany (79). The project was realized in cooperation with the German Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, the BQS Institute for Quality and Patient Safety, and the National Reference Center for Nosocomial Infection Surveillance. RESULTS: A representative number (54 of 79 or 68%) of German cardiac surgery centers participated in the survey, in which heterogeneous procedures and various standards for prevention were observed. Surveillance, standards, and advanced training regarding hygiene measures are present in almost all participating hospitals. Methicillin-resistant Streptococcus aureus (MRSA) screening is performed in 81.5% (44/54) of all participating departments. A little less than one-tenth (7.4%) perform decolonization measures on all patients, while 85.2% perform decolonization measures only on MRSA-positive patients. Application of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis ranges from single-shot application to 3 days of treatment. Longer treatment is expensive and time-intensive, and also increases the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Nearly three-quarters (70.4%) of all participating hospitals perform preoperative hair removal 1 day before surgery. Common techniques are clipping machines (53.7%), razors (40.7%), clipping machines and depilatory cream (1.9%), or depilatory cream only (1.9%). Remanent (37.0%) and non-remanent disinfectants (55.6%) are used for preoperative skin disinfection. The time of the first wound-dressing change varies from the day of surgery (1.9%) over the first (42.6%) or second (46.3%) day after surgery to up to 3 or more days after surgery (9.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the evaluation show that basic measures for infection prevention in cardiac surgery in Germany are well implemented. Nevertheless, a relevant heterogeneity in the use of special measures was observed, although research-based guidelines for infection prevention in surgery do exist and many studies have demonstrated the usefulness and feasibility of these measures.
TI  - Comparative genome-wide analysis of small RNAs of major Gram-positive pathogens:  from identification to application.
AB  - In the recent years, the number of drug- and multi-drug-resistant microbial strains has increased rapidly. Therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. The detection of small RNAs (sRNAs) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. Several experimental technologies to predict sRNA have been established for the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli. In many respects, sRNA screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of sRNAs for Gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of sRNAs in colonization and pathogenicity for Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. Here, we report the current knowledge about the sRNAs of these socioeconomically relevant Gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput sRNA screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide sRNA identification and target prediction. Finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) as a novel tool to inactivate potential sRNA and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - The impact of enhanced cleaning within the intensive care unit on contamination of the near-patient environment with hospital pathogens: a randomized crossover study in critical care units in two hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of enhanced cleaning of the near-patient environment on the isolation of hospital pathogens from the bed area and staff hands. DESIGN: Prospective randomized crossover study over the course of 1 yr. SETTING: Intensive care units at two teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: There were 1252 patients staying during enhanced cleaning and 1331 staying during standard cleaning. INTERVENTIONS: In each of six 2-month periods, one unit was randomly selected for additional twice-daily enhanced cleaning of hand contact surfaces. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Agar contact samples were taken at five sites around randomly selected bed areas, from staff hands, and from communal sites three times daily for 12 bed days per week. Patients admitted in the year commencing April 2007 were analyzed for hospital-acquired colonization and infection. Over the course of 1152 bed days, 20,736 samples were collected. Detection of environmental methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus per bed-area day was reduced during enhanced cleaning phases from 82 of 561 (14.6%) to 51 of 559 (9.1%) (adjusted odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.86; p = .006). Other targeted pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Clostridium difficile) were rarely detected. Subgroup analyses showed reduced methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus contamination on doctors' hands during enhanced cleaning (3 of 425; 0.7% vs. 11 of 423; 2.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.95; p = .025) and a trend to reduction on nurses' hands (16 of 1647; 1.0% vs. 28 of 1694; 1.7%; adjusted odds ratio 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-1.08; p = .077). All 1252 critical care patients staying during enhanced and 1,331 during standard cleaning were included, but no significant effect on patient methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acquisition was observed (adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.65; p = .93). CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced cleaning reduced environmental contamination and hand carriage, but no significant effect was observed on patient acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

TI  - Infection acquisition following intensive care unit room privatization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) often acquire infections, which impose a heavy human and financial burden. The use of private rooms may reduce the acquisition of certain pathogens, but the limited evidence on this topic is inconsistent. METHODS: We compared the rates of acquisition of infectious organisms in an ICU before and after a change from multibed to single rooms. As a control, we used acquisition rates in the ICU of a nearby university teaching hospital, which contained both multibed and single rooms, during the study period. We used a statistical model to adjust for background time trends common to both hospitals. RESULTS: The adjusted rate of acquisition of Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus combined decreased by 54% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-70%) following the intervention. The methicillin-resistant S aureus acquisition rate fell by 47% (95% CI,1%-71%), the C difficile acquisition rate fell by 43% (95% CI, 7%-65%), and the yeast acquisition rate fell by 51% (95% CI, 34%-64%). Twelve common and likely exogenous organisms and exogenous/endogenous organisms had a reduction in acquisition rates after the intervention; for 6 of them, this reduction was statistically significant. No effect was observed on the acquisition rate of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, the most common endogenous organism, for which no change would be expected. The adjusted rate ratio of the average length of stay in the ICU was 10% (95% CI, 0%-19%) lower after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Conversion to single rooms can substantially reduce the rate at which patients acquire infectious organisms while in the ICU.
TI  - A comparative study of three methods to evaluate an intervention to improve empirical antibiotic therapy for acute bacterial infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to limit the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, standardized empirical therapy against acute bacterial infections has been advocated. METHODS: Guidelines for acute bacterial infections recommending increased usage of benzylpenicillin and restricted use of fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins have been implemented in Kalmar County, Sweden. We evaluated this strategy by recording therapy in patients with bacteraemia, antibiotic requisition, and point prevalence surveys prior to this intervention and at 6 and 12 months after. RESULTS: Comparing the methods simultaneously, there was good agreement between them and an overall significant change in antibiotic usage. There was a significant shift from cefuroxime to cefotaxime and a borderline significant increase in the use of benzylpenicillin (p = 0.057). Based on the defined daily dose (DDD), a highly significant decrease in total cefotaxime and cefuroxime usage was observed that was not detected when applying the prescribed daily dose (PDD), which is adapted to local treatment practices. No change was found in mortality in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia or the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the implementation of the new guidelines has resulted in a significant change in antibiotic usage, which could be conveniently monitored by antibiotic requisition if PDD is used in addition to DDD.
TI  - The role of environmental cleaning in health care-associated infections.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and toxin-producing organisms such as Clostridium difficile have been a concern for over 30 years. An increasing focus is being placed on the role that an unclean environment can play in transmission. This article describes the pathogens of concern and the use of a robust environmental cleaning program to help reduce the chances for hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - [Entero-colitis implicated by antimicrobial agents].
AB  
TI  - Gaseous and air decontamination technologies for Clostridium difficile in the healthcare environment.
AB  - The recent data for hospital-acquired infections suggest that infection rates for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile are beginning to decrease. However, while there is still pressure to maintain this trend, the resistance of C. difficile spores to standard detergents continues to present a problem for many UK hospitals trying to prevent its spread or control outbreaks. Alternative disinfection technologies such as gaseous decontamination are currently being marketed to the healthcare sector as an alternative/supplement to manual disinfection, and have been shown to be effective in reducing environmental contamination. When used correctly, they offer a complementary technology to manual cleaning that increases the probability of an effective reduction in viability and provides a comparatively uniform distribution of disinfectant. Three gaseous decontamination technologies are examined for their suitability in reducing environmental contamination with C. difficile: gaseous hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide and ozone. Air decontamination and UV-based technologies are also briefly described. We conclude that while there is a role to play for these new technologies in the decontamination of ward surfaces contaminated with C. difficile, the requirement for both a preclean before use and the limited 'in vivo' evidence means that extensive field trials are necessary to determine their cost-effectiveness in a healthcare setting.
TI  - The continuing crisis in antibiotic resistance.
AB  - The emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is an inevitable consequence of antibiotic use. Despite repeated warnings, negligent antibiotic use and poor infection-control practice have led to the continuing development of extensive resistance problems worldwide. Multidrug-resistant pathogens are now characterized by their heterogeneity, increasing virulence, resistance even to reserve agents and spread within and between hospitals and the community. Examples are glycopeptide-resistant meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- and carbapenemase-producing coliforms, and toxin-hyperproducing Clostridium difficile. Effective national and international programmes of control to combat these problems are urgently needed. The potential for success of such coordinated efforts has been demonstrated by the recent dramatic reductions in MRSA and C. difficile infections in England.
TI  - Escherichia coli and selected veterinary and zoonotic pathogens isolated from environmental sites in companion animal veterinary hospitals in southern Ontario.
AB  - Hospital-based infection control in veterinary medicine is emerging and the role  of the environment in hospital-acquired infections (HAI) in veterinary hospitals is largely unknown. This study was initiated to determine the recovery of Escherichia coli and selected veterinary and zoonotic pathogens from the environments of 101 community veterinary hospitals. The proportion of hospitals with positive environmental swabs were: E. coli--92%, Clostridium difficile--58%, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)--9%, CMY-2 producing E. coli--9%, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius--7%, and Salmonella--2%. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., canine parvovirus, and feline calicivirus were not isolated. Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli isolates was low. Important potential veterinary and human pathogens were recovered including Canadian epidemic strains MRSA-2 and MRSA-5, and C. difficile ribotype 027. There is an environmental reservoir of pathogens in veterinary hospitals; therefore, additional studies are required to characterize risk factors associated with HAI in companion animals, including the role of the environment.
TI  - Sustained reduction in antimicrobial use and decrease in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile infections following implementation of an electronic medical record at a tertiary-care teaching hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: we evaluated the effect of implementation of an electronic medical record (EMR) on the use of antimicrobial agents and on the rates of infections with Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS: this was a retrospective, observational study conducted between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2009. Antimicrobial drug use, rates of nosocomial C. difficile infection (CDI) and MRSA infection, the number of medical charts reviewed and number of antimicrobial recommendations made and accepted were compared before and after implementing the EMR utilizing interrupted time-series analysis. RESULTS: compared with the 10 quarters prior to implementing the EMR, there was a 36.6% increase in the number of charts reviewed (P < 0.0001), a 98.1% increase in the number of antimicrobial recommendations made (P < 0.0001) and a 124% increase in the number of recommendations accepted (P < 0.0001). There was a 28.8% decrease in the use of 41 commonly used antibacterial agents (P < 0.0001). Nosocomial CDI decreased by 18.7% (P = 0.07) and nosocomial MRSA infections decreased by 45.2% (P < 0.0001) following implementation of the EMR. CONCLUSIONS: adoption of an EMR facilitated a significant increase in chart reviews and antimicrobial recommendations, which resulted in a sustained decrease in antimicrobial use. There were decreased nosocomial infections with MRSA and a trend towards decreasing CDIs following implementation of the EMR.
TI  - Nosocomial infections and multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms in the pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  - Nosocomial infections in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) caused by multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms are increasing. This review attempts to report on significant findings in the current literature related to nosocomial infections in PICU settings with an international perspective. The types of nosocomial infections are addressed, including catheter-related bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections and post-surgical wound infections. A review of emerging resistant bacterial pathogens includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative organisms, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains and multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Basic and enhanced infection control methods for the management and control of multidrug-resistant organisms are also summarized with an emphasis on prevention.

TI  - Effect of ceftobiprole on the normal human intestinal microflora.
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a new broad-spectrum pyrrolidinone cephem active against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Gram-negative bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of administration of ceftobiprole on the normal intestinal microflora. Twelve healthy subjects (six males and six females) aged 20-31 years received ceftobiprole 500 mg by intravenous infusion every 8h for 7 days. Plasma samples were collected on Days -1, 1, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21 for determination of drug concentration by biological and chemical methods. Faecal samples were collected on Days -1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21. For analysis of the microflora, faecal specimens were cultured on non-selective and selective media. Different colony types were counted, isolated in pure culture and identified to genus level. All new colonising aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were tested for susceptibility to ceftobiprole. Plasma concentrations of ceftobiprole 10 min after completion of infusion were as follows: Day 1, 14.7-23.6 mg/L; Day 4, 15.9-24.5 mg/L; and Day 7, 15.9-23.9 mg/L. No ceftobiprole was detected in plasma on Days -1, 10, 14 and 21. No measurable concentrations of ceftobiprole were found in faeces on Days -1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14 and 21. There were minor changes in the numbers of enteric bacteria, enterococci and Candida albicans and there were moderate changes in the numbers of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, clostridia and Bacteroides spp. during the same period. No Clostridium difficile strains or toxins were found. No new colonising aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with ceftobiprole minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/= 4 mg/L were found. Ceftobiprole had no significant ecological impact on the human intestinal microflora.
TI  - A classification system for hospital-based infection outbreaks.
AB  - Outbreaks of infection within semi-closed environments such as hospitals, whether inherent in the environment (such as Clostridium difficile (C.Diff) or Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or imported from the wider community (such as Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs)), are difficult to manage. As part of our work on modelling such outbreaks, we have developed a classification system to describe the impact of a particular outbreak upon an organization. This classification system may then be used in comparing appropriate computer models to real outbreaks, as well as in comparing different real outbreaks in, for example, the comparison of differing management and containment techniques and strategies. Data from NLV outbreaks in the Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust (the Trust) over several previous years are analysed and classified, both for infection within staff (where the end of infection date may not be known) and within patients (where it generally is known). A classification system consisting of seven elements is described, along with a goodness-of-fit method for comparing a new classification to previously known ones, for use in evaluating a simulation against history and thereby determining how 'realistic' (or otherwise) it is.
TI  - Preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infections: An executive summary of  the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc, Elimination Guide.
AB  - The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) began publishing their series of Elimination Guides in 2007. Since then, 9 Elimination Guides have been developed that cover a range of important infection prevention issues, including the prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), as well as mediastinitis surgical site surveillance. Multidrug-resistant organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, also have been the focus of APIC Elimination Guides. The content of each of these Elimination Guides will be summarized in a series of upcoming Brief Reports published in The Journal. This article provides an executive summary of the APIC Elimination Guide for CAUTIs. Infection preventionists are encouraged to obtain the original, full-length APIC Elimination Guide for more thorough coverage of CAUTI prevention.
TI  - The pathogenesis of infection and immune response.
AB  - An understanding of the pathogenesis of infection, and the complex and fascinating 'relationship', or interaction, between the infecting organism and the host are advantageous when caring for patients with infections/infectious diseases, particularly as many of the clinical features of infection are as a consequence of the defence mechanisms mounted by the immune system. This article aims to provide a brief overview of the pathogenesis of infection, explaining how the two branches of the immune system, the innate/natural immune response, and the adaptive/acquired immune response, mount an attack against invading bacteria. Reference is made to bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and their effect on the human host and the immune response, through the processes of attachment/entry, evasion of host defences, replication, and damage to the host.
TI  - Epidemiology and clinical relevance of microbial resistance determinants versus anti-Gram-positive agents.
AB  - Gram-positive pathogens are a major cause of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections, and exhibit a remarkable ability to develop antibiotic resistance. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) and multidrug-resistant pneumococci are currently the major resistance challenges among Gram-positives, due to their global dissemination and overall clinical impact. The mechanisms of evolution of these resistance phenotypes are based on a diverse array of mutational events and gene transfer phenomena carried out by several types of mobile genetic elements, followed by the dissemination of successful resistant clones. Resistance to glycopeptides in staphylococci remains uncommon, likely due to fitness issues. Resistance to the new anti-Gram-positive agents (linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline) overall remains very rare. However, a transferable resistance mechanism to linezolid, mediated by ribosomal target modification by the Cfr protein, has recently emerged among S. aureus, being a matter of raising concern. Linezolid resistance among enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci is also increasingly reported. Moreover, a role for antibiotic resistance has been advocated in the recent increase of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) associated with the emergence of hypervirulent strains.
TI  - Evaluating the link between the management of clinical waste in the National Health Service (NHS) and the risk of the spread of infections: A case study of three hospitals in England.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate waste management practices in three case study NHS Trusts in England and the potential risks of the spread of pathogens causing healthcare associated infections (HCAIs). Using a combination of microbiological techniques, interviews and questionnaire surveys, four target microbes were studied, namely: meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), meticillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Waste Flow Diagrams (WFDs) were used to map the flow of the waste. While there was a perceived link between the management of the waste and the spread of the microbes by staff, none of the target organisms were isolated. The findings suggest that when the waste is properly contained and managed that it should not pose a significant risk in terms of the spread of the four bacteria tested in this study. In addition, the results demonstrate that there is a need for staff perceptions and beliefs to be addressed in the development of policies and training related to infection control and its link to waste management.
TI  - Interventions to improve hand hygiene compliance in patient care.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care-associated infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Hand hygiene is regarded as an effective preventive measure. OBJECTIVES: To update the review done in 2007, to assess the short and longer-term success of strategies to improve hand hygiene compliance and to determine whether a sustained increase in hand hygiene compliance can reduce rates of health care-associated infection. SEARCH STRATEGY: We conducted electronic searches of: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group specialised register of trials; MEDLINE; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; and the BNI. Originally searched to July 2006, for the update databases were searched from August 2006 until November 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time series analyses meeting explicit entry and quality criteria used by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group were eligible for inclusion. Studies reporting indicators of hand hygiene compliance and proxy indicators such as product use were considered. Self-reported data were not considered a valid measure of compliance. Studies to promote hand hygiene compliance as part of a care bundle approach were included, providing data relating specifically to hand hygiene were presented separately. Studies were excluded if hand hygiene was assessed in simulations, non-clinical settings or the operating theatre setting. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed data quality. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies met the criteria for the review: two from the original review and two from the update. Two studies evaluated simple education initiatives, one using a randomized clinical trial design and the other a controlled before and after design. Both measured hand hygiene compliance by direct observation. The other two studies were both interrupted times series studies. One study presented three separate interventions within the same paper: simple substitutions of product and two multifaceted campaigns, one of which included involving practitioners in making decisions about choice of hand hygiene products and the components of the hand hygiene program. The other study also presented two separate multifaceted campaigns, one of which involved application of social marketing theory. In these two studies follow-up data collection continued beyond twelve months, and a proxy measure of hand hygiene compliance (product use) was recorded. Microbiological data were recorded in one study. Hand hygiene compliance increased for one of the studies where it was measured by direct observation, but the results from the other study were not conclusive. Product use increased in the two studies in which it was reported, with inconsistent results reported for one initiative. MRSA incidence decreased in the one study reporting microbiological data. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The quality of intervention studies intended to increase hand hygiene compliance remains disappointing. Although multifaceted campaigns with social marketing or staff involvement appear to have an effect, there is insufficient evidence to draw a firm conclusion. There remains an urgent need to undertake methodologically robust research to explore the effectiveness of soundly designed and implemented interventions to increase hand hygiene compliance.
TI  - Triggering germination represents a novel strategy to enhance killing of Clostridium difficile spores.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium that is the most common cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea in developed countries. Control of C. difficile is challenging because the spores are resistant to killing by alcohol-based hand hygiene products, antimicrobial soaps, and most disinfectants. Although initiation of germination has been shown to increase susceptibility of spores of other bacterial species to radiation and heat, it was not known if triggering of germination could be a useful strategy to increase susceptibility of C. difficile spores to radiation or other stressors. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we demonstrated that exposure of dormant C. difficile spores to a germination solution containing amino acids, minerals, and taurocholic acid resulted in initiation of germination in room air. Germination of spores in room air resulted in significantly enhanced killing by ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation and heat. On surfaces in hospital rooms, application of germination solution resulted in enhanced eradication of spores by UV-C administered by an automated room decontamination device. Initiation of germination under anaerobic, but not aerobic, conditions resulted in increased susceptibility to killing by ethanol, suggesting that exposure to oxygen might prevent spores from progressing fully to outgrowth. Stimulation of germination also resulted in reduced survival of spores on surfaces in room air, possibly due to increased susceptibility to stressors such as oxygen and desiccation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data demonstrate that stimulation of germination could represent a novel method to enhance killing of spores by UV-C, and suggest the possible application of this strategy as a means to enhance killing by other agents.
TI  - Room decontamination with UV radiation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a UV-C-emitting device to eliminate  clinically important nosocomial pathogens in a contaminated hospital room. METHODS: This study was carried out in a standard but empty hospital room (phase 1) and in a room previously occupied by a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infection (phase 2) in an acute care tertiary hospital in North Carolina from January 21 through September 21, 2009. During phase 1, 8 x 8 cm Formica sheets contaminated with approximately 10(4)-10(5) organisms of MRSA, VRE, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii, or Clostridium difficile spores were placed in a hospital room, both in direct line of sight of the UV-C device and behind objects. After timed exposure, the presence of the microbes was assessed. During phase 2, specific sites in rooms that had housed patients with MRSA or VRE infection were sampled before and after UV-C irradiation. After timed exposure, the presence of MRSA and VRE and total colony counts were assessed. RESULTS: In our test room, the effectiveness of UV-C radiation in reducing the counts of vegetative bacteria on surfaces was more than 99.9% within 15 minutes, and the reduction in C. difficile spores was 99.8% within 50 minutes. In rooms occupied by patients with MRSA, UV-C irradiation of approximately 15 minutes duration resulted in a decrease in total CFUs per plate (mean, 384 CFUs vs 19 CFUs; P < .001), in the number of samples positive for MRSA (81 [20.3%] of 400 plates vs 2 [0.5%] of 400 plates; P < .001), and in MRSA counts per MRSA-positive plate (mean, 37 CFUs vs 2 CFUs; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This UV-C device was effective in eliminating vegetative bacteria on contaminated surfaces both in the line of sight and behind objects within approximately 15 minutes and in eliminating C. difficile spores within 50 minutes.
TI  - Oritavancin: a novel lipoglycopeptide active against Gram-positive pathogens including multiresistant strains.
AB  - Oritavancin is a lipoglycopeptide antibiotic under investigation for the treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Oritavancin has demonstrated rapid dose-dependent bactericidal activity towards vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci, meticillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), heteroresistant VISA (hVISA), vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) and small-colony variants of S. aureus. It is also active against Clostridium difficile. Upon intravenous administration, oritavancin displays a three-compartment pharmacokinetic model, dose proportionality, a distribution volume of ca. 110 L, a terminal elimination half-life in excess of 2 weeks and it is not metabolised. Its pharmacodynamic properties make it an ideal antibiotic for a once-daily or even single-dose regimen. Oritavancin is currently under review by the US Food and Drug Administration. So far, oritavancin has demonstrated efficacy in two pivotal Phase III trials conducted in patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections in which oritavancin was compared with vancomycin plus cefalexin. In both trials, the primary endpoint (clinical cure in clinically evaluable patients at first follow-up with a 10% non-inferiority margin) was met, with the advantages of shorter duration of therapy and fewer adverse events. Further results indicating its activity against bacteria growing in biofilms as well as stationary-phase bacteria open the way for its use to treat prosthetic device infections, which is to be investigated in upcoming trials.
TI  - Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: emerging concepts in vaccine development.
AB  - Both Clostridium difficile and Staphylococcus aureus asymptomatically colonize a  significant percentage of humans, particularly during the first year of life. The epidemiology of both has been and continues to be quite dynamic; presently, we are in the midst of epidemics of infections by C. difficile and S. aureus. These ancient microbes are now armed with more potent virulence factors, which have extended their reach from the hospital into community settings, and from the elderly and debilitated hosts into the younger and otherwise healthy population. This review presents some emerging concepts that will likely shape efforts to develop active and passive immunization interventions in response to the reemergence of these bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Hand hygiene in the intensive care unit.
AB  - Healthcare-associated infections affect 1.4 million patients at any time worldwide, as estimated by the World Health Organization. In intensive care units, the burden of healthcare-associated infections is greatly increased, causing additional morbidity and mortality. Multidrug-resistant pathogens are commonly involved in such infections and render effective treatment challenging. Proper hand hygiene is the single most important, simplest, and least expensive means of preventing healthcare-associated infections. In addition, it is equally important to stop transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization guidelines on hand hygiene in health care, alcohol-based handrub should be used as the preferred means for routine hand antisepsis. Alcohols have excellent in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a variety of fungi, and most viruses. Some pathogens, however, such as Clostridium difficile, Bacillus anthracis, and noroviruses, may require special hand hygiene measures. Failure to provide user friendliness of hand hygiene equipment and shortage of staff are predictors for noncompliance, especially in the intensive care unit setting. Therefore, practical approaches to promote hand hygiene in the intensive care unit include provision of a minimal number of handrub dispensers per bed, monitoring of compliance, and choice of the most attractive product. Lack of knowledge of guidelines for hand hygiene, lack of recognition of hand hygiene opportunities during patient care, and lack of awareness of the risk of cross-transmission of pathogens are barriers to good hand hygiene practices. Multidisciplinary programs to promote increased use of alcoholic handrub lead to an increased compliance of healthcare workers with the recommended hand hygiene practices and a reduced prevalence of nosocomial infections.

AB  
TI  - Evaluation of an automated ultraviolet radiation device for decontamination of Clostridium difficile and other healthcare-associated pathogens in hospital rooms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental surfaces play an important role in transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens. There is a need for new disinfection methods that are effective against Clostridium difficile spores, but also safe, rapid, and automated. METHODS: The Tru-D Rapid Room Disinfection device is a mobile, fully-automated room decontamination technology that utilizes ultraviolet-C irradiation to kill pathogens. We examined the efficacy of environmental disinfection using the Tru-D device in the laboratory and in rooms of hospitalized patients. Cultures for C. difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) were collected from commonly touched surfaces before and after use of Tru-D. RESULTS: On inoculated surfaces, application of Tru-D at a reflected dose of 22,000 microWs/cm(2) for approximately 45 minutes consistently reduced recovery of C. difficile spores and MRSA by >2-3 log10 colony forming units (CFU)/cm2 and of VRE by >3-4 log10 CFU/cm(2). Similar killing of MRSA and VRE was achieved in approximately 20 minutes at a reflected dose of 12,000 microWs/cm(2), but killing of C. difficile spores was reduced. Disinfection of hospital rooms with Tru-D reduced the frequency of positive MRSA and VRE cultures by 93% and of C. difficile cultures by 80%. After routine hospital cleaning of the rooms of MRSA carriers, 18% of sites under the edges of bedside tables (i.e., a frequently touched site not easily amenable to manual application of disinfectant) were contaminated with MRSA, versus 0% after Tru-D (P < 0.001). The system required <5 minutes to set up and did not require continuous monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: The Tru-D Rapid Room Disinfection device is a novel, automated, and efficient environmental disinfection technology that significantly reduces C. difficile, VRE and MRSA contamination on commonly touched hospital surfaces.
TI  - Role of hospital surfaces in the transmission of emerging health care-associated  pathogens: norovirus, Clostridium difficile, and Acinetobacter species.
AB  - Health care-associated infections (HAI) remain a major cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Although the main source of nosocomial pathogens is likely the patient's endogenous flora, an estimated 20% to 40% of HAI have been attributed to cross infection via the hands of health care personnel, who have become contaminated from direct contact with the patient or indirectly by touching contaminated environmental surfaces. Multiple studies strongly suggest that environmental contamination plays an important role in the transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. More recently, evidence suggests that environmental contamination also plays a role in the nosocomial transmission of norovirus, Clostridium difficile, and Acinetobacter spp. All 3 pathogens survive for prolonged periods of time in the environment, and infections have been associated with frequent surface contamination in hospital rooms and health care worker hands. In some cases, the extent of patient-to-patient transmission has been found to be directly proportional to the level of environmental contamination. Improved cleaning/disinfection of environmental surfaces and hand hygiene have been shown to reduce the spread of all of these pathogens. Importantly, norovirus and C difficile are relatively resistant to the most common surface disinfectants and waterless alcohol-based antiseptics. Current hand hygiene guidelines and recommendations for surface cleaning/disinfection should be followed in managing outbreaks because of these emerging pathogens.
TI  - Charting the course for the future of science in healthcare epidemiology: results of a survey of the membership of the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the results of a survey of members of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) that (1) measured members' perceptions of gaps in the healthcare epidemiology knowledge base and members' priorities for SHEA research goals, (2) assessed whether members would be willing to participate in consortia to address identified gaps in knowledge, and (3) evaluated the need for training for the next generation of investigators in the field of healthcare epidemiology. DESIGN: Electronic and paper survey of members of SHEA, a professional society formed to advance the science of healthcare epidemiology through research and education. PARTICIPANTS: All society members were invited to participate. RESULTS: Of 1,289 SHEA members, 593 (46.0%) responded. Respondents identified the following issues as important for the Research Committee of SHEA: setting the scientific agenda for healthcare epidemiology, developing collaborative infrastructure to conduct research, and developing funding mechanisms for research. Respondents ranked multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms, antimicrobial stewardship, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, adherence to effective hand hygiene guidelines, and Clostridium difficile infections as the most important scientific issues facing the field. Respondents ranked inadequate project funding, lack of protected time for research, and inability to obtain a grant, contract, and/or outside funding as the most significant barriers to conducting research. More than 92% of respondents support creating a SHEA research consortium; more than 40% would participate even if no additional funding were available; nearly 90% identified developing research training as a key function for SHEA. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a road map for the SHEA Research Committee for the next decade.
TI  - Skin care as a tool in the prevention of health care-associated infection.
AB  - Keeping skin healthy is particularly important for patients and all health-care personnel as any break in the skin can potentially harbour bacteria that may become a cross-infection risk to patients. When skin is damaged it is more difficult to remove microrganisms even when staff follow the recommended technique for hand washing (Royal College of Nursing, 2000). Broken skin on patients increases the risk of developing a healthcare-associated infection (HAI) as microorganisms can penetrate the surface of broken skin and cause anything from boils to bacteraemia. The aim of this article is to discuss skin as a barrier to infection, and examine ways to maintain the integrity of both staff and patients' skin. It will also look at the effect damaged skin can have on hand hygiene compliance and how it can increase the need for intervention in patients with broken areas of skin if these areas then become infected.

TI  - Trial of universal gloving with emollient-impregnated gloves to promote skin health and prevent the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of universal gloving with emollient-impregnated gloves with standard contact precautions for the control of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and to measure the effect on healthcare workers' (HCWs') hand skin health. DESIGN: Prospective before-after trial. SETTING: An 18-bed surgical intensive care unit. METHODS: During phase 1 (September 2007 through March 2008) standard contact precautions were used. During phase 2 (March 2008 through September 2008) universal gloving with emollient-impregnated gloves was used, and no contact precautions. Patients were screened for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). HCW hand hygiene compliance and hand skin health and microbial contamination were assessed. The incidences of device-associated infection and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) were determined. RESULTS: The rate of compliance with contact precautions (phase 1) was 67%, and the rate of compliance with universal gloving (phase 2) was 78% (P = .01). Hand hygiene compliance was higher during phase 2 than during phase 1 (before patient care, 40% vs 35% of encounters; P = .001; after patient care, 63% vs 51% of encounters; P < .001). No difference was observed in MDRO acquisition. During phases 1 and 2, incidences of device-related infections, in number of infections per 1,000 device-days, were, respectively, 3.7 and 2.6 for bloodstream infection (P = .10), 8.9 and 7.8 for urinary tract infection (P = .10), and 1.0 and 1.1 for ventilator-associated pneumonia (P = .09). The CDI incidence in phase 1 and in phase 2 was, respectively, 2.0 and 1.4 cases per 1,000 patient-days (P = .53). During phase 1, 29% of HCW hand cultures were MRSA positive, compared with 13% during phase 2 (P = .17); during phase 1, 2% of hand cultures were VRE positive, compared with 0 during phase 2 (P = .16). Hand skin health improved during phase 2. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with contact precautions, universal gloving with emollient-impregnated gloves was associated with improved hand hygiene compliance and skin health. No statistically significant change in the rates of device-associated infection, CDI, or patient MDRO acquisition was observed. Universal gloving may be an alternative to contact precautions.
TI  - Cinderella service to health service priority: infection control in the UK.
AB  - Reducing the morbidity, mortality and economic burden of healthcare-associated infection has become an NHS priority. However, this has not always been the case. The problems associated with hospital infection have been well known for some considerable time but historically the topic has been afforded scant resources, and relegated to 'Cinderella' status. This began to change when seminal epidemiological studies of the 1970s and 1980s identified the scale of the problem, and accelerated when adjustments to the management of the NHS throughout the 1990s encouraged Trusts to reposition infection control among their priorities. Since the turn of the century, infection control has become increasingly politicized and regulated. There are some suggestions that standards are improving and rates of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile are falling. Whether or not Trusts are capable of bringing about change through a process of self-regulation, or whether meaningful change will inevitably require regulation and enforcement from outside agencies is an interesting point.
TI  - 3 Bad bugs.
AB  
TI  - Four country healthcare-associated infection prevalence survey: pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - In 2006, the Hospital Infection Society was funded by the respective health services in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to conduct a prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infection (HCAI). Here, we report the prevalence of pneumonia and lower respiratory tract infection other than pneumonia (LRTIOP) in these four countries. The prevalence of all HCAIs was 7.59% (5743 out of 75 694). Nine hundred (15.7%) of these infections were pneumonia, and 402 (7.0%) were LRTIOP. The prevalence of both infections was higher for males than for females, and increased threefold from those aged <35 to those aged >85 years (P<0.001). At the time of the survey or in the preceding seven days, 23.7% and 18.2% of patients with pneumonia and LRTIOP, respectively, were mechanically ventilated compared to 5.2% of patients in the whole study population. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was the cause of pneumonia and LRTIOP in 7.6% and 18.1% of patients, respectively (P<0.001). More patients with LRTIOP (4.2%) had concurrent diarrhoea due to Clostridium difficile compared to patients with pneumonia (2.4%), but this did not reach statistical significance. Other HCAIs were present in 137 (15.2%) of patients with pneumonia and 66 (16.4%) of those with LRTIOP. The results suggest that reducing instrumentation, such as mechanical ventilation where possible, should help reduce infection. The higher prevalence of MRSA as a cause of LRTIOP suggests a lack of specificity in identifying the microbial cause and the association with C. difficile emphasises the need for better use of antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in animals and man: prescribing, practices and  policies.
AB  - This meeting focused on infections in humans and animals due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria and Clostridium difficile, and their corresponding treatments. MRSA is predominantly a human pathogen, and molecular typing has revealed that certain clones have spread widely both between humans and from humans to animals. ESBL-producing bacteria, particularly those that express the CTX-M beta-lactamases, have been disseminated worldwide. Whilst such strains are usually isolated from humans, some animal isolates also produce CTX-M enzymes. In humans, one clone of CTX-M-producing Escherichia coli, sequence type (ST)131, has been particularly successful. C. difficile, often ribotype 027, commonly colonizes the hospital environment and causes serious infections in humans. In animals, ribotype 078 is more often found, and is an important cause of diarrhoea in piglets. There is a concern that the numbers of MRSA or other antimicrobial-resistant bacteria might increase further when human isolates become established in animals, as this can amplify the numbers of such bacteria by dissemination within animal groups with subsequent spread back to humans. Certain antimicrobials have been implicated in the selection of MRSA, ESBL-producing bacteria and predisposition to infection by C. difficile. Guidelines for treatment and prevention of infections by MRSA, ESBL-producing bacteria and C. difficile were discussed and evidence-based policies were recommended for both humans and animals.
TI  - [Recent trend and research issues related to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria].
AB  - The discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. These discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. However, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. Today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. Infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. In this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.
TI  - Evaluation of the efficacy of electrochemically activated solutions against nosocomial pathogens and bacterial endospores.
AB  - AIMS: Electrochemically activated solutions (ECAS) are generated from halide salt solutions via specially designed electrolytic cells. The active solutions are known to possess high biocidal activity against a wide range of target microbial species, however, literature revealing the kill-kinetics of these solutions is limited. The aim of the study was to identify the kill-rate and extent of population kill for a range of target species (including endospores) using ECAS generated at the anode (anolyte). METHODS AND RESULTS: Standard suspensions of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus atrophaeus spores and Clostridium difficile spores were treated with anolyte in a quantitative suspension assay. For vegetative cells, all concentrations of anolyte tested reduced the viable population to below the detection limit within 10 s. At a concentration of 99%, anolyte produced a log(10) reduction factor of greater than five in viable B. atrophaeus endospores within 90 s and reduced numbers of C. difficile endospores to below the experimental detection limit within 20 s at concentrations of 5% or greater. CONCLUSIONS: Anolyte was highly effective in killing test-bacteria and spores. The bactericidal efficacy was retained against vegetative cells at dilutions as low as 1% and against C. difficile spores as low as 5%. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The results of this study demonstrate that ECAS are effective at lower concentrations and act more rapidly than previously reported. Potent bactericidal and sporicidal activity coupled with point-of-use generation, low production-costs and environmental compatibility suggest that acidic ECAS has the potential to be a useful addition to the current armoury of disinfectants.
TI  - Healthcare costs of Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile infections in veterans: role of vitamin D deficiency.
AB  - Clostridium difficile and staphylococcal infections are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Vitamin D deficiency may also contribute to increased healthcare costs. There is increasing evidence that vitamin D may have an antimicrobial role. We examined the relationship of serum 25(OH)D levels to staphylococcal and C. difficile infections to determine if vitamin D deficiency was associated with adverse outcomes. In the outpatient setting, vitamin D deficiency in patients with C. difficile and staphylococcal infections were associated with significantly increased total outpatients costs and fee-based consultation. Laboratory expenses had a trend towards higher costs in the vitamin D-deficient group but did not reach statistical significance. The differences were most clearly seen in the in-patient group with enhanced laboratory, pharmacy and radiology costs. These differences resulted in vitamin D-deficient patients with C. difficile or staphylococcal infections having costs more than five times higher than the non-deficient patients. The total length of hospital stay was four times greater in the vitamin D-deficient group. In addition, the total number of hospitalizations was also significantly greater in the vitamin D-deficient group. Surgery costs demonstrated a tendency to be higher in the vitamin D-deficient group but failed to reach statistical significance. Vitamin D deficiency is intimately linked to adverse health outcomes and costs in Veterans with staphylococcal and C. difficile infections in North East Tennessee. We recommend that vitamin D status be checked in patients with these infections and appropriate therapy be instituted to restore vitamin D level to normal in an expeditious manner.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteria resistant to metallic copper surfaces.
AB  - Metallic copper alloys have recently attracted attention as a new antimicrobial weapon for areas where surface hygiene is paramount. Currently it is not understood on a molecular level how metallic copper kills microbes, but previous studies have demonstrated that a wide variety of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium difficile, are inactivated within minutes or a few hours of exposure. In this study, we show that bacteria isolated from copper alloy coins comprise strains that are especially resistant against the toxic properties exerted by dry metallic copper surfaces. The most resistant of 294 isolates were Gram-positive staphylococci and micrococci, Kocuria palustris, and Brachybacterium conglomeratum but also included the proteobacterial species Sphingomonas panni and Pseudomonas oleovorans. Cells of some of these bacterial strains survived on copper surfaces for 48 h or more. Remarkably, when these dry-surface-resistant strains were exposed to moist copper surfaces, resistance levels were close to those of control strains and MICs for copper ions were at or below control strain levels. This suggests that mechanisms conferring resistance against dry metallic copper surfaces in these newly isolated bacterial strains are different from well-characterized copper ion detoxification systems. Furthermore, staphylococci on coins did not exhibit increased levels of resistance to antibiotics, arguing against coselection with copper surface resistance traits.
TI  - Purification, characterisation and identification of acidocin LCHV, an antimicrobial peptide produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus n.v. Er 317/402 strain Narine.
AB  - In the last two decades, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been gaining attention as antimicrobial alternatives to chemical food preservatives and commonly used antibiotics. Lactobacillus acidophilus n.v. Er 317/402 strain Narine produces a small AMP with a molecular weight of 1.1kDa, designated acidocin LCHV. In this study, the AMP was extremely heat stable (90min at 130 degrees C), was active over a wide pH range and was found to be sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin and proteinase K). Acidocin LCHV has a broad spectrum of activity both against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including several that are classified as Especially Dangerous Infections by the World Health Organization as well as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) was used to determine the molecular mass and sequence of the purified peptide. Complete killing with immediate impact on cells was observed within a very short period of time (10min).
TI  - Exposure to hospital roommates as a risk factor for health care-associated infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous patient- and hospital-level characteristics have been established as risk factors for the transmission of health care-associated infections (HAIs). Few studies have quantitatively assessed the impact of exposure to hospital roommates on the acquisition of infections. This study evaluated the association between roommate exposures and the risk of HAIs. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of adult patients admitted to a Canadian teaching hospital between June 30, 2001, and December 31, 2005, was studied. Exposures were characterized as total daily roommate exposures and daily unique roommate exposures. Outcomes examined were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Clostridium difficile. RESULTS: The number of roommate exposures per day was significantly associated with MRSA and VRE infection or colonization (MRSA: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05 to 1.15; VRE: HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.21), and with C difficile infection (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.19). A significant association also was found for number of unique roommate exposures per day and VRE (HR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.28). CONCLUSIONS: The significant associations found between daily roommate exposures and the infection outcomes suggest a possible role for limiting patient-to-patient contact in an infection prevention and control program in this facility. These findings have implications for the deployment and design of acute care hospitals.
TI  - Infection control practices in assisted living communities.
AB  - Few states require assisted living communities (ALCs) to have an infection control plan (ICP), nor do they provide guidelines about infection control practices in ALCs or require communicable disease reporting to appropriate health agencies or even within the community itself. Most communities do not have an ICP that addresses prevention, detection, investigation, control, monitoring, or communication of an infectious outbreak. This article discusses the presentation and management of pneumonia, influenza, tuberculosis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Clostridium difficile infection; describes common (i.e., standard) infection control practices in long-term care; and provides the most recent information and recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and other sources regarding prevention and treatment of the H1N1 viral influenza. The key to prevention is education and appropriate handwashing and respiratory hygiene practices. Internet sources for up-to-date information are also provided.
TI  - Historical and changing epidemiology of healthcare-associated infections.
AB  - This review compares the historical perspectives on healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) with the current changing epidemiological picture as it relates to these infections. Evidence in support of these changes is given using trends in mortality for Clostridium difficile and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in England as examples. The impact of current intervention programmes which target these, and other HCAIs, is also considered and knowledge gaps and options for changes in public health strategy required to achieve further reductions in HCAIs in the National Health Service in England are identified.
TI  - Development of a DNA microarray to detect antimicrobial resistance genes identified in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database.
AB  - To understand the mechanisms and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance (AR), the genetic elements responsible must be identified. Due to the myriad of possible genes, a high-density genotyping technique is needed for initial screening. To achieve this, AR genes in the National Center for Biotechnology Information GenBank database were identified by their annotations and compiled into a nonredundant list of 775 genes. A DNA microarray was constructed of 70mer oligonucelotide probes designed to detect these genes encoding resistances to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, chloramphenicols, glycopeptides, heavy metals, lincosamides, macrolides, metronidazoles, polyketides, quaternary ammonium compounds, streptogramins, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprims as well as resistance transfer genes. The microarray was validated with two fully sequenced control strains of Salmonella enterica: Typhimurium LT2 (sensitive) and Typhi CT18 (multidrug resistance [MDR]). All resistance genes encoded on the MDR plasmid, pHCM1, harbored by CT18 were detected in that strain, whereas no resistance genes were detected in LT2. The microarray was also tested with a variety of bacteria, including MDR Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria spp., and Clostridium difficile. The results presented here demonstrate that a microarray can be designed to detect virtually all AR genes found in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, thus reducing the subsequent assays necessary to identify specific resistance gene alleles.

TI  - Application of a novel decontamination process using gaseous ozone.
AB  - Environmental disinfection in a health care setting is an important aspect of infection control. Recently, there has been interest in the use of vapor- and gas-based treatments for decontamination of surfaces and rooms. We describe preliminary results for an ozone-based decontamination of surfaces seeded with a range of vegetative cells and spores of bacteria of clinical relevance. The efficacy of the approach for room sanitization was also assessed. The protocol included use of a quenching agent to rapidly reduce ozone concentrations to safe levels allowing treatment times of less than 1 h for the majority of organisms tested. Using bacteria seeded onto agar plates and solid surfaces, reductions in bacterial load of greater than 3 log values were recorded for a number of organisms including Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Application of the process in a 30 m3 room showed similar reductions in viable counts for these organisms and for Clostridium difficile spores. We suggest that the potential of this ozone-quench approach should be further evaluated for disinfection or decontamination of healthcare environments.
TI  - NO-loaded Zn(2+)-exchanged zeolite materials: a potential bifunctional anti-bacterial strategy.
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is important for the regulation of a number of diverse biological processes, including vascular tone, neurotransmission, inflammatory cell responsiveness, defence against invading pathogens and wound healing. Transition metal exchanged zeolites are nanoporous materials with high-capacity storage properties for gases such as NO. The NO stores are liberated upon contact with aqueous environments, thereby making them ideal candidates for use in biological and clinical settings. Here, we demonstrate the NO release capacity and powerful bactericidal properties of a novel NO-storing Zn(2+)-exchanged zeolite material at a 50 wt.% composition in a polytetrafluoroethylene polymer. Further to our published data showing the anti-thrombotic effects of a similar NO-loaded zeolite, this study demonstrates the anti-bacterial properties of NO-releasing zeolites against clinically relevant strains of bacteria, namely Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile. Thus our study highlights the potential of NO-loaded zeolites as biocompatible medical device coatings with anti-infective properties.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections--ecological niches].
AB  - Knowledge of ecological niches of nosocomial pathogens is used in treatment and prevention of nosocomial infections. This article offers an analysis of the ecological niches of three important nosocomial pathogens: Clostridium difficile, Staphylococcus aureus and Legionella pneumophila. Relevant terms are explained and examples of deliberate and non-deliberate manipulation of the niches and the following consequences are given. Finally, the consequences of climate changes on the pattern of nosocomial infections are discussed.
TI  - Infection control and IV therapy in patients with Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming anaerobe belonging to the family Clostridium, with the bacteria being found in low numbers in approximately 5% of the healthy adult population. Together with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, it is a major healthcare-associated infection and is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. Antibiotics administered to patients can alter normal gut flora, allowing the proliferation of C. difficile and causing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and colitis. Such diarrhoea, if severe, can lead to dangerous dehydration and even hypovolaemia, especially in the elderly. To limit the physiological impact of diarrhoea, it is sometimes necessary to administer intravenous therapy. Although good clinical practice demands that infection control should be considered in all clinical situations, specific infection control procedures need to be adhered to when administering intravenous therapy to patients with C. difficile.
TI  - Infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria: a review of the global challenge.
AB  - Infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria represent a major public health burden, not just in terms of morbidity and mortality, but also in terms of increased expenditure on patient management and implementation of infection control measures. Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. are established pathogens in the hospital environment, and their frequent multidrug resistance complicates therapy. The archetypal hospital "superbug", methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), regularly attracts mass-media interest and, in many countries, there is political pressure to reduce MRSA infection rates, with some progress now being made in the United Kingdom and the United States. To compound these established problems, we have witnessed the emergence and spread of virulent clones of MRSA in the community, and of Clostridium difficile in hospitals. Multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae clones are major community pathogens in many parts of the world, but are now being challenged by new conjugate vaccines. Using combinations of molecular epidemiological tools, which characterize the resistant isolates and their resistance determinants, scientists can track highly successful bacterial strains at local, national, and international levels. These methods have provided new insights into the evolution of key pathogens, and this information may aid the design of control strategies and vaccines. In addition, the development of new antimicrobials including oxazolidinones, lipopeptides, glycylcyclines, ketolides, and new generations of fluoroquinolones, antistaphylococcal b-lactams, and glycopeptides must remain a high priority for the continued effective treatment of infections caused by resistant strains. So far, resistance to these newer agents is identified rarely in surveillance programs, but occasional reports of resistance causing therapeutic failure (e.g., with linezolid, daptomycin, telithromycin, or newer fluoroquinolones) give cause for concern. The emergence of antibiotic resistance is inevitable, but we must seek to decrease its impact and prolong the effectiveness of the agents available to us.
TI  - Responsibility for managing healthcare-associated infections: where does the buck stop?
AB  - The prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) requires a tripartite partnership between clinicians and carers, managers and government/Department of Health (DoH) across the whole health and social care community. Mandatory surveillance of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia and Clostridium difficile infection has shown a significant fall from peak numbers in 2003/04 and 2006, respectively, and there is now a zero tolerance approach to preventable infections and poor practice. Success so far has been based on senior management commitment, enhanced real-time surveillance, implementation of clinical protocols (high impact interventions, prudent prescribing), improved hand hygiene and environmental cleaning, and training and audit, backed up by a heightened performance management focus through targets and legislation (Code of Practice). DoH improvement teams have supported National Health Service trusts in implementing change. Responsibility for managing HCAI is a combination of managerial responsibility based upon compliance assurance that procedures and protocols are being implemented and personal professional responsibility of all clinicians and other healthcare workers.
TI  - Swine flu and antibiotics.
AB  - Health services worldwide are likely to be hard-pressed by swine flu-related illness in the months ahead. Secondary infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci (e.g. Streptococcus pyogenes), Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus are likely to be important causes of morbidity and mortality. The UK Department of Health recently published clinical pathways for the management of swine flu. Suggested severity criteria have not been validated in respiratory infection and are different from those previously published. Antibiotics are recommended for all patients assessed at hospital, regardless of severity of illness; cephalosporins or quinolones are suggested for inpatients with pneumonia. These recommendations will jeopardize recent decreases in Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in UK hospitals. This article, written on behalf of the BSAC Council, considers these recommendations and provides alternative antibiotic regimens for a range of clinical scenarios.
TI  - [New antibiotics: small or big advances?].
AB  - This contribution summarizes the "state-of-the-art" in the field of new antibiotics. On the one hand interesting new substances are discussed, on the other hand areas of interest for more research are shown. Doripenem is a new broad-spectrum antibiotic which proved superior to other carbapenems as far as gram-negative bacilli were concerned and also showed less development of resistance. For the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), linezolid, tigecyclin and daptomycin reached drug approval within recent years. The new glycopeptides and iclaprim await approval. The majority of these substances are also effective against other resistant organisms like vancomycin-intermediate Staph. aureus and vancomycin-resistant entercoccus. Increasing virulence of some Clostridium difficile strains (particularly ribotype 027) within the past years has led to a growing need for new strategies concerning treatment and prophylaxis of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea.
TI  - The role of environmental cleaning in the control of hospital-acquired infection.
AB  - Increasing numbers of hospital-acquired infections have generated much attention  over the last decade. The public has linked the so-called 'superbugs' with their experience of dirty hospitals but the precise role of environmental cleaning in the control of these organisms remains unknown. Until cleaning becomes an evidence-based science, with established methods for assessment, the importance of a clean environment is likely to remain speculative. This review will examine the links between the hospital environment and various pathogens, including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, norovirus, Clostridium difficile and acinetobacter. These organisms may be able to survive in healthcare environments but there is evidence to support their vulnerability to the cleaning process. Removal with, or without, disinfectants, appears to be associated with reduced infection rates for patients. Unfortunately, cleaning is often delivered as part of an overall infection control package in response to an outbreak and the importance of cleaning as a single intervention remains controversial. Recent work has shown that hand-touch sites are habitually contaminated by hospital pathogens, which are then delivered to patients on hands. It is possible that prioritising the cleaning of these sites might offer a useful adjunct to the current preoccupation with hand hygiene, since hand-touch sites comprise the less well-studied side of the hand-touch site equation. In addition, using proposed standards for hospital hygiene could provide further evidence that cleaning is a cost-effective intervention for controlling hospital-acquired infection.
TI  - A comparison of infection control program resources, activities, and antibiotic resistant organism rates in Canadian acute care hospitals in 1999 and 2005: pre- and post-severe acute respiratory syndrome.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Resources for Infection Control in Hospitals (RICH) project assessed infection control programs and rates of antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) in Canadian acute care hospitals in 1999. In the meantime, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and the concern over pandemic influenza have stimulated considerable government and healthcare institutional efforts to improve infection control systems in Canada. METHODS: In 2006, a version of the RICH survey similar to the original RICH instrument was mailed to infection control programs in all Canadian acute care hospitals with 80 or more beds. Chi-square, ANOVA, and analysis of covariance analyses tested for differences between the 1999 and 2005 samples for infection control program components and ARO rates. RESULTS: 72.3% of Canadian acute care hospitals completed the RICH survey for 1999 and 60.1% for 2005. Hospital size was controlled for in analyses involving AROs and surveillance and control intensity levels. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rates increased from 1999 to 2005 (F = 9.4, P = 0.003). In 2005, the MRSA rate was 5.2 (SD 6.1) per 1,000 admissions and in 1999 was 2.0 (SD 2.9). Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) rates, trended up from 1999 to 2005 (F = 2.9, P = 0.09). In 2005, the mean CDAD rate was 4.7 (SD 4.3) and in 1999 it was 3.8 (SD 4.3). The proportion of hospitals that reported having new nosocomial Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) cases was greater in 2005 than in 1999 (X = 10.5, P = 0.001). In 1999, 34.5% (40 of 116) hospitals reported having new nosocomial VRE cases and in 2005, 61.0% (64 of 105) reported new cases. Surveillance intensity index scores increased from 61.7 (SD 18.5) in 1999 to 68.1 (SD 15.4) in 2005 (F = 4.1, P = 0.04). Control intensity index scores, trended upwards slightly from 60.8 (SD 14.6) in 1999 to 64.1 (12.2) in 2005 (F = 3.2, P = 0.07). ICP full time equivalents (FTEs) per 100 beds increased from 0.5 (SD 0.2) in 1999 to 0.8 (SD 0.3) in 2005 (F = 90.8, P < 0.0001). However, the proportion of ICPs in hospitals certified by the Certification Board of Infection Control (CBIC) decreased from 53% (SD 46) in 1999 to 38% (SD 36) in 2005 (F = 8.7, P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Canadian infection control programs in 2005 continued to fall short of expert recommendations for human resources and surveillance and control activities. Meanwhile, Nosocomial MRSA rates more than doubled between 1999 and 2005 and hospitals reporting new nosocomial VRE cases increased 77% over the same period. While investments have been made towards infection control programs in Canadian acute hospitals, the rapid rise in ICP positions has not yet translated into marked improvements in surveillance and control activities. In the face of substantial increases in ARO rates in Canada, continued efforts to train ICPs and support hospital infection control programs are necessary.

TI  - Training programs to strengthen Pennsylvania's public health response.
AB  - This report describes Pennsylvania's 9-year experience in implementing training programs to strengthen public health response to emerging infectious diseases. During the biannual 3-5-day-long Pennsylvania Public Health Institute (PHI) events, which have been held since 2000, courses have covered topics such as emerging infectious disease outbreaks, monitoring of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in retail food, and zoonotic diseases commonly associated with companion animals. Core competency courses include the legal basis for public health and epidemiology for nonepidemiologists. Emerging infectious disease seminars offered to clinicians since 2005 have focused on the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Complementing the PHI, the Pennsylvania Department of Health's monthly Epidemiology Journal Club offers additional interactions with presenters from academic institutions and federal agencies. Lunch-time forums also provide a venue for health department staff to share their work with colleagues. Innovative use of modern communication technology increases participation of frontline health workers in Journal Club events, and video conference capability offers flexibility in the selection of presenters. Pennsylvania's experience over the past 9 years demonstrates that with political will, commitment from content experts, and adequate administrative support, modest state and federal resources can be used to sustain public health training programs tailored to local needs.
TI  - Staphylococcal enterocolitis: forgotten but not gone?
AB  - PURPOSE: Staphylococcus aureus may cause antibiotic-associated diarrhea and enterocolitis, with or without preceding antibiotic use, in immunocompromised adults or infants, or individuals with predisposing conditions, but there is little appreciation of this condition clinically. CLINICAL DISEASE: The main clinical feature that helps to differentiate staphylococcal enterocolitis (SEC) from Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea is large-volume, cholera-like diarrhea in the former case. A predominance of gram-positive cocci in clusters on gram stain of stool or biopsy specimens and the isolation of S. aureus as the dominant or sole flora support the diagnosis. PATHOGENESIS: The pathogenesis of SEC requires the interaction of staphylococcal enterotoxins, which function as superantigens, with interstitial epithelial lymphocytes and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). MANAGEMENT: Most SEC represents recent S. aureus acquisition, so that improved infection prevention practices can reduce disease recurrence. Management should include aggressive fluid management and repletion and oral vancomycin.
TI  - Nosocomial and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea caused by organisms other than Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Most cases of nosocomial and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are caused by alteration of the physiological gut microflora. This alteration leads to reduced microbial metabolism of carbohydrates and primary bile acids, resulting in osmotic or secretory forms of diarrhoea. Moreover, facultative enteropathogens may experience a growth advantage due to the antibiotic-induced microflora alteration that, in turn, can harm the gut mucosa by the toxins they produce. Clostridium difficile is the major infectious agent leading to pseudomembranous colitis. However, there is increasing evidence that certain other pathogens such as enterotoxin-producing Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella oxytoca can induce mucosal deterioration and diarrhoea after antibiotic use. But, as with C. difficile, these facultative enteropathogens can also be found in the healthy population. Their contribution to disease is, therefore, controversial and their presence in the stools of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea patients is often claimed to be mere colonisation. In this respect, the causal relationship of each suspected pathogen with the development of intestinal disease has to be proved clinically and experimentally.
TI  - Controversies in infection: infection control or antibiotic stewardship to control healthcare-acquired infection?
AB  - Despite record resource being devoted to the control of healthcare-acquired infection (HCAI), rates have never been higher. Although the discovery of the contagiousness of puerperal sepsis by Alexander Gordon heralded the golden era of bacteriology and antibiotics, this led to a belief that infection was beaten. This in its turn may well have led us into a false sense of security and an over-reliance on antibiotics. Modern medicine has built many of its advances on a need for antibiotics, but their very success has led to huge over-use and resulting problems of resistance. Compounded by the absence of a good antibiotic pipeline we are now being forced to address the paradox of antibiotics; namely that they may actually be causing many HCAIs. Not only Clostridium difficile infection, but many others such as those caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, are more or less completely contingent on antibiotic prescribing. Control of prescribing would probably be just as effective a measure in our fight against HCAI as conventional infection control measures. Arguably, traditional infection control is akin to fire-fighting and antibiotic stewardship to prevention.
TI  - Healthcare-associated infections: infection prevention and control within the Accreditation Canada Qmentum Program.
AB  - Gardam, Lemieux, Reason, van Dijk and Goel argue that healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are "a pressing and imminent concern in the context of patient safety." Accreditation Canada supports the position taken by these authors. The prevention and control of two HAIs of great concern, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile, are an integral part of the Accreditation Canada program. A coordinated approach to combating HAIs and developing a culture of infection prevention and control is necessary, one that involves front-line healthcare professionals, senior leadership, national and provincial partners and the public. Since 2005, Accreditation Canada has increasingly strengthened the accreditation program in this area through a number of new strategies, including enhanced standards, required organizational practices, performance measures and indicators and the introduction of education programs. Optimizing the value of accreditation through an integrative approach with organizations' quality improvement programs will contribute to effectively combating HAIs and developing a culture of infection prevention and control.
TI  - Healthcare-associated infections as patient safety indicators.
AB  - Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a pressing and imminent patient safety concern as they cause substantial preventable morbidity and mortality. Despite this, there is a strong tendency for healthcare administrators and providers to view them as far less of a threat to patient safety than adverse events such as medication administration errors and falls. Further, validated strategies to prevent HAIs are frequently slow to be adopted. This paper reviews two HAIs of increasing visibility and importance - namely, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile - and discusses the pivotal importance of hand hygiene and environmental cleaning in their prevention. Possible reasons why HAIs are approached differently from other patient safety issues are discussed, including the false sense of security created by the advent of antibiotics, the lack of randomized controlled trials supporting infection-control interventions and the systemic multifactorial causes of HAIs that result in a need for interventions that go far beyond traditional clinical boundaries. Suggested strategies to improve patient safety with respect to HAIs are provided, including a focus on the role of potential links to accreditation; the role of public reporting; healthcare facility design; change management strategies; visible leadership and role modelling; collaboration between facilities and with public health; reducing hospital overcrowding; and accountability and funding. Finally, the impact of the burgeoning interest of the media, the threat of legal liability and the well-being of healthcare providers are discussed.

TI  - Establishment of an outpatient and home parenteral antimicrobial therapy service  at a London teaching hospital: a case series.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Outpatient and home parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OHPAT) is becoming increasingly commonplace in the UK, enabling those patients who would previously have been obliged to remain in hospital for intravenous treatment to be managed as outpatients or in their own homes. The OHPAT service at St Mary's Hospital, London, was established in 2004. This paper describes the types of infection, antimicrobial management and outcomes of patients referred to the service in the 3.5 years since its inception. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All inpatients were eligible for OHPAT, provided that they had a serious infection requiring parenteral therapy, were well enough to leave hospital and fulfilled other criteria. We initially used an outpatient clinic model, but as the service developed, treatment was often delivered in patients' homes, with the OHPAT team providing training and assessment of primary care staff. RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty-seven patients were referred to the service between September 2004 and April 2008. Of these, 273 received 303 courses of OHPAT, 48 were discharged on oral therapy and 3 patients declined outpatient therapy; the remaining 143 patients were deemed unsuitable for inclusion, most commonly because the patient was too unwell for discharge (28.7%) or their social situation was inappropriate (14.7%). Causative organisms were identified in two-thirds of cases, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus implicated in one-third of these. Mean treatment length was 24 days (range 1-165 days), with 7394 inpatient bed-days saved. Less than 5% of patients were readmitted within 28 days with infection- or drug-related problems. There were no cases of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea during or after outpatient treatment, despite extensive use of cephalosporins and other broad-spectrum agents. Patients found the service highly satisfactory and felt that it had improved their quality of life during the treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the OHPAT service at St Mary's Hospital has proved to be of benefit to patients and hospital efficiency alike.
TI  - SASP gene delivery: a novel antibacterial approach.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a global problem, and with bacteria having developed resistance to all approved antibacterial agents there is a growing need for innovative solutions. Phico Therapeutics has developed a new class of antibacterial agent, a platform technology called SASPject. SASPject comprises modified, disabled bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) injecting a gene encoding an antibacterial protein, SASP, into target bacteria. SASP, or Small, Acid-soluble Spore Protein(s), inactivate bacterial DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner so their activity is unaffected by DNA mutations. Selected pathogens can be targeted, avoiding the normal flora. A Staphylococcus aureus-targeted SASPject, PT1.2, developed for the nasal decolonization of S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains, is expected to complete phase I in 2009. SASPject PT1.2 shows good in vitro activity against a wide range of diverse clinical S. aureus isolates, including MRSA strains. A systemic SASPject PT1.2, and SASPjects targeted against Clostridium difficile and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms are in development. The SASPject technology could represent a new paradigm in antibacterial therapeutics.
TI  - Novel fit for purpose single use tourniquet: best of both worlds.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Healthcare associated infections (HAI), such as Meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) are estimated to cost the NHS pound1 billion and contribute to 5000 deaths/year in the UK. To date the main emphasis to reduce HAIs has been on hand hygiene. However environmental microbial load and compliance limits the efficacy of hand washing alone. Cultures from tourniquets have demonstrated contamination by pathogens including MRSA. Consequently, many UK trusts are introducing disposable tourniquets as policy. The use of most disposable tourniquets is still limited, as few are able to maintain patient comfort, ease of use and cost effectiveness. This study compares patient and phlebotomist experiences of the single-use tourniquet, Tournistrip, with currently available disposable and re-usable alternatives. METHODS: The trial was performed in on patients attending two West London teaching hospital outpatient phlebotomy departments, over a four week period. After Tournistrip use, the patients were invited to fill in an anonymous questionnaire, covering comfort and appearance. A separate questionnaire was filled in by the phlebotomists. RESULTS: Ninety five percent of patients found the Tournistrip professional looking, with 54% preferring it to the current re-usable alternatives. One hundred and seventy eight of the 227 patients found Tournistrip comfortable. Overall, 85% of patients found Tournistrip at least as good, if not better than re-usable tourniquets. All of the phlebotomists found the Tournistrip professional looking, and none preferred previously used disposable alternatives. Ninety-five percent found it as easy to use as a re-usable and none found previous disposables better to use. DISCUSSION: The Tournistrip was designed to match the comfort and ease of use of the re-usable tourniquet, whilst maintaining cost efficacy. This clinical trial shows the Tournistrip is viewed as a superior tourniquet to the current generation of disposables and a viable replacement to the re-usable tourniquet in the continuing challenge to reduce HAIs.
TI  - Assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide CECT7121 against human Gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistant Gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. This work investigated the efficacy of AP-CECT7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121) against various pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: Strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard antibiotic treatments. Inhibitory activity of AP-CECT7121 was assessed using the agar-well diffusion method. The most resistant isolates from each species screened (Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis,Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. RESULTS: These bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus and C. perfringens: viable counts for C. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. CONCLUSIONS: AP-CECT7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Incidence of acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, and other health-care-associated pathogens by dogs that participate in animal-assisted interventions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dogs that visited human health-care facilities were at greater risk of acquiring certain health-care-associated pathogens, compared with dogs performing animal-assisted interventions in other settings, and to identify specific behaviors of dogs associated with an increased risk of acquiring these pathogens. DESIGN: Prospective cohort and nested case-control studies. ANIMALS: 96 dogs that visited human health-care facilities and 98 dogs involved in other animal-assisted interventions. PROCEDURES: Fecal samples and nasal swab specimens were collected from dogs at the time of recruitment and every 2 months for 1 year and were tested for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile, and other selected bacteria. Information was also obtained on facilities visited during animal-assisted interventions, dog diet, dog illnesses, and antimicrobial use within the home. At the end of the study, dog handlers were asked about the behavior of their dogs during visits to health-care facilities. RESULTS: Rates of acquisition of MRSA and C difficile were 4.7 and 2.4 times as high, respectively, among dogs that visited human health-care facilities, compared with rates among dogs involved in other animal-assisted interventions. Among dogs that visited human health-care facilities, those that licked patients or accepted treats during visits were more likely to be positive for MRSA and C difficile than were dogs that did not lick patients or accept treats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that dogs that visited human health-care facilities were at risk of acquiring MRSA and C difficile, particularly when they licked patients or accepted treats during visits.
TI  - The antibiotic challenge: changing clinical management of infections.
AB  - Resistance is one of many reasons why antibiotic therapy can be ineffective. Efforts to forestall further development of antimicrobial resistance include judicial prescribing of antibiotics, implementing infection-control measures, and developing institutional stewardship of antimicrobial agents. This article, the third and final in a series on antibiotic resistance, discusses selected common infections that have changing epidemiology and/or for which the recommended evaluation and treatment guidelines have been updated.
TI  - Isolation precautions for antibiotic-resistant bacteria in healthcare settings.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and new or changing infectious pathogens is an important public health problem. Transmission of these pathogens in an acute care setting may occur frequently if proper precautions are not taken. Despite several guidelines and an abundance of literature on the prevention of transmission of epidemiologically important organisms in the healthcare setting, substantial controversy exists. This review focuses on recent data regarding the use of infection control and isolation precautions. RECENT FINDINGS: New data are available, but the conflict surrounding the use of active surveillance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has not been resolved. The emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria has prompted a greater interest in infection control strategies for prevention of their spread. Outbreaks of Clostridium difficile have responded to broad infection control initiatives, but further research is required to determine whether the best infection control precautions are being utilized. SUMMARY: Effective prevention of the transmission of pathogens within the healthcare system requires a multifaceted approach. Existing guidelines should be used to create institutional policies specific to individual patient populations, problem pathogens and the ability to practically implement various infection control procedures. Despite ongoing study, the use of active surveillance to prevent transmission of MRSA continues to be a complex, controversial and challenging issue.

AB  - Inadequate antibiotic prescribing and poor adherence to infection control guidelines are the main reasons for the development and spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile (CD), the most important cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AD) and colitis. Both CDAD and MRSA infection are associated with significant morbidity, excess mortality and substantial consumption of resources. Increases in the incidence of both infections have been observed in Germany and represent a challenge to clinicians, infection control practitioners, quality management teams und hospital administration. Prudent use of antibiotics, in particular critical prescribing of fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins, is an important component in programmes aiming at an effective prevention of MRSA and CDAD. Other similarly important components are minimization of pathogen transmission between patients and healthcare personnel by isolation and contact precautions, early detection of MRSA carriers and MRSA decolonization treatment. It must be ascertained that patients nursed in isolation rooms receive medical care of similar high quality as all other patients. Over the last years, there has been no major breakthrough in therapy and outcomes in both CDAD and MRSA infection. Close collaboration between hospitals, nursing homes and primary care institutions will be critical for better control of MRSA and CDAD.
TI  - Feasibility of routinely using hydrogen peroxide vapor to decontaminate rooms in  a busy United States hospital.
AB  - During a 22-month period at a 500-bed teaching hospital, 1,565 rooms that had housed patients infected with multidrug-resistant pathogens were decontaminated using hydrogen peroxide vapor. Hydrogen peroxide vapor decontamination required a mean time of 2 hours and 20 minutes, compared with 32 minutes for conventional cleaning. Despite the greater time required for decontamination, hydrogen peroxide vapor decontamination of selected patient rooms is feasible in a busy hospital with a mean occupancy rate of 94%.

TI  - Health care-associated infections: is there an end in sight?
AB  - OVERVIEW: Health care-associated infections (HAIs) have emerged as a significant  concern in policy as well as clinical circles. An HAI is an infection acquired during treatment for another condition. Some of the HAI-causing bacteria have become drug-resistant; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, is a familiar example. Tied to perhaps 100,000 deaths and $20 billion in health care costs each year, HAIs have given rise to state laws, legislative proposals at the federal level, public-private initiatives, and work at the hospital system and individual hospital level. However, much remains to be done. This issue brief reviews the prevalence of HAIs and the strategies for and barriers to reducing their incidence. It examines the roles of public- and private-sector entities in reporting, monitoring, and eliminating HAIs. Policy responses such as research funding, training specifications, and payment adjustments are considered.

TI  - Vapour-phase activities of essential oils against antibiotic sensitive and resistant bacteria including MRSA.
AB  - AIMS: To determine whether essential oil (EO) vapours could reduce surface and airborne levels of bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS AND RESULTS: The antibacterial activity of geranium and lemongrass EO individually and blended were evaluated over a range of concentrations by direct contact and vapour diffusion. The EO were tested in vitro against a selection of antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria, including MRSA, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), Acinetobacter baumanii and Clostridium difficile. An EO blend containing lemongrass and geranium was used to formulate BioScent that was dispersed into the environment using the ST Pro machine. The effects were variable depending on the methods used. In a sealed box environment, MRSA growth on seeded plates was reduced by 38% after 20 h exposure to BioScent vapour. In an office environment, the ST Pro machine dispersing BioScent effected an 89% reduction of airborne bacteria in 15 h, when operated at a constant output of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: EO vapours inhibited growth of antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria in vitro and reduced surface and airborne levels of bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results suggest that EO vapours, particularly Bioscent, could be used as a method of air disinfection.

TI  - Spectrum of activity and mode of action of REP3123, a new antibiotic to treat Clostridium difficile infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of REP3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) in development for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. METHODS: The spectrum of activity of REP3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of C. difficile and non-target organisms. The mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. RESULTS: REP3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of C. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant BI/NAP1/027 strains (MIC range=0.5-1 mg/L and MIC(90) = 1 mg/L). The spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (MIC(90)s < 1 mg/L), but REP3123 was not active against most Gram-negative bacteria. REP3123 targeted C. difficile MetRS with a calculated inhibition constant (K(i)) of 0.020 nM, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic MetRS. The specific mode of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by REP3123, and by metS overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in MIC for REP3123. Spontaneous REP3123-resistant mutants of C. difficile (MICs, 4-128 mg/L) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the metS gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. Most of the MetRS substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. CONCLUSIONS: REP3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target C. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.
TI  - [Collateral damage of cephalosporins and quinolones and possibilities for control].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The occurrence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms is associated with an extended and long-term use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Indeed, this may lead to a colonization and even to an infection of the patient, which is called collateral damage. Moreover, the risk for collateral damage can be assessed for different antibiotic classes. OCCURRENCE OF MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT MICROORGANISMS: The use of cephalosporins may induce a subsequent infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, beta-lactam-resistant Acinetobacter species, and Clostridium difficile. Quinolones are associated with a subsequent infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and with increasing resistance in gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: To avoid the occurrence of multidrug-resistant microorganisms, a strict indication and time-limited use (e.g., 1 week) of antibiotics are required, as already established in the guidelines for infection.
TI  - Two time-series analyses of the impact of antibiotic consumption and alcohol-based hand disinfection on the incidences of nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection and Clostridium difficile infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of antibiotic consumption and alcohol-based hand disinfection on the incidences of nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). METHODS: Two multivariate time-series analyses were performed that used as dependent variables the monthly incidences of nosocomial MRSA infection and CDI at the Freiburg University Medical Center during the period January 2003 through October 2007. The volume of alcohol-based hand rub solution used per month was quantified in liters per 1,000 patient-days. Antibiotic consumption was calculated in terms of the number of defined daily doses per 1,000 patient-days per month. RESULTS: The use of alcohol-based hand rub was found to have a significant impact on the incidence of nosocomial MRSA infection (P< .001). The multivariate analysis (R2=0.66) showed that a higher volume of use of alcohol-based hand rub was associated with a lower incidence of nosocomial MRSA infection. Conversely, a higher level of consumption of selected antimicrobial agents was associated with a higher incidence of nosocomial MRSA infection. This analysis showed this relationship was the same for the use of second-generation cephalosporins (P= .023), third-generation cephalosporins (P= .05), fluoroquinolones (P= .01), and lincosamides (P= .05). The multivariate analysis (R2=0.55) showed that a higher level of consumption of third-generation cephalosporins (P= .008), fluoroquinolones (P= .084), and/or macrolides (P= .007) was associated with a higher incidence of CDI. A correlation with use of alcohol-based hand rub was not detected. CONCLUSION: In 2 multivariate time-series analyses, we were able to show the impact of hand hygiene and antibiotic use on the incidence of nosocomial MRSA infection, but we found no association between hand hygiene and incidence of CDI.
TI  - [Diarrhea from the infectologist's point of view].
AB  - Gastroenteritis is a nonspecific term for various pathologic states of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastroenteritis causing pathogens are the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the developed countries diarrhea is the most common reason for missing work, while in the developing world, it is a leading cause of death. Internationally, the mortality rate is 5-10 million deaths each year. "Traveller's diarrhea" is a polyetiologic common health problem of international travellers which affects travellers generally for days, but it can result in chronic postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome as well. Infectious agents usually cause acute gastroenteritis either by adherence of the intestinal mucosa, or by mucosal invasion, enterotoxin production, and/or cytotoxin production. The incubation period can often suggest the cause of etiology. When symptoms occur within 6 hours of eating, ingestion of preformed toxin of S. aureus or Bacillus cereus should be suspected. The incidence of hypervirulent C. difficile associated colitis is an emerging problem as a healthcare system associated infection. While infectious agents do not commonly cause chronic diarrhea, those that do include C. difficile, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium, Aeromonas and Yersinia . Amoebiasis is the second to malaria as a protozoal cause of death. Infection with HIV is also a common cause of diarrhea.
TI  - Healthcare-associated infection in acute hospitals: which interventions are effective?
AB  - This study investigated the potential factors linked to healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) rates in acute National Health Service hospitals, analysing mandatory surveillance data with existing data available to the Healthcare Commission, and supplemented by a bespoke questionnaire. A questionnaire was developed to cover important elements related to the management and control of HCAI. Additional data were collated from other sources. Infection outcomes comprised the mandatory surveillance data, for both meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD). The response rate was 90%. A lower MRSA rate was linked to hand hygiene and isolation and a lower rate of CDAD to cleanliness, good antimicrobial prescribing practices and surveillance of infections. Lower rates of both organisms were related to strategic planned interventions, such as the inclusion of infection control in the staff development programme. However, certain interventions, for example increased levels of training, were related to a higher infection rate. These findings for MRSA and CDAD are supported by evidence from the infection control literature. We have found relationships between interventions and higher infection rates that are counterintuitive and that may represent examples of what we call 'reactive practice' to higher rates of infection. Whilst it is interesting to hypothesise that these interventions may be swift and simple to introduce and may not be sustained compared to more strategic and planned interventions linked to lower infection rates, they most probably simply represent the beginning of a culture change and embedding of infection control practice.
TI  - Healthcare-associated Infections: epidemiology, prevention, and therapy.
AB  - Reducing nosocomial infection rates is a major component of healthcare improvement. This article reviews the epidemiology, prevention, and therapy for some of the most common healthcare-associated infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infections and catheter-associated urinary tract infections, and 3 common organisms: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug- resistant gram-negative bacteria, and Clostridium difficile.
TI  - Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection in hospitalized older people.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection (UTI) in hospitalized older people with clinical criteria and therapeutic guidelines. DESIGN: A retrospective case series of emergency hospital admissions collected over an 18-month period. SETTING: An acute general hospital in northwest England. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred sixty-five patients aged 75 and older with a diagnosis of UTI at hospital discharge. MEASUREMENTS: Data relating to age, sex, presenting complaint, admission and discharge destinations, background comorbidities and medications, investigations performed, treatment given, length of stay, and complications were obtained using chart review. RESULTS: Of the 265 patients (mean age 85.4) the overdiagnosis of UTI was common, with 43.4% of patients not meeting criteria. Only 32.1% of patients overall had any urinary tract symptoms (48.7% in the UTI group). Of the non-UTI group, 12 (10.4%) had urinary tract symptoms with a negative urine culture, 43 (37.4%) had asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), and 60 (52.2%) had neither urinary tract symptoms nor bacteriuria. Treatment given varied greatly. The mortality rate was 6.0%, and the average length of stay was 29.9 days (median 17.0, range 1-192). Complications were frequent, including Clostridium difficile diarrhea (8%), falls (4%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection (3%), and fracture (2%). CONCLUSION: More-reliable criteria are needed to aid the diagnosis of UTI in hospitalized older people. Better adherence to clinical management guidelines may improve outcomes.

TI  - Survey of wastewater indicators and human pathogen genomes in biosolids produced  by class a and class B stabilization treatments.
AB  - Accurate modeling of the infectious aerosol risk associated with the land application of biosolids requires an in-depth knowledge of the magnitudes and changes in pathogen concentrations for a variety of class A and class B stabilization methods. The following survey used quantitative PCR (qPCR) and culture assays to detect environmentally resistant bacterial and viral pathogens and biosolid indicator organisms for 36 biosolid grab samples. Biosolids were collected from 14 U.S. states and included 16 class B mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) samples and 20 class A biosolid samples from temperature-phased anaerobic digestion (TPAD), MAD plus composting (COM), and MAD plus heat pelletization processes. The indicator concentrations of fecal coliforms and male-specific coliphages as well as pathogen genome concentrations for human adenovirus species, Legionella pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium difficile were significantly lower in the class A samples, and a multivariate analysis of variance ranked the stabilization processes from the lowest pathogen/indicator load to the highest as (i) class A COM, (ii) class A TPAD, and (iii) class B MAD. Human adenovirus genomes were found in 88% of the class B samples and 70 to 100% of the class A samples. L. pneumophila, S. aureus, and C. difficile genomes were detected at the qPCR assay detection limits in 19 to 50% of the class B and class A anaerobic digestion samples, while L. pneumophila was detected in 50% of the class A compost samples. When considering all the stabilization methods, both the fecal coliform and the male-specific coliphage concentrations show a significant linear correlation with the pathogen genome concentrations. This survey provides the necessary pathogen concentrations to add to biosolid aerosol risk and pathogen exposure analyses and clarifies the effectiveness of class A stabilization methods with the pathogen and indicator loads in biosolids.
TI  - Revolutionizing the practice of medicine through rapid (< 1h) DNA-based diagnostics.
AB  - Twenty years ago, I dreamed of using DNA detection for speeding the microbiological identification of microorganisms from two days to less than one hour. This dream is slowly becoming a reality as we were the first to develop and put on the market real-time PCR assays, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada, for the detection of several pathogens including Group B streptococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Clostridium difficile. Since 2000, my team and I have been interested to bring this laboratory revolution to the bedside, by developing a microfluidic centripetal device, a compact disc-like platform that, instead of reading music, reads DNA. This futuristic approach to the management of infectious diseases at point-of-care will undoubtedly necessitate a 'change in culture without culture'.
TI  - Growth and geographic variation in hospitalizations with resistant infections, United States, 2000-2005.
AB  - From 2000 through 2005, hospitalizations with resistant infections (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile-associated disease, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida infection) nearly doubled, from 499,702 to 947,393. Regional variations noted in the aggregate and by individual infection may help clarify modifiable risk factors driving these infections.
TI  - Isolation and analysis of bacteria with antimicrobial activities from the marine  sponge Haliclona simulans collected from Irish waters.
AB  - Samples of the marine sponge Haliclona simulans were collected from Irish coastal waters, and bacteria were isolated from these samples. Phylogenetic analyses of the cultured isolates showed that four different bacterial phyla were represented; Bacteriodetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes. The sponge bacterial isolates were assayed for the production of antimicrobial substances, and biological activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi were demonstrated, with 50% of isolates showing antimicrobial activity against at least one of the test strains. Further testing showed that the antimicrobial activities extended to the important pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium difficile, multi-drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and pathogenic yeast strains. The Actinomycetes were numerically the most abundant producers of antimicrobial activities, although activities were also noted from Bacilli and Pseudovibrio isolates. Surveys for the presence of potential antibiotic encoding polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes also revealed that genes for the biosynthesis of these secondary metabolites were present in most bacterial phyla but were particularly prevalent among the Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. This study demonstrates that the culturable fraction of bacteria from the sponge H. simulans is diverse and appears to possess much potential as a source for the discovery of new medically relevant biological active agents.

TI  - Finding the gaps: an assessment of infection control surveillance needs in British Columbia acute care facilities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper reports on an infection prevention and control surveillance survey of acute care facilities (ACFs) performed by the Provincial Infection Control Network of British Columbia. METHODS: A surveillance questionnaire was sent to all health care facilities that had access to an infection control professional. The questionnaire incorporated questions on organism-specific, disease-specific, and general surveillance activities. RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned from 47 of 51 (92%) of the ACFs surveyed. Participation in surveillance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci-, and Clostridium difficile-associated disease ranged from 97% to 100%, but surveillance methodologies were inconsistent. Surgical-site infection surveillance did not correlate with the most commonly performed operations or with those procedures associated with higher morbidity and mortality from a postoperative infection. Considerable variation in data collection methods and case definitions was also identified. Surveillance for urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, and ventilator-associated pneumonia was present in 28%, 51%, and 23% of responding ACFs, respectively. CONCLUSION: The current lack of a standardized surveillance system in British Columbia limits the ability of facilities to set appropriate benchmarks to assist in prioritizing and applying infection control interventions. The survey, however, has assisted in prioritizing implementation of surveillance activities and identifying the resources that would be required.
TI  - Ozone gas is an effective and practical antibacterial agent.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections continue to pose a threat to health in many institutional and communal settings, and epidemics are frequent. Current control measures are clearly inadequate; thus, there is a need for a simple, effective, and safe way to decontaminate surfaces. METHODS: We evaluated the efficacy of a portable ozone-generating machine, equipped with a catalytic converter and an accessory humidifier, to inactivate 15 different species of medically important bacteria. RESULTS: An ozone dosage of 25 ppm for 20 minutes, with a short burst of humidity in excess of 90% relative humidity, was able to inactivate more than 3 log(10) colony-forming units of most of the bacteria, including Acinetobacter baumannii, Clostridium difficile, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, in both in a laboratory test system and simulated field conditions. In many cases, complete eradication was achieved. Dried and wet samples were equally vulnerable to the ozone. Inactivation of bacterial samples dried onto soft surfaces (eg, fabric, cotton, filter paper) were comparable with that observed for samples on plastic. CONCLUSIONS: The ozone generator can provide a valuable decontamination tool for the removal of bacteria in many institutional and communal settings, including hospitals and other health care institutions.
TI  - Development and application of the active surveillance of pathogens microarray to monitor bacterial gene flux.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human and animal health is constantly under threat by emerging pathogens that have recently acquired genetic determinants that enhance their survival, transmissibility and virulence. We describe the construction and development of an Active Surveillance of Pathogens (ASP) oligonucleotide microarray, designed to 'actively survey' the genome of a given bacterial pathogen for virulence-associated genes. RESULTS: The microarray consists of 4958 reporters from 151 bacterial species and include genes for the identification of individual bacterial species as well as mobile genetic elements (transposons, plasmid and phage), virulence genes and antibiotic resistance genes. The ASP microarray was validated with nineteen bacterial pathogens species, including Francisella tularensis, Clostridium difficile, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The ASP microarray identified these bacteria, and provided information on potential antibiotic resistance (eg sufamethoxazole resistance and sulfonamide resistance) and virulence determinants including genes likely to be acquired by horizontal gene transfer (e.g. an alpha-haemolysin). CONCLUSION: The ASP microarray has potential in the clinic as a diagnostic tool, as a research tool for both known and emerging pathogens, and as an early warning system for pathogenic bacteria that have been recently modified either naturally or deliberately.
TI  - Who's winning the war?
AB  - Traditionally, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been seen as an infection control problem in healthcare communities. It is now clear that antibiotic use is also an important factor in the control of MRSA, both in the treatment of infection and also, paradoxically perhaps, as a cause of the MRSA problem, in the same way that antibiotic use causes Clostridium difficile disease. At both levels, major improvements in the quality of our antibiotic use are required, particularly antibiotic stewardship to reduce the selection, maintenance and transmission of MRSA strains. In addition, new agents are required to reduce our reliance on glycopeptides for the treatment of serious MRSA infections. Daptomycin has great promise in this regard as its rapid bactericidal activity makes it particularly suitable for the treatment of bacteraemia and endocarditis.
TI  - Reduction in infection risk through treatment of microbially contaminated surfaces with a novel, portable, saturated steam vapor disinfection system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surface-mediated infectious disease transmission is a major concern in various settings, including schools, hospitals, and food-processing facilities. Chemical disinfectants are frequently used to reduce contamination, but many pose significant risks to humans, surfaces, and the environment, and all must be properly applied in strict accordance with label instructions to be effective. This study set out to determine the capability of a novel chemical-free, saturated steam vapor disinfection system to kill microorganisms, reduce surface-mediated infection risks, and serve as an alternative to chemical disinfectants. METHODS: High concentrations of Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Salmonella enterica, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, MS2 coliphage (used as a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses including norovirus), Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, and the endospores of Clostridium difficile were dried individually onto porous clay test surfaces. Surfaces were treated with the saturated steam vapor disinfection system for brief periods and then numbers of surviving microorganisms were determined. Infection risks were calculated from the kill-time data using microbial dose-response relationships published in the scientific literature, accounting for surface-to-hand and hand-to-mouth transfer efficiencies. RESULTS: A diverse assortment of pathogenic microorganisms was rapidly killed by the steam disinfection system; all of the pathogens tested were completely inactivated within 5 seconds. Risks of infection from the contaminated surfaces decreased rapidly with increasing periods of treatment by the saturated steam vapor disinfection system. CONCLUSIONS: The saturated steam vapor disinfection system tested for this study is chemical-free, broadly active, rapidly efficacious, and therefore represents a novel alternative to liquid chemical disinfectants.
TI  - A comparison of infection control program resources, activities, and antibiotic resistant organism rates in Canadian acute care hospitals in 1999 and 2005: pre- and post-severe acute respiratory syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Resources for Infection Control in Hospitals (RICH) project assessed infection control programs and rates of antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) in Canadian acute care hospitals in 1999. In the meantime, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak and the concern over pandemic influenza have stimulated considerable government and health care institutional efforts to improve infection control systems in Canada. METHODS: In 2006, a version of the RICH survey similar to the original RICH instrument was mailed to infection control programs in all Canadian acute care hospitals with 80 or more beds. We used chi(2), analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance analyses to test for differences between the 1999 and 2005 samples for infection control program components and ARO rates. RESULTS: 72.3% of Canadian acute care hospitals completed the RICH survey for 1999 and 60.1% for 2005. Hospital size was controlled for in analyses involving AROs and surveillance and control intensity levels. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rates increased from 1999 to 2005 (F = 9.4, P = .003). In 2005, the mean MRSA rate was 5.2 (standard deviation [SD], 6.1) per 1000 admissions, and, in 1999, it was 2.0 (SD, 2.9). Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea rates trended up from 1999 to 2005 (F = 2.9, P = .09). In 2005, the mean Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea rate was 4.7 (SD, 4.3), and, in 1999, it was 3.8 (SD, 4.3). The proportion of hospitals that reported having new nosocomial vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) cases was greater in 2005 than in 1999 (chi(2) = 10.5, P = .001). In 1999, 34.5% (40/116) of hospitals reported having new nosocomial VRE cases, and, in 2005, 61.0% (64/105) reported new cases. Surveillance intensity index scores increased from a mean of 61.7 (SD, 18.5) in 1999 to 68.1 (SD, 15.4) in 2005 (F = 4.1, P = .04). Control intensity index scores trended upward slightly from a mean of 60.8 (SD, 14.6) in 1999 to 64.1 (SD, 12.2) in 2005 (F = 3.2, P = .07). Infection control professionals (ICP) full-time equivalents (FTEs) per 100 beds increased from a mean of 0.5 (SD, 0.2) in 1999 to 0.8 (SD, 0.3) in 2005 (F = 90.8, P < .0001). However, the proportion of ICPs in hospitals certified by the Certification Board of Infection Control decreased from 53% (SD, 46) in 1999 to 38% (SD, 36) in 2005 (F = 8.7, P = .004). CONCLUSION: Canadian infection control programs in 2005 continued to fall short of expert recommendations for human resources and surveillance and control activities. Meanwhile, nosocomial MRSA rates more than doubled between 1999 and 2005, and hospitals reporting new nosocomial VRE cases increased 77% over the same period. Although investments have been made toward infection control programs in Canadian acute care hospitals, the rapid rise in ICP positions has not yet translated into marked improvements in surveillance and control activities. In the face of substantial increases in ARO rates in Canada, continued efforts to train ICPs and support hospital infection control programs are necessary.

TI  - Contamination of hospital curtains with healthcare-associated pathogens.
AB  - In a culture survey, we found that 42% of hospital privacy curtains were contaminated with vancomycin-resistant enterococci, 22% with ethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and 4% with Clostridium difficile. Hand imprint cultures demonstrated that these pathogens were easily acquired on hands. Hospital curtains are a potential source for dissemination of healthcare-associated pathogens.
TI  - Evaluation of the risks of shedding Salmonellae and other potential pathogens by  therapy dogs fed raw diets in Ontario and Alberta.
AB  - Dogs that participate in animal-assisted interventions (AAIs), often called 'therapy dogs', commonly interact with humans whose immune systems are not functioning optimally. The advisability of feeding raw meat (including poultry) to these animals remains a highly contentious issue, in spite of increasing evidence that raw meat is frequently contaminated with Salmonella. We set out to determine if consuming raw meat influences the risk of therapy dogs shedding Salmonella and other pathogens. Two hundred healthy therapy dogs from Ontario and Alberta were enrolled. Between May 2005 and November 2006, fecal specimens were collected from each dog every 2 months for 1 year, along with a log of places visited, antimicrobial use within the home, dog health status and diet. Specimens were cultured for Salmonella, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended-spectrum cephalosporinase (ESC) Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile. Forty (20%) of the dogs were reported to have been fed raw meat at some point during the year. The incidence rate of Salmonella shedding in the raw meat-fed dogs was 0.61 cases/dog-year, compared with 0.08 cases/dog-year in dogs that were not fed raw meat (P<0.001). Controlling for therapy dog group, the repeated measures, and pig ear consumption and diarrhoea in the 2 months prior to specimen submission, dogs that consumed raw meat were significantly more likely to test positive for Salmonella at least once during the year than dogs that did not eat raw meat [odds ratio (OR) 22.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1-58.8; P<0.001]. Specific Salmonella serovars were more common among dogs that consumed raw meat versus those that did not include S. Typhimurium, S. Heidelberg and S. Kentucky. Raw meat consumption was also significantly associated with shedding ESC E. coli (OR 17.2; 95% CI 9.4-32.3). No associations between C. difficile, MRSA or VRE and consumption of raw meat were detected. We recommend that dogs fed raw meat should be excluded from AAI programmes, particularly when the programmes involve interaction with humans at high risk of infection or adverse sequelae attributable to infection. Furthermore, although AAI dogs may not be representative of the general population of dogs, we also recommend that feeding of raw meat to dogs is to be avoided in homes where immunocompromised people live.
TI  - Infection control and prevention in perioperative practice.
AB  - The personal and financial consequences of avoidable infection are enormous in personal and global terms (DH 2003, Stone, Larson & Kawar 2002). Patients expect to be treated and cared for in clean conditions, and not be exposed to the risks of acquiring an infection by poor practice on the part of healthcare workers (DH 2005, Health Care Commission 2005). Infection control and prevention in perioperative settings assumes an even greater significance because of the vulnerability of patients who are already ill or injured, and because surgery, anaesthesia and immediate postoperative recovery may expose them to invasive procedures, allowing more portals of entry for infection. There is ample evidence, widely available, to support best practice in all healthcare settings. The methods are cheap, easy to apply and very effective (Wright 2004, Pratt et al 2007). This article will examine a range of evidence applicable to perioperative infection control and prevention, including an assessment of current practice and how it may be improved, with a particular emphasis on surgical site infection associated with Meticillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium Difficile (C.diff).

AB  - Linezolid is an oxazolidinone, a new class of antibacterial with a unique mechanism of action, namely inhibition of the formation of a functional 70S initiation complex in the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit. Linezolid is highly active against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci; its spectrum of activity also includes some anaerobic bacteria. Linezolid has been studied in several randomized controlled trials for the treatment of patients with community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), urinary tract infections and bacteraemia. The available evidence suggests that linezolid is at least as effective as vancomycin for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, and there are some retrospective analyses supporting its superiority in comparison with vancomycin for MRSA nosocomial pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia. Linezolid is more effective than glycopeptides, macrolides and beta-lactams for SSTIs. The limited available data for the treatment of patients with bacteraemia suggest that it may be a better treatment option than vancomycin and beta-lactams for these patients, but questions have arisen regarding patients with catheter-related bacteraemias. Compared with other antibacterials, linezolid is associated with a greater frequency of adverse events, mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and headaches. Thrombocytopenia also occurs more frequently in patients taking linezolid but there is no increased frequency of anaemia. Other adverse events potentially related to linezolid therapy include fungal infections (moniliasis), hypertension and serotonin-like syndrome, tongue discolouration and taste alterations, dizziness, insomnia, rash and Clostridium difficile-related diarrhoea. The majority of adverse events develop after prolonged administration (i.e. >2 weeks) and subside shortly after discontinuation of linezolid. Peripheral or optic neuropathy, another possible adverse effect, is associated with an even longer duration of treatment (3-6 months). In conclusion, linezolid is an important treatment option for the treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant, Gram-positive bacterial infections. However, in order to reduce the possibility of development of resistance and preserve its activity, the use of linezolid should be restricted to treatment of patients with infections associated with high morbidity and mortality, particularly those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Single-dose cefuroxime with gentamicin reduces Clostridium difficile-associated disease in hip-fracture patients.
AB  - Antibiotic-associated Clostridium difficile diarrhoea may complicate recovery from surgery for proximal femoral fracture. We undertook a four-year case-control study to evaluate a change in antibiotic prophylaxis in our department. During the period January 2003 to January 2005, patients received three doses of prophylactic cefuroxime (1.5g). We then introduced a new regimen, comprising of one single dose of cefuroxime (1.5g) with gentamicin (240mg) at induction. Prior to the change in prophylaxis, 912 patients underwent surgery for neck of femur fracture, and from March 2005 to March 2007, 899 patients had surgery under the new regimen. Thirty-eight patients developed C. difficile infection (4.2%) in the initial group, compared with 14 patients (1.6%) in the group with the new regimen (P=0.009). The incidence of C. difficile infection increased throughout the rest of the hospital over the same time period. Patients with C. difficile infection had a statistically significant increase in antibiotic exposure, inpatient stay, morbidity and inpatient mortality. The main challenges regarding prophylactic antibiotic selection are infection due to meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and C. difficile-associated diarrhoea. We advocate the use of the new regimen as an alternative to multiple-dose cephalosporin antibiotics for the prevention of C. difficile infection in this group of high-risk patients.
TI  - Pandemic and seasonal influenza: therapeutic challenges.
AB  - Influenza A viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality annually, and the threat of a pandemic underscores the need for new therapeutic strategies. Here, we briefly discuss novel antiviral agents under investigation, the limitations of current antiviral therapy and stress the importance of secondary bacterial infections in seasonal and pandemic influenza. Additionally, the lack of new antibiotics available to treat increasingly drug resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, pneumococci, Acinetobacter, extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and Clostridium difficile is highlighted as an important component of influenza treatment and pandemic preparedness. Addressing these problems will require a multidisciplinary approach, which includes the development of novel antivirals and new antibiotics, as well as a better understanding of the role secondary infections play on the morbidity and mortality of influenza infection.

TI  - Hospital infection society prevalence survey of Healthcare Associated Infection 2006: comparison of results between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
AB  - As part of the Third Healthcare Associated Infection (HCAI) Prevalence Survey of  the United Kingdom and Ireland, HCAI point prevalence surveys were carried out in Northern Ireland (NI) and the Republic of Ireland (RoI). Here we explore the potential benefits of comparing results from two countries with different healthcare systems, which employed similar methodologies and identical HCAI definitions. Forty-four acute adult hospitals in the RoI and 15 in NI participated with a total of 11 185 patients surveyed (NI 3644 patients and RoI 7541). The overall HCAI prevalence was 5.4 and 4.9 in NI and the RoI, respectively. There was no significant difference in prevalence rates of HCAI, device-related HCAI or HCAI associated with bloodstream infection but there was a difference in meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-related HCAI (P = 0.02) between the two countries. There were significantly more urinary tract infections and Clostridium difficile infections recorded in NI (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001). HCAIs were more prevalent in patients aged >65 years and in the intensive care unit in both countries. HCAIs were also more prevalent if patients were mechanically ventilated, had had recent non-implant surgery (RoI) or had more recorded HCAI risk factors. This is the first time that HCAI prevalence rates have been directly compared between NI and the RoI. By closely examining similarities and differences between HCAI prevalence rates in both countries it is hoped that this will influence healthcare planning and at the same time reassure the public that HCAI is important and that measures are being taken to combat it.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of copper surfaces against spores and vegetative cells of  Clostridium difficile: the germination theory.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Persistent contamination of surfaces by spores of Clostridium difficile is a major factor influencing the spread of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in the clinical setting. In recent years, the antimicrobial efficacy of metal surfaces has been investigated against microorganisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This study compared the survival of C. difficile on stainless steel, a metal contact surface widely used in hospitals, and copper surfaces. METHODS: Antimicrobial efficacy was assessed using a carrier test method against dormant spores, germinating spores and vegetative cells of C. difficile (NCTC 11204 and ribotype 027) over a 3 h period in the presence and absence of organic matter. RESULTS: Copper metal eliminated all vegetative cells of C. difficile within 30 min, compared with stainless steel which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity (P < 0.05). Copper significantly reduced the viability of spores of C. difficile exposed to the germinant (sodium taurocholate) in aerobic conditions within 60 min (P < 0.05) while achieving a >or=2.5 log reduction (99.8% reduction) at 3 h. Organic material did not reduce the antimicrobial efficacy of the copper surface (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of copper surfaces within the clinical environment and application of a germination solution in infection control procedures may offer a novel way forward in eliminating C. difficile from contaminated surfaces and reducing CDAD.

TI  - Clostridium difficile TxAC314 and SLP-36kDa enhance the immune response toward a  co-administered antigen.
AB  - This study evaluated the in vivo adjuvant activity of two peptides derived from Clostridium difficile: a fragment of the receptor-binding domain of toxin A (TxA(C314)) and a fragment of the 36 kDa surface-layer protein (SLP-36kDa) from strain C253. Their ability to affect the magnitude, distribution and polarization of the immune response against fibronectin-binding protein A (FnbpA), a protective vaccine antigen against Staphylococcus aureus, was evaluated using two different routes of immunization: intranasal and subcutaneous. It was shown that (i) the route of immunization affected the magnitude of the immune response; (ii) both peptides enhanced the production of circulating anti-FnbpA IgG and IgA; (iii) following mucosal immunization TxA(C314) was more effective than SLP-36kDa at inducing antibody in the gastrointestinal tract; (iv) the adjuvant influenced the Th1/Th2 balance; and (v) TxA(C314) was more effective than SLP-36kDa in inducing a cell-mediated response. These studies provide insight into the ability of different C. difficile-derived peptides to differentially affect and polarize the activity of the immune system and on their potential use as adjuvants in newly developed vaccines.
TI  - Controlling healthcare-associated infections in the NHS.
AB  - The prevention and control of healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) is a priority for the NHS. The delivery of national targets for reducing methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemias and Clostridium difficile infection are supported by enhanced mandatory surveillance through the Health Protection Agency and a Department of Health improvement programme that promotes policies and protocols for enhancing clinical procedures and places infection prevention and control at the centre of clinical and corporate governance. The Health Act 2006 Code of Practice makes such policies and protocols a legal requirement and compliance will be assessed by the Healthcare Commission. Clinicians must recognise their responsibilities for patient safety and take a lead role in ensuring good practice to reduce HCAI.
TI  - Clostridium difficile: from obscurity to superbug.
AB  - According to the UK media and popular press, Clostridium difficile is now a fully fledged member of that notorious but ill-defined group of microorganisms portrayed to the general public as superbugs. Following the trail blazed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), C. difficile has made the transition from being an obscure anaerobic bacterium, mainly of interest to specialist anaerobic microbiologists, to that of an infamous superbug responsible for outbreaks of hospital-acquired infection that commonly result in serious disease and death. This review tracks the rise in scientific knowledge and public awareness of this organism.
TI  - Temporal effects of antibiotic use and hand rub consumption on the incidence of MRSA and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the temporal relation between  the use of antibiotics and alcohol-based hand rubs (ABHRs) and the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile. METHODS: An interventional time-series analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of two promotion campaigns on the consumption of ABHRs and to assess their effect on the incidence of non-duplicate clinical isolates of MRSA and C. difficile from February 2000 through September 2006. This analysis was combined with a transfer function model of aggregated data on antibiotic use. RESULTS: Consumption of ABHRs correlated with MRSA, but not with C. difficile. The final model demonstrated the immediate effect of the second hand hygiene promotion campaign and an additional temporal effect of fluoroquinolone (time lag, 1 month; i.e. antibiotic effect delayed for 1 month), macrolide (lag 1 and 4 months), broad-spectrum cephalosporins (lag 3, 4 and 5 months) and piperacillin/tazobactam (lag 3 months) use. The final model explained 57% of the MRSA variance over time. In contrast, the model for C. difficile showed only an effect for broad-spectrum cephalosporins (lag 1 month). CONCLUSIONS: We observed an aggregate-level relation between the monthly MRSA incidence and the use of different antibiotic classes and increased consumption of ABHR after a successful hand hygiene campaign, while no association with ABHR use was detected for C. difficile.
TI  - Infection control experience in a cooperative care center for transplant patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize infection control experience during a 6.5-year period  in a cooperative care center for transplant patients. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis. SETTING: A cooperative care center for transplanted patients, in which patients and care partners are housed in a homelike environment, and care partners assume responsibility for patient care duties. PATIENTS: Nine hundred ninety one transplant patients. METHODS: Infection control definitions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used to ascertain infection rates. Environmental cultures were used to detect methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Clostridium difficile, and fungi during the first 18 months. Surveillance cultures were performed for a subset of patients and care partners. RESULTS: From June 1999 through December 2005, there were 19,365 patient-days observed. The most common healthcare-associated infection encountered was intravascular catheter-related bloodstream infection, with infection rates of 5.74 and 4.94 cases per 1,000 patient-days for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, respectively. C. difficile-associated diarrhea was observed more frequently in HSCT patients than in SOT patients (3.97 vs 0.57 cases per 1,000 patient-days; P < .0001). There was no evidence of environmental contamination with MRSA, VRE, or C. difficile. Acquisition of MRSA was not observed. Acquisition of VRE was documented. CONCLUSION: This study documented that cooperative care was associated with some risk of healthcare-associated infection, most notably intravascular catheter-associated bloodstream infection and C. difficile-associated diarrhea, it appears the incidences of these infections were roughly commensurate with those in other care settings.
TI  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhea: candidate organisms other than Clostridium difficile.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The direct toxic effects of antibiotics on the intestine can alter digestive functions and cause pathogenic bacterial overgrowth leading to antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is widely known to be responsible for 10 approximately 20% of AAD cases. However, Klebsiella oxytoca, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida species might also contribute to AAD. METHODS: We prospectively analyzed the organisms in stool and colon tissue cultures with a C. difficile toxin A assay in patients with AAD between May and December 2005. In addition, we performed the C. difficile toxin A assays using an enzyme-linked fluorescent assay technique. Patients were enrolled who had diarrhea with more than three stools per day for at least 2 days after the initiation of antibiotic treatment for up to 6 approximately 8 weeks after antibiotic discontinuation. RESULTS: Among 38 patients (mean age 59 +/- 18 years, M:F =18:20), the organism isolation rates were 28.9% (11/38) for stool culture, 18.4% (7/38) for colon tissue cultures and 13.2% (5/38) for the C. difficile toxin A assay. The overall rate of identification of organisms was 50.0% (19/38). Of the five patients that had a positive result by the C. difficile toxin A assay, two had no organism isolated by the stool or colon tissue culture. The organisms isolated from the stool cultures were C difficile (4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) (3), Candida species (3), and Staphylococcus aureus (1). C. difficile (4) and K. pneumoniae (3) were isolated from the colon tissue culture. CONCLUSIONS: For C. difficile negative AAD patients, K. pneumoniae, Candida species and Staphylococcus aureus were found to be potential causative organisms.

TI  - Randomized trial of combination versus monotherapy for the empiric treatment of suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare a strategy of combination therapy with a strategy of monotherapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected late ventilator-associated pneumonia. DESIGN: Randomized trial. SETTING: Twenty-eight intensive care units in Canada and the United States. PATIENTS: The study included 740 mechanically ventilated patients who developed suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia after 96 hrs in the intensive care unit. Patients known to be colonized or infected with Pseudomonas or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or who were immunocompromised were excluded from the study. INTERVENTIONS: As initial unblinded therapy, patients were allocated to receive meropenem (1 g every 8 hrs) and ciprofloxacin (400 mg every 12 hrs) or meropenem alone. Before starting antibiotics, patients were also randomized to bronchoalveolar lavage with quantitative cultures or endotracheal aspirates. When culture results were available, physicians were encouraged to adjust antibiotics. Adequacy of antibiotics was defined as the organism present in the enrollment culture having in vitro susceptibility to one or more of the study antibiotics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline characteristics and etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia were similar in the two groups. There was no difference in 28-day mortality between the combination and monotherapy groups (relative risk = 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.78-1.42, p = .74). Duration of intensive care unit and hospital stay, clinical and microbiological treatment response, emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolation of Clostridium difficile in stool, and fungal colonization were also similar in the two groups. In a subgroup of patients who had infection due to Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli at enrollment (n = 56), the adequacy of initial antibiotics (84.2% vs. 18.8%, p < .001) and microbiological eradication of infecting organisms (64.1% vs. 29.4%, p = .05) was higher in the combination group compared with the monotherapy group, but there were no differences in clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: For critically ill patients who have suspected late ventilator-associated pneumonia and who are at low risk for difficult-to-treat gram-negative bacteria, monotherapy is associated with similar outcomes compared with combination therapy. For those patients at high risk of difficult-to-treat gram-negative bacteria, combination therapy is safe and may be associated with better microbiological and clinical outcomes.

TI  - Importance of the environment in meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acquisition: the case for hospital cleaning.
AB  - In the UK, we continue to debate the importance of hospital cleaning in relation  to increasing numbers of patients acquiring meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, there is little direct evidence for the effectiveness of cleaning because it has never been afforded scientific status. Hospital hygiene is usually assessed visually, but this does not necessarily correlate with microbiological risk. A more robust case for hospital cleaning can be presented by considering the evidence for all the stages of the staphylococcal transmission cycle between human beings and their environment. Cleaning has already been accepted as an important factor in the control of other hardy environmental pathogens, such as Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, norovirus, and Acinetobacter spp. This Review will show why the removal of dirt might have more impact on the control of MRSA than previously thought. Introduction of additional cleaning services is easier than improvements in hand-hygiene compliance.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of DC-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - DC-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. DC-159a showed activity against Streptococcus spp. (MIC(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Staphylococcus spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. Against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the MIC 90 of DC-159a was 8 microg/ml. DC-159a was the most active against Enterococcus spp. (MIC 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml) and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. The activity of DC-159a against Mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. The MICs of DC-159a against Chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and DC-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. DC-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, DC-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. The bactericidal activity of DC-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. These activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with DC-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  - Widespread environmental contamination associated with patients with diarrhea and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization of the gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may contaminate their immediate environment with this organism. However, the extent to which gastrointestinal colonization with MRSA affects environmental contamination is not known. We investigated the frequency of environmental contamination in the rooms of patients with diarrheal stools and heavy gastrointestinal colonization with MRSA. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: A 500-bed teaching hospital. METHODS: Stool specimens submitted for Clostridium difficile toxin assays were inoculated onto colistin-naladixic acid agar. MRSA was identified with standard methods. Samples from a standardized list of 10 environmental surfaces were cultured, from the rooms of 8 patients who had diarrhea that yielded heavy growth of MRSA (case patients) and from the rooms of 6 MRSA-positive patients with stool cultures negative for MRSA (control patients). MRSA isolates from 13 patients (8 case patients and 5 control patients) and 64 of the environmental isolates recovered from their rooms were compared by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). One clinical isolate from a control patient was excluded because there was no corresponding environmental MRSA isolate with which to compare it. RESULTS: Overall, MRSA were recovered from 47 (58.8%) of 80 surfaces in the rooms of case patients, compared with 14 (23.3%) of 60 surfaces in the rooms of control patients (58.8% [95% CI, 47.8-68.9] vs 23.3% [95% CI, 14.3-35.5]; P<.0001). The items most commonly contaminated were bedside rails, blood pressure cuffs, television remote controls, and toilet seats. Seventy-eight percent of the environmental isolates in patients' rooms had PFGE types that were indistinguishable or closely related to those recovered from the patients' clinical specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have diarrheal stools and heavy gastrointestinal colonization with MRSA are associated with significantly greater environmental MRSA contamination than patients without MRSA in their stool, and they are likely to be the source of that contamination.
TI  - Prevalence of enterotoxin producing Staphylococcus aureus in stools of patients with nosocomial diarrhea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial diarrhea causes prolonged hospital stay leading to additional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures resulting in higher costs. A total of 20%-25% of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) cases are attributed to Clostridium difficile. Other microorganisms like Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus are discussed to be associated with AAD. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study evaluated the prevalence of enterotoxigenic S. aureus in stool samples submitted to the laboratory with the diagnosis nosocomial diarrhea. A total of 2,727 stools from clinical patients were investigated for S. aureus and C. difficile. Samples were cultured for both bacteria and a C. difficile toxin A and B assay was performed from all stools. Isolated S. aureus were investigated for enterotoxin production and for resistance against methicillin. In addition, both assays were evaluated for determination of S. aureus enterotoxins directly in stool samples. RESULTS: Out of 2,727 stools investigated, 198 grew S. aureus and 148 C. difficile. Toxins A/B from C. difficile were detected in 184 stools. A total of 114 S. aureus strains produced the following enterotoxins in vitro: A, 36; B, 20; C, 19; D, 68; E, 2. Both pathogens were found in 25 stools. Twenty-nine (14.6%) S. aureus strains were identified as methicillin-resistant. The two toxin assays evaluated in this study were not able to detect S. aureus enterotoxins directly in stools. CONCLUSION: The role of enterotoxigenic S. aureus in the pathogenesis of nosocomial and AAD needs further consideration. It might be necessary to investigate stool samples from patients with AAD/nosocomial diarrhea for S. aureus on a routine basis.
TI  - The epidemiology and treatment of infections in cancer patients.
AB  - Significant changes in the epidemiology of infectious complications in cancer patients have emerged during the past decade. Among blood culture isolates from febrile neutropenic patients, Gram-positive pathogens have become predominant, and an increasing spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci must be taken into consideration. Risk factors such as indwelling venous catheters or chemotherapy-induced mucosal damage are associated with an increased incidence of Gram-positive infections. Invasive fungal infections, particularly invasive aspergillosis, have become most important in severely neutropenic patients and are associated with fatality rates of 40-60%. The use of nucleoside analogues and the CD52-antibody alemtuzumab induce a long-lasting lymphopenia facilitating the occurrence of opportunistic infections specifically caused by viruses and fungi. In elderly patients undergoing intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy, infectious complications may be managed as successfully as in younger patients by appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The broad use of fluoroquinolones for antibacterial prophylaxis in neutropenic patients may lead to very high resistance rates among Gram-negative bacilli such as E. coli. In patients given moxifloxacin for infection prevention, unacceptably large numbers of Clostridium difficile-associated enterocolitis have been reported.
TI  - Binary toxin production in Clostridium difficile is regulated by CdtR, a LytTR family response regulator.
AB  - Clostridium difficile binary toxin (CDT) is an actin-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase that is produced by various C. difficile isolates, including the "hypervirulent" NAP1/027 epidemic strains. In contrast to the two major toxins from C. difficile, toxin A and toxin B, little is known about the role of CDT in virulence or how C. difficile regulates its production. In this study we have shown that in addition to the cdtA and cdtB toxin structural genes, a functional cdt locus contains a third gene, here designated cdtR, which is predicted to encode a response regulator. By introducing functional binary toxin genes into cdtR(+) and cdtR-negative strains of C. difficile, it was established that the CdtR protein was required for optimal expression of binary toxin. Significantly increased expression of functional binary toxin was observed in the presence of a functional cdtR gene; an internal deletion within cdtR resulted in a reduction in binary toxin production to basal levels. Strains that did not carry intact cdtAB genes or cdtAB pseudogenes also did not have cdtR, with the entire cdt locus, or CdtLoc, being replaced by a conserved 68-bp sequence. These studies have shown for the first time that binary toxin production is subject to strict regulatory control by the response regulator CdtR, which is a member of the LytTR family of response regulators and is related to the AgrA protein from Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Environmental contamination makes an important contribution to hospital infection.
AB  - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are capable of surviving for days to weeks on environmental surfaces in healthcare facilities. Environmental surfaces frequently touched by healthcare workers are commonly contaminated in the rooms of patients colonized or infected with MRSA or VRE. A number of studies have documented that healthcare workers may contaminate their hands or gloves by touching contaminated environmental surfaces, and that hands or gloves become contaminated with numbers of organisms that are likely to result in transmission to patients. Pathogens may also be transferred directly from contaminated surfaces to susceptible patients. There is an increasing body of evidence that cleaning or disinfection of the environment can reduce transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens. Because routine cleaning of equipment items and other high-touch surfaces does not always remove pathogens from contaminated surfaces, improved methods of disinfecting the hospital environment are needed. Preliminary studies suggest that hydrogen peroxide vapour technology deserves further evaluation as a method for decontamination of the environment in healthcare settings.

TI  - Antibiotic associated diarrhoea: infectious causes.
AB  - Nearly 25% of antibiotic associated diarrhoeas (AAD) is caused by Clostridium difficile, making it the commonest identified and treatable pathogen. Other pathogens implicated infrequently include Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Candida spp. and Salmonella spp. Most mild cases of AAD are due to non-infectious causes which include reduced break down of primary bile acids and decrease metabolism of carbohydrates, allergic or toxic effects of antibiotic on intestinal mucosa and pharmacological effect on gut motility. The antibiotics most frequently associated with C. difficile associated diarrhoea are clindamycin, cephalosporin, ampicillin and amoxicillin. Clinical presentation may vary from mild diarrhoea to severe colitis and pseudomembranous colitis associated with high morbidity and mortality. The most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for C. difficile infection is tissue culture assay for cytotoxicity of toxin B. Commercial ELISA kits are available. Though less sensitive, they are easy to perform and are rapid. Withdrawal of precipitating antibiotic is all that is needed for control of mild to moderate cases. For severe cases of AAD, oral metronidazole is the first line of treatment, and oral vancomycin is the second choice. Probiotics have been used for recurrent cases.

TI  - HCAIs: statutory code of practice in England and Wales.
AB  - Healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs) such as Meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile (C. dif) are never far from the media headlines. In January 2006 a leaked memo identified the government's concerns that its target of halving MRSA infection rates by April 2008 may not be met (Boseley 2007). During 2004-5, 30 people died following two outbreaks of C. dif at Stoke Mandeville (Boseley 2007). In this article the author will focus on and discuss in detail key components of the new Code of Practice on Health Care Associated Infections (DH 2006a) to show how legislation has provided the framework to ensure that not only do NHS bodies have a duty to comply with this Act but so do we as practitioners.
TI  - Three novel highly charged copper-based biocides: safety and efficacy against healthcare-associated organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated three novel highly charged copper-based inorganic biocidal formulations for their activity against organisms highly relevant to healthcare-associated infection. METHODS: The three copper-based formulations were tested: (i) against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Legionella pneumophila, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus/baumannii (ACCB), glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus and spores of Clostridium difficile in time-kill assays; (ii) for their ability to decontaminate ultramicrofibre (UMF) cloths; and (iii) for their cytotoxicity to human skin and intestinal epithelial cells. RESULTS: All three copper-based formulations were potently biocidal down to concentrations of 1 ppm for both stationary- and log-phase organisms, and they were all active against C. difficile spores. At 150 ppm, they achieved a complete (>6 log10) kill of MRSA and ACCB mostly within 1 h. This biocidal activity was not achieved by copper sulphate or the inorganic binders used in the formulations. All three copper-based formulations completely decontaminated UMF cloths containing MRSA, ACCB or C. difficile spores, suggesting that any of these copper-based formulations would be highly beneficial in the healthcare environment. All three copper-based formulations and copper sulphate were not cytotoxic to human epithelial cells up to concentrations of 100-200 ppm. CONCLUSIONS: All three of the novel copper-based biocidal formulations, but not their components (copper sulphate and inorganic binders), have potent activity against organisms highly relevant to healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - Evaluation of Clostridium difficile-associated disease pressure as a risk factor  for C difficile-associated disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonization pressure has been identified as an important risk factor in the transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus species, but the role of colonization pressure in the transmission of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate CDAD pressure, a modified form of colonization pressure based on symptomatic CDAD cases, as a risk factor for CDAD. METHODS: Retrospective cohort and nested case-control studies of patients admitted to Barnes-Jewish Hospital from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2003. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the role of CDAD pressure as a risk factor for CDAD. RESULTS: A total of 36 275 patients were included in the cohort, of which 382 had CDAD. The median CDAD pressure was higher for case patients than noncase patients (1.4 vs 0.3; P<.001), and only 1 patient with CDAD had a CDAD pressure of 0. In the nested case-control study, CDAD pressure remained an independent risk factor for CDAD after adjustment for demographics, severity of illness, medications received (chemotherapy, gastric acid suppressors, antidiarrheals or narcotics, and antibiotics), and abdominal procedures or surgery performed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that CDAD pressure may be an independent risk factor for CDAD. Future studies that evaluate risk of CDAD should control for CDAD pressure.
TI  - The missing care bundle: antibiotic prescribing in hospitals.
AB  - The care bundle involves grouping together key elements of care for procedures and the management of specific diagnoses in order to provide a systematic method to improve and monitor the delivery of clinical care processes. In short, care bundles aim to ensure that all patients consistently receive the best care or treatment, all of the time. This approach has been successfully applied to the management of various conditions, particularly in the critical care setting. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement's '100K lives campaign' consisted of six care bundles, three of which have addressed preventing hospital-acquired infection. The UK Department of Health's delivery programme to reduce healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs), including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), includes six 'high-impact interventions', which are care bundles to reduce HCAIs. However, we suggest that one key intervention is missing, and consider this intervention will be increasingly important if hospitals are to address the rising incidence of Clostridium difficile, to tackle antibiotic resistance and to improve patient care. The missing intervention addresses the process of antibiotic prescribing. We propose that the time is right to consider the application of the care bundle approach to improve the prescribing of antibiotics, both for treatment and prophylaxis.

TI  - Prediction of specific pathogens in patients with sepsis: evaluation of TREAT, a  computerized decision support system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prediction of bacterial infections and their pathogens allows for early, directed investigation and treatment. We assessed the ability of TREAT, a computerized decision support system, to predict specific pathogens. METHODS: TREAT uses data available within the first few hours of infection presentation in a causal probabilistic network to predict sites of infection and specific pathogens. We included 3529 patients (920 with microbiologically documented infections) participating in the observational and interventional trials of the TREAT system in Israel, Germany and Italy. Discriminatory performance of TREAT to predict individual pathogens was expressed by the AUC with 95% confidence intervals. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic. RESULTS: The AUCs for Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, ranged between 0.70 and 0.80 (all significant). Adequate calibration was demonstrated for any Gram-negative infection and individual bacteria, except for E. coli. Discrimination and calibration were acceptable for Enterococcus spp. (AUC 0.71, 0.65-0.78), but not for Staphylococcus aureus (AUC 0.63, 0.55-0.71). The few infections caused by Candida spp. and Clostridium difficile were well predicted (AUCs 0.74, 0.54-0.95; and 0.94, 0.88-1.00, respectively). The coverage with TREAT's recommendation exceeded that observed with physicians' treatment for all pathogens, except Candida spp. CONCLUSIONS: TREAT predicted individual pathogens causing infection well. Prediction of S. aureus was inferior to that observed with other pathogens. TREAT can be used to triage patients by the risk for specific pathogens. The system's predictions enable it to prescribe appropriate antibiotic treatment prior to pathogen identification.
TI  - Successful use of feedback to improve antibiotic prescribing and reduce Clostridium difficile infection: a controlled interrupted time series.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of reinforcing a narrow-spectrum antibiotic policy on antibiotic prescription and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) rates by feedback of antibiotic use to doctors, as part of a departmental audit and feedback programme. DESIGN: A prospective controlled interrupted time-series (ITS) study, with pre-defined pre- and post-intervention periods, each of 21 months. SETTING: Three acute medical wards for elderly people in a teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Six thousand one hundred and twenty-nine consecutive unselected acute medical admissions aged >or=80 years. INTERVENTIONS: A 'narrow-spectrum' antibiotic policy (reinforced by an established programme of audit and feedback of antibiotic usage and CDI rates) was introduced, following an unplanned rise in amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) use. It targeted broad-spectrum antibiotics for reduction (cephalosporins and amoxicillin/clavulanate) and narrow-spectrum antibiotics for increase (benzyl penicillin, amoxicillin and trimethoprim). Changes in the use of targeted antibiotics (intervention group) were compared with those of untargeted antibiotics (control group) using segmented regression analysis. Changes in CDI rates were examined by the Poisson regression model. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acquisition rates acted as an additional control. RESULTS: There was a reduction in the use of all targeted broad-spectrum antibiotics and an increase in all targeted narrow-spectrum antibiotics, statistically significant for sudden change and/or linear trend. All other antibiotic use remained unchanged. CDI rates fell with incidence rate ratios of 0.35 (0.17, 0.73) (P=0.009). MRSA incidence did not change [0.79 (0.49, 1.28); P=0.32]. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first controlled prospective ITS study to use feedback to reinforce antibiotic policy and reduce CDI. Multicentre ITS or cluster randomized trials of this and other methods need to be undertaken to establish the most effective means of optimizing antibiotic use and reducing CDI.
TI  - A comparison of available and investigational antibiotics for complicated skin infections and treatment-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus.
AB  - This article compares vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecyline, dalbavancin, telavancin, ceftobiprole, oritavancin, and ramoplanin for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), enterococcus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is administered intravenously, and is the mainstay of treatment for MRSA and cSSSI. While not available in the U.S., teicoplanin, another glycopeptide antibiotic, can be administered intramuscularly and has simpler dosing and monitoring requirements than vancomycin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin treats vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) infections but inhibits cytochrome P450 A3P4, and has only modest activity against MRSA pneumonia. Daptomycin effectively treats cSSSI but not pneumonia caused by MRSA, and is effective against all strains of Staphylococcus. Linezolid, available orally and intravenously, is approved to treat community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia, cSSSI, and infections caused by MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci including infections with concurrent bacteraemia and VREE Tigecycline, a glycylcycline derived from minocycline, has been approved by the FDA to treat cSSSI and complicated intraabdominal infections, and might be effective against Acinetobacter baumannii; its primary side effect is digestive upset. Dalbavancin, effective against MRSA and administered intravenously once weekly, possesses coverage similar to vancomycin. Telavancin deploys multiple mechanisms of action and is effective against MRSA and Gram-positive bacteria resistant to vancomycin. Ceftobiprole, a cephalosporin effective against MRSA, has few side effects. Oritavancin demonstrates similar activity to vancomycin but possesses extended activity against vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus and enterococci. Ramoplanin, a macrocyclic depsipeptide, is unstable in the bloodstream but can be taken orally to treat Clostridium difficile colitis.
TI  - [Infectious diseases (beside AIDS)].
AB  - Important epidemiological developments include the continuing dissemination of Influenza A H5N1. It is not adapted to human beings, but its potential to cause a pandemic is confirmed. Chikungunya has spread around the Indian Ocean. A new resistant Staphylococcus aureus in increasingly prevalent in the community. Finally, a virulent strain of Clostridium difficile is emerging in North America and Europe. New therapeutic developments are scarce. Several studies promote a rational use of available antibiotics, for instance through wait-and-see prescription for acute otitis media, or appropriate use of urinary cultures in elderly patients. A new Papillomavirus vaccine is now available for prevention of cervical cancer.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli in the community: assessing the problem and controlling the spread.
AB  - Although health care-associated methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and clostridium difficile strains are primarily a risk to hospital patients, people are increasingly concerned about their potential to circulate in the community and the home. They are thus looking for support in order to understand the extent of the risk, and guidance on how to deal with situations where preventing infection from these species becomes their responsibility. A further concern are the community-acquired MRSA and C. difficile strains, and other antibiotic resistant strains circulating in the community such as the Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli. In response to concerns about such organisms in the community, the International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has produced a report evaluating MRSA, C. difficile, and ESBL-producing E. coli from a community viewpoint. The report summarizes what is known about their prevalence in the community, their mode of transmission in the home, and the extent to which they represent a risk. It also includes "advice sheets" giving practical guidance on what to do when there is a risk of infection transmission in the home.

TI  - Mutations in fusA associated with posttherapy fusidic acid resistance in Clostridium difficile.
AB  - In silico, we identified fusA (2,067 bp) in Clostridium difficile 630. Sequencing of fusA in posttherapy fusidic acid-resistant C. difficile isolates from 12 patients with C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) identified fusA mutations, one or two nonsynonymous substitutions, or in one case a deletion of one codon associated with resistance. Five of these mutations have previously been described in fusA of fusidic acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but seven were novel fusA mutations. Fusidic acid monotherapy for CDAD seemed to rapidly select conserved resistant mutants.
TI  - Direct E-test (AB Biodisk) of respiratory samples improves antimicrobial use in ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia is the most frequently observed nosocomial infection in intensive care units, and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Early microbiological diagnosis and the initial administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy are associated with decreased mortality and potentially reduced costs. Our study evaluates the clinical and financial impact of performing rapid antimicrobial susceptibility tests directly on samples obtained from the lower respiratory tract. METHODS: A prospective, randomized study was performed over a 2-year period. Patients who had a lower respiratory tract infection that was acquired during mechanical ventilation and for whom samples obtained from the respiratory tract were sent for culture were randomized to 1 of 2 groups. Samples were cultured for the control group, and results were reported using standard procedures. Samples were also cultured for the test subject group using standard procedures, but in addition, a rapid antibiogram was immediately performed by placing E-test antibiotic strips (AB Biodisk) directly on respiratory tract samples. Patients in the E-test group received a preliminary laboratory report when it became available. The 2 patient groups were compared according to the following variables: type and severity of underlying conditions, total days of antimicrobial use, number of defined daily doses, cost of acquisition of the antimicrobial agent per episode, days of fever, days receiving mechanical ventilation, days in the intensive care unit, incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, and mortality. RESULTS: Reporting a rapid E-test was associated with fewer days of fever, fewer days of antibiotic administration until resolution of the episode of ventilator-associated pneumonia, decreased antibiotic consumption, less C. difficile-associated diarrhea, lower costs of antimicrobial agents, and fewer days receiving mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid E-test of respiratory tract samples improves antimicrobial use in cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

TI  - Prophylactic antibiotics in obstetrics-gynecology: a current asset, a future liability?
AB  - Currently, prophylactic antibiotics have proven effective in lowering the postoperative and postprocedure infection rate following vaginal hysterectomy, emergency cesarean section for the patient in labor, radical hysterectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, pregnancy termination, hysterosalpingogram and intrauterine device insertion. Guidelines for the most effective and safe use are presented. Concerns are raised regarding the widespread prolonged use of prophylactic antibiotics on women in labor to prevent Group B streptococcal infections in newborn children and women with prolonged preterm membrane rupture. There is also an awareness needed of a growing incidence of infections seen in the hospital from community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile. These problems have not been addressed by the current prophylactic antibiotic strategies.
TI  - Narrative review: the new epidemic of Clostridium difficile-associated enteric disease.
AB  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis were well established soon after antibiotics became available. Early work implicated Staphylococcus aureus, but in 1978 Clostridium difficile became the established pathogen in the vast majority of cases. In the first 5 years (1978 through 1983), the most common cause was clindamycin, the standard diagnostic test was the cytotoxin assay, and standard management was to withdraw the implicated antibiotic and treat with oral vancomycin. Most patients responded well, but 25% relapsed when vancomycin was withdrawn. During the next 20 years (1983 through 2003), the most commonly implicated antibiotics were the cephalosporins, which reflected the rates of use; the enzyme immunoassay replaced the cytotoxin assay because of speed of results and technical ease of performance; and metronidazole replaced vancomycin as standard treatment, and principles of containment hospitals became infection control and antibiotic control. During the recent past (2003 to 2006), C. difficile has been more frequent, more severe, more refractory to standard therapy, and more likely to relapse. This pattern is widly distributed in the United States, Canada, and Europe and is now attributed to a new strain of C. difficile designated BI, NAP1, or ribotype 027 (which are synonymous terms). This strain appears more virulent, possibly because of production of large amounts of toxins, and fluoroquinolones are now major inducing agents along with cephalosporins, which presumably reflects newly acquired in vitro resistance and escalating rates of use. The recent experience does not change principles of management of the individual patient, but it does serve to emphasize the need for better diagnostics, early recognition, improved methods to manage severe disease and relapsing disease, and greater attention to infection control and antibiotic restraint.
TI  - High unmet-need infectious disease opportunities.
AB  - Despite advances in pharmaceutical science, considerable unmet medical needs exist in the field of anti-infective therapies. While pharmaceutical companies have focused research efforts on a few selected areas of the field, new microbial diseases have steadily increased in prevalence. Three emerging areas in the field of anti-infectives now represent large commercial opportunities: Gram-negative infections, community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Dedication and extensive investment by pharmaceutical companies is required to battle against these emerging and deadly microbial infections.
TI  - Experimental evaluation of an automated endoscope reprocessor with in situ generation of peracetic acid for disinfection of semicritical devices.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a high-level disinfection solution generated inside an endoscope processing system for decontaminating external and internal surfaces of experimentally contaminated heat-sensitive medical devices. METHODS: The American Society for Testing and Materials Simulated-Use Test protocol (E1837-02), which incorporates a soil load in each inoculum, was used to evaluate the efficacy of the system when processing 4 common types of endoscopes contaminated separately with 5 types of nosocomial pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15442), spores of Clostridium difficile (ATCC 9689), a glutaraldehyde-resistant strain of Mycobacterium chelonae, a vancomycin-resistant strain of Enterococcus faecalis, and a methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus. Rinse solution samples from channels and from surfaces of the processed endoscopes were tested for any microbicidal residues. RESULTS: For all organisms tested, the baseline level of contamination of the endoscopes ranged from 5 log(10) to greater than 7 log(10) at each external surface site and internal channel. All tests showed reductions in viability of the test organisms to undetectable levels. All rinse solution samples from external and internal sites of the endoscopes proved to be free of any residual microbicidal activity. CONCLUSIONS: The endoscope reprocessor, with its processor-generated high-level disinfection solution, successfully reduced the numbers of selected, clinically relevant pathogens to undetectable levels both in the channels and on the outside surfaces of the 4 representative endoscopes tested in this study.
TI  - Fluoroquinolones and risk for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Canada.
AB  - Receipt of fluoroquinolones was the predominant risk factor for Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) during an epidemic in Quebec, Canada. To determine the role of antimicrobial drugs in facilitating healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization and infection and to compare this role with their effects on methicillin-susceptible S. aureus infection and CDAD, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients in a Quebec hospital. For 7371 episodes of care, data were collected on risk factors, including receipt of antimicrobial drugs. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) were calculated by Cox regression. Of 150 episodes of MRSA colonization and 23 of MRSA infection, fluoroquinolones were the only antimicrobials that increased risk for colonization (AHR 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.84-3.60) and infection (AHR 2.49, 95% CI 1.02-6.07). Effect of antimicrobial drugs on MRSA colonization and infection was similar to effect on CDAD and should be considered when selecting antimicrobial drugs to treat common infections.
TI  - In vitro killing of nosocomial pathogens by acid and acidified nitrite.
AB  - Exposure to pH 1 or 2 buffers or acidic gastric contents resulted in the killing  of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida glabrata but not Clostridium difficile spores. Nitrite enhanced killing under acidic conditions, but significant killing of C. difficile spores required nitrite concentrations above usual physiological levels.
TI  - Proton pump inhibitor use and risk of community-acquired Clostridium difficile-associated disease defined by prescription for oral vancomycin therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is controversial. In this study we re-examined a previously reported association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the development of community-acquired CDAD, this time using an alternative case definition of the disease. METHODS: We performed a case-control study of community-acquired CDAD using a United Kingdom clinical research database. Patients receiving oral vancomycin therapy were identified as having CDAD, the only indication for this drug. Each case subject was matched with up to 10 control subjects. Neither the cases nor the controls had been admitted to hospital in the year before the date of the vancomycin prescription (index date). Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for key covariates. RESULTS: We identified 317 cases of community-acquired CDAD treated with oral vancomycin therapy and 3167 matched control subjects. Exposure to a proton pump inhibitor in the 90 days before the index date was associated with an increased risk of CDAD (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-5.2). Antibiotic exposure in the 90 days before the index date was also a significant risk factor for community-acquired CDAD (OR 8.2, 95% CI 6.1- 11.0), even though 45% of the case subjects had not received a prescription for an antibiotic during that period. Certain comorbidities, in particular renal failure, inflammatory bowel disease and malignant disease, as well as prior methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, were also associated with an increased risk. INTERPRETATION: Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with an increased risk of community-acquired CDAD, when cases were defined by receipt of prescription for oral vancomycin therapy. Prior antibiotic exposure was also a significant risk factor, but a significant proportion of the patients with community-acquired CDAD had no such exposure.
TI  - Multihospital surveillance of nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and Clostridium difficile: analysis of a 4-year data-sharing project, 1999-2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study sought to establish a benchmark of resistant organism rates among a cohort of regional hospitals. METHODS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definitions were used to standardize the methodology for obtaining rates per 1000 patient days of nosocomial infection and colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), and nosocomial infection with Clostridium difficile (CDIF). Only newly acquired nosocomial cases were counted. Data were reported as individual hospital control charts and as cohorted aggregate data. VHA East Coast Infection Control Professionals from 32 hospitals in New Jersey and Pennsylvania were involved. RESULTS: Benchmarks were established with pooled mean rates for each cohort. During the observational period, a statistically significant downward trend was observed for VRE and MRSA (P = .02 and .0007, respectively), and an upward trend was observed for CDIF (P = .0256). CONCLUSION: Benchmarks were established to compare nosocomial MRSA, VRE, and CDIF rates. Although significant changes in rates were observed, no attempt was made to establish a causal relationship between infection control practices and observed rates. However, a secondary gain was achieved through sharing best practices.
TI  - How long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? A systematic review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. The aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. METHODS: The literature was systematically reviewed in MedLine without language restrictions. In addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included. RESULTS: Most gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. (including VRE), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), or Streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. Many gram-negative species, such as Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Shigella spp., can also survive for months. A few others, such as Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus vulgaris, or Vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. Candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. Persistence of other yeasts, such as Torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (Candida parapsilosis, 14 days). Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, SARS or rhino virus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, HAV, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. Blood-borne viruses, such as HBV or HIV, can persist for more than one week. Herpes viruses, such as CMV or HSV type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to 7 days. CONCLUSION: The most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.
TI  - Comparative analysis of prevalence, risk factors, and molecular epidemiology of antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We prospectively studied the comparative epidemiology and risk factors for Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Four thousand six hundred fifty-nine inpatient fecal specimens (11 months) were tested for C. difficile cytotoxin, C. perfringens enterotoxin, and S. aureus by Vero cell assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and growth on fresh blood agar, respectively. Two distinct age-, sex-, and location-matched control patient groups were used for multivariate logistic regression risk factor analyses: symptomatic patients who were AAD pathogen negative and asymptomatic patients with histories of recent antimicrobial therapy. All AAD pathogen isolates were DNA fingerprinted. In AAD cases, the prevalences of C. difficile cytotoxin, C. perfringens enterotoxin, and S. aureus were 12.7%, 3.3%, and 0.2%, respectively (15.8% overall). Age of >70 years was a common risk factor. Other risk factors for infective AAD and C. difficile AAD included length of hospital stay and use of feeding tubes (length of stay odds ratios [OR], 1.017 and 1.012; feeding tube OR, 1.864 and 2.808). Female gender and use of antacids were significantly associated with increased risk of C. perfringens AAD (OR, 2.08 and 2.789, respectively), but unlike what was found for C. difficile AAD, specific antibiotic classes were not associated with increased risk. A limited number of genotypes caused the majority of C. difficile and C. perfringens AAD cases. Similar to what was found for C. difficile AAD, there was epidemiological evidence of C. perfringens AAD case clustering and reinfection due to different strains. C. difficile AAD was approximately 4 and 60 times more common than C. perfringens AAD and S. aureus AAD, respectively. Risk factors for these AAD pathogens differed, highlighting the need to define specific control measures. There is evidence of nosocomial transmission in cases of C. perfringens AAD.
TI  - Cellulose acetate containing toluidine blue and rose bengal is an effective antimicrobial coating when exposed to white light.
AB  - Simple methods of reducing the microbial load on surfaces in hospitals are needed to reduce the risk of hospital-associated infections. Here we report on the ability of a cellulose acetate coating containing the photosensitizers toluidine blue and rose bengal to kill microbes (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, a bacteriophage, and Candida albicans) on its surface when illuminated with white light.
TI  - Prospective evaluation of hospital isolation room capacity.
AB  - Risk assessment is used to determine the need for isolation in single rooms. Limited availability of isolation rooms and/or operational needs may compromise this process. This article reports the results of a 12-month prospective observational study of every infection control request for isolation in a 1100-bed teaching hospital. In addition, four point-prevalence surveys of the usage of single rooms were carried out. Data were collected on the incidence of new clinical meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates per ward and these were correlated with rates of isolation failures for MRSA cases. There were 845 requirements for patient isolation, of which 185 (22%) could not be met (isolation failures). Three-quarters of the requirements for isolation were due to MRSA or Clostridium difficile. The proportion of isolation failures was consistent for most organisms and conditions but varied markedly between clinical specialities (0-57%). Reasons for failure to isolate included no single rooms available, all single/isolation rooms occupied (for both isolation and non-infection-control reasons), limitations on the use of single rooms in mixed-sex wards and patient-specific reasons. Only a minority of the available single rooms were occupied for infection control reasons (12-19%). There was a statistically significant correlation between isolation failures and MRSA incidence (Spearman's rho 0.596, P<0.001). In only one case where a ward had >or=30% of its beds provided in single rooms was there an instance of failure to isolate. In conclusion, insufficient capacity to isolate patients with potentially transmissible pathogens is common and may compromise infection control requirements. Either isolation capacity must be increased or evidence-based risk assessment must be applied to situations where demand for isolation exceeds availability. Further information is needed on the consequences of isolation failure.
TI  - Blood pressure cuffs: friend or foe?
AB  - A study to assess the level of bacterial contamination of blood pressure cuffs in use on hospital wards was performed. Viable organisms were recovered from all the 24 cuffs sampled at a density of between 1000 and >25 000 colony-forming units/100 cm2. Potential pathogens were isolated from 14 cuffs (58%). Eleven cuffs grew a single pathogen and three cuffs grew a mixture, yielding a total of 18 isolates. Meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from eight (33%) cuffs, meticillin-resistant S. aureus was isolated from two (8%) cuffs and Clostridium difficile was isolated from eight (33%) cuffs. This study serves as a reminder that hands are not the only fomite to go from patient to patient on hospital wards, and that measures should be taken to reduce the risks posed by blood pressure cuffs.
TI  - Rectal bleeding in infancy: clinical, allergological, and microbiological examination.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rectal bleeding is an alarming symptom and requires additional investigation. In infants it has been explained mainly by hypersensitivity. In addition to dietary antigens, intraluminal microbial agents challenge the immature gut mucosa. Although controlled in the mature gut, these antigens may induce inflammation in the developing gastrointestinal tract. The objectives of this study were to evaluate prospectively the clinical course of rectal bleeding and evaluate the impact of cow's milk allergy and aberrant gut microbiota on the condition. Because withdrawal of cow's milk antigens from the infants' diet is used as a first treatment without evidence of its efficacy, we also aimed to asses the effect of a cow's milk-elimination diet on the duration of rectal bleeding. METHODS: The study involved 40 consecutive infants (mean age: 2.7 months) with visible rectal bleeding during a 2-year period at the Tampere University Hospital Department of Pediatrics. Most of the infants (68%) were fully breastfed. At enrollment the infants were randomly allocated to receive a cow's milk-elimination diet (n = 19) or continue their previous diet (n = 21) for 1 month. Findings of colonoscopy, fecal bacterial culture, fluorescence in situ hybridization of selected gut genera, specific detection of fecal enteroviruses, rotaviruses, and adenoviruses, fecal electron microscopy for viruses, and mucosal electron microscopy for viruses were assessed. During each visit the severity of atopic eczema, if any, was assessed according to the SCORAD method. In evaluating the extent of sensitization, serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific IgE and skin-prick tests for cow's milk, egg, and wheat were studied. Cow's milk allergy was diagnosed by elimination and provocation testing. Five patients were hospitalized; all others were treated on an outpatient basis. The follow-up visits were scheduled 1 month later and at the age of 1 year. Sixty-four healthy reference infants were selected as controls according to the following criteria: age and timing of fecal sampling being identical to within 1 month. RESULTS: Altogether, 32 (80%) infants manifested bloody stools during follow-up (mean [range]: 2.1 [1-15] per day). The mean number of days with rectal bleeding on follow-up was 6. Typically, bloody stools occurred irregularly, for which reason the mean time to the last occurrence of rectal bleeding was 24 (range: 1-85) days from admission. Atopic eczema at presentation or during follow-up was diagnosed in 38% of the infants. Increased specific IgE concentrations or a positive skin-prick test were uncommon. The growth of the infants was normal on admission and during follow-up. Colonoscopy revealed typically focal mucosal erythema and aphthous ulcerations. The mucosa appeared normal in less than half of the patients. No anorectal fissures or colonic polyps were found. Light microscopy revealed that the overall architecture of the mucosa was well maintained. Acute inflammation or postinflammatory state and focal infiltration of eosinophils in the lamina propria were the most common abnormalities. A cow's milk-elimination diet did not affect the duration of rectal bleeding. Cow's milk allergy was diagnosed in 7 (18%) patients. Virus-particle aggregates were found in the microvillus layer of the colon epithelium in 8 cases. The surface epithelium of the virus-positive colon biopsy specimens regularly showed degenerative changes in the microvillus layer and epithelial cells. Electron microscopy study of the colon biopsies disclosed virus particles (30 nm in diameter) on the surface of epithelial cells. Virus particles or RNA were present in feces in only a minority of the patients. All fecal cultures were negative for Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia. Campylobacter jejuni was found in the feces of 1 patient, and fecal cultures were positive for Clostridium difficile in 4 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients, and yeast in 2 patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that at the time of admission the total numbers of bacteria and the numbers of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in feces were lower in the patients compared with controls. The fecal concentrations of microbes characterized in this study (Bacteroides, bifidobacteria, Clostridium, lactobacilli, and enterococci) did not differ significantly between the time of admission and the second visit in the patients or controls. At the age of 1 year, 7 patients still suffered from cow's milk allergy, 5 of whom also suffered from multiple food allergies. Atopic eczema and histopathologically confirmed inflammation of the colonic mucosa at presentation were associated with persistence of cow's milk allergy at the age of 1 year. No patients exhibited gastrointestinal complaints or visible blood in stools. CONCLUSIONS: Rectal bleeding in infants is generally a benign and self-limiting disorder. Bloody stools occurred irregularly for only a few days during the following months. As in a previous report, most infants were exclusively breastfed. In the majority of the patients the cause of the condition remains unknown. An association with viruses can be seen in some patients. The microbes that commonly lead to bloody diarrhea in older children and adults, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia, were absent in the present material. The low bifidobacterial numbers in fecal samples may indicate a significant aberrance that may provide a target for probiotic intervention to normalize gut microbiota. The gut microbiota overall seemed stable, because the numbers of major groups of microbiota tested did not change significantly between the time of admission and after 1 month. Cow's milk allergy among these patients is more uncommon than previously believed. Cow's milk challenge is thus essential in infants who become symptom-free during a cow's milk-free diet to reduce the number of false-positive cow's milk-allergy diagnoses.
TI  - Systematic review of antimicrobial drug prescribing in hospitals.
AB  - Prudent prescribing of antimicrobial drugs to hospital inpatients may reduce incidences of antimicrobial drug resistance and healthcare-associated infection. We reviewed the literature from January 1980 to November 2003 to identify rigorous evaluations of interventions to improve hospital prescribing of antimicrobial drugs. We identified 66 studies with interpretable data, of which 16 reported 20 microbiologic outcomes: gram-negative resistant bacteria, 10 studies; Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, 5 studies; vancomycin-resistant enterococci, 3 studies; and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 2 studies. Four studies provided strong evidence that the intervention changed microbial outcomes with low risk for alternative explanations, 8 studies provided less convincing evidence, and 4 studies provided no evidence. The strongest and most consistent evidence was for C. difficile-associated diarrhea, but we were able to analyze only the immediate impact of interventions because of nonstandardized durations of follow-up. The ability to compare results of studies could be substantially improved by standardizing methods and reporting.
TI  - Prevalence of zoonotic agents in dogs visiting hospitalized people in Ontario: implications for infection control.
AB  - Visitation of hospitalized people by dogs is becoming commonplace, but little is  known about the potential health risks of introducing dogs to healthcare settings. This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of zoonotic agents in a group of 102 visitation dogs from a variety of sources across Ontario. Between May and July 2004, owners were interviewed by a standardized questionnaire while dogs underwent a standardized physical examination. One specimen of faeces, hair-coat brushings and one rectal, aural, nasal, oral and pharyngeal swab were collected from each dog and tested for 18 specific pathogens. All dogs were judged to be in good health. Zoonotic agents were isolated from 80 out of 102 (80%) dogs. The primary pathogen was Clostridium difficile, which was isolated from 58 (58%) faecal specimens. Seventy-one percent (41/58) of these isolates were toxigenic. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli was isolated from one (1%) dog, extended-spectrum cephalosporinase E. coli was isolated from three (3%) dogs, and organisms of the genus Salmonella were isolated from three (3%) dogs. Pasteurella multocida or Pasteurella canis was isolated from 29 (29%) oral swabs, and Malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from eight (8%) aural swabs. Giardia antigen was present in the faeces of seven (7%) dogs, while Toxocara canis and Ancylostoma caninum were detected in two (2%) dogs and one (1%) dog, respectively. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Campylobacter spp., Microsporum canis, group A streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Cryptosporidium spp. were not detected. Further information is needed before the full implications of these findings for infection control can be assessed properly.
TI  - Erythromycin for prokinesis: imprudent prescribing?
AB  - Problems with antibiotic resistant bacteria are increasing in the hospital and particularly in the intensive care unit. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumanii and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli constitute a therapeutic and infection control challenge. Early enteral feeding improves survival in patients in the intensive care unit. Prokinetic agents are routinely used in patients with inappropriate gastrointestinal motility. The use of erythromycin at sub-therapeutic doses as a prokinetic agent is a cause of concern for the following reasons: it can increase the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and the likelihood of Clostridium difficile disease. The use of an antibiotic as a prokinetic agent does not constitute prudent antimicrobial prescribing and should be avoided. Alternative agents, whenever possible, should be used.
TI  - Intestinal pseudomembranes: Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium difficile or both?
AB  
TI  - Trends in antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens and effect on treatment.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in health care-associated pathogens is a growing concern for health care and for public health. A recent shift in the epidemiological profile of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has resulted not only in health care-associated infections but now, also, in community-associated infections. Reports have described S. aureus exhibiting decreased susceptibility and, even, resistance to vancomycin. The rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci may be leveling; however, vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium has already achieved high levels. Multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is increasing, and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella strains are emerging. Acinetobacter species cause a minority of health care-associated pneumonias due to gram-negative organisms, but a growing proportion is resistant to carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins. Recent increases in the frequency and severity of Clostridium difficile-associated illness are associated with the emergence of a hypervirulent C. difficile strain with increased resistance to the fluoroquinolones. The presence of these and other resistant organisms in health care facilities limits the number of effective antimicrobials available for treatment.
TI  - Frequency and possible infection control implications of gastrointestinal colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major cause of health care-associated infections. Multiple factors, including transmission from unrecognized reservoirs of MRSA, are responsible for failure to control the spread of MRSA. We conducted prospective surveillance to determine the frequency of gastrointestinal colonization with MRSA among patients and its possible impact on nosocomial transmission of MRSA. Stool specimens submitted for Clostridium difficile toxin A/B assays were routinely inoculated on colistin-naladixic acid agar plates, and S. aureus was identified by using standard methods. Methicillin resistance was confirmed by growth on oxacillin-salt screening agar. For patients whose stool yielded MRSA, information regarding any previous cultures positive for MRSA or other organisms that would require contact precautions was obtained from the laboratory's computer system. During a 1-year period, 151 (9.8%) of 1,543 patients who had one or more stool specimens screened had MRSA in their stool. Ninety-three (62%) of the 151 patients had no previous history of MRSA colonization or infection. Of these 93, 75 were inpatients. Sixty (80%) of the 75 inpatients with no previous history of MRSA were not under "contact precautions." The 60 patients would have spent an estimated total of 267 days without being placed under contact precautions if their positive stool cultures had not resulted in their being isolated. Placing patients under contact precautions based on their positive stool cultures prevented an estimated 35 episodes of MRSA transmission. We conclude that gastrointestinal colonization with MRSA may serve as an unrecognized reservoir from which transmission of MRSA may occur in health care facilities.
TI  - Postoperative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus enteritis following hysterectomy: a case report and review of the literature.
AB  - Following a hysterectomy a 43-year-old woman developed colicky abdominal pain and profuse postoperative diarrhoea. Examination was unremarkable and initial investigations revealed a normal plain abdominal X-ray initially, but later there was some small bowel dilatation and evidence of raised inflammatory markers. No cause was identified at exploratory laparotomy 2 days post operation. Flexible sigmoidoscopy was normal. The patient was empirically treated with oral vancomycin for presumed Clostridium difficile diarrhoea, although subsequent stool cultures were negative for the usual intestinal pathogens and C. difficile toxin. The diarrhoea persisted for 9 days. By day 10 stool cultures had grown methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, establishing the diagnosis. To our knowledge this is the first report of methicillin-resistant S. aureus enteritis following hysterectomy.
TI  - Increase of faecal bifidobacteria due to dietary oligosaccharides induces a reduction of clinically relevant pathogen germs in the faeces of formula-fed preterm infants.
AB  - In a previous study on formula-fed preterm infants, we were able to demonstrate that dietary oligosaccharides (a mixture of 90% galacto-oligosaccharides and 10% fructo-oligosaccharides in a concentration of 1 g/dl) stimulate the growth of faecal bifidobacteria. In the present explorative analysis of this study, we focus on the effect of the dominance of bifidobacteria on the presence of clinically relevant pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Streptococcus group B, Clostridium difficile, Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter). CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that stimulation of bifidobacteria by prebiotic oligosaccharides reduces the presence of clinically relevant pathogens in the faecal flora, indicating that prebiotic substances might have the capacity to protect against enteral infections.
TI  - Reduction in nosocomial transmission of drug-resistant bacteria after introduction of an alcohol-based handrub.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess quantitatively the clinical impact of using an alcohol-based handrub (ABHR) in the hospital environment, measuring impact as the incidence of new, nosocomial isolates of drug-resistant organisms. DESIGN: An observational survey from 1998 to 2003 comparing the first 3 years of no ABHR use with the 3 years following, when an ABHR was provided for hand hygiene. SETTING: An inner-city, tertiary-care medical center. INTERVENTION: At baseline, an antimicrobial soap with 0.3% triclosan was provided for staff hand hygiene. The intervention was placement in all inpatient and all outpatient clinic rooms of wall-mounted dispensers of an ABHR with 62.5% ethyl alcohol. Data were collected on change in the incidence of three drug-resistant bacteria. RESULTS: During the 6 years of the survey, all new, nosocomially acquired isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea were recorded. On comparison of the first 3 years with the final 3 years, there was a 21% decrease in new, nosocomially acquired MRSA (90 to 71 isolates per year; P = .01) and a 41% decrease in VRE (41 to 24 isolates per year; P < .001). The incidence of new isolates of C. difficile was essentially unchanged. CONCLUSION: In the 3 years following implementation of an ABHR, this hospital experienced the value of reductions in the incidence of nosocomially acquired drug-resistant bacteria. These reductions provide clinical validation of the recent CDC recommendation that ABHRs be the primary choice for hand decontamination.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of commercial canine and feline raw diets.
AB  - Twenty-five commercial raw diets for dogs and cats were evaluated bacteriologically. Coliforms were present in all diets, ranging from 3.5 x 10(3) to 9.4 x 10(6) CFU/g (mean 8.9 x 10(5); standard deviation 1.9 x 10(6)). Escherichia coli was identified in 15/25 (64%) diets; however, E. coli O157 was not detected. Salmonella spp. were detected in 5/25 (20%) diets; 1 each of beef-, lamb-, quail-, chicken-, and ostrich-based diets. Sporeforming bacteria were identified from 4/25 (16%) samples on direct culture and 25/25 (100%) samples using enrichment culture. Clostridium perfringens was identified in 5/25 (20%) samples. A toxigenic strain of C. difficile was isolated from one turkey-based food. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 1/25 (4%) diets. Campylobacter spp. were not isolated from any of the diets.
TI  - Can the law help Hewitt take MRSA to the cleaners?
AB  
TI  - Acd, a peptidoglycan hydrolase of Clostridium difficile with N-acetylglucosaminidase activity.
AB  - A gene encoding a putative peptidoglycan hydrolase was identified by sequence similarity searching in the Clostridium difficile 630 genome sequence, and the corresponding protein, named Acd (autolysin of C. difficile) was expressed in Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequence of Acd shows a modular structure with two main domains: an N-terminal domain exhibiting repeated sequences and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The C-terminal domain exhibits sequence similarity with the glucosaminidase domains of Staphylococcus aureus Atl and Bacillus subtilis LytD autolysins. Purified recombinant Acd produced in E. coli was confirmed to be a cell-wall hydrolase with lytic activity on the peptidoglycan of several Gram-positive bacteria, including C. difficile. The hydrolytic specificity of Acd was studied by RP-HPLC analysis and MALDI-TOF MS using B. subtilis cell-wall extracts. Muropeptides generated by Acd hydrolysis demonstrated that Acd hydrolyses peptidoglycan bonds between N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid, confirming that Acd is an N-acetylglucosaminidase. The transcription of the acd gene increased during vegetative cellular growth of C. difficile 630. The sequence of the acd gene appears highly conserved in C. difficile strains. Regarding deduced amino acid sequences, the C-terminal domain with enzymic function appears to be the most conserved of the two main domains. Acd is the first known autolysin involved in peptidoglycan hydrolysis of C. difficile.
TI  - Multidrug resistance in Staphylococcus aureus due to overexpression of a novel multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) transport protein.
AB  - Efflux is an important mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR) in bacteria. The multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) family is the most recently described group of MDR efflux proteins, none of which have previously been identified in Staphylococcus aureus. Two independently derived S. aureus mutants having efflux-related MDR phenotypes were studied using microarray technology and a marked overexpression of an open reading frame (ORF; mepA) encoding a protein homologous with MATE family proteins was observed in both. There was concomitant overexpression of ORFs in close proximity to mepA (approximately 100 bp) encoding a MarR-type regulator (mepR, upstream of mepA) and a protein of unknown function (mepB, downstream). Experiments in which mepA was overexpressed or disrupted revealed that the encoded protein has a broad substrate profile that includes several monovalent and divalent biocides and the fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The function of MepB is obscure, it does not contribute to the MDR phenotype conferred by MepA. MepR overexpression reversed the MDR phenotypes of both mutants by repressing mepA transcription. All three ORFs are preferentially transcribed as a single mepRAB unit, suggesting that the three genes form an operon.
TI  - [The study of the pro-nucleating activity of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones in model bile systems].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of bacteria identified in cholesterol gallstones and gallstone formation. METHODS: Observe the bacteria activity in model bile and the influence of bacteria on the cholesterol nucleation time (NT). RESULTS: (1) Model bile were suitable for the growth of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile and Clostridium. Propionibacterium acne grew weakly and the growth of Bacteroides fragilis was restrained in model bile. (2) Only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enTerococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) With pseudomonas aeruginosa or enTerococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.
TI  - The relationship between hospital infection surveillance and control activities and antibiotic-resistant pathogen rates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-resistant pathogen rates are rising in Canada and the United States with significant health and economic costs. The examination of the relationship of surveillance and control activities in hospitals with rates of nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea (CDAD), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) may identify strategies for controlling this growing problem. METHODS: Surveys were sent to infection control programs in hospitals that participated in an earlier survey of infection control practices in Canadian acute care hospitals. RESULTS: One hundred twenty of 145 (82.8%) hospitals responded to the survey. The mean MRSA rate was 2.0 (SD 2.9) per 1000 admissions, the mean CDAD rate was 3.8 (SD 4.3), and the mean VRE rate was 0.4 (SD 1.5). Multiple stepwise regression analysis found that hospitals that reported infection rates by specific risk groups ( r = -0.27, P < .01) and that kept attendance records of infection control teaching activities ( r = -0.23, P < .01) were associated with lower MRSA rates. Multiple stepwise regression analysis found that larger hospitals ( r = 0.25, P < .01) and hospitals at which infection control committees or staff had the direct authority to close a ward or unit to further admissions because of outbreaks ( r = 0.22, P < .05) were associated with higher CDAD rates. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that larger hospitals (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.0; P = .003) and teaching hospitals (OR, 3.7 95% CI, 1.2-11.8; P = .02) were associated with the presence of VRE. Hospitals were less likely to have VRE when infection control staff frequently contacted physicians and nurses for reports of new infections (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7; P = .02) and there were in-service programs for updating nursing and ancillary staff on current infection control practices (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7; P = .01). CONCLUSION: Surveillance and control activities were associated with MRSA and CDAD rates and the presence of VRE. Surveillance and control activities might be especially beneficial in large and teaching hospitals.
TI  - Prevalence and characteristics of bacteria and host factors in an outbreak situation of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) represents a clinical entity leading to prolonged hospital stays and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and results in additional costs. The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence and characteristics of different bacteria in stools of patients with AAD. The reliability of diagnostic procedures under routine conditions was evaluated. Host factors were also analysed. From June 2002 to April 2003 89 cases of diarrhoea were reported at a hospital unit for internal medicine. Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens toxin enzyme-immunoassays (EIAs), and culture for C. difficile, C. perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus were performed on stool samples from all patients. Toxin production was determined in isolated S. aureus strains. In vitro susceptibility of S. aureus for oxacillin and of C. difficile for vancomycin, metronidazole, linezolid, fusidic acid and tetracycline was tested. Host factors, such as age, comorbidities, antibiotic exposure and contact with other patients, were evaluated. Twenty-six stools were positive for C. difficile toxins by an EIA technique, while C. difficile was cultured from 39. C. difficile was isolated from 21 stools that were EIA negative. Additionally, from 28 stools S. aureus and/or C. perfringens could be isolated. Nine samples contained only S. aureus and/or C. perfringens. Thirty-one stools were negative in all tests. All C. difficile isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and metronidazole. Age >60 years, and diseases of the vascular system, the heart, the kidneys and the lungs were identified as risk factors for acquiring C. difficile in this setting (P values < 0.05). Stool culture for C. difficile was shown to be more sensitive than toxin EIA in this study. Risk factors for the acquisition of C. difficile in outbreak situations seem to differ from risk factors in the normal hospital setting. The role of toxin-producing S. aureus in cases of AAD needs further investigation.
TI  - Nurses and the control of infectious disease. Understanding epidemiology and disease transmission is vital to nursing care.
AB  - Epidemiology examines the distribution and source of a disease in a population. Understanding epidemiology and disease transmission is vital to nursing care. Infectious disease transmission requires three components: an agent (virus, bacterium, parasite or other microbe), a vulnerable host and a conducive environment. Disease spread can occur through direct contact or via indirect methods (airborne droplets, vectors, fomites, water or food). Intervention can occur by attacking the agent (e.g., using microbicides), changing the environment (e.g., providing negative pressure rooms) or strengthening the host (e.g., vaccination). Three epidemiologically relevant microbes are the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-associated coronavirus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). The first is an emerging pathogen, and the latter two are existing agents that have mutated such that they are resistant to their standard treatments. For SARS, control measures include screening for possible cases and appropriate triage, respiratory and barrier precautions within the healthcare facility, and voluntary isolation in the community for contacts or healthcare workers who exhibit symptoms. Control measures for MRSA include the screening of patient lesions, isolating or cohorting patients who are already infected, covering wounds with impermeable dressings, treating staff and patient carriers with antibiotics, and improved hygiene. Control measures for C. difficile Control measures include paying close attention to the hygiene of the clinical setting, disinfecting using bleach and the isolation of infected patients.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on Helicobacter pylori (Hp) growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 Hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. The inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and Hp strains, and were method dependent. The cagA status of Hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. The success and progress of Hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating Hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of Hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. Hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. These results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.
TI  - [A case of pseudomembranous enterocolitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - A 47-year-old woman was hospitalized because of urinary-tract infection. She was  treated with antibiotics for 6 days. However, severe watery diarrhea and pyrexia developed 6 days after stopping administration of antibiotics. Stool, throat and blood cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and negative for Clostridium difficile DI toxin. In spite of administration of VCM, she died of septic shock. At autopsy, macroscopic observation revealed a pseudomembrane in the ileum. MRSA enterocolitis can occur in patients with antibiotic-related diarrhea, and physicians should be aware of its rapid clinical course and possible lethal outcome.
TI  - The Role of the Intestinal Tract As a Source for Transmission of Nosocomial Pathogens.
AB  - The intestinal tract provides an important source for transmission of many nosocomial pathogens, including Enterococcus species, Clostridium difficile, Candida species, Enterobacteriaceae, and other gram-negative bacilli. Recent data suggest that the intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients may also be an important reservoir of Staphylococcus aureus. Although the clinical manifestations of these pathogens are diverse, a common pathogenesis is involved in their colonization of and dissemination from the intestinal tract. Of particular importance is the role that antibiotic selective pressure plays in promotion of colonization by antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Strategies to limit the spread of these pathogens must include efforts to improve adherence to standard infection control practices and promotion of good antimicrobial stewardship. New strategies that include application of novel technologies to the problem of pathogen transmission are needed, and additional research is needed to clarify the potential utility of selective decontamination of the digestive tract.
TI  - Contamination, disinfection, and cross-colonization: are hospital surfaces reservoirs for nosocomial infection?
AB  - Despite documentation that the inanimate hospital environment (e.g., surfaces and medical equipment) becomes contaminated with nosocomial pathogens, the data that suggest that contaminated fomites lead to nosocomial infections do so indirectly. Pathogens for which there is more-compelling evidence of survival in environmental reservoirs include Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and pathogens for which there is evidence of probable survival in environmental reservoirs include norovirus, influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, and Candida species. Strategies to reduce the rates of nosocomial infection with these pathogens should conform to established guidelines, with an emphasis on thorough environmental cleaning and use of Environmental Protection Agency-approved detergent-disinfectants.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile cause distinct pseudomembranous intestinal diseases.
AB  - We report simultaneous infections with Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a patient with discrete colonic pseudomembranes typical of C. difficile infection, as well as confluent, loosely adherent pseudomembranes in the small bowel. Identification of MRSA in the small bowel pseudomembrane by polymerase chain reaction supports S. aureus as an enteric pathogen.
TI  - The cme gene of Clostridium difficile confers multidrug resistance in Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance in C. difficile by efflux has been previously suggested. The genome of C. difficile 630 was screened for sequences encoding putative proteins homologous to NorA from Staphylococcus aureus. Four ORFs homologous to efflux genes were cloned into the pAT79 shuttle vector under the control of transcription and translation signals of Gram-positive bacteria and expressed in Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 and S. aureus RN4220. One of these sequences, designated cme conferred resistance to ethidium bromide, safranin O, and erythromycin in E. faecalis. The three other ORFs did not confer detectable resistance in both bacteria.
TI  - The prevention of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea in hospital.
AB  - The number of health care-associated infections has increased over the years and  generated a lot of interest and concern. The attention tends to be focused on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but the less publicised Clostridium difficile is a growing problem. It increases length of hospital stay, causes significant morbidity in patients, affects nurses' workloads, adds to the cost of cleaning, laundry and disposables, and can lead to ward closures. All NHS trusts in England are now required to report C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in all patients over 65 years of age (National Clostridium Difficile Standards Group, 2003).
TI  - Bacillus clausii probiotic strains: antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities.
AB  - The clinical benefits observed with probiotic use are mainly attributed to the antimicrobial substances produced by probiotic strains and to their immunomodulatory effects. Currently, the best-documented probiotic bacteria used in human therapy are lactic acid bacteria. In contrast, studies aiming to characterize the mechanisms responsible for the probiotic beneficial effects of Bacillus are rare. The current work seeks to contribute to such characterization by evaluating the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities of probiotic B. clausii strains. B. clausii strains release antimicrobial substances in the medium. Moreover, the release of these antimicrobial substances was observed during stationary growth phase and coincided with sporulation. These substances were active against Gram-positive bacteria, in particular against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and Clostridium difficile. The antimicrobial activity was resistant to subtilisin, proteinase K, and chymotrypsin treatment, whereas it was sensitive to pronase treatment. The evaluation of the immunomodulatory properties of probiotic B. clausii strains was performed in vitro on Swiss and C57 Bl/6j murine cells. The authors demonstrate that these strains, in their vegetative forms, are able to induce NOS II synthetase activity, IFN-gamma production, and CD4 T-cell proliferation.
TI  - Do infection control measures work for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review evidence regarding the effectiveness of control measures in  reducing transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in hospitals. DESIGN: Literature review and surveillance cultures of hospitalized patients at high risk for MRSA colonization or infection. SETTING: A 500-bed, university-affiliated, community teaching hospital. RESULTS: The percentage of nosocomial S. aureus infections caused by MRSA increased significantly between 1982 and 2002, despite the use of various isolation and barrier precaution policies. The apparent ineffectiveness of control measures may be due to several factors including the failure to identify patients colonized with MRSA. For example, cultures of stool specimens submitted for Clostridium difficile toxin assays at one hospital found that 12% of patients had MRSA in their stool, and 41% of patients with unrecognized colonization were cared for without using barrier precautions. Other factors include the use of barrier precaution strategies that do not account for multiple reservoirs of MRSA, poor adherence of healthcare workers (HCWs) to recommended barrier precautions and handwashing, failure to identify and treat HCWs responsible for transmitting MRSA, and importation of MRSA by patients admitted from other facilities. Control programs that include active surveillance cultures (ASCs) of high-risk patients and use of barrier precautions have reduced MRSA prevalence rates and have been cost-effective. Using a staged approach to implementing ASCs can minimize logistic problems. CONCLUSION: MRSA control programs are effective if they include ASCs of high-risk patients, use of barrier precautions when caring for colonized or infected patients, hand hygiene, and treating HCWs implicated in MRSA transmission.
TI  - "Collateral damage" from cephalosporin or quinolone antibiotic therapy.
AB  - "Collateral damage" is a term used to refer to ecological adverse effects of antibiotic therapy; namely, the selection of drug-resistant organisms and the unwanted development of colonization or infection with multidrug-resistant organisms. The risk of such damage can be assessed for different antibiotic classes by a variety of epidemiologic studies. Cephalosporin use has been linked to subsequent infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, beta-lactam-resistant Acinetobacter species, and Clostridium difficile. Quinolone use has been linked to infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and with increasing quinolone resistance in gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Neither third-generation cephalosporins nor quinolones appear suitable for sustained use in hospitals as "workhorse" antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Microbial-gut interactions in health and disease. Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  - Most cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) are directly or indirectly due to the alteration of gut microflora by antibiotics. 'Functional' diarrhoea, usually limited to a mild and brief change in stool frequency, is considered as the most frequent pattern of AAD. Reduced carbohydrate fermentation and impaired metabolism of bile acids have been claimed as the potential causes of this transient digestive discomfort but a critical analysis of the data supporting these theories is necessary. Alternatively, changes in the gut flora ecosystem allow pathogens to proliferate. Clostridium difficile is responsible for approximately 10% of cases of AAD and almost all cases of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. The level of evidence which supports the potential responsibility of other candidate pathogens (Klebsiella oxytoca, enterotoxin-producing Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus, Candida) needs to be appreciated according to the updated postulates of causality relationships between a bacterium and a disease.
TI  - Provision of alcohol hand rub at the hospital bedside: a case study.
AB  - A pilot study was performed on a 28-bed acute hospital ward, promoting hand disinfection by providing Sterillium alcohol hand rub at the bedside. Bottles of Sterillium with pump dispensers were attached to the end of each patient's bed, next to the observation charts. Posters promoting the use of the product were prominently displayed and several ward staff attended a presentation on the effectiveness of Sterillium. Although this was a small study, Alert Organism rates during the three-month trial indicated a reduction in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) incidence and an increased Clostridium difficile incidence. Several other factors that may have influenced the study outcomes will be discussed. There were no health and safety problems during the trial, but other issues were identified which have implications for introducing the bedside rub on a hospital wide basis, including the type of holder used, logistical arrangements and the staff and patient information requirements. The strategies adopted to address these issues will be discussed.
TI  - [Characteristics of post antibiotic Clostridium difficile and Staphylococcus aureus diarrhoea].
AB  
TI  - The role of bacterial and non-bacterial toxins in the induction of changes in membrane transport: implications for diarrhea.
AB  - Bacterial toxins induce changes in membrane transport which underlie the loss of  electrolyte homeostasis associated with diarrhea. Bacterial- and their secreted toxin-types which have been linked with diarrhea include: (a) Vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin, E1 Tor hemolysin and accessory cholera enterotoxin); (b) Escherichia coli (heat stable enterotoxin, heat-labile enterotoxin and colicins); (c) Shigella dysenteriae (shiga-toxin); (d) Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens enterotoxin, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin and theta-toxin); (e) Clostridium difficile (toxins A and B); (f) Staphylococcus aureus (alpha-haemolysin); (g) Bacillus cereus (cytotoxin K and haemolysin BL); and (h) Aeromonas hydrophila (aerolysin, heat labile cytotoxins and heat stable cytotoxins). The mechanisms of toxin-induced diarrhea include: (a) direct effects on ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells, i.e. direct toxin interaction with intrinsic ion channels in the membrane and (b) indirect interaction with ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells mediated by toxin binding to a membrane receptor. These effects consequently cause the release of second messengers, e.g. the release of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate/guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, IP(3), Ca2+ and/or changes in second messengers that are the result of toxin-formed Ca2+ and K+ permeable channels, which increase Ca2+ flux and augment changes in Ca2+ homeostasis and cause depolarisation of the membrane potential. Consequently, many voltage-dependent ion transport systems, e.g. voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx, are affected. The toxin-formed ion channels may act as a pathway for loss of fluid and electrolytes. Although most of the diarrhea-causing toxins have been reported to act via cation and anion channel formation, the properties of these channels have not been well studied, and the available biophysical properties that are needed for the characterization of these channels are inadequate.
TI  - [Antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the elderly].
AB  - PURPOSE: Most of the antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) cases result from a transient disturbance in the function of the normal intestinal flora and are spontaneously solved when discontinuing the antibacterial therapy. However, a mild diarrhea lasting several days may induce a dehydration or worsen a denutrition in frail elderly people. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AND KEY POINTS: The incidence of AAD varies between 5 and 25% depending on the concerned antibiotic. Only 10-20% of all AAD cases are caused by infection, especially with Clostridium difficile, for which advanced age is a major risk factor. The first biological exam to perform when severe AAD or in frail people is the detection of C. difficile toxins, especially in elderly patient treated with beta-lactam antibiotics. Nevertheless, other infectious organisms causing AAD may be considered, as Staphylococcus aureus when predominant in stool cultures from patients treated with fluoroquinolones or as Klebsiella oxytoca when isolated in bloody diarrhea from patients treated with ampicillin. Elevated fecal counts of Candida spp. found in patients treated with antibiotics is rather the consequence of therapy than the cause of AAD. The prevention of AAD is based on a rational antibiotic use to avoid endogenous selection of C. difficile and on the improvement of the hygiene measures to limit the exogenous transmission of the bacteria or related spores by spoiled hands. FUTURE PROSPECTS: Simultaneous prescription of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal flora, should be better described, especially in elderly people, because of its important economic impact.
TI  - How do we assess hospital cleaning? A proposal for microbiological standards for  surface hygiene in hospitals.
AB  - Increasing numbers of hospital-acquired infections have generated much attention  over the last decade. The public has linked the so-called 'superbugs' with their experience of dirty hospitals, but the precise role of cleaning in the control of these organisms in unknown. Hence the importance of a clean environment is likely to remain speculative unless it becomes an evidence-based science. This proposal is a call for bacteriological standards with which to assess clinical surface hygiene in hospitals, based on those used by the food industry. The first standard concerns any finding of a specific 'indicator' organism, the presence of which suggests a requirement for increased cleaning. Indicators would include Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and various Gram-negative bacilli. The second standard concerns a quantitative aerobic colony count of <5 cfu/cm(2) on frequent hand touch surfaces in hospitals. The principle relates to modern risk management systems such as HACCP, and reflects the fact that pathogens of concern are widespread. Further work is required to evaluate and refine these standards and define the infection risk from the hospital environment.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - Favorable impact of a multidisciplinary antibiotic management program conducted during 7 years.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of an interventional multidisciplinary antibiotic management program on expenditures for antibiotics and on the incidence of nosocomial infections caused by Clostridium difficile and antibiotic-resistant pathogens during 7 years. DESIGN: Prospective study with comparison with preintervention trends. SETTING: University-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENTS: All adult inpatients. INTERVENTION: A multidisciplinary antibiotic management program to minimize the inappropriate use of third-generation cephalosporins was implemented in 1991. Its impact was evaluated prospectively. The incidence of nosocomial C. difficile and resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections as well as the rate of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were compared with those of National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System hospitals of similar size. RESULTS: Following implementation of the program, there was a 22% decrease in the use of parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics (P < .0001) despite a 15% increase in acuity of patient care during the following 7 years. Concomitantly, there was a significant (P = .002) decrease in nosocomial infections caused by C. difficile and a significant (P = .02) decrease in nosocomial infections caused by resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The program also appeared to have a favorable impact on VRE rates without a sustained impact on MRSA rates. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that an ongoing multidisciplinary antibiotic management program may have a sustained beneficial impact on both expenditures for antibiotics and the incidence of nosocomial infection by C. difficile and resistant bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (PO) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Propionibacterium propionicum, Clostridium difficile) and fungi (Candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. The study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of PO decreased antilysozyme activity (ALA) and the anticomplement activity in Klebsiella, Shigella, Propionibacterium, Clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus Candida, but increased ALA in nonhemolytic Escherichia. Under the action of PO an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. The data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of PO on the microbiocenosis of the intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.
TI  - Restriction of third generation cephalosporin use reduces the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea in hospitalised patients.
AB  - Third generation cephalosporin antibiotics (3GC) have become the antibiotics of choice in many hospitals in recent years for the treatment of infections such as community-acquired pneumonia. However, increased use of 3GCs has also been associated with a rise in the occurrence of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea due to Clostridium difficile, as well as an increase in the prevalence of antibiotic resistant organisms such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin resistant entrococci, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram negative bacilli. In Western Australia, greater use of 3GCs was shown to correlate with more Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in a large acute care teaching hospital during the 1980s. During the 1990s, the use of 3GCs in this hospital remained high and, at the end of 1998, a policy was introduced to prevent the use of ceftriaxone (the only 3GC in use) without prior approval. This resulted in a decline in 3GC use and a 50 per cent reduction in the incidence of CDAD during 1999 and 2000. To strengthen these observations, the impact of the 3GC policy on the occurrence of CDAD was analysed using time-series intervention analysis that showed a statistically significant decrease in the occurrence of CDAD during the post-intervention period after controlling for exogenous factors. Thus, changes in antibiotic prescribing practices can influence the incidence of CDAD and, potentially, antibiotic resistant pathogens.
TI  - Identification and characteristics of nisin Z-producing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolated from Kimchi.
AB  - We isolated bacteriocin-producing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis from Kimchi. The bacteriocin inhibited strains of Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Listeria monocytogenes, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and one out of four methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, as well as some closely related lactic acid bacteria. In tricine-SDS-PAGE, the bacteriocin migrated with an apparent molecular weight of about 4 kDa to the same location as nisin A and crude nisin Z. The gene encoding this bacteriocin was found to be identical to that of nisin Z with direct PCR sequence methods. The inhibitory activity was stable against heat and pH, but it was lost at 100 degrees C for 1 h and at 121 degrees C for 15 min. The bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but was not affected by lysozyme, lipase, catalase, or beta-glucosidase. There were some differences in characteristics from those of nisins described previously.
TI  - Colonization and infection with multiple nosocomial pathogens among patients colonized with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that patients colonized with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) have a higher frequency of colonization or infection with other nosocomial pathogens than do patients who are not colonized with VRE. DESIGN: A rectal swab culture survey was conducted to determine the point-prevalence of stool colonization with ceftazidime-resistant gram-negative bacilli in hospitalized patients with or without VRE stool colonization. For a 6-month period, the frequency of Clostridium difficile diarrhea and isolation of antibiotic-resistant (ie, ceftazidime-, piperacillin/tazobactam-, levofloxacin-, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant) gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and non-albicans Candida species from clinical specimens other than stool was examined. SETTING: A Department of Veterans Affairs medical center. PATIENTS: All patients hospitalized in the acute care facility and one nursing home unit during a 1-week period in February 2001. RESULTS: VRE-colonized patients had a higher point-prevalence of rectal colonization with ceftazidime-resistant gram-negative bacilli than did patients not colonized with VRE (17% vs 4%; P = .026). During a 6-month period,the VRE-colonized patients were more likely to have Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (26% vs 2%; P = .001), MRSA infection (17% vs 4%; P = .017), or colonization or infection with gram-negative bacilli resistant to 4 different antibiotics. CONCLUSION: VRE-colonized patients in our institution have a higher frequency of colonization or infection with other nosocomial pathogens than do patients who are not colonized with VRE. This suggests that isolation measures implemented to control VRE could help limit the dissemination of other, coexisting pathogens.
TI  - The effect of an enhanced infection-control policy on the incidence of Clostridium difficile infection and methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus colonization in acute elderly medical patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile (CD) infection and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization are increasingly common in elderly patients, are associated with cephalosporin or prolonged aminopenicillin courses and can be transmitted by direct contact. Management is by side-room isolation. Ward closure may be required to control outbreaks. METHODS: following prolonged bed closures due to CD and MRSA in an acute age-related geriatric service, an enhanced infection control policy was introduced-emphasis on handwashing, cephalosporin restriction, 7-day time limits on antibiotics and feedback of infection rates. The effect of this policy was evaluated by investigating 2,467 consecutive admissions in the 9 months before and after its introduction. RESULTS: CD infection fell from 36/1,075 admissions (3.35 per 100) to 27/1,392 (1.94 per 100; P < 0.05). MRSA incidence fell from 3.95 per 100 to 1.94 (P < 0.01) whilst that in the rest of the hospital continued to fluctuate. Cephalosporin use fell (and aminopenicillin and trimethoprim use rose) by a factor of three. Unoccupied bed days fell from 1,164 (12.6%) to 513 (5.1%) over the winter, an increase in bed availability of 4.95 a day. CONCLUSIONS: introduction of the policy was associated with significant reductions in CD infection and unoccupied bed-days and helped maintain a lower incidence of MRSA. It is not clear which elements of the policy most influenced outcome. A multi-centre study is needed to determine whether our findings are generally applicable.
TI  - Identification and screening for antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species isolated from healthy infant faeces.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity against Clostridium difficile of 109 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from 32 healthy Korean infants was measured. The ability to show similar activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus was also looked for. Twelve of the 109 LAB showed activity against C. difficile and 19 strains were active against E. coli O157:H7, but none against S. aureus. Four strains had antimicrobial activity against both C. difficile and E. coli O157:H7. Of the 12 strains that had activity against C. difficile, four strains were excluded as Streptococcus species, while the other eight were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays using group-specific primers designed from the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. Based on the sequencing results, the eight strains screened were identified as Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus salivarius.
TI  - Health and economic outcomes of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The health and economic impact of vancomycin-resistant enterococci has not been quantified. METHODS: A retrospective matched cohort study was conducted comparing the outcomes of patients with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (cases) with those of control subjects matched for length of hospital stay until inclusion in the cohort, hospital location, and calendar date. The propensity to be a vancomycin-resistant enterococci case was modeled based on patient characteristics, and included in multivariable models to adjust for confounding. Analyses included the following: (1) conditional logistic regression for mortality, surgery, intensive care unit admission, and discharge to long-term care; (2) linear regression for the logarithm of cost; and (3) accelerated failure time model for length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 233 cases were compared with 647 controls. Groups were similar in age (mean, 62 years), sex (female, 47%), and length of stay before inclusion in the cohort (mean, 8.1 days), but differed in primary diagnosis and comorbidities, past infection or colonization with methicillin sodium-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium difficile, and treatment with cephalosporins or metronidazole. These variables were included in the propensity score, which had good to excellent prediction. Outcomes for cases vs controls and adjusted risks (relative risks [RRs]) were as follows: (1) case fatality rate, 17% vs 6% (RR, 2.13; P =.04); (2) length of stay after inclusion in the cohort, 15.1 vs 8.5 days (RR, 1.73; P<.001); (3) hospital costs, $52 449 vs $31 915 (RR, 1.40; P<.001); (4) surgery after inclusion in the cohort, 18% vs 10% (RR, 2.74; P =.001); (5) intensive care unit admission after inclusion in the cohort, 25% vs 14% (RR, 3.47; P<.001); and (6) transfer to an institution, 51% vs 35% (RR, 2.01; P =.001). CONCLUSION: Compared with a matched hospital population, a population with vancomycin-resistant enterococci was associated with severe adverse outcomes: increased mortality, morbidity, and costs.
TI  - The ICESt1 element of Streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  - The 34,734-bp element ICESt1 from Streptococcus thermophilus CNRZ368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. ICESt1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. Six proteins of the putative conjugative system of ICESt1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon Tn916 from Enterococcus faecalis. A comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low G+C bacteria including Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium difficile, E. faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. Sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. These exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. Therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. We propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "Integrative and Conjugative Elements" (ICEs), irrespective of the integration specificity.
TI  - Occupational health and safety in small animal veterinary practice: Part I--nonparasitic zoonotic diseases.
AB  - Zoonotic diseases are an ever-present concern in small animal veterinary practice and are often overlooked. A variety of nonparasitic zoonotic diseases may be encountered in small animal practice, including cat scratch disease (bartonellosis), cat bite abscesses, rabies, leptospirosis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, salmonellosis, avian chlamydiosis, campylobacteriosis, dermatophytosis, and blastomycosis. These may cause human disease ranging from mild and self-limiting to fatal. The risk of development of a zoonotic disease can be lessened by early recognition of infected animals, proper animal handling, basic biosecurity precautions, and, most importantly, personal hygiene.
TI  - Antecedent treatment with different antibiotic agents as a risk factor for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.
AB  - We conducted a matched case-control study to compare the effect of antecedent treatment with various antibiotics on subsequent isolation of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE); 880 in-patients; 233 VRE cases, and 647 matched controls were included. After being matched for hospital location, calendar time, and duration of hospitalization, the following variables predicted VRE positivity: main admitting diagnosis; a coexisting condition (e.g., diabetes mellitus, organ transplant, or hepatobiliary disease); and infection or colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium difficile within the past year (independent of vancomycin treatment). After controlling for these variables, we examined the effect of various antibiotics. Intravenous treatment with third-generation cephalosporins, metronidazole, and fluoroquinolones was positively associated with VRE. In our institution, when we adjusted the data for temporo-spatial factors, patient characteristics, and hospital events, treatment with third-generation cephalosporins, metronidazole, and fluoroquinolones was identified as a risk factor for VRE. Vancomycin was not a risk factor for isolation of VRE.
TI  - The commonality of risk factors for nosocomial colonization and infection with antimicrobial-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus, gram-negative bacilli, Clostridium difficile, and Candida.
AB  - Recent years have witnessed a rapidly growing crisis in antimicrobial resistance, especially among microorganisms that cause nosocomial infection. To better understand common risk factors among multiresistant organisms, this review explores risk factors for nosocomial infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, Clostridium difficile, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli, and Candida. This review comprises data from 74 published studies; 53 (71%) were retrospective studies and addressed few risk factors or did not quantify risk. The analysis shows impressive commonality of risk factors across these diverse multiresistant organisms: advanced age; underlying diseases and severity of illness; inter-institutional transfer of the patient, especially from a nursing home; prolonged hospitalization; gastrointestinal surgery or transplantation; exposure to invasive devices of all types, especially central venous catheters; and exposure to antimicrobial drugs, especially cephalosporins. More restricted use of antibiotics, especially cephalosporins, and strategies to prevent medical device-related infection and cross-infection in the hospital would yield benefit with all types of resistant organisms. Preemptive isolation of all patients with risk factors for infection by resistant organisms would very likely reduce secondary spread within the hospital. Conversely, programs that focus on only one organism or one antimicrobial drug are unlikely to succeed. Prospective studies of sufficient size that address all potential risk factors, especially individual anti-infective agents, and that use matched controls who are shown by surveillance cultures to be free of colonization by resistant organisms would enhance understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in institutions and guide efforts to develop more effective strategies for prevention.
TI  - High-density microarray of small-subunit ribosomal DNA probes.
AB  - Ribosomal DNA sequence analysis, originally conceived as a way to provide a universal phylogeny for life forms, has proven useful in many areas of biological research. Some of the most promising applications of this approach are presently limited by the rate at which sequences can be analyzed. As a step toward overcoming this limitation, we have investigated the use of photolithography chip technology to perform sequence analyses on amplified small-subunit rRNA genes. The GeneChip (Affymetrix Corporation) contained 31,179 20-mer oligonucleotides that were complementary to a subalignment of sequences in the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) (B. L. Maidak et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 29:173-174, 2001). The chip and standard Affymetrix software were able to correctly match small-subunit ribosomal DNA amplicons with the corresponding sequences in the RDP database for 15 of 17 bacterial species grown in pure culture. When bacteria collected from an air sample were tested, the method compared favorably with cloning and sequencing amplicons in determining the presence of phylogenetic groups. However, the method could not resolve the individual sequences comprising a complex mixed sample. Given these results and the potential for future enhancement of this technology, it may become widely useful.

TI  - Interaction of the Rho-ADP-ribosylating C3 exoenzyme with RalA.
AB  - RhoA, -B, and -C are ADP-ribosylated and biologically inactivated by Clostridium  botulinum C3 exoenzyme and related C3-like transferases. We report that RalA GTPase, which is not ADP-ribosylated by C3, inhibits ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by C3 from C. botulinum (C3bot), Clostridium limosum (C3lim), and Bacillus cereus (C3cer) but not from Staphylococcus aureus (C3stau) in human platelet membranes and rat brain lysate. Inhibition by RalA occurs with the GDP- and guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-bound forms of RalA and is overcome by increasing concentrations of C3. A direct interaction of RalA with C3 was verified by precipitation of the transferase with GST-RalA-Sepharose. The affinity constant (K(d)) of the binding of RalA to C3lim was 12 nm as determined by fluorescence titration. RalA increased the NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot by about 5-fold. Although RalA had no effect on glucosylation of Rho GTPases by Clostridium difficile toxin B, C3bot and C3lim inhibited glucosylation of RalA by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin. Furthermore, C3bot decreased activation of phospholipase D by RalA. The data indicate that several C3 exoenzymes directly interact with RalA without ADP-ribosylating the GTPase. The interaction is of high affinity and interferes with essential functions of C3 and RalA.
TI  - Marketing hand hygiene in hospitals--a case study.
AB  - Hand hygiene of healthcare workers is frequently poor despite the efforts of infection control teams to promote hand decontamination as the most important method to prevent transmission of hospital-acquired infections. In this case study, we describe how principles of societal marketing were applied to improve hand hygiene. Pre-marketing analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to implementation; attention to product, price, promotion and placement; and post-marketing 'customer' surveys were the essential components of the marketing strategy and its implementation. Placement of an alcohol-based gel decontaminant (Spirigel) at the bedside of every patient was widely welcomed in the hospital, and has played a major role in improving hand hygiene of healthcare workers. In the twelve months following the implementation, the decontaminant was used at least 440,000 times. The cost of purchasing the decontaminant was approximately 5000 pounds sterling. Following the introduction of Spirigel, there was a consistent reduction in the proportion of hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in each of the quarters of 2000-2001 compared with 1999-2000. In the period 1999-2000, nearly 50% of the MRSA were hospital acquired compared with 39% in 2000-2001. Similarly, the average incidence of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) decreased in each of the quarters in 2000-2001 following the introduction of Spirigel. During this period, there was an average incidence of 9.5 cases of CDAD/1000 admissions compared with 11.5 cases of CDAD/1000 admissions in 1999-2000. This represents a 17.4% reduction in the incidence of CDAD. However, this reduction was not statistically significant (P=0.2). Our case study demonstrates that principles of societal marketing methods can be used effectively to promote and sustain hand hygiene in hospitals. Improvement in hand hygiene will lead to considerable reduction in hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Impact of quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP59500) on the faecal microflora in healthy volunteers.
AB  - The effect of 5 days' administration of quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP59500) on the faecal microflora was evaluated in healthy volunteers. Twenty healthy volunteers received 7.5 mg/kg of quinupristin/dalfopristin infused over 1 h twice daily for 5 days and four received a matched placebo. Faecal samples were collected before, during and after treatment (days -1/-2, 6, 8, 14/15, 35 +/- 2, 60 +/- 4, 90 +/- 4). In the treated volunteers, anaerobes, including sporulating and Gram-negative bacteria, decreased slightly during treatment, whereas numbers of enterococci and Enterobacteriaceae increased significantly (P < 0.01). Counts of anaerobes and enterococci resistant to erythromycin or to quinupristin/dalfopristin increased significantly (P < 0.01) during treatment and returned slowly to their baseline levels after the end of treatment. Mean faecal antibiotic concentrations reached 291 +/- 184 and 42 +/- 22 microg/g of faeces for quinupristin and dalfopristin, respectively, by the fifth day of treatment. Counts of yeasts were not influenced significantly by the treatment. No emergence of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Clostridium difficile was observed. No episode of diarrhoea was reported. In conclusion, quinupristin/dalfopristin administration was associated with a temporary shift towards resistance of the endogenous flora and a temporary increase in counts of enterobacteria and enterococci. However, no decrease in colonization resistance towards exogenous potentially pathogenic bacteria was observed and the observed modifications disappeared within 12 weeks after the end of quinupristin/dalfopristin administration.
TI  - Human infections caused by glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus spp: are they a zoonosis?
AB  - Following the detection of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) in 1986 and their subsequent global dissemination during the 1990s, many studies have attempted to identify the reservoirs and lines of resistance transmission as a basis for intervention. The eradication of reservoirs and the prevention of GRE spread is of major importance for two reasons: (i) the emergence of high-level glycopeptide resistance in invasive enterococcal clinical isolates that are already multiresistant, has left clinicians with therapeutic options that are only at the experimental stage; and (ii) the resistance genes may spread to more virulent bacterial species such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Clostridium difficile. VanA-type strains, resistant to high levels of both vancomycin and teicoplanin, are the most commonly encountered enterococci with acquired glycopeptide resistance in humans. A widespread VanA-type GRE reservoir was detected early in farm animals that were exposed to the glycopeptide growth-promoter avoparcin. Numerous studies have provided indirect evidence for the transfer of VanA-type GRE and their resistance determinants from animal reservoirs to humans. The data collected have expanded our understanding of the promiscuous nature of antibiotic resistance, and have provided the groundwork for logical decision-making with the objective of deterring the dissemination of resistant bacteria and of their resistance genes.
TI  - The problem with cephalosporins.
AB  - The cephalosporin antibiotics have become a major part of the antibiotic formulary for hospitals in affluent countries. They are prescribed for a wide variety of infections every day. Their undoubted popularity relies upon lesser allergenic and toxicity risks as well as a broad spectrum of activity. It is the latter feature, however, that encourages the selection of microorganisms that are resistant to these agents. There are long-term implications for the treatment and control of this heterogeneous group of superinfections. When clinicians evaluate a septic patient, it is understandable that they choose empirical therapy with a cephalosporin whilst awaiting microbiology and other tests, since bacterial identification and antimicrobial testing still usually require 24-48 h. The broad-spectrum capability of these drugs, however, encourages rapid overgrowth of some microorganisms that are neither eliminated nor inhibited by therapy. These organisms not only have pathogenic potential, they may also be multiply resistant to antibiotics. This review discusses the evidence that cephalosporin usage is the most important factor in the selection and propagation of microorganisms such as Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, multiply resistant coliforms and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, the continuing increase of which threatens the future of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  - Evidence for holin function of tcdE gene in the pathogenicity of Clostridium difficile.
AB  - Toxigenic strains of Clostridium difficile produce two large bacterial toxins called toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB). tcdA and tcdB genes are located on the pathogenicity locus of C. difficile, a unique characteristic of toxigenic strains of this species. Intergenic to the two toxin genes is tcdE, a small 501-bp open reading frame of unknown function. Expression of the tcdE gene in Escherichia coli caused bacterial cell death. Computational analysis of the amino acid sequence of TcdE revealed structural features that are strikingly similar to a class of bacteriophage proteins called holins. Holins are cytolytic proteins that cause lysis of bacterial hosts to effect the release of progeny phages. Further analysis of the recombinant clone expressing TcdE by transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the site of action of TcdE is on the bacterial cell membrane. The results provide evidence that TcdE is structurally and functionally similar to holin proteins. TcdE may function as a lytic protein to facilitate the release of TcdA and TcdB to the extracellular environment, as these toxins lack signal peptide.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of uniforms.
AB  - Microbiological sampling of nurses' uniforms was undertaken using a Casella slit  sampler. Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were detected on uniforms both before and after a span of duty. Recommendations for provision and changing of nurses' uniforms are made.
TI  - Intestinal epithelial damage in sids babies and its similarity to that caused by  bacterial toxins in the rabbit.
AB  - Sections of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and large intestine from 14 sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) babies were examined by scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The type and amount of damage was characterised and quantitated and compared with the presence of Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in faecal samples from the babies and toxins from the bacteria in faecal samples and serum from the babies. The data were compared with the damage that these toxins cause to the rabbit intestinal epithelium (see the previous paper in this issue). Damage was present in most of the SIDS samples, varying from 0 to 96%, and most damage occurred when the faecal samples contained the above bacteria and their toxins. Damage varied from removal of microvilli, damage to villus tips, separation of and removal of epithelial cells from the lamina propria, and removal of enterocytes leaving goblet and tuft cells, to damage and breakdown of the lamina propria. The results support the hypothesis that the cause of death in a significant proportion of SIDS babies may result from the absorption of toxins from the intestinal tract initiating a toxic shock reaction.
TI  - The effect of bacterial enterotoxins implicated in SIDS on the rabbit intestine.
AB  - The aim of this project was to characterise the type of damage caused to the intestine of the infant rabbit by bacterial enterotoxins implicated in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Samples of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and large intestine exposed to the toxins for up to 6 hours were examined by scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The damage was quantitatively assessed (% villi damaged) by SEM and qualitatively by SEM and TEM. Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin, staphylococcal enterotoxin B and Clostridium difficile toxin A + toxin B combined all caused severe damage to the villi in the small intestine (80-90% damage). Clostridium difficile toxin B caused only slight damage (17% to the jejunum, 26% to the caecum). Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin caused moderate damage to the small intestine (duodenum 34%, caecum 35%), and Escherichia coli STa caused significant damage to the small (53-70%) and large intestine (51%). The level of toxin damage increased with time, the small intestine being more susceptible generally to damage than the large intestine. Each toxin differed in its ability to damage the villi, microvilli, enterocytes and lamina propria.
TI  - Linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. It has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroidesfragilis. In controlled phase III studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. Further phase III studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (SSTIs). In these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments, including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated SSTIs. Oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated SSTIs or community-acquired pneumonia. Linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. The most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of S. aureus (including GISA), Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis (including VRE). In controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. As the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among S. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
TI  - Five-year surveillance of patients with communicable diseases nursed in isolation.
AB  - During a five year surveillance program of patients with communicable diseases nursed in isolation, we gathered information on 2880 patients who were nursed in isolation for 28 145 days, from January 1994 to December 1998. The mean number of patients nursed in isolation was 575.4 (range, 427-709) per year. On average 2.4% of patients admitted yearly to the University Medical Center (UMC) were nursed in isolation. The mean number of days nursed in isolation was 9.8 days per patient.1996 was a peak year in isolations due to outbreaks of gentamicin-resistant enterobacteriaceae (GRB) and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The main reasons for requiring isolation were: GRB, MRSA (proven and suspected cases), Clostridium difficile, viral infections and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Registration of quantitative data on nursing patients in isolation, as presented in this paper, makes it possible to gain insight into the type and number of isolation indications, the required isolation room capacity on different wards, the workload of healthcare workers resulting from isolation and the trends in incidence of communicable diseases.
TI  - Clostridium difficile and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus: the new nosocomial alliance.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of the association between Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and delineate the role of C. difficile coinfection as a predictor of VRE infection versus colonization and adverse outcome. METHODS: Patients with both C. difficile colitis and VRE (CD/VRE) were compared to patients with VRE alone with regard to demographics, comorbidity, prior antibiotic therapy, and coinfection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and funguria. C. difficile as a predictor of VRE infection (VRE-I) versus colonization (VRE-C) and adverse outcome was also studied. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients with VRE infection or colonization were studied. This included 31 cases of VRE-I and 58 VRE-C. C. difficile was isolated in 17 (19.1%) of patients; of these C. difficile was isolated before VRE in 9 patients and after VRE in 8. The two groups did not differ in age, residence, or comorbidity. C. difficile coinfection was not predictive of VRE-I versus VRE-C, nor was it associated with increased length of stay or mortality. However, the mortality rates in both groups was high, around 30%. A significant association was noted between the use of vancomycin and metronidazole (before the isolation of VRE) and C. difficile coinfection (p = 0.03 and p = 0.001, respectively). A high incidence of nosocomial coinfection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, funguria, and gram-negative sepsis was noted in both groups; the association with funguria was statistically significant (p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, C. difficile coinfection is common in patients with VRE infection or colonization and is significantly associated with other nosocomial dilemmas like funguria. This may result in the emergence of highly virulent pathogens including vancomycin-resistant C. difficile, posing new challenges in the management of nosocomial diarrheas.
TI  - Bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. The aim of this study was to examine if bifidobacteria, a major species of the human colonic microflora, participates in the barrier effect by developing antimicrobial activity against enterovirulent bacteria. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was examined in vitro against a wide range of Gram negative and Gram positive pathogens. Inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium SL1334 cell association and cell invasion was investigated in vitro using Caco-2 cells. Colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract in vivo by bifidobacteria was examined in axenic C3/He/Oujco mice. Antimicrobial activity was examined in vivo in axenic C3/He/Oujco mice infected by the lethal S typhimurium C5 strain. RESULTS: Fourteen human bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant stools were examined for antimicrobial activity. Two strains (CA1 and F9) expressed antagonistic activity against pathogens in vitro, inhibited cell entry, and killed intracellular S typhimurium SL1344 in Caco-2 cells. An antibacterial component(s) produced by CA1 and F9 was found to be a lipophilic molecule(s) with a molecular weight of less than 3500. In the axenic C3/He/Oujco mice, CA1 and F9 strains colonised the intestinal tract and protected mice against S typhimurium C5 lethal infection. CONCLUSION: Several bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity, suggesting that they could participate in the "barrier effect" produced by the indigenous microflora.
TI  - Hospital-acquired infections among chronic hemodialysis patients.
AB  - The epidemiological characteristics of nosocomial infections among patients requiring chronic hemodialysis, a high-risk and rapidly growing population, have not been fully elucidated. During a 30-month cohort study, rates of bloodstream infections (BSIs), urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia, and diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile and the distribution of pathogens among hospitalized chronic hemodialysis patients were compared with hospitalized patients not requiring chronic hemodialysis. To identify risk factors for developing a nosocomial infection among chronic hemodialysis patients, a matched case-control study was performed. A total of 1,557 nosocomial infections were detected during 1,317 of 68,361 admissions (2%). Of these, 47 nosocomial infections occurred in chronic hemodialysis patients during 31 of 578 admissions (5%). Nosocomial infections were significantly more frequent among the chronic hemodialysis group (9.1/1,000 patient-days) compared with the non-chronic hemodialysis group (3. 8/1,000 patient-days; relative risk [RR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 3.2; P < 0.001). UTIs were the most common nosocomial infections among chronic hemodialysis patients, accounting for 47% of all infections in this population. UTIs were significantly more common among chronic hemodialysis patients (4.2/1, 000 patient-days) compared with non-chronic hemodialysis patients (0.7/1,000 patient-days; RR, 6.2; 95% CI, 3.8 to 9.5; P < 0.001). Among chronic hemodialysis patients, Candida spp and enterococci were the most common pathogens in contrast to coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus among patients not requiring hemodialysis. Using conditional logistic regression, a greater index of comorbidity was significantly associated with nosocomial infections among the chronic hemodialysis population (odds ratio, 3. 6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 10.7; P = 0.02). Chronic hemodialysis patients are at a substantially greater risk for developing a nosocomial infection compared with other hospitalized patients.
TI  - pH-induced conformational changes in Clostridium difficile toxin B.
AB  - Toxin B from Clostridium difficile is a monoglucosylating toxin that targets substrates within the cytosol of mammalian cells. In this study, we investigated the impact of acidic pH on cytosolic entry and structural changes within toxin B. Bafilomycin A1 was used to block endosomal acidification and subsequent toxin B translocation. Cytopathic effects could be completely blocked by addition of bafilomycin A1 up to 20 min following toxin treatment. Furthermore, providing a low extracellular pH could circumvent the effect of bafilomycin A1 and other lysosomotropic agents. Acid pH-induced structural changes were monitored by using the fluorescent probe 2-(p-toluidinyl) naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid, sodium salt (TNS), inherent tryptophan fluorescence, and relative susceptibility to a specific protease. As the toxin was exposed to lower pH there was an increase in TNS fluorescence, suggesting the exposure of hydrophobic domains by toxin B. The change in hydrophobicity appeared to be reversible, since returning the pH to neutrality abrogated TNS fluorescence. Furthermore, tryptophan fluorescence was quenched at the acidic pH, indicating that domains may have been moving into more aqueous environments. Toxin B also demonstrated variable susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease at neutral and acidic pH, further suggesting pH-induced structural changes in this protein.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin MIC90s, < or =1 mg/L, except 4 mg/L against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium). Gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s, 0.06-0.5 mg/L against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/L against Proteus/Morganella spp.). Relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against Providencia spp., and had good potency against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90s, 0.25-1 mg/L). Gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding MIC90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/L for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. The three quinolones were equipotent against Burkholderia cepacia (MIC90s, 8 mg/L), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 4 mg/L). Gatifloxacin was highly potent (MIC90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/L) against Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella spp., Helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin MIC90s, 0.13 mg/L). The higher quinolone MICs for ureaplasma (MIC90s, 4-8 mg/L) may be due to the acidic pH of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. Like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.25 mg/L). Of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. In summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.
TI  - Epidemiology of nosocomial infection and resistant organisms in patients admitted for the first time to an acute rehabilitation unit.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to define the epidemiology of nosocomial bacterial colonization and infection and to define predictors of nosocomial infection among a cohort (n=423) of admissions to an acute rehabilitation unit. Overall, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci were the most commonly identified colonizing organisms. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most commonly identified colonizing gram-negative bacilli. During 70 (16.5%) of the 423 hospitalizations in the unit, 94 nosocomial infections occurred. The most common infections were those of the urinary tract (30% of 94 infections) or a surgical site (17%), Clostridium difficile diarrhea (15%), and bloodstream infection (12.8%). Antibiotic-resistant bacteria most commonly caused bloodstream infection (41.7%) and surgical site infection (56.3%). Independent predictors of nosocomial infection at the time of admission were functional status (measured with the functional independence measure), APACHE III score, and spinal cord injury. In conclusion, gram-positive organisms were the predominant strains causing nosocomial colonization and infection. The logistic model, if verified, may be useful in defining patients who should be targeted for measures to prevent nosocomial infection.
TI  - In vitro activities of novel trans-3,5-disubstituted pyrrolidinylthio-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the novel 1beta-methylcarbapenems J-111, 225, J-114,870, and J-114,871, which have a structurally unique side chain that consists of a trans-3,5-disubstituted 5-arylpyrrolidin-3-ylthio moiety at the C-2 position, were compared with those of reference antibiotics. Among isolates of both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), 90% were inhibited by J-111,347 (prototype), J-111,225, J-114,870, and J-114,871 at concentrations of 2, 4, 4, and 4 microgram/ml (MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC(90)s]), respectively, indicating that these agents were 32- to 64-fold more potent than imipenem, which has an MIC(90) of 128 microgram/ml. Although these drugs were less active in vitro than vancomycin, which had MIC(90)s of 1 and 2 microgram/ml for MRSA and MRCoNS, respectively, the new carbapenems displayed better killing kinetics than vancomycin. The potent anti-MRSA activity was ascribed to the excellent affinities of the new carbapenems for penicillin-binding protein 2a of MRSA. Since the new carbapenems also exhibited good activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria including clinically important pathogens such as penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Clostridium difficile, as well as MRSA, the novel carbapenems are worthy of further evaluation.
TI  - An audit of the use of manual handling equipment and their microbiological flora--implications for infection control.
AB  - A review of the use of manual handling aids in two hospitals found equipment was  employed on a multi-patient basis with inadequate cleaning. Sampling with a Casella slit sampler demonstrated frequent contamination by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile of fabric aids. Recommendations for care of equipment are made.
TI  - Bacterial resistance to disinfectants: present knowledge and future problems.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a long-established, widely-studied problem. Increasingly, attention is being directed to the responses of various types of microbes to biocides (antiseptics, disinfectants and preservatives). Different groups of bacteria vary in their susceptibility to biocides, with bacterial spores being the most resistant, followed by mycobacteria, then Gram-negative organisms, with cocci generally being the most sensitive. There are wide divergencies within this general classification. Thus, (i) spores of Bacillus subtilis are less susceptible to biocides than those of Clostridium difficile: (ii) Mycobacterium chelonae strains may show high resistance to glutaraldehyde and M. avium intracellulare is generally less sensitive than M. tuberculosis; (iii) Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia spp and Proteus spp may be difficult to inactivate; (iv) enterococci are less sensitive than staphylococci to biocides and antibiotic-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus might show low-level biocide resistance. The mechanisms involved in biocide resistance to biocides are becoming better understood. Intrinsic resistance (intrinsic insusceptibility) is found with bacterial spores, mycobacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. This resistance might, in some instances, be associated with constitutive degradative enzymes but in reality is more closely linked to cellular impermeability. The coats(s) and, to some extent, the cortex in spores, the arabinogalactan and possibly other components of the mycobacterial cell wall and the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria limit the concentration of active biocide that can reach the target site(s) in these bacterial cells. A special situation is found with bacteria present in biofilms, which can be considered as being an intrinsic resistance mechanism resulting from physiological (phenotypic) adaptation of cells. Acquired resistance to biocides may arise by cellular mutation or by the acquisition of genetic elements. Plasmid/transposon-mediated resistance to inorganic and organic mercury compounds by hydrolases and reductases has been extensively studied. Plasmid-mediated resistance to some other biocides in Gram-negative bacteria and in staphylococci has been described, but its significance remains uncertain. As to the future, there is a need to establish conclusively whether there is a clear-cut linkage between antibiotic and biocide resistance in non-sporulating bacteria and whether biocides can select for antibiotic resistance. Additionally, the responses to biocides of new and emerging pathogens must be assessed. At the same time, continuing research is necessary to establish further the underlying mechanisms of resistance and to provide more efficient means of bacterial inactivation.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections].
AB  - GLYCOPEPTIDE RESISTANCE: Resistance to glycopeptides raises many therapeutic problems when it occurs in strains such as enterococci or staphylococci causing clinical infections. Two observations described here exemplify the emergence of such resistance in a metacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain during vancomycin treatment and in a Clostridium difficile strain. NASAL MRSA IN HOSPITAL PERSONNEL: Nasal cavities of hospital personnel is a not well recognized reservoir of MRSA. A survey conducted in a Parisian hospital evidenced problems of personnel-patient transmission. MRSA were found in 6% of the hospital personnel samples.
TI  - Predominant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from antibiotic-associated diarrhea is clinically relevant and produces enterotoxin A and the bicomponent toxin LukE-lukD.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus was isolated as the predominant or only isolate from cultures of stools of 60 patients over 2 years in a university hospital, leading to the collection of 114 isolates. Diarrhea was observed in 90% of the patients. Ninety-eight percent of the patients had received antibiotics in the month before the diarrhea. Ninety-two percent of the S. aureus isolates were methicillin resistant. S. aureus was encountered with antibiotic-associated diarrhea among 47 quite elderly patients affected or not affected by a gastrointestinal disease. Among the antimicrobial treatments, cessation of the previous therapy when possible or rapid application of oral vancomycin therapy was the most appropriate. Analysis of total DNA by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed 27 different SmaI pulsotypes distributed in 15 clusters. The pulsotypes never differed for related isolates from a single patient, even if they originated from patients with bacteremia. S. aureus was not isolated as the predominant isolate in cultures of stools of 57 patients who received an antimicrobial treatment for more than 5 days without diarrhea. Occurence of production of both enterotoxin A and the bicomponent leucotoxin LukE-LukD by the S. aureus isolates was significantly different from that by random isolates. The results strongly suggest that when predominant in stool samples, S. aureus should be considered a possible etiologic agent for some cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
TI  - IL-15 is elevated in the patients of postoperative enterocolitis.
AB  - Serum interleukin 15 (IL-15) levels were measured in 77 patients who were consecutively admitted to our intensive care unit. Postoperative enterocolitis occurred in four patients and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but not Clostridium difficile, was identified in the faecal specimens from these patients. The IL-15 levels in the patients with MRSA enterocolitis were significantly elevated compared with those of other MRSA infections without enterocolitis including pneumonia (n=6) and cholangitis (n=1), and other MRSA non-colonized patients (n=66) (21.2+/-5.2 pg/ml vs 4.3+/-0.2, 4.3+/-0.5). Notably, an increase in serum IL-15 was observed just before clinical manifestation of severe diarrhoea. Our findings suggest that IL-15 may be associated in the pathogenesis of postoperative enterocolitis and its serum level may be a severity indicator of the disease.
TI  - Prophylactic Lactobacillus GG reduces antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children  with respiratory infections: a randomized study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial treatment may disturb the colonization resistance of gastrointestinal microflora, which may induce clinical symptoms, most commonly diarrhea. The severity of antibiotic-associated diarrhea may range from a brief, self-limiting disease to devastating diarrhea with electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, crampy abdominal pain, pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, or even death. The incidence of diarrhea in children receiving a single antimicrobial treatment is unclear. In addition to more critical use of antimicrobials, adjunctive preventive measures to antibiotic-associated diarrhea are needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of diarrhea after antimicrobial treatment in children with no history of antimicrobial use during the previous 3 months. Another aim of this study was to assess the preventive potential of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (Lactobacillus GG; American Type Culture Collection 53103), a probiotic strain with a documented safety record and a therapeutic effect in viral gastroenteritis on antibiotic-associated diarrhea. METHODS: Oral antimicrobial agents were prescribed for the treatment of acute respiratory infections at the clinics of the Health Care Center of the City of Tampere or Tampere University Hospital, Finland, to 167 patients who were invited to participate in the study. Of the patients, 48 were lost to follow-up; therefore, the final study population consisted of 119 children from 2 weeks to 12. 8 years of age (mean: 4.5 years). All study subjects met the inclusion criteria: they had not received any antimicrobial medication during the previous 3 months, they did not suffer from gastrointestinal disorders, and they did not need intravenous antimicrobial treatment. The patients were randomized to receive placebo or 2 x 10(10) colony-forming units of Lactobacillus GG in capsules given twice daily during the antimicrobial treatment. Lactobacillus GG and placebo capsules were indistinguishable in appearance and taste. The parents kept a daily symptom diary and recorded stool frequency and consistency at home for 3 months. Diarrhea was defined as at least three watery or loose stools per day for a minimum of 2 consecutive days. In the case of diarrhea, viral (adenovirus, rotavirus, calicivirus and astrovirus) and bacterial (Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, Staphylococcus aureus, and yeasts) analyses were studied in fecal samples. The metabolic activity of the gut microflora was assessed by analysis of fecal urease, beta-glucosidase, and beta-glucuronidase activities. The primary outcome measure was diarrhea during the first 2 weeks after the beginning of the antimicrobial treatment, because this period most likely reflects the effects of antimicrobial use. Secondary outcome measures were the activities of fecal urease, beta-glucuronidase, and beta-glucosidase. RESULTS: On the entire follow-up, 80% of any gastrointestinal symptoms were reported during the first 2 weeks after the beginning of the antimicrobial treatment. The incidence of diarrhea was 5% in the Lactobacillus GG group and 16% in the placebo group within 2 weeks of antimicrobial therapy (chi(2) = 3.82). The treatment effect (95% confidence interval) of Lactobacillus GG was -11% (-21%-0%). In diarrheal episodes, the viral and bacterial analyses were positive for Clostridium difficile in 2 cases and for Norwalk-like calicivirus in 3 cases. The age of the patients with diarrhea was between 3 months and 5 years in 75% of cases in both groups. The severity of diarrhea was comparable in the study groups, as evidenced by similar stool frequency (mean: 5 per day; range: 3-6) and the duration of diarrhea (mean: 4 days; range: 2-8). The activities of fecal urease and beta-glucuronidase, but not beta-glucosidase, changed significantly after the beginning of the antimicrobial treatment in the Lactobacillus GG group and in the placebo group alike.

TI  - Infection control. Dazed and confused.
AB  - This research project aims to uncover the practical concerns of health care staff on a hospital ward while attempting to implement isolation precaution guidelines for patients with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The project is still in progress so this article describes the research methods used and some preliminary findings.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. T-3811, a free base of T-3811ME, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In particular, T-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. T-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). T-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with GyrA and ParC (GrlA) mutations. The activity of T-3811 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. In common with other fluoroquinolones, T-3811 was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella sp., with MIC90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. T-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. T-3811 was the most active agent against C. trachomatis (MIC, 0.008 microgram/ml) and M. pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). The activity of T-3811 against M. tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. In experimental systemic infection with a GrlA mutant of S. aureus and experimental pneumonia with PRSP in mice, T-3811ME showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.
TI  - Monocytic cell necrosis is mediated by potassium depletion and caspase-like proteases.
AB  - Apoptosis is a physiological cell death that culminates in mitochondrial permeability transition and the activation of caspases, a family of cysteine proteases. Necrosis, in contrast, is a pathological cell death characterized by swelling of the cytoplasm and mitochondria and rapid plasma membrane disruption. Necrotic cell death has long been opposed to apoptosis, but it now appears that both pathways involve mitochondrial permeability transition, raising the question of what mediates necrotic cell death. In this study, we investigated mechanisms that promote necrosis induced by various stimuli (Clostridium difficile toxins, Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin, ouabain, nigericin) in THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, and in monocytes. All stimuli induced typical features of necrosis and triggered protease-mediated release of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and CD14 in both cell types. K+ depletion was actively implicated in necrosis because substituting K+ for Na+ in the extracellular medium prevented morphological features of necrosis and IL-1beta release. N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, prevented morphological features of necrosis, plasma membrane destruction, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, IL-1beta release, and CD14 shedding induced by all stimuli. Thus, in monocytic cells, necrosis is a cell death pathway mediated by passive K+ efflux and activation of caspase-like proteases.
TI  - Regulation of phospholipase D activity in synaptosomes permeabilized with Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin.
AB  - In order to investigate the regulation of presynaptic phospholipase D (PLD) activity by calcium and G proteins, we established a permeabilization procedure for rat cortical synaptosomes using Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin (30-100 microg/ml). In permeabilized synaptosomes, PLD activity was significantly stimulated when the concentration of free calcium was increased from 0.1 microM to 1 microM. This activation was inhibited in the presence of KN-62 (1 microM), an inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), but not by the protein kinase C inhibitor, Ro 31-8220 (1-10 microM). Synaptosomal PLD activity was also stimulated in the presence of 1 microM GTPgammaS. When Rho proteins were inhibited by pretreatment of the synaptosomes with Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB; 1-10 ng/ml), the effect of GTPgammaS was significantly reduced; in contrast, brefeldin A (10-100 microM), an inhibitor of ARF activation, was ineffective. Calcium stimulation of PLD was inhibited by TcdB, but GTPgammaS-dependent activation was insensitive to KN-62. We conclude that synaptosomal PLD is activated in a pathway which sequentially involves CaMKII and Rho proteins.
TI  - Mechanisms and management of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  - Only 10%-20% of all cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) are caused by infection with Clostridium difficile. Other infectious organisms causing AAD include Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Candida species, and Salmonella species. Most of the clinically mild AAD cases are due to functional disturbances of intestinal carbohydrate or bile acid metabolism, to allergic and toxic effects of antibiotics on intestinal mucosa, or to pharmacological effects on motility. Saccharomyces boulardii and Enterococcus SF68 can reduce the risk of developing AAD. Patients receiving antibiotic treatment should avoid food containing high amounts of poorly absorbable carbohydrates. Mild cases of AAD that may or may not be caused by C. difficile can be resolved by discontinuation of antibiotic therapy and by dietary carbohydrate reduction. Only severe AAD caused by C. difficile requires specific antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Enterococci and vancomycin resistance.
AB  - The frequency of infections with multiply antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria is increasing, and in some cases these organisms remain susceptible only to the glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin. The appearance of transferable high-level glycopeptide resistance in enterococci--producing some strains that are now resistant to all available antibiotics--is thus a cause for concern. The enterococci readily colonize the bowel, spread rapidly among hospital patients, and transfer their antibiotic resistances widely among themselves and other gram-positive species. Glycopeptide resistance has not yet transferred in vivo to other significant pathogens, but experimental transfer to Staphylococcus aureus has been achieved in vitro. The emergence of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci has been encouraged by the increasing use of aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, and quinolones for the treatment of infections due to gram-negative bacteria and glycopeptides for infections due to staphylococci and clostridium difficile. In Europe this antibiotic pressure has been aggravated by the use of the glycopeptide avoparcin in animal feeds. The enterococci may now be poised to disseminate glycopeptide resistance among other more pathogenic gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. Besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sp., Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus D. L. acidophilus LF221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin LF221 A and acidocin LF221 B, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase FPLC. The antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase K) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-Da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide A and 35 of peptide B were determined. Among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. No significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin LF221 A and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology was found between acidocin LF221 B and brevicin 27. L. acidophilus LF221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.
TI  - Clinical significance of alimentary tract microbes in bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  - A prospective study on the microbes isolated from the alimentary tract in 120 bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients (1991-1993) was undertaken to define the spectrum of organisms isolated under antimicrobial prophylaxis, their temporal sequence of emergence, and the associated morbidity and mortality. Clostridium difficile (n = 20), isolated in the pre-engraftment and early post-engraftment periods (day 2-45 post-BMT), was the most common microbe recovered from stool of patients with diarrhea. In contrast to previous reports, no significant difference in mortality was observed between patients with and without C. difficile isolated in stool. Two patients had neutropenic ileocecitis with concomitant bacteremia due to Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. One patient was found to have astrovirus gastroenteritis (day 7), and Giardia lamblia was recovered from the stool of another (day -7). Heavy growth of Staphylococcus aureus from direct smear-positive specimens was found from the upper airway of two patients with severe mucositis and complete dysphagia (day 12 and 23). Salmonella spp. of groups B and E were found in the stool of five asymptomatic patients at the time of conditioning. No specific organisms was recovered from the endoscopic brushing of two patients with lower end esophagitis, three patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and three patients with perirectal cellulitis. During the post-engraftment period, five patients had documented cytomegalovirus gastroenterocolitis (days 34-97), one had Mycobacterium chelonae colitis (day 70), and another had nodular gastritis due to Acremonium falciforme (day 270). Overall, only 28% of patients with alimentary tract symptoms/syndrome had specific pathogens isolated from clinical specimens. Differentiation of the causation of alimentary tract symptoms was often difficult because noninfectious complications such as conditioning toxicity, graft-versus-host disease, and its treatment often caused alimentary tract symptoms in addition to predisposed BMT patient to infection. The reluctance of obtaining tissue biopsy for ascertaining the importance of those potential alimentary tract pathogens often dictate the use of empirical treatment.
TI  - [Method of quantitative assessment of antimicrobial effects of iodine-containing  preparations].
AB  - Iodine-containing preparations were studied by UV spectral analysis. Water-soluble composition of 1,3-diethylbenzimidasolium triiodide is inactivated in the presence of meat-peptone broth. Dissolving of these preparations in a mixture of acetone and stearic acid does not change the physicochemical properties or impair the antibacterial effect. A high antibacterial effect of 12 iodine-containing compounds has been demonstrated: 15-min exposure suppressed the growth of bacteria at the minimal concentration of 0.1-1.0 microgram/ml.
TI  - [Genotyping of isolates of bacteria and Candida].
AB  - Strain differentiation of Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, and Candida species was performed by restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) of genomic DNA with HinfI or HaeIII followed by conventional agarose gel electrophoresis. REA of 19 methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates and 19 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates revealed 8, and 14 patterns, respectively. Fifty-three isolates of S. epidermidis were divided into 39 groups on the basis of REA pattern. REA patterns obtained from different strains of the same species were more similar than those from different Staphylococcus species. A total of 67 patterns were noted among 215 S. pneumoniae isolates. There was some correlation between the REA patterns and serotypes. In addition, all 61 isolates showing the pattern 6 (serotype 19) were penicillin-resistant. Sixteen isolates of E. coli O157 and 18 isolates of E. coli O25 were analyzed by REA with HaeIII. Among 14 epidemiologically unrelated E. coli O157:H7 isolates, REA patterns were either identical or differed only by a few fragment bands. REA patterns of 7 isolates of heat stable enterotoxin producing E. coli O25 from an outbreak were identical. Eight distinct REA patterns were noted among 7 toxigenic C. difficile strains, and one to two strains were included in each group. Candida strains belonging to different six Candida species were analysed by REA. All C. albicans isolates (148 strains) showed one to four bright bands ranging from 4 to 8kb in size, and these strains were divided into 37 groups according to the REA patterns. Each Candida strain showed species-specific REA patterns. Twenty-one isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex were analyzed by PCR with primer complementary to the inverted repeat of IS6110(IS6110-PCR). The results of PCR of 19 M. tuberculosis isolates and 2 M. bovis BCG isolates revealed 15 patterns, and 1 pattern, respectively. Our results demonstrated that REA of genomic DNA with HinfI or HaeIII was a useful tool for strain differentiation. By comparing the species-specific REA patterns of reference strains, clinical isolates of Candida and Staphylococci could be identified to the species level if they could not be identified by routine biochemical methods. Because IS6110-PCR is simple and rapid to perform, it seems to be a good screening method to differentiate M. tuberculosis strains.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in a long-term care facility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiology and natural history of colonization with  vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) in a long-term care facility. DESIGN: All patients in whom VREF was isolated were followed prospectively, with rectal swab cultures at 2-week intervals, until discharge, death, or clearance of VREF. Clearance was defined as two consecutive negative cultures. In addition, three prevalence surveys were conducted of all patients in residence on one 34-bed intermediate care ward. SETTING: A 400-bed, long-term care Veterans Affairs facility. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six patients colonized with VREF. RESULTS: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was identified in 24 of the 36 patients at the time of transfer from an acute care facility. Seventeen patients had concomitant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and seven patients had a recent history of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. VREF in these patients persisted for a median of 67 days after identification. Treatment of VREF colonization with antimicrobials was associated with prolongation of colonization. Serial surveillance of the 34-bed ward found stable rates of colonization, with only three documented instances of VREF acquisition. During 2.5 years of surveillance for infection, a single case of bacteremia occurred in a patient in whom colonization with VREF could not be demonstrated by rectal swab culture. No infections occurred in patients colonized with VREF. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term care patients have protracted carriage of VREF. Most will improve over time; however, receipt of antimicrobial therapy is associated with prolongation of VREF carriage. The risk of VREF infection is low in this population. When there are appropriate contact precautions, patient to patient transmission occurs at a low rate. These observations can be used to design a practical infection control strategy for long-term care facilities.
TI  - Stool colonization of healthcare workers with selected resistant bacteria.
AB  - We examined the carriage of selected resistant bacteria in the stools of healthcare workers who provided direct patient care. Neither vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, nor Clostridium difficile was recovered from the 55 stool specimens collected. A ceftazidime-resistant Citrobacter freundii was isolated from one specimen. We conclude that the stool of healthcare workers is colonized infrequently with these resistant organisms.
TI  - Bacterial toxins block endothelial wound repair. Evidence that Rho GTPases control cytoskeletal rearrangements in migrating endothelial cells.
AB  - We investigated the effect of bacterial toxins that modify and inactivate Rho GTP-binding proteins on the migratory response of endothelial cells to wounding. C3-transferase from Clostridium botulinum, EDIN from Staphylococcus aureus, and toxin A from Clostridium difficile blocked migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in an in vitro wound repair assay. Migrating HUVECs expressed actin microspikes (maximum at 10 minutes after wounding), ruffles (maximum at 12 hours), and fibers (maximum at 24 hours), and within these actin structures, vinculin-containing focal complexes/adhesions were formed. C3-Transferase ADP ribosylated RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC in HUVECs and abolished the formation of actin stress fibers/focal adhesions but had no effect on expression of microspikes, ruffles, or the associated vinculin-containing focal complexes. Similar results were obtained with EDIN and toxin A. These results indicate that endothelial cells migrating into a wounded area express distinct combinations of actin/vinculin structures in a spatially and temporally coordinated manner. The GTPase Rho selectively controls the formation of actin fibers/focal adhesions that occurs 2 to 24 hours after wounding. A mechanism is proposed by which Rho-specific bacterial toxins could influence vascular repair, angiogenesis, or atherosclerosis.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BO-3482, a novel dithiocarbamate carbapenem with activity  against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - BO-3482, a dithiocarbamate carbapenem, inhibited clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) at 6.25 microg/ml (MIC at which 90% of isolates tested are inhibited [MIC90]), while the MIC90 of imipenem was > 100 microg/ml. BO-3482 was generally less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, enterococci, and gram-negative bacteria, although BO-3482 showed better activity (MIC90) than imipenem against Enterococcus faecium, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis, and Clostridium difficile. The affinities (50% inhibitory concentrations) of BO-3482 for penicillin-binding protein (PBP) PBP 2' of MRS and PBP 5 of E. faecium (both PBPs have low affinities for ordinary beta-lactam antibiotics) were 3.8 and 20 microg/ml, respectively, reflecting the greater activity of BO-3482 against MRS than against E. faecium.
TI  - Decrease in expenditures and selected nosocomial infections following implementation of an antimicrobial-prescribing improvement program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in antimicrobial use and expenditures and the rates of selected nosocomial infections due to resistant organisms associated with implementation of an antimicrobial-prescribing improvement program. DESIGN: Before-after trial comparing 1992 (pre-program), 1993 (a transition year), and 1994 (after full implementation of the program). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Academic medical center, all patients and physicians. INTERVENTION: An antimicrobial-prescribing improvement program with prior approval requirement for use of restricted agents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Antimicrobial use and expenditures, rates of selected nosocomial infection marker events. RESULTS: Between 1992 and 1994, there were substantial decreases in antimicrobial use, from 158,107 to 137,364 defined daily doses, and in expenditures from $2,486,902 ($24.01 per patient day) to $1,701,522 ($18.49 per patient day). After adjusting for changes in purchase prices and census days, we estimated savings attributable to the program of $279,573 in 1993 and $389,814 in 1994. In addition, we found significant decreases between 1992 and 1994 in the rates of enterococcal bacteremia (.34 vs .16 events per 1,000 patient days; P = .016), selected gram-negative bacteremia (.26 vs .11; P = .015), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization or infection (.66 vs .20; P < .0001), and Stenotrophomonas colonization or infection (.35 vs .17; P = .019). No significant change occurred in rates of nosocomial candidemia or Clostridium difficile toxin-positive diarrhea. Values for 1993 were intermediate between those of 1992 and 1994. CONCLUSION: Implementation of an antimicrobial-prescribing improvement program was associated with substantial savings in antimicrobial use and expenditures and significant decreases in rates of selected nosocomial infections due to resistant organisms.
TI  - Single-step polymerase chain reaction for combined gene detection and epidemiological typing in three bacterial models.
AB  - We describe a new polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for combined gene detection and epidemiological typing (COGEDET), which allows bacterial typing and gene detection in a one-step assay. This assay, in which target gene-specific primers are used under low-stringency annealing conditions, was evaluated on 32 Staphylococcus aureus strains using toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tst) primers, 30 Clostridium difficile strains using toxin A (toxA) primers, and 30 Escherichia coli strains using cytotoxic necrotizing factor (cnf) primers. Typing performances with COGEDET were compared to those of conventional random amplification polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and gene detection performances, to those of conventional PCR followed by Southern blot hybridization. Concordances between conventional PCR/Southern blot and COGEDET were 96.9, 100 and 96.7% for the detection of the tst, toxA and cnf genes, respectively. Discriminatory indexes for the conventional RAPD and COGEDET techniques were similar in the three bacterial species tested. These results show that the COGEDET assay can replace two separate assays for typing and genes detection respectively, thus saving both technicians' time and reagents.
TI  - The stethoscope. A potential source of nosocomial infection?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stethoscope diaphragms have been shown to harbor potentially pathogenic bacteria. OBJECTIVES: To assess bacterial contamination on the diaphragm and under the plastic rim that secures the diaphragm of stethoscopes of physicians, nurses, medical students, and house staff in an intensive care unit and a general medical ward of a large university hospital. Also to compare the effectiveness of various cleaning agents and assess the transmissibility of bacteria from contaminated stethoscopes to human skin. METHODS: Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures were performed on 40 randomly selected stethoscopes. We compared the effects of isopropyl alcohol, sodium hypochlorite (bleach), and benzalkonium chloride swabs, as well as soap and water, on reducing bacterial contamination on the stethoscope diaphragm and under the rim. The transmissibility of Micrococcus luteus inoculated onto a stethoscope diaphragm to clean human skin was also determined. RESULTS: Eleven genera and species of bacteria were isolated, with coagulase-negative staphylococcus present on 100% of stethoscopes and Staphylococcus aureus on 38%. Clostridium difficile was not isolated. The mean (+/-SE) number of total colony-forming units was 158 +/- 33 per diaphragm and 289 +/- 54 per rim. Physicians' stethoscope diaphragms had significantly more colony-forming units of coagulase-negative staphylococci than those of nurses: 163 +/- 44 vs 50 +/- 12, respectively (P = .02). The most effective cleaning agent was isopropyl alcohol after cleaning the diaphragm surface, the stethoscope diaphragms contained 0.2 +/- 0.2 colony-forming units and the rims contained 2.2 +/- 1.5 colony-forming units (P = .01). In addition, M luteus was transferred from inoculated stethoscopes to human skin. CONCLUSIONS: Most stethoscopes harbor potential pathogens but are not a source of C difficile. Physicians' stethoscopes generally had a higher bacterial load than nurses' stethoscopes. Isopropyl alcohol is an effective cleaning agent when applied to the stethoscope diaphragm. Stethoscopes transfer M luteus to human skin, making it likely that other bacteria can be transferred as well.
TI  - Periodontal microflora of HIV infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in HIV seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. The subgingival microflora of 20 CDC II, 20 CDC III, 20 CDC IV/V and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. Four sites with greatest probing depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. The samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. The microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the HIV infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Selenomonas spp. and Peptostreptococcus micros. However, HIV seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloaca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus avium, Clostridium difficile, Aspergillus fumigatus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Mycoplasma incognitum. The lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in HIV infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.
TI  - Intracellular transport and processing of protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial toxins are associated with disease in humans and animals. Toxins can either be preformed in food or produced by bacteria in the intestine. There are two types of toxins: heat-labile protein toxins and heat stabile toxins. Heat labile toxins are produced by Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio cholerae, and heat-stabile enterotoxins consisting of relatively few amino acids are produced by Escherichia coli and acts by activation of guanylate cyclase. Similarly, heat-stabile entero-toxins are also produced by Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of food poisoning in the United States, and Yersenia enterocolitica. Protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria can intoxicate intestinal cells and can also be taken up from the gut and reach other cells in the body. For example the Shiga-like toxins (vero-toxins) can intoxicate endothelial cells in the kidney and cause kidney failure. Intracellular transport and processing of a few of the protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria, namely Clostridium difficile toxin A and B, cholera toxin and the related heat-labile toxin produced by Escherichia coli, and Shiga toxin and Shiga-like toxins are presented.
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new fluoroquinolone, was studied in comparison with those of ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin (CP 99,219), cefpodoxime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate against gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic bacteria. Its activity against mycobacteria and chlamydia was also investigated. BAY 12-8039 was active against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC at which 90% of strains tested were inhibited [MIC90S] < or = 1 microgram/ml, except for Serratia spp. MIC90 2 microgram/ml), Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, 0.015 microgram/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.03 microgram/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.12 micrgram/ml), and these results were comparable to those obtained for ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the quinolones were more active than the beta-lactam agents but BAY 12-8039 was less active than ciprofloxacin. Strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were fourfold more susceptible to BAY 12-8039 and trovafloxacin (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml) than to ciprofloxacin. BAY 12-8039 was as active as trovafloxacin but more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus auerus (MIC90S, 0.12 micrograms/ml). The activity of BAY 12-8039 against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) was lower than that against methicillin-susceptible strains. BAY 12-8039 was active against anaerobes (MIC90S < or = 2 micrograms/ml), being three- to fourfold more active against Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella spp., and Clostridium difficile than was ciprofloxacin. Against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, BAY 12-8039 exhibited activity comparable to that of rifampin (MICs < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml). Against Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae BAY 12-8039 was more active (MICs < or = 0.12 microgram/ml) than either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin and exhibited a greater lethal effect than either to these two agents. The protein binding of BAY 12-8039 was determined at 1 and 5 micrograms/ml as 30 and 26.4%, respectively. The presence of human serum (at 20 or 70%) had no marked effect on the in vitro activity of BAY 12-8039.
TI  - [Perioperative managements for postoperative severe infections in compromised host].
AB  - The incidence of postoperative infections, especially due to multi-drug resistant strains such as Pseudomonas sp., Enterococcus sp., and Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), is high in compromised hosts. Among them, respiratory infection, catheter sepsis, and drug-associated enteritis are frequently observed and respiratory infection is liable to fall into serious illness. These infections have characteristics in causative organisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa or MRSA are frequently isolated in respiratory infections and Candida or coagulase-negative staphylococcus are frequently isolated in catheter sepsis. G-test in addition to blood culture is necessary for early diagnosis of Candida sepsis, vancomycin should be administered in early phase of antibiotic-associated enteritis, since this infection is usually caused by MRSA or Clostridium difficile and frequently falls into serious illness. The patients with protein-calorie malnutrition, liver cirrhosis, renal failure, diabetes melitis, administration of anticancer drugs and/or radiation therapy, serious injury, or severe operative stress are considered to be compromised hosts in surgical field, and the adequate perioperative managements according to these disorders should be carried out against postoperative infections.
TI  - Incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  - Rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  More than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. Clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for C. difficile enterotoxin. However, 27 cefmetazole-induced diarrheic cases were not associated with C. difficile. Other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as Campylobacter spp., Bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. However, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. This was ascribed to the overgrowth of Clostridium innocuum and Clostridium sporogenes. There were no remarkable differences in changes in other bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of activities of nitazoxanide and tizoxanide against anaerobes and aerobic organisms.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of nitazoxanide and its main metabolite, tizoxanide, were tested against a broad range of bacteria, including anaerobes. Metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin, cefoxitin, imipenem, and clindamycin were used as positive controls. MICs were determined by reference agar dilution methods. The 241 anaerobes were all inhibited by nitazoxanide, with the MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC90S) being between 0.06 and 4 mg/liter with the exception of those for Propionibacterium species, for which the MIC90 was 16 mg/liter. The MIC90s of nitazoxanide were 0.5 mg/liter for the Bacteroides fragilis group (80 strains), 0.06 mg/liter for Clostridium difficile (21 strains), and 0.5 mg/liter for Clostridium perfringens (16 strains). Metronidazole showed a level of activity comparable to that of nitazoxanide except against Bifidobacterium species, against which it was poorly active, and Propionibacterium species, which were resistant to metronidazole. The other antibiotics showed various levels of activity against anaerobes, with imipenem along with nitazoxanide being the most active agents tested. Tizoxanide was less effective than nitazoxanide except against the B. fragilis group, against which its activity was similar to that of nitazoxanide. Under aerobic conditions, nitazoxanide demonstrated poor activity against members of the family Enterobacteriacae and Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Enterococcus species. The same results were obtained when culture was performed under anaerobic conditions with the notable exception of the results against Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of nitazoxanide were in the range of 2 to 4 mg/liter for 34 clinical isolates of S. aureus, 12 of which were methicillin resistant, while tizoxanide was not effective.
TI  - A human antibody binds to alpha-galactose receptors and mimics the effects of Clostridium difficile toxin A in rat colon.
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nearly all human sera contain an immunoglobulin G antibody (antigalactose) that binds the trisaccharide Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc expressed on cells from most mammals but not humans. Because the Clostridium difficile toxin A receptor in rodents contains this trisaccharide, the aim of this study was to examine whether antigalactose could mimic the enterotoxic effects of toxin A and bind to receptors containing this trisaccharide. METHODS: Fluid secretion, [3H]-mannitol permeability, and release of rat mast cell protease II and prostaglandin E2 were measured after luminal exposure of rat colon to either purified human anti-galactose, control immunoglobulin G, toxin A, or buffer. RESULTS: Toxin A (5 micrograms) and antigalactose (250 micrograms) but not control immunoglobulin (250 micrograms) stimulated colonic fluid secretion and caused increased mannitol permeability and rat mast cell protease II release. Antigalactose and toxin A and, to a lesser degree, control immunoglobulin G also stimulated release of prostaglandin E2, but only toxin A produced acute inflammation of rat colonic mucosa. Antigalactose and toxin A bound specifically to a single class of colonic brush border receptors with dissociation constants of 10(-6) mol/L and 5.4 x 10(-8) mol/L, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fluid secretion, increased permeability, and mast cell activation occur in rat colon when toxin A or human antigalactose immunoglobulin G bind to receptors bearing the trisaccharide Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc.
TI  - Small-bowel bacterial overgrowth in children with chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, or both.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of small-bowel bacterial overgrowth (SBBO) as a cause of chronic digestive symptoms in a large cohort of children, using the glucose breath hydrogen test (BHT). DESIGN: Patients were 53 children (aged 2 months to 12 years) with chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, or both. Diagnosis of SBBO was defined with a BHT by a change in H2 concentration of 10 ppm H2 or more in expired air after an oral glucose load. Patients with a positive BHT result were included in group 1 and treated with a combination of colistin and metronidazole for 10 days; a second BHT was performed 1 month later. Group 2 comprised patients with a negative BHT result. Group 3 (n = 15) was a control group of healthy subjects, and group 4 (n = 6) a comparison group of subjects with bacteriologically documented SBBO. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (34%) had a positive BHT result and 35 a negative result. The BHT results were comparable in groups 1 and 4 and in groups 2 and 3, respectively. Fasting H2 levels were higher in group 1 than in groups 2 (p < 0.001) and 3 (p < 0.01). In group 1, children were younger than in group 2 (1 +/- 1 year vs 3.9 +/- 3 years; p < 0.001) and diarrhea was frequent (83%), but 17% of patients had abdominal pain alone. Fetid stools (p < 0.01), mucus in stools (p < 0.01), and flatulence (p < 0.05) were more frequent in group 1 than in group 2. Antibiotic treatment of children in group 1 led to a rapid disappearance of symptoms and normalization of BHT results. CONCLUSION: SBBO appears to be a frequent cause of chronic digestive symptoms in children, especially before the age of 2 years. The BHT provides a simple and noninvasive method of detecting it. The recognition of SBBO in children leads to effective treatment.
TI  - In vitro activity of MDL 62,879 against gram-positive bacteria and Bacteroides species.
AB  - The new thiazolyl peptide antibiotic MDL 62,879 (GE2270 A) showed excellent in vitro activity in testing against staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC90s ranging from 0.23 to 0.9 mg/l. It was very active against Clostridium difficile and Propionibacterium acnes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l in each case) and had variable activity against Bacteroides spp. MDL 62,879 had exceptionally good activity against Enterococcus faecalis, including against a collection of high-level aminoglycoside-resistant isolates where it had an MIC90 of 0.047. The antibiotic was bacteriostatic for enterococcal isolates but bactericidal for a methicillin-resistant isolate of Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - A risk-benefit assessment of teicoplanin in the treatment of infections.
AB  - Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic whose activity is selectively oriented against Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Clostridium difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Corynebacterium jeikeium; such activity is affected by neither methicillin resistance nor beta-lactamase production. Teicoplanin is not significantly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; consequently, it has to be administered intravenously (either by infusion or by rapid injection) or intramuscularly. Its long half-life allows regimens based upon once daily administration. The adverse effects most frequently associated with teicoplanin treatment are local and hypersensitivity reactions, such as itching and drug fever; anaphylactoid reactions (the 'red man syndrome') are seldom observed. Teicoplanin also has less potential than vancomycin to cause nephrotoxicity, especially when administered in combination with an aminoglycoside. Teicoplanin has been proven to be effective in the treatment of microbiologically documented Gram-positive infections, including 'difficult to treat infections' such as endocarditis and prosthetic infections. Furthermore, recent trials in patients with haematological malignancies or other cancers have clearly demonstrated that teicoplanin is at least as efficacious as vancomycin in the empirical initial antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients, and is associated with fewer adverse effects. Finally, owing to its good tolerability profile and the advantage of once daily administration by both intravenous and intramuscular routes, teicoplanin has proven to be very useful for the outpatient treatment of serious Gram-positive infections. In conclusion, teicoplanin is potentially an effective alternative to vancomycin both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, with the advantage over vancomycin of single daily dose administration and lower toxicity. Further comparative studies with vancomycin are, however, required to better define the therapeutic role of teicoplanin for particular infections (i.e. infective endocarditis).
TI  - Antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous enteritis due to Clostridium difficile.
AB  
TI  - Clostridium difficile colitis: recent therapeutical and immunological considerations.
AB  - Clostridium difficile is the main etiological agent of antibiotic associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). It is considered as the most frequent agent of infectious diarrhoea occurring in hospitalized patients, in whom it is responsible for a high morbidity and occasional mortality even when the diagnosis and the treatment are pursued aggressively (1). The pathology is due to the production of at least two toxins: toxin A is an enterotoxin which induces intestinal tissue damage and a fluid response and toxin B is a cytotoxin which lacks any enterotoxic activity but is believed to exert an additive effect in vivo (2).
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive gene probe for the detection of C.perfringens alpha toxin.
AB  - The synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the Clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. A vector free digoxigenin-dUTP-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cloned plc gene of C.perfringens strain ATCC 13124. In a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of C.perfringens were tested for plc. None of the strains failed in hybridization. Presence of plc was even demonstrated in C.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. Specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. None different Clostridia sp. tested, e.g. C.bifermentans, C.tertium, C.novyi, C.chauvoei, C.sporogenes, C.difficile, C.putrifucum, C.sordellii, C.botulinum, C. septicum and C.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. Strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. Comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with DNA hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of C.perfringens plc.
TI  - Teicoplanin or vancomycin in the treatment of gram-positive infections?
AB  - The glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin have similar mechanisms of action on bacterial cell wall synthesis. Their spectra of activity are limited to Gram-positive bacteria, with the degree of bactericidal activity depending on the species of micro-organism. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, enterococci and Clostridium difficile are generally sensitive, including methicillin-resistant strains of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Glycopeptide resistance has recently emerged in staphylococci and enterococci. Vancomycin has a shorter half-life than teicoplanin and requires multiple dosing to maintain adequate serum levels. It can only be given by prolonged intravenous infusion over 1 h. In contrast, the pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin allow for once-daily dosing, either by rapid intravenous infusion or by the intramuscular route. The latter offers reliable absorption for patients with limited venous access and is also of benefit for out-patient therapy. Teicoplanin is a safer drug than vancomycin. It is associated with a lower incidence of nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. Compared to vancomycin, the availability of the intramuscular route and the absence of a requirement for routine serum monitoring, together with the reduced need to treat drug-related side-effects make teicoplanin more cost-effective. It is as effective as vancomycin for most indications, is safe, easy to administer and an important agent for treating Gram-positive infections. Its role in hospitals is likely to increase if the price of drug acquisition is kept low.
TI  - In vitro activity of BMS-181139, a new carbapenem with potent antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the carbapenem BMS-181139 were determined in comparison with those of imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. BMS-181139 was the most active against species of Pseudomonas and related genera Alteromonas and Burkholderia, with MICs for 147 of 149 isolates of < 4 micrograms/ml. Of 22 imipenem-resistant (MIC > 8 micrograms/ml) P. aeruginosa strains, only 1 required an MIC of BMS-181139 of > 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 14 requiring the same meropenem MIC. BMS-181139 was the most active carbapenem against the majority of other gram-negative species except members of the tribe Proteeae, against which meropenem was more active. Although imipenem was more active against gram-positive species, BMS-18139 MICs at which 90% of strain tested were inhibited were < 1 microgram/ml for these species. BMS-181139 was generally active against isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin or broad-spectrum cephalosporins, including those containing plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases or high levels of chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases, as well as anaerobes except Clostridium difficile. Inoculum effects were noted for all three carbapenems against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens but not Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Staphylococcus aureus. BMS-181139's inoculum effect tended to be more marked. BMS-181139 exhibited bactericidal activity at the MIC for some strains and up to four to eight times the MIC for others. The postantibiotic effect of BMS-181139 was equal to or less than that of imipenem and, like meropenem, exhibited intraspecies variability. BMS-181139 was 30-fold more stable than imipenem and 7-fold more stable than meropenem to hydrolysis by hog kidney dehydropeptidase.
TI  - Everninomicin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic: its antimicrobial activity, post-antibiotic effect and synergistic bactericidal activity.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin (SCH) 27899) in comparison with two glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) and six beta-lactam agents was evaluated against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria. Everninomicin showed the highest activity against the species tested and MICs90% of everninomicin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium difficile were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs90% of everninomicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 0.78 microgram/ml. Laboratory induced resistance to everninomicin in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis occurred in a stepwise manner and at a very slow rate. Post-antibiotic effect against strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis were 1.8 and 2.6 h, respectively, and a little longer than that of vancomycin. Adherence to glass surface of an MRSA strain was strongly repressed by the addition of sub MIC of everninomicin in combination with fosfomycin.
TI  - [Fecal flora in infants at the beginning and the end of hospitalization].
AB  - The feces of 52 children without diarrhea, aged from 5 days to 22 months, treated in the Department for various causes was investigated for the presence of that might be the cause of infectious diarrhea. Samples were taken at the beginning and the end of hospitalization. The results were analyzed with reference to 5 age subgroups (1 month, 2-3 months, 4-6 months, 7-12 months, 12-22 months) and duration of hospitalization (3-42 days). The presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the feces was found in 87% of children without diarrhea, especially at the beginning of hospitalization, which suggests the possible existence of a "transient carrier state". Because of the immaturity of a number of intra-organism mechanisms, the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the alimentary tract in the youngest children, may be a potential danger of developing serious, even generalized disease processes and may constitute an important source of nosocomial infections.
TI  - Cefepime: a new fourth-generation cephalosporin.
AB  - The chemistry, pharmacology, antimicrobial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage of cefepime are reviewed. Fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefepime, have a quaternary nitrogen that is positively charged at the 3-position, providing the properties of a zwitterion. A 2-aminothiazolyl-acetamido group in the side chain at the 7-position with an alpha-oxyimino substitution may enhance stability against beta-lactamases by preventing the enzymes' approach to the main nucleus. Cefepime may exert its antimicrobial effect by attaching to specific penicillin-binding proteins, disrupting cell-wall synthesis. Cefepime has good activity against gram-positive organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative organisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefepime is not active in vitro against Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium difficile, and methicillin- and cefazolin-resistant Staph. aureus. Cefepime's activity against gram-negative organisms is similar to that of most third-generation cephalosporins. The agent has poor activity against Bacteroides species. The most common mechanism of resistance to cefepime is the excess production of beta-lactamases. Maximum peak plasma concentrations are two to three times higher after i.v. administration than after intramuscular administration. In healthy adults, the volume of distribution is 13-22 L and the elimination half-life is 2-2.3 hours. Clinical studies show that cefepime is as effective as cefotaxime or ceftazidime in patients with infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures, urinary tract, or female reproductive system. Cefepime reduces fever as effectively as ceftazidime or piperacillin plus gentamicin in neutropenic patients. The most common adverse effects of cefepime are headache (2.4%), nausea (1.8%), rash (1.8%), and diarrhea (1.7%). Depending on creatinine clearance, the dosage of cefepime is 1000-2000 mg i.v. every 8-24 hours for life-threatening infections and 500-2000 mg i.v. every 12-24 hours for severe infections. Cefepime's clinical efficacy is comparable to that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime.
TI  - Effect of ceftibuten on the normal intestinal microflora.
AB  - 14 healthy volunteers were given 400 mg ceftibuten orally once daily for ten days. Stool specimens were collected before, during and after ceftibuten administration. Ceftibuten was well absorbed; on average 123 mg was excreted in urine 0-6 h after dosing, while only two volunteers had detectable concentrations of ceftibuten in faeces (< or = 3.2 mg/kg). There was an overgrowth of enterococci during the administration period, while the numbers of Escherichia coli and anaerobic cocci were reduced. Six volunteers were colonized by Clostridium difficile during days 4 to 17. Beta-lactamase activity was detected in faecal samples from eight volunteers and increased significantly during the administration period.
TI  - Review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. DATA SOURCES: Published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by MEDLINE; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb. STUDY SELECTION: Only published comparative clinical trial reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. Noncomparative clinical data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the Food and Drug Administration are not included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. In clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections, secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. The beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. Cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. Cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.
TI  - Enterotoxigenic bacteria in the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Faecal samples from 123 infants who died with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and from a comparative group of 52 age-matched babies were analysed for toxigenic bacteria and their toxins. Serum samples from the SIDS infants were also analysed for these toxins. A significantly higher proportion of toxigenic bacteria and their toxins were found in faecal samples of SIDS babies than in samples from the comparative group. These toxins were also found in serum from the SIDS babies. Clostridium perfringens was found in 54 (45.4%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 10 (19.6%) of 51 healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.1, p < 0.01); C. difficile in 33 (27.7%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 8 (14.8%) of 54 healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.43ns, p < 0.1); Staphylococcus aureus in 12 (27.3%; 66.7% enterotoxigenic) of 44 SIDS cases compared with 12 (85.7%; non-enterotoxigenic) of 14 healthy babies (chi 2 = 14.9, p < 0.001); C. botulinum in 6 (5.0%) of 120 SIDS cases compared with 0 of 53 healthy babies (chi 2 = 2.74, p < 0.1). Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonellae and Bacillus cereus were not detected. Heat-labile toxin, lethal to mice (HLML) was found in 32 (27.1%) of 118 SIDS faecal samples compared with 5 (10.6%) of 47 healthy babies (chi 2 = 5.24, p < 0.05); cytotoxins in 38 (30.9%) of 123 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 21 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 8.8, p < 0.01) and 24 (27.6%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 33 (34.4%) of 96 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 23 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.94, p < 0.001), and in 27 (24.5%) of 110 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens alpha-toxin (presumptive) was detected in 14 (17.5%) of 80 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 17 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.5ns, p congruent to 0.05) and in 2 (2.3%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. difficile toxin was detected in four SIDS faecal samples and two serum samples. C. botulinum toxin was detected in only one of 120 SIDS faecal samples compared with none of 49 from healthy babies. Staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected in 8 (19.5%) of 41 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 19 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 4.278, p < 0.05), and in 4 (10.8%) of 37 SIDS serum samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Medical technologists using molecular epidemiology as part of the infection control team.
AB  - Two medical technologists were appointed as permanent members of a new epidemiology section in the diagnostic microbiology laboratory of a large Veterans Administration Medical Center in the fall of 1989. These positions accounted for 9% of the total microbiology staff and were created on a temporary basis 2 years earlier from a need to have dedicated technical expertise for use in the culture, isolation, and typing of nosocomial organisms. The technologists have evaluated outbreaks due to Clostridium difficile, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and Serratia marcescens, and have begun work on a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-typing scheme. Their major responsibility has been the development and application of molecular biology techniques for the typing of nosocomial isolates, including restriction enzyme analysis of genomic DNA, plasmid profiling with and without restriction enzyme analysis, ribosomal RNA probing of restricted genomic DNA, and selected DNA sequencing of target organisms. Medical supervision rests jointly between the directors of the infection control program and the microbiology laboratory. During their tenure, infections due to C. difficile have dropped from 95 cases per year to 57 cases annually, treatment of MRSA colonization with systemic agents has been curtailed, and a case control investigation involving S. marcescens was avoided. The inclusion of medical technologists in the infection control practice of large medical care facilities, particularly with the availability of molecular epidemiologic techniques and the emergence of increasing numbers of multiply-drug-resistant pathogens, will become an essential component of these programs.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of T-3761, a new quinolone derivative.
AB  - T-3761, a new quinolone derivative, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.20 to 100 micrograms/ml against gram-positive bacteria, including members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus; 0.025 to 3.13 micrograms/ml against gram-negative bacteria, including members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genus Haemophilus; 0.05 to 50 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, including members of the genera Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, and Moraxella; 0.025 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; and 6.25 to 25 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile, and Peptostreptococcus spp. The in vitro activity of T-3761 against these clinical isolates was comparable to or 2- to 32-fold greater than those of ofloxacin and norfloxacin and 2- to 16-fold less and 1- to 8-fold greater than those of ciprofloxacin and tosulfoxacin, respectively. When administered orally, T-3761 showed good efficacy in mice against systemic, pulmonary, and urinary tract infections with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including quinolone-resistant Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vivo activity of T-3761 was comparable to or greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and tosufloxacin against most infection models in mice. The activities of T-3761 were lower than those of tosufloxacin against gram-positive bacterial systemic and pulmonary infections in mice but not against infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The activities of T-3761 against systemic quinolone-resistant Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in mice were 2- to 14-fold greater than those of the reference agents.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections. Some aspects].
AB  - Nosocomial infection is not a recent problem. However, it presents nowadays as a  serious issue, not only due to the associated morbidity and mortality but also due to the economic burden on hospitals. The increased susceptibility of patients and the increased resistance to antibiotics by bacterial agents are important factors in the present situation. Among the different nosocomial pathogens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile are two of the most distressing for hospitals worldwide. Knowledge of their epidemiology, pathological and clinical particularities and treatment are fundamental in the observation and control of these infections. As a result of my recent experience in two teaching hospitals in the United States of America, I have decided to write the present paper.
TI  - Automated lanes detection and comparison of bacterial electrophoretic protein fingerprints using fast Fourier transformation.
AB  - A method of computer-automated analysis of bacterial fingerprints produced by electrophoresis of proteins in a one-dimensional slab gel system is described. Proteins were visualized by silver staining. Western blotting, or autoradiography. Gels were recorded with a CCD camera, and after initial manual removal of the unwanted image margins, track margins were identified and extracted and a normalized trace was produced automatically using Fourier routines to smooth plots required for this process. Normalized traces were then compared by Fourier correlation after application of a high-pass step filter.
TI  - Review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. A review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/mL; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/mL; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/mL) against gram-positive species such as streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and Listeria monocytogenes; it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. Among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. For anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including Clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Eubacterium. The activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally similar to that of cefaclor. In these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and C. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.
TI  - [Clinical spectrum of antibiotic associated enterocolitis due to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - Historically, various types of antibiotic-associated diarrhea have been recognized. In the 1950-1960s, multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was implicated to be major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, especially pseudomembranous enterocolitis. In the late 1970s, a new type of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, which is characterized by pseudomembranous colitis and lack of fecal multi-resistant S. aureus, usually following lincosamide administration, was recognized. Many studies have revealed the pathogenic roles of Clostridium difficile in these patients. Recent emergence of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) provokes another type of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. We have tried to isolate S. aureus and C. difficile from 150 faecal samples of patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhea. S. aureus alone was isolated from 32 (21.3%) samples. C. difficile alone was isolated from 51 (34.0%) samples, and, both were detected in 23 (15.3%) samples. 90.9% of S. aureus were MRSA. Comparing the clinical features of these cases, patients with both C. difficile and MRSA showed more serious clinical features. The patients who had undergone laparotomy were accompanied by shock and meteorism, more often than patients without laparotomy. The management of antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to MRSA is discussed.
TI  - Lack of care giver hand contamination with endemic bacterial pathogens in a nursing home.
AB  - Prevalences of Clostridium difficile and multiply resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were determined in nursing staff and residents of a 233-bed long-term care facility. Twenty of 38 (52.6%) patients in the long-term care ward and three of 69 (4.3%) in the skilled-nursing ward were colonized with MRSA; 16 of 48 (33%) patients in the long-term care ward and seven of 52 (13%) in the nursing home ward were colonized with C. difficile. None of the 79 staff members whose hands were cultured had chronic C. difficile hand carriage and MRSA was present on only three of 79 (3.9%). Over a 6-month period, 128,000 pairs of gloves were worn. Since C. difficile and MRSA are rarely present on washed hands of care providers, appropriate handwashing and gloving should make a significant contribution to reducing the spread of these agents in long-term care facilities.
TI  - Search for enteric microbial pathogens in patients with ulcerative colitis.
AB  - Microbial pathogens were sought in faeces of patients with active ulcerative colitis and again after 3 months treatment. 64 patients were examined during their first episode of ulcerative colitis and 30 with relapse of chronic disease. At presentation, bacterial pathogens were not found; 1 patient had cryptosporidiosis. In 10 patients treatment appeared to result in some loss of colonisation resistance as evidenced by colonisation with beta-haemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, candida and Clostridium difficile. Unidentified cytotoxic activity was present in the faeces of 4 patients at presentation and 2 patients during or after treatment. We conclude that enteric infection is an uncommon finding in patients with active ulcerative colitis.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and phylogeny of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase encoded  by the plasmid pSCS7 from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) and its regulatory region, encoded by the plasmid pSCS7 from Staphylococcus aureus, was determined. The structural cat gene encoded a protein of 209 amino acids, which represented one monomer of the enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). Comparisons between the amino acid sequences of the pSCS7-encoded CAT from S. aureus and the previously sequenced CAT variants from S. aureus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Bacillus pumilis, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Proteus mirabilis were performed. An alignment of CAT amino acid sequences demonstrated the presence of 34 conserved amino acids among all CAT variants. These conserved residues were considered for their possible roles in the structure and function of CAT. On the basis of the alignment, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. It demonstrated relatively large evolutionary distances between the CAT variants of enteric bacteria, Clostridium, Bacillus, and Staphylococcus species.
TI  - [Secondary penetration of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt into the intestines. Possible cause of a recurring sepsis?].
AB  - We present a 28-year-old-patient with a severe head injury: skull fractures, epidural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, Glasgow coma score 7, and aspiration following a motorbike accident. A systemic infection with symptoms of shock and Staphylococcus aureus in blood culture specimens developed a few days after admission (later Staphylococcus epidermidis was also cultured). A posttraumatic hydrocephalus was treated by a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt inserted at mini-laparotomy. In multiple microbiological and cytological tests the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was always sterile. Enterocolitis occurred with Clostridium difficile and Staphylococcus aureus in stool cultures. After 6 months' intractable sepsis the patient died with multiple-system failure. Autopsy revealed secondary displacement of the shunt catheter into the intestinal lumen. A possible ascending infection was found in the form of a cerebral ventricular empyema. However, prior to death there was no specific clinical sign of peritonitis or encephalitis or a positive microbiological or cytological CSF findings. Despite insertion of a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt under visual control, this case shows that secondary displacement of the peritoneal extremity into the bowel can occur, which may cause a cerebral and eventually a systemic infection. CSF examinations may fail to show contamination; specific clinical signs may be absent or, with multiple-system failure, misleading. An autopsy is generally to be recommended as it contributes to a better understanding of the clinical problems in most cases.
TI  - Molecular detection of persistent Borrelia burgdorferi in the urine of patients with active Lyme disease.
AB  - Current diagnostic tests for Lyme disease (LD) are dependent upon the host serologic response and are insensitive early in infection and, possibly, following antibiotic therapy. We cloned a library of Borrelia burgdorferi 297 DNA and studied one clone, Ly-1, for its potential in diagnostic and pathogenic studies. Using pulsed-field electrophoresis, we demonstrated that Ly-1 is of chromosomal origin and estimated that the B. burgdorferi chromosome is approximately 1,100 kb in size. The 3.7-kb Ly-1 clone hybridizes with geographically diverse strains of B. burgdorferi. No cross hybridization occurs with DNA from human cells, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, or the closely related B. hermsii. We used a dot blot assay to detect 100 pg of B. burgdorferi DNA. We partially determined the nucleotide sequence of Ly-1 and used it to select and synthesize oligonucleotides for use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two different primer pairs were found to amplify DNA from nine geographically diverse isolates. We could detect 10 fg (less than 10 molecules) of B. burgdorferi or less than five spirochetes added to human urine. Finally, we were able to use the PCR to detect B. burgdorferi DNA in the urine of four of eight patients with suspected active LD (three with arthritis and one with neurologic manifestations), all of whom responded to antibiotic treatment. In contrast, those patients who were PCR negative either had inactive disease or had been appropriately treated and did not respond to additional antibiotics, and all four control urine specimens were PCR negative. We conclude that B. burgdorferi DNA can be sensitively detected by the PCR with the primers and methods we describe and that the urinary tract is a site of persistent infection in some cases of human LD, an observation of potential diagnostic and pathogenic importance.
TI  - In-vitro activity of vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin, MDL 62873 and other agents against staphylococci, enterococci and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of different antibiotics were determined by a broth microdilution method for staphylococci, enterococci and Clostridium difficile. The antimicrobial agents tested were vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin, MDL 62873, rifampicin and piperacillin, the latter limited to enterococci. In terms of MIC90S, daptomycin (0.89 mg/l). MDL 62873 (0.99 mg/l), and teicoplanin (1.50 mg/l) were found to be highly active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Daptomycin (MIC90 0.48 mg/l), MDL 62873 (0.95 mg/l) and ramoplanin (1.45 mg/l) were the most active drugs against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE). Teicoplanin (MIC90 0.45 mg/l) was the most active agent against enterococci, followed by MDL 62873 (0.65 mg/l) and daptomycin (1.60 mg/l). MDL 62873 gave the lowest MIC90 (0.17 mg/l) for C. difficile. Teicoplanin (MIC90 0.42 mg/l), daptomycin (0.87 mg/l) and ramoplanin (0.98 mg/l) were also very active. Our results indicate that teicoplanin, daptomycin, ramoplanin and MDL 62873, a teicoplanin derivative, are potentially effective alternative antibiotics for treatment of infections caused by staphylococci, enterococci and C. difficile.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY 264826 compared with that of vancomycin against 100 clinical isolates each of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY 264826, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, was compared with that of vancomycin against 100 strains each of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile. LY 264826 was more active, by weight, than vancomycin against the isolates tested. The human serum protein binding of LY 264826 was 15.3% (range, 9.8 to 21.8%).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  - In in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of Acinetobacter spp. and Aeromonas hydrophila. They were also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. Other Pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. Both agents were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing Branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. Neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher MICs. Gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and Campylobacter coli/jejuni usually susceptible. Both antibiotics had good activity against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and Staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. All streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. Both antibiotics had little useful activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group or Bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. Clostridium difficile and some other Clostridium species were resistant.
TI  - [Colitis due to chemotherapeutic agent].
AB  - From 1965 through 1989, a total of 1,382 cases of malignant trophoblastic neoplasms, were treated in our hospital. Colitis related to chemotherapy was observed in 110 cases. This toxic reaction was specific to 5-Fluorouracil treatment and may result in pseudomembranous colitis if improperly treated. Staphylococcus aureus or Clostridium difficile was the causative agent. For the early detection of this disease, it is necessary to monitor the bacteria flora in the smear of fecal substance. Vancomycin and Metronidazole together with lactobacillus preparation were given and proved to be effective in most cases. The mechanism of formation of pseudomembranous colitis, the causative agents and method of diagnosis and treatment were discussed.
TI  - Open trial of cefepime (BMY 28142) for infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum, semisynthetic parenteral cephem antibiotic, were evaluated in an open trial at a single hospital. Seventy patients were treated with cefepime: 44 had lower respiratory tract infections, 4 had urinary tract infections, and 22 had skin or soft tissue infections. Of 65 clinically evaluable patients, 64 (98%) had satisfactory responses. No mortality or superinfections occurred. Of 57 respiratory and urinary tract pathogens, 54 (95%) were eradicated and 3 (5%) persisted after therapy. Five bacteremias (two with Streptococcus pneumoniae and one each with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and a coagulase-negative staphylococcus) were eradicated. MICs ranged from 1 to 8 micrograms/ml for 13 S. aureus and 9 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and were less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 10 streptococcal isolates. Adverse effects occurred in two patients: transient diarrhea and Clostridium difficile toxin in the stool in one patient and loose bowel movements and increased transaminases in the other patient. Cefepime appeared to be well tolerated in humans and was effective against a wide range of isolates, including S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Infectious diarrhea in the adult].
AB  - Infectious diarrhoeas are usually divided into two types; toxinogenic and invasive. Invasive diarrhoeas are copious and responsible for dehydration which is the principal clinical sign; mucosal lesions and bacteraemia are absent. The most typical of toxinogenic diarrhoeas is cholera, but enterotoxicogenic E. coli and Aeromonas infections have similar clinical features. In invasive diarrhoeas the responsible microorganisms penetrate into the epithelial cells of the intestine, producing fever and stools that contain blood and mucus. However, some organisms causing invasive diarrhoeas secrete cytotoxins; they include Shigella spp., Salmonella spp, some strains of E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia spp. When diarrhoea occurs in patients under antibiotics pseudomembranous colitis due to the proliferation of Clostridium difficile must be suspected; the diagnosis is suggested by endoscopy and confirmed by bacteriology. Toxic and infectious diarrhoeas due to food are increasingly frequent; they are usually caused by Salmonella spp., but sometimes by Clostridium perfringens or Staphylococcus aureus. In patients with suspected infectious diarrhoea symptomatic treatment combined or not with intestinal antibacterial agents is immediately initiated in most cases; stool cultures are reserved to severe or protracted diarrhoeas. Specimens must be collected under the best conditions and rapidly sent to the laboratory.
TI  - Intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  - Seventy-one adult patients with 72 infections were treated, by random selection,  with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin or intravenously administered ceftazidime. Twenty-seven additional patients with 29 infections who were not appropriate for random assignment were treated in an open study with intravenously administered ciprofloxacin only; the latter infections were generally more serious or were caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms. The most common doses were ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously and 500 mg orally every 12 hours and ceftazidime, 1 to 2 g intravenously every eight to 12 hours. Forty-seven ciprofloxacin-treated infections and 31 ceftazidime-treated infections were evaluable for determination of efficacy. Infections included lower respiratory tract (21 infections), urinary (37 infections), skin/soft tissue (14 infections), bacteremia/endocarditis (four infections), colitis (one infection), and mastoiditis (one infection). Median minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were, respectively: for Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis, no more than 0.06 and no more than 0.25 micrograms/ml; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml; for Enterococcus faecalis, 1 and more than 32 micrograms/ml; and for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously, yielded mean serum concentrations 0.5 and eight hours post-intravenous infusion of 2.3 and 0.7 micrograms/ml, respectively. Satisfactory clinical responses were achieved in 17 (81 percent) of 21 patients with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, 22 (71 percent) of 31 patients with ceftazidime, and 20 (77 percent) of 26 patients with intravenous ciprofloxacin. The most common treatment failures occurred in complicated skin/soft-tissue infections treated with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, complicated urinary tract infections treated with ceftazidime, and necrotizing P. aeruginosa pneumonia treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin; the pneumonia patients all had respiratory failure and had been previously unresponsive to treatment with other appropriate drugs. Serious adverse reactions were observed in three patients, seizures with intravenous ciprofloxacin in two patients, and Clostridium difficile diarrhea with ceftazidime in one patient. We conclude that sequential intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were comparable in efficacy and safety; the ability to change from intravenous to oral therapy is a major convenience. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was useful for more serious infections, often caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms.
TI  - [A rapid test for detecting Clostridium difficile].
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus cells, strain Cowan 1, were coated with an anti-Clostridium difficile serum, produced in rabbits. This reagents were used in the coagglutination (coa-test) for detection of Clostridium difficile. A total of 275 bacterial cultures of different species were tested for detection of Clostridium difficile by coa-test and bacterial culture. Of 183 strains positive by isolation of the organism, 181 were positive by coa-test. The sensitivity and specificity of the coa-test relative to bacterial culture was 98.9% and 90.2%. A total of 206 stool specimens of children were tested also for detection of Clostridium difficile with both methods. From 16 specimens which were positive in bacterial culture 12 were positive in coa-test. The total number of samples which were positive with the coa-test was 46. The sensitivity and specificity of the coa-test in stool specimens relative to the isolation of the organism were 75.0% and 75.8%, respectively. The high predictive value for a negative result of the coa-test relative to the culture from 97.6% (bacterial cultures) and 97.3% (stool specimens) suggest that the coa-test will be a useful, rapid and simple screening test for Clostridium difficile. Specimens positive by the coa-test must be confirmed by the bacterial culture. Of some other Clostridium spp. tested, strains of Clostridium bifermentans and Clostridium sordelli also gave a positive result.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem ALP-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new penem derivative ALP-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. For comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. ALP-201 was found to be highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile were resistant to ALP-201. When tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of ALP-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. Further investigations are warranted with ALP-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
TI  - Fulminant idiopathic pseudomembranous colitis.
AB  - Pseudomembranous colitis is characterized by inflammatory plaques and pseudomembranes on the colonic mucosa. The disorder most commonly occurs after the use of antibiotics, which allow overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, a spore-forming, gram-positive rod that produces a toxin. Overgrowth of Staphylococcus aureus can also produce pseudomembranous colitis. In rare cases, pseudomembranous colitis is not associated with antibiotic use. When C. difficile is present, vancomycin or metronidazole usually produces a prompt response. In idiopathic cases, surgery may be required.
TI  - Hybridization analysis of three chloramphenicol resistance determinants from Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile.
AB  - The chloramphenicol resistance determinant from a nonconjugative strain of Clostridium perfringens was cloned and shown to be expressed in Escherichia coli. Subcloning and deletion analysis localized the resistance gene, catQ, to within a 1.25-kilobase (kb) partial Sau3A fragment. The catQ gene contained internal HindII, HaeIII, and DraI restriction sites and was distinct from the catP gene, which was originally cloned (L. J. Abraham, A. J. Wales, and J. I. Rood Plasmid 14:37-46, 1985) from the conjugative C. perfringens R plasmid, pIP401. Hybridization studies were carried out with a 0.35-kb DraI-P fragment of pJIR260 as an internal catQ-specific probe and a 0.38-kb EcoRV-HinfI fragment of pJIR62 as an internal catP-specific gene probe. The results showed that the catP and catQ genes were not similar and that neither probe hybridized with cat genes from other bacterial genera. However, the catP gene was similar to the cloned catD gene from Clostridium difficile. Comparative studies with both catP and catD probes showed that these genes had significant restriction identity. We therefore suggest that these genes were derived from a common source.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of BMY 40062, a new fluoronaphthyridone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of a new naphthyridone, BMY 40062, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. BMY 40062 showed about threefold more activity than ciprofloxacin showed and four- to eightfold more activity than ofloxacin showed against staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. BMY 40062 showed generally twofold less activity than ciprofloxacin showed against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. but twofold more activity than ofloxacin showed against these organisms. BMY 40062 and ofloxacin were more active than ciprofloxacin against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. The antiureaplasmal and antichlamydial activities of BMY 40062 were similar to those of the tetracyclines and were 4- and 16-fold, respectively, higher than those of ciprofloxacin. The in vitro activities of BMY 40062 were influenced by pH and magnesium, although these factors appeared to affect the activity of BMY 40062 against P. aeruginosa to a lesser extent than those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. BMY 40062 was found to be bactericidal, and cross-resistance with other fluoroquinolones was observed. In mouse protection tests, the efficacy of BMY 40062 reflected its in vitro potency. BMY 40062 exhibited longer half-life, higher maximum concentration in serum, greater area under the curve, and better bioavailability in mice after oral dosing than ciprofloxacin. Compared with ofloxacin, BMY 40062 had a lower maximum concentration in serum but a much longer half-life in mice. BMY 40062 was more effective than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in penetrating mouse macrophages and killing macrophage-associated Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - Characterization and reassembly of a regular array in the cell wall of Clostridium difficile GAI 4131.
AB  - The cell wall of Clostridium difficile GAI 4131 was revealed by electron microscopy to have an outer layer composed of a nearly square array and contained the two major proteins with molecular weights of 38 kDa and 42 kDa. The properties and reassembly of the two major proteins into the regular array were investigated. When the isolated cell walls were treated with hydrophobic bond-disrupting agents or a chelating agent specific for Ca2+, the two major proteins were effectively removed and the regularly arranged outer layer disappeared. The amino acid composition of the two major proteins differed from each other. The two major proteins also gave different peptide maps from each other upon proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The major proteins solubilized from the isolated cell walls with 8 M urea or 4 M guanidine hydrochloride could be reassembled into open-ended cylinders possessing the native regular pattern by dialysis against neutral buffer containing 5 mM CaCl2. The reassembled cylinders purified by centrifugation on a Percoll density gradient were composed of almost equal amounts of the 38 kDa and 42 kDa proteins and freed from the other proteins. These results suggest that the regular array in the outer cell wall layer is constructed from the two major cell wall proteins and requires Ca2+ for its assembly.
TI  - Teicoplanin in the treatment of infections by staphylococci, Clostridium difficile and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Eighty-three episodes of Gram-positive infection in 82 patients were treated with teicoplanin in an open study. Infectious episodes included endocarditis (6 cases), bacteraemia (7), osteomyelitis (8), pseudomembranous colitis (13), cellulitis (11), urinary tract infection (5), pneumonia (1), wound and post-surgical infections (9) and erysipelas (23). Four patients affected by an overwhelming Gram-positive infection as well as eight cases of Gram-positive-Gram-negative mixed infections received teicoplanin in combination with other antibiotics. The average duration of treatment was 16 days (range 5-70). In pseudomembranous colitis teicoplanin was given by mouth for ten days. Staphylococcus aureus (11 methicillin-sensitive and 13 methicillin-resistant strains) and Clostridium difficile (13 isolates) were the most frequent pathogens. Overall 89% (74/83) of the infections were cured, 3.6% (3/83) improved and 3.6% (3/83) failed. Relapse and superinfection were observed in 2.4% (2/83) and 1.2% (1/83) episodes respectively. All pseudomembranous colitis cases were clinically cured and C. difficile was eradicated in all but one patient. The MIC range, MIC50 and MIC90 (mg/l) of teicoplanin for C. difficile were less than 0.125-0.250, less than 0.125 and 0.250 respectively. Pharmacokinetic studies in patients given a single iv daily maintenance dose of 400 mg showed that the steady-state trough teicoplanin concentrations in serum were reached on day 8. Assays of skin-subcutaneous tissue biopsies showed that teicoplanin penetrated well into these structures. Side effects were observed in six of the 82 treated patients (7.3%) and teicoplanin had to be discontinued in four cases. The results of the study show that teicoplanin is a safe and useful new agent for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and C. difficile.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - Molecular cloning and genetic analysis of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase determinant from Clostridium difficile.
AB  - A gene bank from a clinical isolate of Clostridium difficile expressing high chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was constructed by cloning Sau3A-cleaved clostridial DNA fragments into the plasmid vector pUC13. Among 1,020 clones tested, 11 were resistant to chloramphenicol; 1 of these, with an insert size of 1.9 kilobases (pPPM9), was studied further. The clone pPPM9 was mapped using a variety of restriction enzymes, and a 0.27-kilobase EcoRV-TaqI restriction fragment was shown to be within the chloramphenicol resistance (Cmr) gene by using transposon (Tn1000) mutagenesis. The 0.27-kilobase fragment and the 1.9-kilobase insert were radiolabeled and used as DNA probes in hybridization studies. Southern blot analysis with the gene probes against chromosomal DNA from Cmr strains of C. difficile obtained from five distinct geographical locations revealed that at least two copies of the same chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene were present for each strain. Hybridization of the gene probes against Cmr strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella edwardsii, Escherichia coli, and to four other clostridial species revealed no homology even under conditions of low stringency.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin has a reduced activity against anaerobic pathogens. Therefore, a combination of ciprofloxacin with an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, such as metronidazole, seems to be interesting for the treatment of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections. High metronidazole concentrations (10 mg/l or 40 mg/l) neither affected the bactericidal efficacy of ciprofloxacin on aerobic pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, nor on the anaerobic pathogens Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, as demonstrated by kill-kinetic curves. The same high concentrations, as well as lower therapeutically achievable concentration (2 mg/l or 5 mg/l) of metronidazole in combination with ciprofloxacin were slightly more potent for the tested clostridia than ciprofloxacin or metronidazole alone.
TI  - Evaluation of a computer-assisted method of analysing SDS-PAGE protein profiles in tracing a hospital outbreak of Serratia marcescens.
AB  - Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) profiles of bacterial proteins have been successfully used for taxonomical purposes. More recently this technique has been applied to epidemiological investigations in respect of various micro-organisms including Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile. The main limitations of the methods so far described are lack of standardisation in extraction and separation as well as in the analysis of results. Although reproducibility in the same laboratory has been shown to be satisfactory, comparison of results among laboratories is still difficult. Moreover, assessment of differences and/or similarities among chromatograms or autoradiographs showing many bands depends upon qualitative descriptions. Interpretation of densitometric scannings is laborious and time-consuming. In this paper we present our experience of a completely standardised, fully computer-controlled procedure for SDS-PAGE (AMBIS System) in analysing 35S-methionine-labelled total proteins. The methodology proved very useful in monitoring a hospital outbreak of Serratia marcescens. It allowed us to make quantitative comparison in a shorter time as well as to handle easily a great amount of data and usefully integrate it with those obtained with other systems such as serotyping. Furthermore, when the two systems are used together, more precise information can be gained. In this epidemic, serotyping indicated the presence of two groups which would have been missed by PAGE analysis alone. Electrophoretotyping, however, focused on similarities of cellular proteins among the epidemic strains. This allowed us to distinguish them from epidemiologically unrelated strains of the same serogroup.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activities of two oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, DuP 721 and DuP 105.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of DuP 105 and DuP 721, new oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, were compared with those of beta-lactams and glycopeptides. Ninety percent of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, including methicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 4 micrograms of DuP 105 and 1 microgram of DuP 721 per ml. DuP 721 inhibited hemolytic streptococcus groups A, B, C, F, and G at a concentration of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, and it inhibited viridans group streptococci at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium group JK species, anaerobic cocci, and Clostridium spp. including Clostridium difficile. They did not inhibit members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the MIC for 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates was 8 micrograms of DuP 721 per ml.
TI  - Infectious complications in four long-term recipients of the Jarvik-7 artificial  heart.
AB  - This article describes the infectious complications that occurred among four of the longest-term recipients of the Jarvik-7 artificial heart. Infection arising from the drive lines, with spread to the mediastinal periprosthetic space, was the major limiting factor in long-term use of the device in these patients. Periprosthetic infections were due to coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other Pseudomonas species. Other infectious complications incurred by some of the patients included pneumonia, empyema, urinary tract infection, and intravascular line sepsis with Candida. Intensive antimicrobial therapy for prolonged periods seemed to suppress but not to eradicate infection and was accompanied by the appearance of multiresistant bacterial strains. Complications of antimicrobial therapy included diarrhea secondary to overgrowth with Clostridium difficile in two patients. Use of the current device for more than 30 days should be considered extraordinary and should be reserved for patients for whom no other form of life support is available.
TI  - Vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a narrow-spectrum bactericidal antibiotic used primarily for treatment of serious staphylococcal infections. It is the alternative therapy of choice when the penicillins and cephalosporins cannot be used. Vancomycin is also used in (1) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections; (2) streptococcal endocarditis in conjunction with an aminoglycoside in patients intolerant of penicillin or ampicillin; (3) infections, including those involving prosthetic devices, caused by gram-positive organisms with multiple antibiotic resistance; (4) antibiotic-induced enterocolitis caused by Clostridium difficile; and (5) prophylaxis for endocarditis in patients who are at risk and cannot tolerate a penicillin, cephalosporin, or erythromycin. The major toxic effect associated with the use of vancomycin is ototoxicity, which may develop when serum levels exceed 30 micrograms/ml.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the oral cephalosporin BMY-28100.
AB  - BMY-28100 was compared with cephalexin, cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram and found to be more active than the reference cephalosporins against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Clostridium difficile. BMY-28100 was the next most active, after cefteram, against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Against gram-negative bacteria, BMY-28100 showed similar activity to that of cefaclor. The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100, including bactericidal activity, against Staphylococcus aureus was less affected by penicillinase-production than was that of cefaclor. BMY-28100 was more stable than cefaclor against various types of penicillinases, especially against the penicillinase from Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Automation in clinical microbiology: a new approach to identifying micro-organisms by automated pattern matching of proteins labelled with 35S-methionine.
AB  - A new rapid automated method for the identification and classification of microorganisms is described. It is based on the incorporation of 35S-methionine into cellular proteins and subsequent separation of the radiolabelled proteins by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The protein patterns produced were species specific and reproducible, permitting discrimination between the species. A large number of Gram negative and Gram positive aerobic and anaerobic organisms were successfully tested. Furthermore, there were sufficient differences within species between the protein profiles to permit subdivision of the species. New typing schemes for Clostridium difficile, coagulase negative staphylococci, and Staphylococcus aureus, including the methicillin resistant strains, could thus be introduced; this has provided the basis for useful epidemiological studies. To standardise and automate the procedure an automated electrophoresis system and a two dimensional scanner were developed to scan the dried gels directly. The scanner is operated by a computer which also stores and analyses the scan data. Specific histograms are produced for each bacterial species. Pattern recognition software is used to construct databases and to compare data obtained from different gels: in this way duplicate "unknowns" can be identified. Specific small areas showing differences between various histograms can also be isolated and expanded to maximise the differences, thus providing differentiation between closely related bacterial species and the identification of differences within the species to provide new typing schemes. This system should be widely applied in clinical microbiology laboratories in the near future.
TI  - Genetic characterization of a Clostridium difficile erythromycin-clindamycin resistance determinant that is transferable to Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The transferable macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS) resistance determinant of clinical isolates of Clostridium difficile, designated ermZ, has been shown to share homology with ermB, which is associated with Staphylococcus aureus transposon Tn551. Homology within Tn551 was confined to less than or equal to 1.3 kilobases, whereas no homology could be demonstrated between Tn551 sequences external to ermB and MLS-resistant C. difficile. Transfer of ermZ from C. difficile to S. aureus was achieved by means of the filter mating technique, suggesting that (conjugative?) intergeneric exchange between clostridia and staphylococci may also occur in nature. S. aureus transcipients were shown to contain additional DNA from C. difficile besides ermZ. This additional DNA appeared to be present in MLS-susceptible C. difficile and might form part of an as yet undemonstrated insertion sequence element associated with ermZ of resistant strains.
TI  - In vitro activity of coumermycin in comparison to other non-beta-lactam antibiotics against staphylococci, streptococci, and Clostridium difficile.
AB  
TI  - Bowel flora changes in humans receiving cefixime (CL 284,635) or cefaclor.
AB  - Twelve healthy young male subjects received either cefixime, a new oral cephalosporin (CL 284,635), or cefaclor (six subjects on each drug) orally for 2 weeks. In the case of cefixime, single daily doses of 400 mg were taken; with cefaclor, the dosage was 250 mg three times daily. Modest changes in the fecal flora were noted in both drug groups, but the changes were of different types. In the case of cefixime, there was more of an impact on the indigenous flora, and in the case of cefaclor, there was more ingrowth of new flora. With cefixime, Enterobacteriaceae were usually decreased (the decrease in Escherichia coli count was statistically significant), as were counts of clostridia and sometimes Bifidobacterium spp.; the Bacteroides fragilis group was eliminated in one subject. Coincident with these decreases, four subjects had increases in counts of group D streptococci of 3 logs or more. There was new appearance of Clostridium difficile in four subjects and of Staphylococcus aureus in one; four new strains of Enterobacteriaceae appeared. With cefaclor, there was no decrease of E. coli counts; two subjects had elimination of Bifidobacterium spp. There was little change in counts of group D streptococci. On the other hand, there were 13 new strains of Enterobacteriaceae, two of S. aureus, and three of C. difficile.
TI  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BMY 28100, a new oral cephalosporin with a (Z)-propenyl side chain at the 3 position and a p-hydroxyphenylglycyl substituent at the 7 position, was evaluated in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin and, when appropriate, ampicillin and vancomycin. In vitro, BMY 28100 was more active than the reference cephalosporins against streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. BMY 28100 was comparable to cefaclor and more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus saprophyticus and ampicillin-susceptible strains of Branhamella catarrhalis; but against ampicillin-resistant strains of B. catarrhalis, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin and more active than cefaclor. Against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, BMY 28100 was comparable to cephalexin, but less active than cefaclor. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae overall were equally susceptible to BMY 28100 and cefaclor but were less susceptible to cephalexin. In human serum, BMY 28100 was 45% protein bound. After an oral dose to mice, 82% of the drug was recovered in urine. The oral therapeutic efficacy of BMY 28100 in systemically infected mice reflected its activity in vitro.
TI  - Surveillance cultures and benefit of laminar airflow units in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.
AB  - The effectiveness of gastrointestinal and topical decontamination, as well as isolation in laminar airflow (LAF) units were investigated in 20 patients. On a weekly basis, surveillance cultures were taken. Environmental controls were taken on the medical ward outside the two LAF units and from the LAF unit itself when being used by a patient. The use of LAF units seems to be of benefit in preventing exogenous infections, but there are two weak points in the isolation techniques: the opening of the tent (with a free entry into the tent itself) and the water delivery system. By using appropriate decontamination measures, it was possible to greatly reduce the number of bacteria and species of the normal flora in all regions with the exception of the oropharynx. Individual patients with oxacillin resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and/or Candida albicans continued to show the presence of these organisms during this time. The detection of Clostridium difficile and/or its toxin B in eight patients at the beginning of the individual observation period was significant. Four out of 15 fever episodes were attributable to endogenous bacterial infections. Each of the causative organisms had been previously isolated in the surveillance cultures, thus the clinician was able to initiate a calculated antimicrobial therapy. As evident from the low incidence of infectious complications, gastrointestinal and topical decontamination of the skin as well as reverse isolation in LAF units are efficient protective measures for bone marrow transplant patients.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  - The relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. We used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two Bacteroides spp., eight Gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric Gram-negative aerobic rods. Abscesses were induced by all seven Clostridium perfringens and three C. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. Selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric Gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. Enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. Enhancement was observed mainly with C. perfringens in mixed infections. By contrast, other Clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. Clostridium difficile and C. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species. This study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.
TI  - Further studies on thymidine kinase: distribution pattern of the enzyme in bacteria.
AB  - Various micro-organisms (131 strains of 73 species) were studied for their ability to produce thymidine kinase (TK; EC 2.7.1.21). Taking the specific TK activity of Escherichia coli K12 [specific activity of sonicated cell extracts 95-194 pmol min-1 (mg protein)-1] as 100%, the test organisms had the following relative specific TK activities. In the Gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus (21-84%) showed higher activity than Staph. epidermidis (1-20%) and Streptococcus (1-7%) except for one strain of Strep. pyogenes (29%). Neisseria sicca, a Gram-negative coccus, lacked TK. Gram-positive endospore-forming rods showed significant activity (Bacillus, 13-51%; Clostridium perfringens, 9-18%) except for one strain of B. megaterium (2%) and C. difficile (1-3%). Among the Gram-positive asporogenous rods, Listeria monocytogenes and six species of Lactobacillus (especially L. brevis, L. buchneri and L. casei) had moderate to high activity (23-348%) but L. acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. lactis and L. cellobiosus had low activity (0-8%). Of the species of Pseudomonas studied, most lacked TK but Ps. fluorescens and Ps. maltophilia had significant TK activity (15-53%). Of the Gram-negative facultative anaerobes, Vibrio lacked TK, while Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella (148-1120%), Escherichia (59-141%), Klebsiella (78-299%) and Serratia (61-110%), had a high activity. Proteus had a somewhat lower activity (0-34%) except for 'Pr. rettgerella' (307%). Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium and related organisms other than Streptomyces, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium lacked TK. The seven species of Candida tested, and Cryptococcus neoformans, essentially lacked TK.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high and prolonged levels in blood.
AB  - Three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins A, B, and C, produced by Kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. The antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. In vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of Staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. However, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of Streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of Clostridium difficile. In experimental infections, aridicin A was effective against strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. After subcutaneous administration, aridicin A had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. The aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.
TI  - Review of the in vitro spectrum of activity of imipenem.
AB  - Imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin, MK0787), a new carbapenem was found to have  the widest antimicrobial activity of currently available beta-lactam drugs. Enterobacteriaceae had minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem of 8.0 micrograms/ml or less for 99.8 percent of clinical isolates. Only rare strains of Enterobacter species and Proteus mirabilis have higher imipenem minimal inhibitory concentration results. Hemophilus and Neisseria species were inhibited, but minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem were higher than those reported for third-generation cephalosporins. Only Pseudomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas cepacia strains were imipenem resistant (MIC50 greater than 32 micrograms/ml) among the commonly isolated non-enteric gram-negative bacilli. All anaerobes were found susceptible to imipenem with the exception of some strains of Clostridium difficile. Staphylococcus species and non-enterococcal streptococci were very susceptible to imipenem. Streptococcus faecalis had higher minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem (MIC90 3.1 micrograms/ml) and S. faecium strains were frankly resistant. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates had a MIC90 of 27.2 micrograms imipenem/ml. Imipenem was generally bactericidal except for marked minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentration differences with enterococci, Listeria, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and some P. aeruginosa strains. The minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of imipenem were not significantly influenced by organism inoculum size, probably because of its beta-lactamase stability to nearly all commonly encountered bacterial enzymes. Imipenem was found to be an excellent inhibitor of beta-lactamases and a potent enzyme inducer. The induction characteristic seems responsible for the antagonistic interactions of imipenem with some enzyme-labile beta-lactams in combination. Imipenem had limited stability in some in vitro susceptibility test systems. The 10 micrograms disk test or dry-form broth micro-dilution systems were preferred, applying the interpretive criteria from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (M2-A3). Imipenem-resistant strains were rarely found in clinical practice and bacteria resistant to newer beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were generally very susceptible to this new carbapenem.
TI  - Role for newer beta-lactam antibiotics in treatment of osteomyelitis.
AB  - Monotherapy of osteomyelitis with the newer broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics has become attractive because of the efficacy, safety, and cost of these antibiotics when compared with conventional combination therapy. Imipenem/cilastatin is a recent and promising addition to this antibiotic family. Experience with imipenem/cilastatin and that reported for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftizoxime in the treatment of biopsy-proved osteomyelitis was compared, using data from published reports from five centers. Two hundred forty-three patients were evaluable: 34 were treated with imipenem/cilastatin, 84 with cefotaxime, 122 with ceftazidime, and 33 with ceftizoxime. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated by 80 bone cultures and was the most common single species encountered. There were 75 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 113 mixed Enterobacteriaceae species, 115 mixed gram-positive and -negative isolates of miscellaneous species, and 30 anerobic isolates. Polymicrobial infection was present in 101 cases (41.6 percent). Failure rates were similarly low in all groups (10 to 30 percent). However, resistance developed during therapy in all groups with P. aeruginosa. Side effects were predictably few, but reversible neutropenia, pseudomembranous colitis due to Clostridium difficile, and nausea required therapy to be discontinued in seven patients. Imipenem/cilastatin should prove to be a very effective and relatively safe single agent for treatment of osteomyelitis.
TI  - In-vitro activity of Sch 34343 against nosocomial pathogens: methicillin-resistant staphylococci, gentamicin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus faecalis, Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Sch 34343, a new beta-lactam antimicrobial, was studied  in vitro by quantitative broth dilution methods. It was found to have good antibacterial activity against four emerging problem pathogens: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis isolates showing high level resistance to gentamicin (and other aminoglycosides), Clostridium difficile (the cause of pseudomembranous colitis), and Bacteroides fragilis. On the basis of these promising results, Sch 34343 merits further in-vitro and in-vivo study to define its potential usefulness in treatment of infections with these pathogens in humans.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - Comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  - It is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. Although the effect of most of these toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. The resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. The biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase, leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. The duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. Subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. The heat-labile toxins of V. cholerae, E. coli, Salmonella spp., A. hydrophila and Y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. Similarly the heat-stable toxins of E. coli and Y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. Classified along with the enterotoxin of C. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by Sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of E. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. In another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by Staph. aureus until more is known. Surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological and structural differences. Evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. The structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. It is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like V. cholerae.
TI  - [Effect of the ingestion of wheat bran on the fecal microbial flora of human donors and of recipient gnotoxenic mice, and on the barrier effects exerted by these flora against various potentially pathogenic microorganisms].
AB  - The effect of bran ingestion on the flora of the human digestive tract was studied using two methods: quantitative enumeration of various microbial populations of the faecal flora, and a demonstration of the antagonistic effect exerted by the faecal flora against various potentially pathogenic bacteria of the environment. Since this latter study cannot be effected in human subjects, we used a model constituted by axenic mice inoculated with patients' flora. Faecal samples from 3 human donors receiving bran-containing diets were obtained prior to treatment and 30 days thereafter. These faecal samples were inoculated into axenic mice fed a diet with or without bran. The dominant floras of the human donors, before and after bran ingestion, were highly similar. The faecal floras of the gnotoxenic mice resembled those of the donors and no change resulting from the presence of bran in the diet could be observed. The drastic or permissive barrier effects exerted in the gnotoxenic mice by the human donors against Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not modified by the presence of bran in the diet. The large variability between animals in the barrier effect against Clostridium difficile masked any possible role of the bran. Study of the transit of Bacillus spores in the digestive tract of various mouse groups showed the existence of differences according to the origin of the inoculated floras, but not according to the presence or absence of bran in the diet.
TI  - Clindamycin as an anti-staphylococcal agent--indications and limitations.
AB  - In a general survey it is stated that for single Staphylococcus aureus infections, clindamycin is not considered to be a first-line drug. Its chief indication is penicillin allergy. Penetration and accumulation of clindamycin within leukocytes demonstrated in vitro may be of value in the treatment of S. aureus diseases resulting in large abscesses. An insidious risk of the development of Clostridium difficile diarrhoea limits the use of clindamycin in ambulatory long-term treatment of diabetic osteitis and chronic osteomyelitis. Such patients must therefore be carefully checked during clindamycin therapy. In staphylococcal endocarditis treated with clindamycin, relapses and development of resistance have been reported. Mixed staphylococcal and anaerobic infections in skin, subcutaneous tissue, the diabetic foot, bone and joints are primary indications for clindamycin. S. epidermidis infections, especially septicemia and endocarditis, are not suitable for clindamycin therapy due to a high rate of resistance.
TI  - Interaction between Clostridium difficile and polymorphonuclear leucocytes from the elderly and post-operative cancer patients: phagocytosis and bactericidal function.
AB  - The ability of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) from elderly healthy subjects  and post-operative cancer patients to ingest and kill Clostridium difficile was studied. The percentage of phagocytosis in clinically healthy subjects aged 69-82 years ranged from 20.2 +/- 3.2 (mean +/- SD) to 34.1 +/- 4.2, depending on the strain of C. difficile, from 6.7 +/- 2.2 to 11.2 +/- 2.2 in post-operative cancer patients aged 65-69, and from 68.4 +/- 3.1 to 81.1 +/- 6.3 in young healthy control subjects. In both study groups, the defect was in part serum-associated. Although the total number of bacteria killed by the PMNs was reduced in the two study groups, the percentage of ingested bacteria killed by the PMNs was similar to that in the young healthy subjects. These differences were not noted when Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were used as the test organisms. The defective PMN function against C. difficile in the elderly and post-operative cancer patients described in this study may offer an explanation as to why these individuals are at high risk of developing antibiotic-associated colitis.
TI  - Clinical usefulness of vancomycin.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, and clinical uses of vancomycin are reviewed. Vancomycin interferes with peptidoglycan biosynthesis in multiplying organisms and is bactericidal. It is supplied as the hydrochloride salt and is available in 500-mg ampuls. Vancomycin is usually administered intravenously or orally. I.V. vancomycin should be administered slowly (over 30--60 min) and in an adequate volume (100--250 ml) of 5% dextrose injection. Usual adult dose is 500 mg every six hours or 1 g every 12 hours. Serum vancomycin kinetics are best explained on the basis of a two- or three-compartment open model. Vancomycin is almost completely eliminated through the kidneys. Mean vancomycin concentrations in the presence of inflamed meninges, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, ascitic fluid, synovial fluid, and bile are approximately 15% of the serum concentrations. Vancomycin is used prophylactically to prevent infections caused by gram-positive cocci. Vancomycin is an ideal drug for prophylaxis in prosthetic implant surgery because of its long serum half-life and activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. aureus. Vancomycin has been used in the prevention and treatment of shunt infection in hemodialysis patients. It can be used adjunctly with a number of antibiotics to treat a variety of bacterial infections. Vancomycin is recognized as one of the most potent antistaphylococcal drugs available. It is the drug-of-choice in the treatment of serious methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus infections. It is the preferred therapy for Clostridium difficile (antibiotic-associated) colitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Ceftazidime in severe infections: a Swiss multicentre study.
AB  - A total of 105 patients (mean age 57, range 15 to 90) with serious infections were treated with intravenous ceftazidime, usually 2 g 8-hourly. Most patients had complicating factors such as major surgery, cancer, chronic obstructive lung disease, catheters or anatomical abnormalities. Eighty-seven infectious episodes in 77 patients could be assessed for efficacy. Bacteraemia was diagnosed in 26% of these episodes. Seventy-five per cent of infections were due to Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most frequent. The major sites of infections were the lower respiratory tract (30), the urinary tract (28), the soft tissues (9), the biliary tract (4), bones (4) and the ears (4). Overall, 67% of the patients were cured, 20% improved, 7% relapsed and 6% failed to respond. Among the 27 infections due to Ps aeruginosa, only two failures (in the same patient) and four relapses were recorded. However, in the two failures and in three other cases with persistent Ps. aeruginosa colonisation, the organism had become resistant to ceftazidime. Three failures were recorded in the seven Staphylococcus aureus infections included in this study. Superinfection occurred in four patients. Adverse events included rash (6), Clostridium difficile toxin-induced diarrhoea (3), transaminase elevation (3), weakly positive Coombs test (10). Ceftazidime appears to be safe and effective for the treatment of severe Gram-negative infections, including those caused by Ps. aeruginosa.
TI  - Teichomycin: in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - Teichomycin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to that of vancomycin, was highly active against staphylococci, streptococci and Gram-positive anaerobes (Propionibacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens and Cl. difficile). Ninety per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus and streptococcal strains, including enterococci, were inhibited by 0.4 mg/l; 90% of Staph. epidermidis strains were susceptible to 1.6 mg/l. Vancomycin was less active than teichomycin against all clinical isolates tested. Multiply resistant strains, including methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus, were all susceptible to teichomycin and vancomycin. Teichomycin was highly bactericidal for growing cells of staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes and moderately bactericidal for Str. faecalis. In mice, teichomycin was well absorbed upon subcutaneous administration and had a half-life of 2.5 h. It was very effective in curing experimental mouse septicemias caused by Gram-positive bacteria (ED50 values less than 1 mg/kg).
TI  - Vancomycin.
AB  - Vancomycin is a narrow-spectrum bactericidal antistaphylococcal antibiotic that was introduced in 1956 because of its efficacy against resistant penicillinase-producing staphylococci. It was effective for serious staphylococcal infections for which no satisfactory alternative to penicillin G was available at the time. When methicillin and the other semisynthetic penicillins and the cephalosporins were introduced, the role of vancomycin was relegated to the alternative therapy of choice when the penicillins and the cephalosporins could not be used. In the future, vancomycin may be used more frequently in (1) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, (2) streptococcal endocarditis in conjunction with an aminoglycoside in patients intolerant to penicillin or ampicillin, (3) infections associated with prosthetic devices caused by organisms with multiple antibiotic resistance, and (4) antibiotic-induced enterocolitis associated with Clostridium difficile.
TI  - Ceftazidime therapy of serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftazidime, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin, was administered to 30 patients  with serious bacterial infections in a randomized dosing trial with daily doses of 1.5 or 3 g. Both regimens were equally efficacious, with satisfactory clinical responses in 28 instances (93%) and microbiological eradication of 79% of initial bacterial isolates. The development of resistance to ceftazidime during therapy was observed in three cases (Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and superinfection by a resistant Enterobacter agglomerans strain occurred in one case. Adverse reactions of clinical significance included one case each of leukopenia, azotemia, diarrhea (Clostridium difficile toxin positive), and rash.
TI  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was thought to be the cause of 10 cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea observed over a 12-month period at The Royal Melbourne Hospital. Each patient had significant underlying disease, and all had been treated with multiple, broad-spectrum antibiotic agents. The diagnosis was made on the distinctive Gram-stain appearance of faecal smears, the heavy predominant growth of methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus from stool cultures, and the absence of other bowel pathogens, including toxigenic Clostridium difficile. Diarrhoea usually responded to treatment with vancomycin or bacitracin, and, in patients whose condition improved, the stools cleared of staphylococci. Patients with staphylococcal diarrhoea present a significant crossinfection risk, and early diagnosis, treatment, and isolation are essential.
TI  - Further experience with augmentin in the treatment of skin infections.
AB  - Thirty-two patients with skin infections were treated with Augmentin, a combination of amoxycillin with the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. These infections were primary skin sepsis (7), infected eczema (11), infected trauma (10) and leg ulcers (4). The majority of cases were caused by amoxycillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus either alone or in combination with Streptococcus pyogenes. Thirty patients (94%) responded to treatment with only one withdrawal (for side effects). Side effects were limited to nausea (9%) diarrhoea (9%) and rash (3%). No patient with diarrhoea showed evidence of Clostridium difficile toxin production in the stools. Augmentin appears to be a safe, useful, effective antibiotic for the treatment of skin infections in general practice and in hospital. It may prove of particular value when mixed infections of penicillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus pyogenes are present.
TI  - Clostridium difficile and cytotoxin in feces of patients with antimicrobial agent-associated pseudomembranous colitis.
AB  - Thirty patients with antimicrobial agent-associated pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) were studied for the presence of Clostridium difficile and its cytotoxin in feces. Either colonoscopy or barium enema radiography was required in three patients for the diagnosis of PMC because of nondiagnostic findings at sigmoidoscopy. Both the organism and cytotoxin were detected in 27 of the 30 patients; Staphylococcus aureus was excluded as the cause of PMC in two of the remaining patients. Eighteen of 19 patients with C. difficile-induced PMC who were treated with oral vancomycin had a salutary response; seven patients, however, had a relapse of colitis following the discontinuation of vancomycin. In general, relapses of colitis responded to retreatment with vancomycin. The implication of C. difficile as a cause of diarrhea is best achieved by the demonstration of colonic mucosal plaques or of a pseudomembrane. The value of fecal culture for C. difficile and cytotoxin assay is limited by the existence of asymptomatic carriers.
TI  - Bacterial interference between Clostridium difficile and normal fecal flora.
AB  - Clostridium difficile has been shown to be the cause of virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis related to the administration of antimicrobial agents. It is possible that some antimicrobial agents alter the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract so as to permit colonization and/or proliferation by C. difficile. The inhibitory activity of representative fecal bacteria from 23 anaerobic and aerobic genera against C. difficile was examined using two in vitro procedures. Strains of bacteria in six of the genera inhibited the multiplication of C. difficile, with Lactobacillus organisms and group D enterococci displaying the most antagonistic activity. C. difficile was examined for its ability to inhibit the multiplication of several fecal strains of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. All eight strains of C. difficile tested inhibited the growth of particular strains of bacteria in the genera Bacteroides, Peptococcus, and Peptostreptococcus.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of a new stabilized thienamycin, N-formimidoyl thienamycin, in comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new crystalline derivative of thienamycin, N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787), was tested against 46 laboratory reference strains and 2,158 clinical isolates of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobes, and compared with cefoxitin, cefaxolin, carbenicillin, and amikacin. MK0787 was significantly more active than the reference antibiotics against most bacteria tests. MK0787 was 16- to 500-fold more active than the other antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and group A and group B streptococci, inhibiting most isolates at concentrations less than 0.031 micrograms/ml. The inhibition concentration against over 90% of 156 strains of Streptococcus faecalis was 1 micrograms/ml. MK0787 had slightly less activity than carbenicillin against Haemophilus influenzae. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of MK0787 against strains of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Serratia marcescems. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Clostridium difficile that are resistant to currently available antibiotics were less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. The only species found resistant to MK0787 was Pseudomonas maltophilia, which was equally nonsusceptible to the other reference antibiotics.
TI  - Etiology of tetracycline-associated pseudomembranous colitis in hamsters.
AB  - Tetracyclines were implicated in the 1950s in induction of protracted diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. Because the pathogenetic mechanism of these illnesses has been questioned recently, we studied tetracycline in hamster models of antibiotic-associated colitis. Orogastric administration of tetracycline caused diarrhea and death, with evidence of hemorrhagic typhlitis. Filtrates of cecal contents were toxic when inoculated into normal hamsters and cell culture monolayers, and toxicity was neutralized with Clostridium sordellii antitoxin. Tetracycline-resistant C. difficile was cultured from stools of these hamsters, but Staphylococcus aureus was not isolated. The value of tetracycline for treatment or prevention of clindamycin-induced colitis in hamsters was also studied, and it was found that daily orogastric administration of tetracycline was poorly protective against clindamycin-induced colitis.
TI  - Immunological studies in ulcerative colitis. IV. Origin of autoantibodies.
AB  - The incidence and height of antibody titers to colon, assayed by indirect hemagglutination with a heat stable colon extract from germ free rats, is significantly higher in sera from patients with ulcerative colitis than in those from healthy controls or from patients with amebic liver abscess or dysentery. While sera from ulcerative colitis patients and controls are indistinguishable in regard to incidence and height of antibody titers to Forsman antigen, Staphylococcus aureus S 209, Clostridium difficile, and several common strains of E. coli, they have elevated titers and increased incidence of antibodies to a heat stable antigen of E. coli O14. Patients with amebic dysentery have normal titers of such antibodies. Absorption of patients' sera with E. coli O14 antigen inhibits the colon directed hemagglutination reaction in approximately 30% of the cases tested. Likewise, the anti-E. coli O14 reaction can sometimes be inhibited with the colon extract. Other E. coli strains and other bacteria are inactive or have only weak inhibitory activity. Hemagglutination inhibition experiments show that germ free rat colon and E. coli O14 contain common structures, depicted by antibodies in the patients' sera. This pattern of reactivity closely resembles that seen in rats made autoimmune to colon by injection of newborn rabbit colon. E. coli O14 is known to carry a heterogenetic antigen present in lower concentration (or activity) in most Enterobacteriaceae. Hemagglutination inhibition experiments with rabbit antisera to E. coli O14 suggest that the antigen common for E. coli O14 and colon is related to this heterogenetic antigen. The findings imply that this antigen, which is constantly present in low concentrations in the human colon, may give rise to anticolon antibody formation in ulcerative colitis through breakage of tolerance. Since this antigen is present in healthy individuals as well, additional factors are required to explain the induction of anti-colon autoimmunity in ulcerative colitis.
