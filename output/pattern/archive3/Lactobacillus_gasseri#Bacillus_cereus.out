food preservative potential of gassericin a-containing concentrate prepared from  a cheese whey culture supernatant from lactobacillus gasseri la39.
gassericin a (ga) is a circular bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39. in this study, ga-containing concentrate was prepared using a cross-flow membrane filtration device (30 kda cut-off) from the culture supernatant of lb. gasseri la39 cultivated in a cheese whey-based food-grade medium. the bacteriocin activity titer in the concentrate was 16 times as high as that of the culture supernatant and was completely maintained through each incubation at 4 degrees c for 3 months, 37 degrees c for 2 months, 60 degrees c for 5 h, and 100 degrees c for 30 min. the ga-containing concentrate was used with glycine powder to make custard creams, and then four representative strains of custard cream spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, achromobacter denitrificans and pseudomonas fluorescens) were individually inoculated at c. 10(3) colony forming units/g in the custard creams. throughout 30 days of incubation at 30 degrees c, all of the inoculated bacteria were completely inhibited by the combination of 5% (w/w) of the ga-containing concentrate and 0.5% (w/w) glycine. this is the first highly practical application of ga to foods as a biopreservative, and the concentration method and the bacteriocin concentrate would contribute to biopreservation of several foods.
effects of gassericins a and t, bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus gasseri, with glycine on custard cream preservation.
lactobacillus gasseri la39 and la158 isolated from human-infant feces produce bacteriocins named gassericins a and t, respectively. both gassericins have high heat stability (121 degrees c, 10 min), good ph tolerance (ph 2-11), and strong bactericidality against many gram-positive bacteria, especially lactic acid bacteria, and thus are expected to be effective food preservatives. a microwell plate assay against 12 strains of custard cream spoilage bacteria showed that the gassericins had broader antibacterial spectra than nisin a. although the gassericins allowed gram-negative isolates to grow, they successfully inhibited the growth of all tested bacterial strains in microwells with the addition of glycine. glycine was bacteriostatic against many strains except lactic acid bacteria. for practical use, gassericin a was efficiently produced by cultivation in a food-grade medium improved using cheese whey, nourishing proteose peptone, and surfactant yolk lecithin. the practical preservative effect of gassericin a and glycine was verified from the viability of 4 isolated strains, bacillus cereus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, achromobacter denitrificans, and pseudomonas fluorescens, in custard creams. custard cream containing 123 arbitrary units of gassericin a per milliliter entirely growth-inhibited the 2 gram-positive strains. in custard cream containing an insufficient amount of gassericin a (49 arbitrary units/ml), the gram-positive strains gradually grew but were completely inhibited by the addition of 0.5% (wt/wt) glycine. the 2 gram-negative strains did not multiply even in the additive-free custard cream, probably because of the unsuitable growth environment. this is the first report showing the combined effect of bacteriocin and glycine and their application for food preservation, which may be helpful for future use in the food industry.
