TI  == inguinal syndrome secondary to prevotella bivia after accidental bite in orogenital sex.
AB  == the authors report a case of an inguinal bubo in a young man caused by an anaerobe, prevotella bivia, which was acquired during oral sexual intercourse. as far as the authors know, this is the first reported case of a sexually transmitted infection by prevotella. prevotella spp. inhabit the oral cavity and  are highly prevalent in bacterial vaginosis, a polymicrobial syndrome resulting from replacement of the normal vaginal lactobacillus spp. flora by high concentrations of anaerobic microorganisms such as prevotella spp., mobiluncus spp., gardnerella vaginalis and other uncultivated anaerobes.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == characterization of vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis in women who have sex with women.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) may be common among women who report having sex with women (wsw) and frequently occurs in both members of monogamous couples. the results of gram staining of a vaginal smear were consistent with bv in 81 (25%) and intermediate in 37 (11%) of 326 wsw included in this study. lactobacilli were detected in 64% of subjects, and 42% of subjects had h(2)o(2)-producing strains.  bv was associated with a higher lifetime number of female sex partners, failure to always clean an insertive sex toy before use, and oral-anal sex with female partners. neither recent douching nor sexual practices with male partners were associated with bv. vaginal smears from each partner were concordant in 55 (95%)  of 58 monogamous couples; bv was present in both partners in 16 couples (28%) (p<.001, compared with expected distribution). bv was common among subjects who did not douche, who did not have concurrent sex with male partners, or who did not have a new sex partner, which suggests that other risk factors for bv exist.  these data support the hypothesis that sexual exchange of vaginal secretions is a possible mechanism for acquisition of bv.
