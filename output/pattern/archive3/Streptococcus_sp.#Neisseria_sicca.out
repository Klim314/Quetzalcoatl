production of bacteriocin-like substances by human oral streptococci.
a sample of human streptococci (mainly streptococcus mutans species) from dental  plaques was examined in order to evaluate the production frequency and activity spectrum of bacteriocin-like substances (mutacins). 89% of the 55 streptococcus mutans strains produced substances with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity. the bacteriocins produced showed a marked inhibitory activity against gram-positive bacteria. among the gram-negative species tested, only neisseria sicca was inhibited by 25% of streptococcus mutans strains. also, 16 strains belonging to oral streptococci other than streptococcus mutans, were examined for their inhibitory capacity against the same indicator. the authors stress the importance of mutacins production in oral ecology and streptococcus mutans pathogenicity.
effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
interactions between neisseria sicca and viridin b, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus mitis.
viridin b, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus mitis (mitior), is bactericidal to neisseria sicca. oxygen consumption by actively growing n. sicca cultures ceased immediately upon exposure to viridin b. adenosine triphosphate production was slightly enhanced within 1 h of exposure to the bacteriocin but was subsequently repressed. the uptake and incorporation of glucose was prevented in the presence of viridin b. the bacteriocin also blocked uptake of an amino acid mixture in chloramphenicol-pretreated cells. pretreatment or concomitant treatment with a variety of antibiotics known to inhibit specific synthetic pathways did not alter the inhibition of macromolecular synthesis produced by the bacteriocin. although viridin b blocks protein and nucleic acid syntheses, no degradation of such macromolecules was observed. the inhibitory effects of viridin b on macromolecular synthesis and on viability required the presence of sufficient nutrients to allow active metabolism of n. sicca. the bacteriocin did not inhibit viability or macromolecular synthesis in anaerobically incubated n. sicca. thus, active, oxidative metabolism by n. sicca cells is essential for viridin b action. a model for viridin b action is proposed.
ultrastructural and biochemical alterations effected by viridin b, a bacterocin of alpha-hemolytic streptococci.
viridin b, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus mitis strain 42885, was shown  previously to exert a bactericidal effect against a neisseria sicca strain but only a bacteriostatic effect against a coagulase-negative staphylococcus. in the present report, this dual effect was defined further. viridin b caused the appearance of mesosomes in both indicator strains early in the course of exposure. whereas mesosomes were the only noticeable alterations in the staphylococcal strain at all times of exposure to bacteriocin, progressive changes occurred in the n. sicca cells involving the nucleoid and cytoplasmic contents and resulting in the appearance of bacterial ghosts. biochemical studies indicated a rapid and complete cessation of the incorporation of [3h]thymidine in n. sicca and in the staphylococcus. whereas the incorporation of [3h]leucine and [3h]uridine in n. sicca was completely stopped, such incorporation was only reduced in the staphylococcus.
