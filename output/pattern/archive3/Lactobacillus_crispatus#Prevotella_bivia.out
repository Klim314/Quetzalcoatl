bacteria in the vaginal microbiome alter the innate immune response and barrier properties of the human vaginal epithelia in a species-specific manner.
background: bacterial vaginosis increases the susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections and negatively affects women's reproductive health. methods: to investigate host-vaginal microbiota interactions and the impact on immune barrier function, we colonized 3-dimensional (3-d) human vaginal epithelial cells with 2 predominant species of vaginal microbiota (lactobacillus iners and lactobacillus crispatus) or 2 prevalent bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (atopobium vaginae and prevotella bivia). results: colonization of 3-d vaginal epithelial cell aggregates with vaginal microbiota was observed with direct attachment to host cell surface with no cytotoxicity. a. vaginae infection yielded increased expression membrane-associated mucins and evoked a robust proinflammatory, immune response in 3-d vaginal epithelial cells (ie, expression of ccl20, hbd-2, interleukin 1beta, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) that can negatively affect barrier function. however, p. bivia and l. crispatus did not significantly upregulate pattern-recognition receptor-signaling, mucin expression, antimicrobial peptides/defensins, or proinflammatory cytokines in 3-d vaginal epithelial cell aggregates. notably, l. iners induced pattern-recognition receptor-signaling activity, but no change was observed in mucin expression or secretion of interleukin 6 and interleukin 8. conclusions: we identified unique species-specific immune signatures from vaginal epithelial cells elicited by colonization with commensal and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria. a. vaginae elicited a signature that is consistent with significant disruption of immune barrier properties, potentially resulting in enhanced susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections during bacterial vaginosis.
lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l. gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.
