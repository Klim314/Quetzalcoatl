TI  == cultivable microbiota of lithobates catesbeianus and advances in the selection of lactic acid bacteria as biological control agents in raniculture.
AB  == the cultivable microbiota of skin and cloaca of captive lithobates catesbeianus includes microorganisms generally accepted as beneficial and potentially pathogenic bacteria. in order to select a group of potentially probiotic bacteria, 136 isolates were evaluated for their surface properties and production of antagonistic metabolites. then, 11 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were selected and identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactococcus lactis, l. garvieae and enterococcus gallinarum. studies of compatibility indicate that all the strains could be included in a multi-strain probiotic, with the exception of ent. gallinarum crl 1826 which inhibited lab species through a bacteriocin-like metabolite. these results contribute to the design of a probiotic product to improve the sanitary status of bullfrogs in intensive culture systems, to avoid the use of antibiotics and thus  to reduce production costs. it could also be an alternative to prevent infectious diseases during the ex situ breeding of amphibian species under threat of extinction.

TI  == identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from mixed pasture of timothy and orchardgrass, and its badly preserved silage.
AB  == in order to understand the relationship between lactic acid bacteria (lab) species and silage fermentation, a total of 65 lab strains isolated from mixed pasture of timothy (phleum pratense l.) and orchardgrass (dactylis glomerata l.), and its badly preserved silages were subjected to phenotypic and genetic analysis. according to these analyses, the isolates were divided into 13 groups,  including enterococcus gallinarum, lactobacillus acidipiscis, l. coryniformis subsp. coryniformis, l. coryniformis subsp. torquens, l. curvatus, l. paraplantarum, l. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, l. plantarum subsp. plantarum, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus, weissella hellenica, weissella paramesenteroides and carnobacterium divergens. this is the first report to document that c. divergens, l. acidipiscis, l. sakei subsp. carnosus, l. garvieae, phenotypically novel l. lactis subsp. cremoris, e. gallinarum and w. hellenica are present in vegetative  forage crops. l. plantarum group strains were most frequently isolated from the badly preserved silages. some isolates showed a wide range of growth preferences  for carbohydrate utilization, optimal growth ph and temperature in vitro, indicating that they have a high growth potential. these results are useful in understanding the diversity of lab associated with decayed silage of timothy and  orchardgrass.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses.
AB  == pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) was used to study the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in two flemish artisan raw milk gouda-type cheeses. in parallel, conventional culturing was performed. isolates were identified using (gtg)(5)-pcr and sequence analysis of 16s rrna and phes genes. discriminant analysis revealed some differences in overall lab diversity between the two batches and between the two cheeses. within each batch, the diversity of 8- and 12-week-old cheeses was relatively similar. conventional isolation mainly revealed the presence of lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and pediococcus pentosaceus. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of three species of which no isolates were recovered, i.e. enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus gallinarum. conversely, not all isolated bacteria were detected by  pcr-dgge. we recommend the integrated use of culture-dependent and -independent approaches to maximally encompass the taxonomic spectrum of lab occurring in gouda-type and other cheeses.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == modification of peptidoglycan precursors is a common feature of the low-level vancomycin-resistant vanb-type enterococcus d366 and of the naturally glycopeptide-resistant species lactobacillus casei, pediococcus pentosaceus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and enterococcus gallinarum.
AB  == the biochemical basis for the acquired or natural resistance of various gram-positive organisms to glycopeptides was studied by high-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of their peptidoglycan udp-murnac-peptide precursors. in all cases, resistance was correlated with partial or complete replacement of the  c-terminal d-ala-d-ala-containing udp-murnac-pentapeptide by a new precursor with a modified c terminus. nuclear magnetic resonance analysis by sequential assignment showed that the new precursor encountered in enterococcus faecium d366, a strain belonging to the vanb class, which expresses low-level resistance  to vancomycin, was udp-murnac-l-ala-gamma-d-glu-l-lys-d-ala-d-lactate, identical  to that previously found in the vana class, which expresses high-level resistance to vancomycin. high-pressure liquid chromatographic analyses, composition determinations, and digestion by r39 d,d-carboxypeptidase demonstrated the exclusive presence of the new precursor in lactobacillus casei and pediococcus pentosaceus, which are naturally highly resistant to glycopeptides. the low-level natural resistance of enterococcus gallinarum to vancomycin was found to be associated with the synthesis of a new precursor identified as a udp-murnac-pentapeptide containing a c-terminal d-serine. the distinction between low and high levels of resistance to glycopeptides appeared also to depend on the presence or absence of a substantial residual pool of a d-ala-d-ala-containing udp-murnac-pentapeptide.

TI  == recovery of vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci from pediatric liver transplant recipients.
AB  == between november 1988 and october 1989, 49 first-time pediatric liver transplant  recipients at the children's hospital of pittsburgh were prospectively monitored  for the presence of stool colonization and the development of disease caused by vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci (vrgpc). quantitative stool culturing was done on a weekly basis, and cultures were planted onto a selective medium for vrgpc. isolates for which the mic was greater than or equal to 8 were considered  resistant to vancomycin. patients were monitored clinically for the development of infection, and their charts were systematically reviewed for the use of antibiotics. eighty-six isolates were recovered from 36 of the 49 patients. enterococcal species were isolated from 31 patients and included enterococcus gallinarum (n = 28), e. casseliflavus (n = 14), e. faecium (n = 9), e. faecalis (n = 2), e. mundtii (n = 2), and e. durans (n = 1). stool colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci was noted to increase steadily during the first  month after transplantation. only 9 of 31 patients demonstrated clearance of these organisms in serial repeat cultures. additional isolates of vrgpc included  lactobacillus confusus (n = 13), lactobacillus spp. (n = 12), and pediococcus pentosaceus (n = 4). infection due to vrgpc developed in three patients: a urinary tract infection in two and peritonitis in one. e. faecium was the pathogen in each of these cases. the ranges of mics of vancomycin were 8 to 32 micrograms/ml for all enterococcal isolates and greater than 128 micrograms/ml for lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates. all lactobacillus and pediococcus isolates were resistant to teicoplanin, although they were susceptible to daptomycin. all other isolates were susceptible to both teicoplanin and daptomycin. this study demonstrates that stool colonization with vrgpc may be a common and early finding among pediatric liver transplant recipients. however, infection appears to be uncommon.
