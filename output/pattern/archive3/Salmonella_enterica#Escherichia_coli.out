antimicrobial susceptibility and oxymino-beta-lactam resistance mechanisms in salmonella enterica and escherichia coli isolates from different animal sources.
the impact of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases (pmabetas) of animal origin has been a public health concern. in this study, 562 salmonella enterica and 598 escherichia coli isolates recovered from different animal species and food products were tested for antimicrobial resistance. detection of esbl-, pmabeta-, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (pmqr)-encoding genes and integrons was performed in isolates showing non-wild-type phenotypes. susceptibility profiles of salmonella spp. isolates differed according to serotype and origin of the isolates. the occurrence of cefotaxime non-wild-type isolates was higher in pets than in other groups. in nine salmonella isolates, blactx-m (n=4), blashv-12 (n=1), blatem-1 (n=2) and blacmy-2 (n=2) were identified. no pmqr-encoding genes were found. in 47 e. coli isolates, blactx-m (n=15), blashv-12 (n=2), blacmy-2 (n=6), blatem-type (n=28) and pmqr-encoding genes qnrb (n=2), qnrs (n=1) and aac(6')-ib-cr (n=6) were detected. to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the presence of blacmy-2 (n=2) and blashv-12 (n=1) genes among s. enterica from broilers in portugal. this study highlights the fact that animals may act as important reservoirs of isolates carrying esbl-, pmabeta- and pmqr-encoding genes that might be transferred to humans through direct contact or via the food chain.
effect of milk fat content on the performance of ohmic heating for inactivation of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes.
aims: the effect of milk fat content on ohmic heating compared to conventional heating for inactivation of food-borne pathogens was investigated. methods and results: sterile cream was mixed with sterile buffered peptone water and adjusted to 0, 3, 7, 10% (w/v) milk fat content. these samples with varying fat content were subjected to ohmic and conventional heating. the effect of milk fat on temperature increase and electrical conductivity were investigated. also, the protective effect of milk fat on the inactivation of foodborne pathogens was studied. for conventional heating, temperatures of samples increased with time and were not significantly (p > 0.05) different regardless of fat content. although the inactivation rate of e. coli o157:h7, s. typhimurium, and l.monocytogens decreased in samples of 10% fat content, a protective effect was not observed for conventional heating. in contrast to conventional heating, ohmic heating was significantly affected by milk fat content. temperature increased more rapidly with lower fat content for ohmic heating due to higher electrical conductivity. non-uniform heat generation of non-homogeneous fat-containing samples was verified using a thermal infrared camera. also, the protective effect of milk fat on e. coli o157:h7 and l. monocytogenes was observed in samples subjected to ohmic heating. conclusions: these results indicate that food-borne pathogens can survive in non-homogeneous fat-containing foods subjected to ohmic heating. therefore, more attention is needed regarding ohmic heating than conventional heating for pasteurizing fat-containing foods. significance and impact of the study: the importance of adequate pasteurization for high milk fat containing foods was identified. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.
biochemical and kinetic characterization of the eukaryotic phosphotransacetylase  class iia enzyme from phytophthora ramorum.
phosphotransacetylase (pta), a key enzyme in bacterial metabolism, catalyzes the  reversible transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl phosphate to coa to produce acetyl-coa and pi. two classes of pta have been identified based on the absence (ptai) or presence (ptaii) of an n-terminal regulatory domain. ptai has been fairly well studied in bacteria and one genus of archaea; however, only the escherichia coli and salmonella enterica ptaii enzymes have been biochemically characterized, and both are allosterically regulated. here we describe the first biochemical and kinetic characterization of a eukaryotic pta from the oomycete phytophthora ramorum. the two ptas from p. ramorum, designated as prptaii1 and prptaii2, both belong to class ii. prptaii1 displayed positive cooperativity for both acetyl phosphate and coa and is allosterically regulated. we compared the effect of different metabolites on prptaii1 and the s. enterica ptaii and found that although the n-terminal regulatory domains share only 19% identity, both enzymes are inhibited by atp, nadp, nadh, pep, and pyruvate in the acetyl-coa/pi-forming direction but are differentially regulated by amp. phylogenetic analysis of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic sequences identified four subtypes of ptaii based on the presence or absence of the p-loop and drtgg subdomains within the n-terminal regulatory domain. although the e. coli, s. enterica, and p. ramorum enzymes all belong to the iia subclass, our kinetic analysis has indicated that enzymes within a subclass can still display differences in their allosteric regulation.
species interactions differ in their genetic robustness.
conflict and cooperation between bacterial species drive the composition and function of microbial communities. stability of these emergent properties will be influenced by the degree to which species' interactions are robust to genetic perturbations. we use genome-scale metabolic modeling to computationally analyze the impact of genetic changes when escherichia coli and salmonella enterica compete, or cooperate. we systematically knocked out in silico each reaction in the metabolic network of e. coli to construct all 2583 mutant stoichiometric models. then, using a recently developed multi-scale computational framework, we simulated the growth of each mutant e. coli in the presence of s. enterica. the type of interaction between species was set by modulating the initial metabolites present in the environment. we found that the community was most robust to genetic perturbations when the organisms were cooperating. species ratios were more stable in the cooperative community, and community biomass had equal variance in the two contexts. additionally, the number of mutations that have a substantial effect is lower when the species cooperate than when they are competing. in contrast, when mutations were added to the s. enterica network the system was more robust when the bacteria were competing. these results highlight the utility of connecting metabolic mechanisms and studies of ecological stability. cooperation and conflict alter the connection between genetic changes and properties that emerge at higher levels of biological organization.
identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
a total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. according to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequences and reca gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these lab isolates were identified as five species: lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus mundtii, weissella cibaria and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two l. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains zzu 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited salmonella enterica atcc 43971(t), micrococcus luteus atcc 4698(t) and escherichia coli atcc 11775(t) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, ph and protease. cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees c), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees c for 15 min. the antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (ph 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (ph 7.0 to 9.0). in addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease k. these results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains zzu 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. the nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.
purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, kl-1y, from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1.
three bacteriocins from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase hplc. the bacteriocin peptides kl-1x, -1y and -1z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 da, respectively. all three peptides were stable at ph 2-12 and 25 degrees c and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees c for 30 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min. however, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. kl-1y showed broad inhibitory activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis dmst 17368, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, p. aeruginosa atcc 9027, escherichia coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739. kl-1x and -1z inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. kl-1x, kl-1y and kl-1z exhibited synergistic activity. the successful amino acid sequencing of kl-1y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin kl-1y". plantaricin kl-1y exhibited bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus jcm 2152(t). compared to nisin, kl-1y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 au/ml against the growth of bacillus coagulans jcm 2257(t), b. cereus jcm 2152(t), listeria innocua atcc 33090(t), staphylococcus aureus tistr 118, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only b. coagulans jcm 2257(t) and b. cereus jcm 2152(t). therefore, the novel plantaricin kl-1y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.
growth inhibition of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli o157:h7 by d-tryptophan as an incompatible solute.
under osmotic stress, bacterial cells uptake compatible solutes such as glycine-betaine to maintain homeostasis. it is unknown whether incompatible solutes exist that are similar in structure to compatible solutes but have adverse physiological effects on bacterial physiology. the objective of this study was to evaluate solute incompatibility of various amino acids against bacterial growth. bacterial growth was evaluated by changes in optical density at 595 nm in peptone-yeast-glucose (pyg) broth. twenty-three amino acids with l and/or d isomers were examined for the effect of bacterial growth inhibition. among the various amino acids examined, d-tryptophan ( approximately 40 mm) in pyg broth supplemented with 0 to 4% (wt/vol) salt inhibited the growth of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli o157:h7 at 25 degrees c. d-tryptophan (30 to 40 mm) completely inhibited the growth of e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella in the presence of >3% salt, but the growth of l. monocytogenes was not completely inhibited under the same conditions. low concentrations of salt (0 to 2% nacl) with d-tryptophan did not significantly inhibit the growth of all bacteria except l. monocytogenes, which was relatively inhibited at 0% nacl. the effect of d-tryptophan differed depending on the bacterial species, illustrating the difference between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. these results indicate that the uptake of d-tryptophan as a compatible solute during osmotic stress may inhibit bacterial growth. the antibacterial effect of d-tryptophan found in this study suggests that d-tryptophan could be used as a novel preservative for controlling bacterial growth in foods.
green synthesis of silver nanoparticles by bacillus methylotrophicus, and their antimicrobial activity.
the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (agnps) by microorganisms is an area attracting growing interest in nanobiotechnology, due to the applications of these nanoparticles in various products including cosmetics and biosensors, and in the biomedical, clinical, and bioimaging fields as well. various microorganisms have been found to be able to synthesize agnps when silver salts are supplied in the reaction system. the main objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficiency of synthesis of agnps by the strain bacillus methylotrophicus dc3, isolated from the soil of korean ginseng, a traditionally known oriental medicinal plant in korea. the agnps showed maximum absorbance at 416 nm, when assayed by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (uv-vis). the field emission transmission electron micrograph (fe-tem) results showed that the particles were spherical and 10-30 nm in size. in addition, the product was also characterized by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (edx), which displayed a 3 kev peak corresponding to the silver nanocrystal. elemental mapping results also confirmed the presence of silver elements in the electron micrograph region. furthermore, the agnps demonstrated antimicrobial activity against various pathogenic microorganisms such as candida albicans, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and vibrio parahaemolyticus, with enhanced antimicrobial activity being exhibited against c. albicans. therefore, the current study describes the simple, efficient, and green method of synthesis of agnps by b. methylotrophicus dc3.
acrb drug-binding pocket substitution confers clinically relevant resistance and  altered substrate specificity.
the incidence of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections is increasing globally  and the need to understand the underlying mechanisms is paramount to discover new therapeutics. the efflux pumps of gram-negative bacteria have a broad substrate range and transport antibiotics out of the bacterium, conferring intrinsic multidrug resistance (mdr). the genomes of pre- and posttherapy mdr clinical isolates of salmonella typhimurium from a patient that failed antibacterial therapy and died were sequenced. in the posttherapy isolate we identified a novel g288d substitution in acrb, the resistance-nodulation division transporter in the acrab-tolc tripartite mdr efflux pump system. computational structural analysis suggested that g288d in acrb heavily affects the structure, dynamics, and hydration properties of the distal binding pocket altering specificity for antibacterial drugs. consistent with this hypothesis, recreation of the mutation in standard escherichia coli and salmonella strains showed that g288d acrb altered substrate specificity, conferring decreased susceptibility to the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin by increased efflux. at the same time, the substitution increased susceptibility to other drugs by decreased efflux. information about drug transport is vital for the discovery of new antibacterials; the finding that one amino acid change can cause resistance to some drugs, while conferring increased susceptibility to others, could provide a basis for new drug development and treatment strategies.
the expression of propionicin plg-1 gene (plg-1) by lactic starters.
propionicin plg-1 is a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p127. such bacteriocin inhibits wide range of food-borne pathogens such as pathogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio parahaemolyticus, yersinia enterocolitica and a strain of corynebacterium sp. in the present study, plg-1 gene expressing propionicin plg-1 was isolated, sequenced for the first time and the resulting sequence was analysed using several web-based bioinformatics programs. the pcr product containing plg-1 gene was transferred to different lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains using pleb590 as a cloning vector to give the modified vector plebplg-1. lab transformants showed an antimicrobial activity against esch. coli dh5alpha (most affected strain), listeria monocytogenes 18116, and salmonella enterica 25566 as model pathogenic strains. such lab transformants can be used in dairy industry to control the food-borne pathogens that are largely distributed worldwide and to feed schoolchildren in the poor countries where dangerous epidemic diseases and diarrhoea prevail.
extraction, characterization and antimicrobial activity of sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins.
sulfated polysaccharides were extracted from gray triggerfish (gtsp) and smooth hound (shsp) skins. their chemical and physical characteristics were determined using x-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopic analysis. the antibacterial activities of gtsp and shsp against listeria monocytogenes (atcc 43251), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), salmonella enterica (atcc 43972) and enterobacter sp were evaluated by determining clear growth inhibition zone diameters and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values and by essays in liquid media. gtsp and shsp were fractionated by a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. fraction fgii, from gtsp, and fraction fsii, from shsp, showed the most important inhibitory effects against the tested bacterial species. the sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins did not show hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes. overall, the results suggested that those polysaccharides could offer promising sources of polysaccharides for future application as dietary ingredients in the nutraceutical industry.
multidrug efflux pumps from enterobacteriaceae, vibrio cholerae and staphylococcus aureus bacterial food pathogens.
foodborne illnesses caused by bacterial microorganisms are common worldwide and constitute a serious public health concern. in particular, microorganisms belonging to the enterobacteriaceae and vibrionaceae families of gram-negative bacteria, and to the staphylococcus genus of gram-positive bacteria are important causative agents of food poisoning and infection in the gastrointestinal tract of humans. recently, variants of these bacteria have developed resistance to medically important chemotherapeutic agents. multidrug resistant escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, vibrio cholerae, enterobacter spp., and staphylococcus aureus are becoming increasingly recalcitrant to clinical treatment in human patients. of the various bacterial resistance mechanisms against antimicrobial agents, multidrug efflux pumps comprise a major cause of multiple drug resistance. these multidrug efflux pump systems reside in the biological membrane of the bacteria and actively extrude antimicrobial agents from bacterial cells. this review article summarizes the evolution of these bacterial drug efflux pump systems from a molecular biological standpoint and provides a framework for future work aimed at reducing the conditions that foster dissemination of these multidrug resistant causative agents through human populations.
expression, purification, and in vitro comparative characterization of avian beta-defensin-2, -6, and -12.
the mature peptides of avian beta-defensin-2 (avbd-2), avbd-6, and avbd-12 were expressed as 6xhis-tagged recombinant proteins using the escherichia coli bl21(de3)plyss system. the yields of ravbd-2, ravbd-6, and ravbd-12 were approximately 0.92 mg/l, 1.24 mg/l, and 1.52 mg/l, respectively, of bacterial culture. the antimicrobial activities of ravbds were characterized under different salt, nutrient, and ph conditions. at concentrations of 8 mug/ml, 16 mug/ml, and 32 mug/ml, ravbds inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, e. coli, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. while no synergistic inhibitory activity was found, a significant antagonistic effect was detected between ravbd-2 and ravbd-12. treatment of e. coli and salmonella typhimurium with ravbds diminished their natural resistance to bile salts. under the nonreplicating low-nutrient condition, ravbds at a concentration of 16 mug/ml were able to kill e. coli and s. aureus within 30 min of contact. the antimicrobial activities of ravbds were enhanced by lowering salt concentration and ph from 7 to 6. the antimicrobial potency against s. aureus and e. coli could be characterized as ravbd-6 > ravbd-2 > ravbd-12, which coincided with the net positive charges of these peptides. in conclusion, data from the current study warrant the investigation of the potential use of ravbd-2, -6, and -12 as therapeutic and prophylactic antimicrobial agents against common bacterial pathogens.
pmrd is required for modifications to escherichia coli endotoxin that promote antimicrobial resistance.
in salmonella enterica, pmrd is a connector protein that links the two-component  systems phop-phoq and pmra-pmrb. while escherichia coli encodes a pmrd homolog, it is thought to be incapable of connecting phopq and pmrab in this organism due to functional divergence from the s. enterica protein. however, our laboratory previously observed that low concentrations of mg(2+), a phopq-activating signal, leads to the induction of pmrab-dependent lipid a modifications in wild-type e. coli (c. m. herrera, j. v. hankins, and m. s. trent, mol microbiol 76:1444-1460, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07150.x). these modifications include phosphoethanolamine (petn) and 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-ara4n), which promote bacterial resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (camps) when affixed to lipid a. here, we demonstrate that pmrd is required for modification of the lipid a domain of e. coli lipopolysaccharide (lps) under low-mg(2+) growth conditions. further, rna sequencing shows that e. coli pmrd influences the expression of pmra and its downstream targets, including genes coding for the modification enzymes that transfer petn and l-ara4n to the lipid a molecule. in line with these findings, a pmrd mutant is dramatically impaired in survival compared with the wild-type strain when exposed to the camp polymyxin b. notably, we also reveal the presence of an unknown factor or system capable of activating pmrd to promote lipid a modification in the absence of the phopq system. these results illuminate a more complex network of protein interactions surrounding activation of phopq and pmrab in e. coli than previously understood.
antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of foodborne pathogens in poultry meat in romania.
introduction: the occurrence of pathogenic strains in poultry meat is of growing  concern in romania. another problem found on a global level is the continuous increase of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food. this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in poultry carcasses obtained in romania in 2012-2013 and to reveal the most prevalent patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the isolated strains. methodology: a total of 144 broiler chicken carcasses were evaluated according to classical microbiological methods. the dna was extracted from the bacterial colonies and the resistance genes were identified by pcr. results: in 2012, 47.2% of the samples revealed at least one of the following bacteria: campylobacter jejuni (9.72%; n = 7), salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis (4.17%; n = 3), listeria monocytogenes (15.28%; n = 11), and escherichia coli (16.67%; n = 12). in 2013, the number of positive samples of pathogenic bacteria decreased, although campylobacter jejuni was isolated in a higher percentage (20.8% vs. 9.72%). the percentage of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria was high (23%); the most prevalent pattern included resistance to tetracycline, sulfonamides, and quinolones/fluoroquinolones. all the resistant salmonella and e. coli strains were tested for the presence of characteristic resistance genes (kn, bla(tem), teta, tetb, tetg, dfria, aada1a, sul) and revealed that these isolates represent an important reservoir in the spread of this phenomenon. conclusions: our findings suggest that romania urgently needs an integrated surveillance system within the entire chain, for drug-resistant pathogens isolated from poultry meat.
activation of rida chaperone function by n-chlorination.
escherichia coli rida is a member of a structurally conserved, yet functionally highly diverse protein family involved in translation inhibition (human), hsp90-like chaperone activity (fruit fly) and enamine/imine deamination (salmonella enterica). here, we show that e. coli rida modified with hocl acts as a highly effective chaperone. although activation of rida is reversed by treatment with dtt, ascorbic acid, the thioredoxin system and glutathione, it is independent of cysteine modification. instead, treatment with hocl or chloramines decreases the amino group content of rida by reversibly n-chlorinating positively charged residues. n-chlorination increases hydrophobicity of rida and promotes binding to a wide spectrum of unfolded cytosolic proteins. deletion of rida results in an hocl-sensitive phenotype. hocl-mediated n-chlorination thus is a cysteine-independent post-translational modification that reversibly turns rida into an effective chaperone holdase, which plays a crucial role in the protection of cytosolic proteins during oxidative stress.
lasso-inspired peptides with distinct antibacterial mechanisms.
microcin j25 (mccj25) is an antibacterial peptide with a peculiar molecular structure consisting of 21 amino acids and a unique lasso topology that makes it highly stable. we synthesized various mccj25-derived peptides that retained some of the inhibitory activity of the native molecule against salmonella enterica and escherichia coli. of the tested peptides, c1, 7-21c and wk_7-21 were the most inhibitory peptides (mic = 1-250 microm), but all three were less potent than mccj25. while mccj25 was not active against gram-positive bacteria, the three derived peptides were slightly inhibitory to gram-positive bacteria (mic >/= 250 microm). at 5 microm, c1, 7-21c and wk_7-21 reduced e. coli rna polymerase activity by respectively, 23.4, 37.4 and 65.0 %. the mccj25 and its derived peptides all appeared to affect the respiratory apparatus of s. enterica. based on circular dichroism and ftir spectroscopy, the peptides also interact with bacterial membrane phospholipids. these results suggest the possibility of producing potent mccj25-derived peptides lacking the lasso structure.
polymorphism of genes encoding pmrab in colistin-resistant strains of escherichia coli and salmonella enterica isolated from poultry and swine.
objectives: to detect the occurrence of low susceptibility to colistin (polymyxin e), a last-resort antimicrobial, among enterobacteria isolated from samples of animal origin (poultry and swine) and to find out the molecular basis of colistin resistance. methods: salmonella enterica and escherichia coli were isolated from eggs and swine samples. bacterial strains were screened for colistin resistance by using mic determinations interpreted according to eucast recommendations. pmrab genes were amplified by pcr from bacterial isolates and their sequences were characterized. results: nine colistin-resistant strains were detected in a collection of 739 enterobacteria (s. enterica and e. coli) isolated from animal samples taken in different environments. sequences encoding the pmrab two-component sensor-regulator from two colistin-resistant e. coli strains isolated from swine faeces presented three non-synonymous polymorphisms, producing the variants 39s --> i and 81r --> s of pmra and 161v --> g of pmrb, among which the involvement of mutations in pmra-81 and pmrb-161 in resistance to the antimicrobial had been previously shown. no variation at the protein level was detected after analysis of pmrab sequences from seven colistin-resistant s. enterica strains. conclusions: e. coli strains carrying mutations in pmrab that confer resistance to polymyxins, which might have evolved in vivo and have been rarely detected, are described for the first time in enterobacteria isolated from animals.
reduction of an e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella composite on fresh strawberries by varying antimicrobial washes and vacuum perfusion.
a 2011 outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis, which resulted in the death of two individuals, was associated with contaminated strawberries. a study was conducted to identify antimicrobial washes effective at reducing e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica from the surface of fresh whole strawberries during two-minute immersion washes. twenty-seven antimicrobial treatments were tested. vacuum perfusion was applied to strawberries during chlorine and peracetic acid treatments to promote infiltration of sanitizer into porous strawberry tissue. strawberries were inoculated to 7.1logcfu/strawberry with a seven-strain bacterial composite, consisting of three strains of e. coli o157:h7 and four serovars of salmonella enterica. berries were air-dried for 2h and immersed in circulating antimicrobial solutions for 120s at 22 degrees c. four treatments reduced >/=3.0logcfu/strawberry, including (a) 1% acetic acid+1% h2o2, (b) 30% ethanol+1% h2o2, (c) 90ppm peracetic acid, and (d) 1% lactic acid+1% h2o2. two additional treatments that reduced 2.8logcfu/strawberry were (a) 40% ethanol, and (b) 1% each of phosphoric+fumaric acids. eight treatments reduced 2.0-2.6logcfu/strawberry. five treatments reduced <1.45cfu/strawberry, including (a) 1% citric acid, (b) 1% lactic acid, (c) 1% acetic acid, (d) 0.5% each of acetic+citric acids and (e) 0.5% each of acetic+lactic acids. the use of vacuum perfusion with 200ppm chlorine or 90ppm peracetic acid did not reduce greater populations of pathogens than did the same treatments without vacuum perfusion. fourteen treatments reduced no more pathogens (p<0.05) than did sterile deionized water. results from this study provide some options for end-point decontamination of strawberries for retail operations just prior to serving to customers.
analysis of bacterial pathogens causing acute diarrhea on the basis of sentinel surveillance in shanghai, china, 2006-2011.
acute diarrhea is the most common infectious disease worldwide and its causes vary from one region to another. we aimed to analyze the spectrum and epidemiological characteristics of pathogens from 22,386 outpatients with acute diarrhea on the basis of surveillance data from shanghai, china, during 2006-2011. the following 8 pathogens were isolated and identified using standard methods: salmonella, shigella, vibrio cholerae, v. parahaemolyticus, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic e. coli, enteroinvasive e. coli, and enterohemorrhagic e. coli. in total, 2,234 strains of pathogens were obtained and the overall isolation rate of these 8 pathogens gradually decreased from 17.1% in 2006 to 7.4% in 2011. v. parahaemolyticus was the most frequently identified pathogen, followed by shigella and salmonella. the isolation rate of v. parahaemolyticus notably varied by season, whereas salmonella and shigella infections showed little seasonal variation. age-related variation was also observed. v. parahaemolyticus infection occurred more often in patients aged 20-40 years. s. enterica serovar enteritidis and s. flexneri were the most common serotypes of salmonella and shigella, respectively. the descending trend observed in the isolation rate of pathogens from the current surveillance suggests an urgent requirement or improvement.
green conversion of agroindustrial wastes into chitin and chitosan by rhizopus arrhizus and cunninghamella elegans strains.
this article sets out a method for producing chitin and chitosan by cunninghamella elegans and rhizopus arrhizus strains using a green metabolic conversion of agroindustrial wastes (corn steep liquor and molasses). the physicochemical characteristics of the biopolymers and antimicrobial activity are described. chitin and chitosan were extracted by alkali-acid treatment, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, viscosity and x-ray diffraction. the effectiveness of chitosan from c. elegans and r. arrhizus in inhibiting the growth of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica were evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). the highest production of biomass (24.60 g/l), chitin (83.20 mg/g) and chitosan (49.31 mg/g) was obtained by r. arrhizus. chitin and chitosan from both fungi showed a similar degree of deacetylation, respectively of 25% and 82%, crystallinity indices of 33.80% and 32.80% for chitin, and 20.30% and 17.80% for chitosan. both chitin and chitosan presented similar viscosimetry of 3.79-3.40 cp and low molecular weight of 5.08x10(3) and 4.68x10(3) g/mol. they both showed identical mic and mbc for all bacteria assayed. these results suggest that: agricultural wastes can be produced in an environmentally friendly way; chitin and chitosan can be produced economically; and that chitosan has antimicrobial potential against pathogenic bacteria.
combined treatments of high-pressure with the lactoperoxidase system or lactoferrin on the inactivation of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli o157:h7 in beef carpaccio.
the effect of high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) treatments in combination with the  lactoperoxidase system (lpos) or activated lactoferrin (alf) on listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis and escherichia coli o157:h7 was investigated in cured beef carpaccio stored at 8 degrees c or 22 degrees c during 7 d. hhp (450 mpa for 5 min) reduced pathogen levels by 1-3 log units and the antimicrobial effect remained during 7 d of storage under temperature abuse conditions at 8 degrees c and at 22 degrees c. the individual application of lpos and alf did not affect the survival of the three pathogens studied during storage. however, a synergistic bactericidal interaction between lpos and hhp was observed against s. enteritidis and e. coli o157:h7. combined treatments of hhp with lpos would be useful to reduce the intensity of pressurization treatments diminishing changes in the quality of meat products.
indole negatively impacts predation by bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and its release from the bdelloplast.
bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a predatory bacterium that attacks a wide range of  gram-negative bacterial pathogens and is proposed to be a potential living antibiotic. in this study, we evaluated the effects of indole, a bacterial signalling molecule commonly produced within the gut, on the predatory ability of b. bacteriovorus hd100. indole significantly delayed predation on escherichia coli mg1655 and salmonella enterica kacc 11595 at physiological concentrations (0.25 to 1 mm) and completely inhibited predation when present at 2 mm. microscopic analysis revealed that indole blocked the predator from attacking the prey. furthermore, indole was not toxic to the predator but slowed down its motility. microarray and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr) analyses confirmed that as the gene group showing the greatest downregulation in the presence of indole was flagellar assembly genes. indole also caused a wide spectrum changes in gene expression including general downregulation of genes involved in ribosome assembly. furthermore, indole addition to the predatory culture after the entrance of b. bacteriovorus into the prey periplasm slowed down bdelloplast lysis. in conclusion, indole can have significant impacts on the predation efficiency, which should be taken into consideration especially if b. bacteriovorus is to be applied as a probiotic or living antibiotic.
incorporation of essential oils and nanoparticles in pullulan films to control foodborne pathogens on meat and poultry products.
the incorporation of essential oils and nanotechnology into edible films has the  potential to improve the microbiological safety of foods. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of pullulan films containing essential oils and nanoparticles against 4 foodborne pathogens. initial experiments using plate overlay assays demonstrated that 2% oregano essential oil was active against staphylococcus aureus and salmonella typhimurium, whereas listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7 were not inhibited. two percent rosemary essential oil was active against s. aureus, l. monocytogenes, e. coli o157:h7, and s. typhimurium, when compared with 1%. zinc oxide nanoparticles at 110 nm were active against s. aureus, l. monocytogenes, e. coli o157:h7, and s. typhimurium, when compared with 100 or 130 nm. conversely, 100 nm silver (ag) nanoparticles were more active against s. aureus than l. monocytogenes. using the results from these experiments, the compounds exhibiting the greatest activity were incorporated into pullulan films and found to inhibit all or some of the 4 pathogens in plate overlay assays. in challenge studies, pullulan films containing the compounds effectively inhibited the pathogens associated with vacuum packaged meat and poultry products stored at 4 degrees c for up to 3 wk, as compared to control films. additionally, the structure and cross-section of the films were evaluated using electron microscopy. the results from this study demonstrate that edible films made from pullulan and incorporated with essential oils or nanoparticles may improve the safety of refrigerated, fresh or further processed meat and poultry products.
antibacterial, kinetics and bacteriolytic properties of silver(i) pyridinedicarboxylate compounds.
antibacterial properties of silver(i)-pyridinedicarboxylate compounds (with pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic(lutidinic acid), pyridine-2,4-dicarboxylic (quinolinic acid) and pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic (isocinchomeronic acid)) were studied against escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes (isp-65-08), salmonella typhi and staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923) using kinetics of grown inhibition, viability assays, minimum inhibitory concentration and optical microscopy. the 3 silver compounds were tested toward uv-radiation in order to characterize their light insensitivity for potential medical devices: uv-radiation curable polymers. photophysical measurements show remarkable differences toward uv-radiation, which were explained based on their polymeric structures with multiple nature bonds between pyridinedicarboxylic ligands and ag(i) centers. we found a bacteriolytic effect and differences in the antibacterial efficiency depending on the structure of the complexes and the nature of agx (x=oxygen and nitrogen) bonds: agquinol>aglutidin>agisocinchom.
species-selective killing of bacteria by antimicrobial peptide-pnas.
broad-spectrum antimicrobials kill indiscriminately, a property that can lead to  negative clinical consequences and an increase in the incidence of resistance. species-specific antimicrobials that could selectively kill pathogenic bacteria without targeting other species in the microbiome could limit these problems. the pathogen genome presents an excellent target for the development of such antimicrobials. in this study we report the design and evaluation of species-selective peptide nucleic acid (pna) antibacterials. selective growth inhibition of b. subtilis, e. coli, k. pnuemoniae and s. enterica serovar typhimurium in axenic or mixed culture could be achieved with pnas that exploit species differences in the translation initiation region of essential genes. an s. typhimurium-specific pna targeting ftsz resulted in elongated cells that were not observed in e. coli, providing phenotypic evidence of the selectivity of pna-based antimicrobials. analysis of the genomes of e. coli and s. typhimurium gave a conservative estimate of >150 pna targets that could potentially discriminate between these two closely related species. this work provides a basis for the development of a new class of antimicrobial with a tuneable spectrum of activity.
influence of moisture content on inactivation of escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in powdered red and black pepper spices by radio-frequency heating.
the influence of moisture content during radio-frequency (rf) heating on heating  rate, dielectric properties, and inactivation of foodborne pathogens was investigated. the effect of rf heating on the quality of powdered red and black pepper spices with different moisture ranges was also investigated. red pepper (12.6%, 15.2%, 19.1%, and 23.3% dry basis, db) and black pepper (10.1%, 17.2%, 23.7%, and 30.5% db) inoculated with escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium were treated in a rf heating system with 27.12 mhz. the heating rate of the sample was dependent on moisture content up to 19.1% (db) of red pepper and 17.2% (db) of black pepper, but there was a significant decrease in the heating rate when the moisture content was increased beyond these levels. the dielectric properties of both samples increased with a rise in moisture content. as the moisture content increased, treatment time required to reduce e. coli o157:h7 and s. typhimurium by more than 7 log cfu/g (below the detection limit, 1 log cfu/g) decreased and then increased again without affecting product quality when the moisture content exceeded a level corresponding to the peak heating rate. rf treatment significantly (p<0.05) reduced moisture content of both spices. these results suggest that rf heating can be effectively used to not only control pathogens but also reduce moisture levels in spices and that the effect of inactivation is dependent on moisture content.
antimicrobial function of shbetaap, a novel hemoglobin beta chain-related antimicrobial peptide, isolated from the liver of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis.
a 2.3 kda of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified liver extract of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and c18 reversed-phase hplc. a comparison of the amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with those of other known polypeptides revealed high homology with the c-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain; thus, this peptide was designated as the skipjack hemoglobin beta chain-related antimicrobial peptide (shbetaap). shbetaap showed potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [mecs], 6.5-57.0 mug/ml), gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli d31, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei, and two vibrio parahaemolyticus species (mecs, 2.0-19.0 mug/ml), and against candida albicans (mec; 12.0 mug/ml) without significant hemolytic activity. antimicrobial activity of this peptide was heatstable and ph resistant but is sensitive to proteases and salt. shbetaap did not show membrane permeabilization and killing ability. the secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling expected that this peptide formed an amphipathic alpha-helical structure. this is the first report the purification of a novel antimicrobial peptide related to the c-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain from marine fish.
antibiotic stress-induced modulation of the endoribonucleolytic activity of rnase iii and rnase g confers resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics in escherichia coli.
here, we report a resistance mechanism that is induced through the modulation of  16s ribosomal rna (rrna) processing on the exposure of escherichia coli cells to aminoglycoside antibiotics. we observed decreased expression levels of rnase g associated with increased rnase iii activity on rng mrna in a subgroup of e. coli isolates that transiently acquired resistance to low levels of kanamycin or streptomycin. analyses of 16s rrna from the aminoglycoside-resistant e. coli cells, in addition to mutagenesis studies, demonstrated that the accumulation of 16s rrna precursors containing 3-8 extra nucleotides at the 5' terminus, which results from incomplete processing by rnase g, is responsible for the observed aminoglycoside resistance. chemical protection, mass spectrometry analysis and cell-free translation assays revealed that the ribosomes from rng-deleted e. coli have decreased binding capacity for, and diminished sensitivity to, streptomycin and neomycin, compared with wild-type cells. it was observed that the deletion of rng had similar effects in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain sl1344. our findings suggest that modulation of the endoribonucleolytic activity of rnase iii and rnase g constitutes a previously uncharacterized regulatory pathway for adaptive resistance in e. coli and related gram-negative bacteria to aminoglycoside antibiotics.
lack of efflux mediated quinolone resistance in salmonella enterica serovars typhi and paratyphi a.
salmonella enterica serovars typhi and paratyphi a isolates from human patients in france displaying different levels of resistance to quinolones or fluoroquinolones were studied for resistance mechanisms to these antimicrobial agents. all resistant isolates carried either single or multiple target gene mutations (i.e., in gyra, gyrb, or parc) correlating with the resistance levels observed. active efflux, through upregulation of multipartite efflux systems, has also been previously reported as contributing mechanism for other serovars. therefore, we investigated also the occurrence of non-target gene mutations in regulatory regions affecting efflux pump expression. however, no mutation was detected in these regions in both typhi and paratyphi isolates of this study. besides, no overexpression of the major efflux systems was observed for these isolates. nevertheless, a large deletion of 2334 bp was identified in the acrs-acre region of all s. typhi strains but which did not affect the resistance phenotype. as being specific to s. typhi, this deletion could be used for specific molecular detection purposes. in conclusion, the different levels of quinolone or fq resistance in both s. typhi and s. paratyphi a seem to rely only on target modifications.
inhibition of escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica on spinach and identification of antimicrobial substances produced by a commercial lactic acid bacteria food safety intervention.
the microbiological safety of fresh produce is of concern for the u.s. food supply. members of the lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been reported to antagonize pathogens by competing for nutrients and by secretion of substances with antimicrobial activity, including organic acids, peroxides, and antimicrobial polypeptides. the objectives of this research were to: (i) determine the capacity of a commercial lab food antimicrobial to inhibit escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica on spinach leaf surfaces, and (ii) identify antimicrobial substances produced in vitro by the lab comprising the food antimicrobial. pathogens were inoculated on freshly harvested spinach, followed by application of the lab antimicrobial. treated spinach was aerobically incubated up to 12 days at 7 degrees c and surviving pathogens enumerated via selective/differential plating. l-lactic acid and a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) were detected and quantified from cell-free fermentates obtained from lab-inoculated liquid microbiological medium. application of 8.0 log10 cfu/g lab produced significant (p < 0.05) reductions in e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella populations on spinach of 1.6 and 1.9 log10 cfu/g, respectively. it was concluded the lab antimicrobial inhibited foodborne pathogens on spinach during refrigerated storage, likely the result of the production of metabolites with antimicrobial activity.
in vitro effectiveness of the antimicrobial peptide ecath1 against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens of horses.
the equine antimicrobial peptide ecath1 previously has been shown to have in vitro activity against antibiotic-susceptible reference strains of rhodococcus equi and common respiratory bacterial pathogens of foals. interestingly, ecath1 was also found to be effective in the treatment of r. equi infection induced in mice. the aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activity of ecath1 against equine isolates of gram-negative (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas spp.) and gram-positive (r. equi, staphylococcus aureus) bacteria resistant to multiple classes of conventional antibiotics. a modified microdilution method was used to evaluate the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the antimicrobial peptide. the study revealed that ecath1 was active against all equine isolates of e. coli, s. enterica, k. pneumoniae, pseudomonas spp. and r. equi tested, with mics of 0.5-16 mug ml(-1), but was not active against most isolates of s. aureus. in conclusion, the activity of the equine antimicrobial peptide ecath1 appears to not be hampered by the antibiotic resistance of clinical isolates. thus, the data suggest that ecath1 could be useful, not only in the treatment of r. equi infections, but also of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.
combining de novo and reference-guided assembly with scaffold_builder.
genome sequencing has become routine, however genome assembly still remains a challenge despite the computational advances in the last decade. in particular, the abundance of repeat elements in genomes makes it difficult to assemble them into a single complete sequence. identical repeats shorter than the average read length can generally be assembled without issue. however, longer repeats such as ribosomal rna operons cannot be accurately assembled using existing tools. the application scaffold_builder was designed to generate scaffolds - super contigs of sequences joined by n-bases - based on the similarity to a closely related reference sequence. this is independent of mate-pair information and can be used complementarily for genome assembly, e.g. when mate-pairs are not available or have already been exploited. scaffold_builder was evaluated using simulated pyrosequencing reads of the bacterial genomes escherichia coli 042, lactobacillus salivarius ucc118 and salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhi str. p-stx-12. moreover, we sequenced two genomes from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 g455 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sdt1291 and show that scaffold_builder decreases the number of contig sequences by 53% while more than doubling their average length. scaffold_builder is written in python and is available at http://edwards.sdsu.edu/scaffold_builder. a web-based implementation is additionally provided to allow users to submit a reference genome and a set of contigs to be scaffolded.
bioprotection of ready-to-eat probiotic artichokes processed with lactobacillus paracasei lmgp22043 against foodborne pathogens.
the survival of 3 pathogens listeria monocytogenes atcc19115, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica atcc13311, and escherichia coli atcc8739 was evaluated over time in ready-to-eat (rte) artichoke products processed or not with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei lmgp22043. both probiotic and standard products (final ph about 4.0; aw = 0.98) dressed with oil and packaged in modified atmosphere were inoculated with pathogens at a level of about 3 log cfu/g and stored at 4 masculinec for 45 d. pathogens decreased in the probiotic product in 2 descent phases, without shoulder and/or tailing as observed by fitting the models available in the ginafit software to the experimental data. s. enterica subsp. enterica was completely inactivated after 14 and 28 d in probiotic and standard products, respectively; e. coli was inhibited in the probiotic food at day 4 (count <detection limit (dl) 1 log cfu/g), while in the standard product, it survived until the end of experiment. l. monocytogenes decreased in the probiotic product at day 1 reaching values below the dl after 14 d, while 21 d were needed in the standard product, and survived in both samples until the end of the experimental period. therefore, the probiotic strain, representing always more than the 93% of lactic acid bacteria (about 7 log cfu/g) during the entire experimental period, combines the efficacy of a protective culture, which can control the development of pathogens during storage with probiotic benefits.
antimicrobial susceptibility assays in paper-based portable culture devices.
to detect antibiotic-resistant bacteria in areas remote from microbiology laboratories, we designed portable culture devices performing an analogue of the kirby-bauer disk diffusion test inside patterned papers embedded in tape. we quantified the antibiotic susceptibility of several strains of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium by measuring blue-colored zones of inhibited growth.
managing salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli o157:h7 in soil with hydrated lime - an outdoor study in lysimeters and field plots.
an outbreak of salmonella typhimurium or e. coli o157:h7 among domestic animals can have great financial consequences for an animal enterprise but also be a threat for public health as there is a risk for transmission of the infection through the environment. in order to minimize disease transmission, it is important to treat not only the affected animals but also the areas on which they have been kept. in the present study, the effect of hydrated lime as a treatment for salmonella typhimurium or e. coli o157:h7 contaminated soil was investigated. the study was performed outdoors, in a lysimeter system and in field plots. the soils were spiked with salmonella typhimurium and/or e. coli o157:h7 and hydrated lime was added at three different concentrations (0.5, 1 and 2%). sampling was performed over one month, and the levels of bacteria were analyzed by standard culture methods. in addition, the soil ph was monitored throughout the study. the results showed that application of 0.5-1 kg hydrated lime per m(2) reduced both salmonella typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 numbers to below the detection limit (2 log10 cfu g-1 soil) in 3-7 days. lower application rates of hydrated lime did not reduce pathogen numbers in the lysimeter study, but in the field plots no e. coli o157:h7 was detected at the end of the four-week study period regardless of hydrated lime application. a recommended strategy for treating a salmonella typhimurium or e. coli o157:h7 contaminated soil could therefore be to monitor the ph over the time of treatment and to repeat hydrated lime application if a decrease in ph is observed.
new function of molybdenum trioxide nanoplates: toxicity towards pathogenic bacteria through membrane stress.
inorganic nanostructures are highly recognized for their potential use in the development of new functional materials for biomedical applications. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial efficiency of molybdenum trioxide (moo3) nanoplates against four types of pathogenic bacteria. moo3 nanoplates are synthesized by a simple wet chemical approach. x-ray diffraction and ft-ir analysis showed the presence of an orthorhombic phase of moo3 nanoplates. field emission scanning electron microscope studies confirmed the formation of plate-like structures of moo3. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of moo3 nanoplates against pathogenic bacteria was evaluated using a microdilution method. mics such as 8mug/ml (against escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium), 16mug/ml (against enterococcus faecalis), and 8mug/ml (against bacillus subtilis) show that moo3 nanoplates have predominant antibacterial activity compared to the standard antibiotic, kanamycin. evaluation of bacterial enzymatic (beta-d-galactosidase) activity in the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenol and beta-d-galactopyranoside suggested the disruption of the bacterial cell wall mechanism responsible for bacterial toxicity.
plum coatings of lemongrass oil-incorporating carnauba wax-based nanoemulsion.
nanoemulsions containing lemongrass oil (lo) were developed for coating plums and the effects of the nanoemulsion coatings on the microbial safety and physicochemical storage qualities of plums during storage at 4 and 25 degrees c were investigated. the emulsions used for coating were produced by mixing a carnauba wax-based solution (18%, w/w) with lo at various concentrations (0.5% to 4.0%, w/w) using dynamic high pressure processing at 172 mpa. the coatings were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli o157:h7 and their ability to preserve various physicochemical qualities of plums. uniform and continuous coatings on plums, formed with stable emulsions, initially inhibited s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 by 0.2 to 2.8 and 0.8 to 2.7 log cfu/g, respectively, depending on the concentration of lo and the sequence of coating. the coatings did not significantly alter the flavor, fracturability, or glossiness of the plums. the antimicrobial effects of the coatings against s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 were demonstrated during storage at 4 and 25 degrees c. the coatings reduced weight loss and ethylene production by approximately 2 to 3 and 1.4 to 4.0 fold, respectively, and also retarded the changes in lightness and the concentration of phenolic compounds in plums during storage. the firmness of coated plums was generally higher than uncoated plums when stored at 4 degrees c and plum respiration rates were reduced during storage. coatings containing nanoemulsions of lo have the potential to inhibit salmonella and e. coli o157:h7 contamination of plums and may extend plum shelf life.
poly(ethyleneimines) in dermal applications: biocompatibility and antimicrobial effects.
cationic polyamines, such as poly(ethyleneimines) (peis), may recommend themselves for antimicrobial applications as they can interact with microbial membranes resulting in their disruption. the purpose of the study was the assessment of biocompatibility and antibacterial activity of peis with different architectures (branched (b) and linear (l)) and molar masses (0.8-750 kda). lpei and bpei exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli with a more pronounced effect on the gram-positive bacteria. lpeis further demonstrated a higher antibacterial efficacy compared to bpeis but no significant differences between 5 and 25 kda were observed. in accordance, antibacterial activity of bpei did not specifically depend on molar mass. only slightly lower minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were observed at 5 kda (s. aureus) and 25 kda (e. coli) in the tests. as peis are compelling candidates for use in antimicrobial treatment, two basic aspects have to be investigated: treatment effectiveness and safety. peis clearly induced molecular weight dependent cytotoxic effects in vitro. peis with low molecular weight (0.8 and 5 kda) exhibited higher biocompatibility. nonetheless, the results confirmed a low genotoxic potential of lpei and bpeis. in conclusion, 2.5 kda-lpei and 0.8 kda-bpei can be recommended for use as antimicrobial polymers in dermal applications due to their high biocompatibility with concomitant antibacterial efficacy.
effects of subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials on gene acquisition events in yersinia, proteus, shigella, and salmonella recipient organisms in isolated ligated intestinal loops of swine.
objective: to assess antimicrobial resistance and transfer of virulence genes facilitated by subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials in swine intestines. animals: 20 anesthetized pigs experimentally inoculated with donor and recipient bacteria. procedures: 4 recipient pathogenic bacteria (salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, or proteus mirabilis) were incubated with donor bacteria in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of 1 of 16 antimicrobials in isolated ligated intestinal loops in swine. donor escherichia coli contained transferrable antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes. after coincubations, intestinal contents were removed and assessed for pathogens that acquired new antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes following exposure to the subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials. results: 3 antimicrobials (apramycin, lincomycin, and neomycin) enhanced transfer of an antimicrobial resistance plasmid from commensal e coli organisms to yersinia and proteus organisms, whereas 7 antimicrobials (florfenicol, hygromycin, penicillin g, roxarsone, sulfamethazine, tetracycline, and tylosin) exacerbated transfer of an integron (salmonella genomic island 1) from salmonella organisms to yersinia organisms. sulfamethazine induced the transfer of salmonella pathogenicity island 1 from pathogenic to nonpathogenic salmonella organisms. six antimicrobials (bacitracin, carbadox, erythromycin, sulfathiazole, tiamulin, and virginiamycin) did not mediate any transfer events. sulfamethazine was the only antimicrobial implicated in 2 types of transfer events. conclusions and clinical relevance: 10 of 16 antimicrobials at subinhibitory or subtherapeutic concentrations augmented specific antimicrobial resistance or transfer of virulence genes into pathogenic bacteria in isolated intestinal loops in swine. use of subtherapeutic antimicrobials in animal feed may be associated with unwanted collateral effects.
antimicrobial activity of yerba mate (ilex paraguariensis st. hil.) against food  pathogens.
yerba mate (ilex paraguariensis st. hil.) has been studied for its important biological activities mainly attributed to phenolic compounds. this study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of yerba mate against food pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli through minimum inhibitory (mic) and bactericidal (mbc) concentrations, in addition to the determination of chemical composition by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and phenolic content. the most effective extract had its activity evaluated under different ph conditions by growth curve analysis. all microorganisms except e. coli were inhibited. the ethanolic extract showed the lowest mic/mbc (0.78/0.78 mg/ml), the highest phenolic content (193.9 g.gae/kg) and the presence of chlorogenic acid derivatives, especially 3-o-caffeoylquinic and caffeic acid. this extract was able to inhibit microbial growth at ph 7 and 8.
impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.
male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. this is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. in mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have reduced motility when bacteria are present. in male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been investigated. the sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. in this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. six different intestinal bacteria, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium bifermentans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. for each bacterium, 50 microl of semen was diluted in 450 microl of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. the experiment was repeated twice. in each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized design with a split plot over time. also, the ph was measured for each treatment at 0 and 10 min. the results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (p < 0.0001), but broths containing bifidobacterium or lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. although broth containing salmonella, campylobacter, and bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. broths containing e. coli, clostridium, and lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. however, ph was increased when semen was exposed to the e. coli and campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to bifidobacterium and lactobacillus treatments, ph was reduced. in conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.
probiotic bacteria reduce salmonella typhimurium intestinal colonization by competing for iron.
host inflammation alters the availability of nutrients such as iron to limit microbial growth. however, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium thrives in the inflamed gut by scavenging for iron with siderophores. by administering escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, which assimilates iron by similar mechanisms, we show that this nonpathogenic bacterium can outcompete and reduce s. typhimurium colonization in mouse models of acute colitis and chronic persistent infection. this probiotic activity depends on e. coli nissle iron acquisition, given that mutants deficient in iron uptake colonize the intestine but do not reduce s. typhimurium colonization. additionally, the ability of e. coli nissle to overcome iron restriction by the host protein lipocalin 2, which counteracts some siderophores, is essential, given that s. typhimurium is unaffected by e. coli nissle in lipocalin 2-deficient mice. thus, iron availability impacts s. typhimurium growth, and e. coli nissle reduces s. typhimurium intestinal colonization by competing for this limiting nutrient.
adhesive ability means inhibition activities for lactobacillus against pathogens  and s-layer protein plays an important role in adhesion.
eighty-five strains of lactobacillus were isolated from the pig intestine and identified by sequencing analysis based on 16s rrna gene, from which five lactobacillus strains with high adhesive ability were selected. the inhibition ability of the five lactobacillus strains with or without s-layer proteins against adherence of escherichia coli k88 and salmonella enteritidis 50335 to caco-2 was evaluated in vitro with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg strain (lgg) as a positive control. in addition, tolerance of lactobacilli to heat, acid, bile, zn(2+) and cu(2+) were assessed. all five selected strains, lactobacillus salivarius zj614 (jn981856), lactobacillus reuteri zj616 (jn981858), l. reuteri zj617 (jn981859), l. reuteri zj621 (jn981863) and l. reuteri zj623 (jn981865), showed inhibition against the two pathogens, e. coli k88 and s. enteritidis 50335. l. reuteri zj621 showed higher inhibition ability than the others to s. enteritidis 50335 (p < 0.05). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis indicated that all five strains had abundant bands with molecular weight ranging from 34 to 130 kda as well as had a common band of approximately 42 kda. after treatment with 5 m licl to remove s-layer protein, the inhibition activities of the lactobacilli against pathogens decreased significantly (p < 0.05). the results showed that higher adhesive ability means higher inhibition activity for lactobacillus against pathogen, in which s-layer proteins plays an important role.
fate of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enteritidis and listeria monocytogenes during storage of fermented green table olives in brine.
the survival of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enteritidis and listeria monocytogenes during the storage of fermented green table olives cv. halkidiki in brine was studied in parallel with the evolution of lactic acid bacteria (lab), yeasts and ph. the olives were previously fermented with a starter culture (a potential probiotic strain of lactobacillus pentosus b281--starter process) or with the indigenous microbiota (control). after the end of fermentation, olives were placed in brine, inoculated with a cocktail of 5 strains of e. coli o157:h7, 5 strains of l. monocytogenes and 4 strains of s. enteritidis, with a final concentration in the brine of ca. 7.0 log cfu/ml, and subsequently packaged in polyethylene pouches and stored at 20 degrees c. the population of e. coli o157:h7 reduced gradually and was detected in the brine until the 27th day of storage in both cases (i.e., starter and control process), and on olive fruits until the 19th and 16th days of storage in the starter and control process, respectively. s. enteritidis population showed also a decrease and it was detected until the 21st day of storage in both brine and olive fruits in both cases. the population of l. monocytogenes declined during storage and it was detected until the 31st day of storage in both brine and olive fruits in both cases, showing a longer survival period in comparison to the other two studied pathogens. the presence of the potential probiotic starter did not affect the pathogen survival. the results demonstrated that even though the growth of the pathogenic strains was not supported, they may survive for a long period in a stressful environment of a fermented product with low ph value (4.2) and high salt concentration (6.0%). these results are a valuable contribution to risk assessment studies related to ready to eat foods in general.
macrophage environment turns otherwise mccj25-resistant salmonella into sensitive.
background: microcin j25 (mccj25) is a plasmid-encoded antibiotic peptide produced by escherichia coli (e. coli). mccj25 enters into the sensitive e. coli strains by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd and sbma. the resistance of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium) to mccj25 is attributed to the inability of its fhua protein to incorporate the antibiotic into the cell. results: in this work we demonstrate that s. typhimurium becomes notably susceptible to mccj25 when replicating within macrophages. in order to determine the possible cause of this phenomenon, we studied the sensitivity of s. typhimurium to mccj25 at conditions resembling those of the internal macrophage environment, such as low ph, low magnesium and iron deprivation. we observed that the strain was only sensitive to the antibiotic at low ph, leading us to attribute the bacterial sensitization to this condition. a mccj25-resistant e. coli strain in which fhua is deleted was also inhibited by the antibiotic at low ph. then, we could assume that the mccj25 sensitivity change observed in both e. coli fhua and s. typhimurium is mediated by a mccj25 uptake independent of the fhua receptor. moreover, low ph incubation also sensitized s. typhimurium to the hydrophobic antibiotic novobiocin, which does not affect enteric bacteria viability because it is unable to penetrate the bacterial outer membrane. this observation supports our hypothesis about low ph producing a modification in the bacterial membrane permeability that allows an unspecific mccj25 uptake. on the other hand, mccj25 inhibited s. typhimurium when cells were preincubated in acidic ph medium and then treated at neutral ph with the antibiotic. conclusions: our results suggest that acidic condition does not alter mccj25 hydrophobicity but irreversibly modifies bacterial membrane permeability. this would allow an unspecific antibiotic uptake into the cell.from our data it is possible to infer that intracellular pathogenic strains, which are in vitro resistant to mccj25, could become susceptible ones in vivo. therefore, the mccj25 action spectrum would be broader than what in vitro experiments indicate.
inhibition of polymerase chain reaction for the detection of escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica on walnut kernels.
the aim of this study was to determine whether escherichia coli o157:h7 can be reliably detected and isolated from walnut kernels using standard methods of analysis. the limit of detection approached 1 cell per analytical unit (25 g) for e. coli o157:h7 on walnut kernels enriched in modified tryptic soy broth with 20 mug/ml novobiocin and plating onto selective agar media. the presence of pcr inhibitors in walnut kernels was indicated by the failure to detect e. coli o157:h7 from culture positive enrichment broths analysed by pcr, with two separate polymerase and reagent compositions (dupont bax e. coli o157:h7 mp system, promega gotaq green for stx) and three methods of template preparation (dupont bax, qiagen dneasy, bio-rad instagene). pcr inhibition was overcome by 1:100 dilution in te buffer of the dneasy or instagene template. pcr inhibition was not relieved by dilution of the bax template. similar results were observed for walnut kernels inoculated with salmonella enterica and analysed for inva, indicating that pcr inhibition is not specific to the organism or primer/template. these results indicate that analysis of walnut kernels for pathogens should be with culture based methods or use protocols for dna template preparation modified to remove or dilute inhibitors and the need for internal amplification controls in pcr methods.
safety assessment and probiotic evaluation of enterococcus faecium yf5 isolated from sourdough.
enterococcus faecium yf5, a strain previously isolated from sourdough, was assessed for safety and probiotic potential. its virulence and antibiotic resistant phenotypes (cytolysin and gelatinase production, antibiotic susceptibility) and genes (cyla, gele, ace, agg, esp, and vana) were surveyed. results indicated that the tested virulence determinants were nontoxic. in addition, e. faecium yf5 was sensitive to 3 antibiotics such as amoxicillin, vancomycin, and chloramphenicol. furthermore, results of in vivo animal acute oral toxicity of e. faecium yf5 studies were similar to the control group that indicated no abnormalities. in addition, e. faecium yf5 stably survived in low ph, bile salts, gastric, and intestinal fluids in vitro. moreover, e. faecium yf5 was found to adhere to human colon cancer cell line ht-29 at 3.39 (+/-0.67) x 10(5) cfu/ml. when cocultured with pathogenic organisms (enterobacter sakazakii cmcc45402, escherichia coli cmcc44102, enterohemorrhage escherichia coli o157: h7 cmcc44828, salmonella typhimurium cmcc50071, shigella flexneri 301, and shigella sonnei atcc 29930) and 2 gram-positive strains (listeria monocytogenes cmcc54001 and staphylococcus aureus cmcc 26003), it inhibited these foodborne pathogens with exception of s. aureus. therefore, e. faecium yf5 can be regarded as a safe strain and it may be used as a probiotic preparation or for microecologics.
recombinant heat shock protein 60 (hsp60/groel) of salmonella enterica serovar typhi elicits cross-protection against multiple bacterial pathogens in mice.
heat shock proteins (hsps) or stress proteins are recognized as protective antigens against a wide range of bacterial diseases. conservation of hsps across different life forms also appears to contribute to the antigenicity of these proteins. due to their high sequence homology, there exists an immunological cross-recognition between different bacterial species. in the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of recombinant groel of salmonella enterica serovar typhi as a vaccine candidate against various bacterial pathogens viz.; shigella dysenteriae type i, shigella flexneri, shigella boydii, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in vitro serum bactericidal assay (sba) with groel antisera showed 50-55% inhibition of cells of shigella spp., 65-75% of e. coli, 60-65% of k. pneumoniae, 45-50% of p. aeruginosa. in in vivo experiments, mice immunized with groel protein of s. typhi showed 60-65% protection against s. flexneri, s. dysenteriae type i, s. boydii. similarly 75-80% protection was observed against enteropathogenic e. coli, 70-80% against k. pneumoniae. 50% of mice survived the lethal infection against p. aeruginosa. organ burden and histopathological studies also revealed significant reduction of bacterial infection. this study shows the cross-protective efficacy of recombinant groel of s. typhi which could lead to the development of a single vaccine candidate protective against multiple bacterial pathogens.
antimicrobial activity of nanodispersed thymol in tryptic soy broth.
food safety is a continuing challenge for the food industry due to sporadic illness outbreaks caused by foodborne pathogens. plant essential oils have been studied extensively as natural antimicrobials to control foodborne pathogens. however, their hydrophobic nature makes application in foods difficult because of their low water solubility, adverse impact on sensory quality, and binding with food components, which can interfere with antimicrobial efficacy. the objective of this study was to characterize antimicrobial activities of transparent nanodispersions of thymol encapsulated in whey protein isolate-maltodextrin conjugates, with comparison to free thymol. tests were conducted for escherichia coli o157:h7 strains atcc 43889 and 43894, salmonella typhimurium strain 2576, listeria monocytogenes strains scott a and 101, and staphylococcus aureus strains 27708 and sa113 in tryptic soy broth at various phs and temperatures. results indicate that the mic for nanodispersed and free thymol against all strains of both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens tested was 500 ppm at ph 6.8 and at the optimal growth temperature, with the exception of e. coli o157:h7 and l. monocytogenes strain scott a, which were inhibited by 300 ppm of free thymol. nanodispersed thymol was further tested at 500 ppm for inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 and l. monocytogenes at 35, 32, 25, and 4 degrees c in tryptic soy broth adjusted to ph 5.5 and 3.5. at ph 5.5, l. monocytogenes was completely inhibited after 3 h, and e. coli o157:h7 showed a reduction of 1.0 to 3.0 log cfu/ml after 48 h. at ph 3.5, l. monocytogenes controls did not grow, but e. coli o157:h7 survived. at both ph 5.5 and 3.5, no significant effect of temperature on antimicrobial activity was observed at 500 mg/ml nanodispersed thymol. the present study demonstrated that transparent nanodispersions of thymol have promising antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of foodborne pathogens.
antibacterial activity of some medicinal plants grown in jordan.
in the present study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of 16 jordanian medicinal plant extracts against four reference bacteria; staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter faecalis, escherichia coli, and salmonella typhi. for that purpose, whole plants were extracted and antimicrobial susceptibility testing and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were determined. ethanolic extracts of most medicinal plants exerted a dose-dependent cytotoxiciy against different reference bacteria. origanum syriaca, varthemia iphionoides, psidium guajava, sarcopoterium spinosa plant extracts were most active against s. aureus (mic; 70 mug/ml), e. faecalis (mic; 130 mug/ml), e. coli (mic; 153 mug/ml), and s. typhi (mic; 110 mug/ml), respectively. results indicate that medicinal plants grown in jordan might be a valuable source of starting materials for the extraction and/or isolation of new antibacterial agents.
antibacterial activity and probiotic potential of lactobacillus plantarum hkn01:  a new insight into the morphological changes of antibacterial compound-treated escherichia coli by electron microscopy.
among several bacteria examined, an antibacterial-producing lactobacillus strain  with probiotic characteristics was selected and identified based on 16s rrna gene sequencing. subsequent purification and mode of action of the antibacterial compounds on target cells including e. coli were investigated. maximum production of the antibacterial compound was recorded at 18 h incubation at 30 degrees c. interestingly, antibacterial activity remained unchanged after heating at 121 degrees c for 45 min, 24 h storage in temperature range of 70 degrees c to room temperature, and 15 min exposure to uv light, and it was stable in the ph of range 2-10. the active compounds were inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, indicating their proteinaceous nature, and, therefore, referred to as bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. isolation and partial purification of the effective agent was done by performing ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration chromatography. the molecular mass of the gfc-purified active compound (~3 kda) was determined by tris-tricine sds-page. to predict the mechanisms of action, transmission electron microscopy (tem) analysis of ultrathin sections of e. coli before and after antibacterial treatment was carried out. tem analysis of antibacterial compounds-treated e. coli demonstrated that the completely altered bacteria appear much darker compared with the less altered bacteria, suggesting a change in the cytoplasmic composition. there were also some membrane-bound convoluted structures visible within the completely altered bacteria, which could be attributed to the response of the e. coli to the treatment with the antibacterial compound. according to the in vivo experiments oral administration of l. plantarum hkn01 resulted in recovery of infected balb/c mice with salmonella enterica ser. typhimurium.
synthesis and characterization of bactericidal silver nanoparticles using cultural filtrate of simulated microgravity grown klebsiella pneumoniae.
silver nanoparticles were synthesized by biological method using cultural filtrate of klebsiella pneumoniae cultured under simulated microgravity and silver nitrate solution as precursor. the nanoparticles exhibited typical plasmon absorption maximum of silver nanoparticles between 405 and 407 nm. spherical silver nanoparticles were found to have size between 15 and 37 nm by tem analysis. xrd pattern corresponding to planes (111), (200), (220) (311) revealed the crystalline nature of the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles. ftir spectrum proposed stabilization of silver nanoparticles by the protein molecules present in the cultural filtrate. the silver nanoparticles exhibited high bactericidal activity against salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and moderate bactericidal activity against streptococcus pyogenes.
salmonella enterica suppresses pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum population and soft rot progression by acidifying the microaerophilic environment.
although enteric human pathogens are usually studied in the context of their animal hosts, a significant portion of their life cycle occurs on plants. plant disease alters the phyllosphere, leading to enhanced growth of human pathogens; however, the impact of human pathogens on phytopathogen biology and plant health is largely unknown. to characterize the interaction between human pathogens and phytobacterial pathogens in the phyllosphere, we examined the interactions between pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and salmonella enterica or escherichia coli o157:h7 with regard to bacterial populations, soft rot progression, and changes in local ph. the presence of p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum enhanced the growth of both s. enterica and e. coli o157:h7 on leaves. however, in a microaerophilic environment, s. enterica reduced p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum populations and soft rot progression by moderating local environmental ph. reduced soft rot was not due to s. enterica proteolytic activity. limitations on p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum growth, disease progression, and ph elevation were not observed on leaves coinoculated with e. coli o157:h7 or when leaves were coinoculated with s. enterica in an aerobic environment. s. enterica also severely undermined the relationship between the phytobacterial population and disease progression of a p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum budb mutant defective in the 2,3-butanediol pathway for acid neutralization. our results show that s. enterica and e. coli o157:h7 interact differently with the enteric phytobacterial pathogen p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum. s. enterica inhibition of soft rot progression may conceal a rapidly growing human pathogen population. whereas soft rotted produce can alert consumers to the possibility of food-borne pathogens, healthy-looking produce may entice consumption of contaminated vegetables. importance: salmonella enterica and escherichia coli o157:h7 may use plants to move between animal and human hosts. their populations are higher on plants cocolonized with the common bacterial soft rot pathogen pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, turning edible plants into a risk factor for human disease. we inoculated leaves with p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and s. enterica or e. coli o157:h7 to study the interactions between these bacteria. while p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum enhanced the growth of both s. enterica and e. coli o157:h7, these human pathogens affected p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum fundamentally differently. s. enterica reduced p. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum growth and acidified the environment, leading to less soft rot on leaves; e. coli o157:h7 had no such effects. as soft rot signals a food safety risk, the reduction of soft rot symptoms in the presence of s. enterica may lead consumers to eat healthy-looking but s. enterica-contaminated produce.
competitive inhibition of three novel bacteria isolated from faeces of breast milk-fed infants against selected enteropathogens.
numerous in vitro and in vivo studies conducted using different probiotic micro-organisms have demonstrated their ability to interfere with the growth and virulence of a variety of enteropathogens. the reported beneficial effects of the use of probiotics to complement antibiotic therapy or prevent diarrhoea or gastrointestinal infection in infants have increased in recent years. in the present study, we demonstrated the capacity of supernatants obtained from three novel probiotics (lactobacillus paracasei cncm i-4034, bifidobacterium breve cncm i-4035 and lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm i-4036) isolated from the faeces of breastfed infants to inhibit the growth of enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic (epec) bacteria, such as escherichia coli, salmonella and shigella. to assess their potential antimicrobial activity, the 17 and 24 h cell-free supernatants broth concentrates (10x) having 1, 2 or 4 % of the three probiotics were incubated with epec bacteria strains. after 17 h of co-culture, the supernatants were able to inhibit the growth of e. coli, salmonella and shigella up to 40, 55 and 81 %, respectively. however, the inhibitory capacity of some supernatants was maintained or completely lost when the supernatants (ph 3.0) were neutralised (ph 6.5). overall, these results demonstrated that l. paracasei cncm i-4034, b. breve cncm i-4035 and l. rhamnosus cncm i-4036 produce compounds that exhibited strain-specific inhibition of enterobacteria and have the potential to be used as probiotics in functional foods.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of cichorium intybus root extract using  orthogonal matrix design.
solvent, impregnation time, sonication repetitions, and ultrasonic power were important factors in the process of ultrasound-assisted extraction from chicory (cichorium intybus) root, while there were no studies about optimizing these 4 factors for extract yield, total phenolic content (tpc), antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal activity of the extracts using orthogonal matrix design. the present research demonstrated that the solvent composition played a significant role in the improving extract yield, tpc, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities. the other 3 factors had inequable effect on different purposes, ultrasonic power could improve tpc and antioxidant activity, but long time of extraction lowered antioxidant activity. the tpc increased from 22.34 to 27.87 mg gae (gallic acid equivalents)/100 g (dry extracts) with increasing solvent polarity. the half inhibition concentration (ic(50,) mug/ml) of the radical scavenging activity of the chicory extracts ranged from 281.00 to 983.33 mug/ml. the content of caffeoylquinic acids of root extract, which was extracted by the optimal combination was 0.104%. several extracts displayed antibacterial activities against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella typhi, while penicillium sp. and aspergillus sp. resisted against all the extracts. combination of 70% ethanol v/v, 24-h impregnation time, 3 sonication rounds, and 300-w ultrasonic input power was found to be the optimal combination for the chicory extract yield, tpc, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial activity.
zoonotic fecal pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in county fair animals.
livestock fairs present a unique opportunity for the public to experience close contact with animals, but may also expose people to zoonotic pathogens through contact with animal feces. the goal of this study was to screen cattle, sheep, goat, chicken, rabbit and horse feces from a livestock fair in california for the potentially zoonotic pathogens escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella, campylobacter, vibrio, cryptosporidium and giardia spp., as well as determining the level of antimicrobial resistance in e. coli and salmonella. notably, e. coli o157:h7 was reported for the first time in a pig at a county fair in california. campylobacter jejuni as well as salmonella enterica serovars derby and thompson were also isolated from pigs, cattle, sheep, goats or chickens, whereas horses and rabbits were negative for all target pathogens. the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance as well as multi-drug resistance patterns were highest for e. coli and salmonella spp. cultured from pigs and chickens, were generally widespread but at lower levels for other animal groups, and included resistance to ampicillin and streptomycin, two antimicrobial drugs of importance for human medicine. this study provides data that highlight the importance of practicing good hygiene in livestock fair settings to avoid transmission of zoonotic microbes, particularly pathogens with antimicrobial resistance, to fair visitors and among animal populations.
a novel synthetic peptide from a tomato defensin exhibits antibacterial activities against helicobacter pylori.
defensins are a class of cysteine-rich proteins, which exert broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this work, we used a bioinformatic approach to identify putative defensins in the tomato genome. fifteen proteins had a mature peptide that includes the well-conserved tetradisulfide array. we selected a representative member of the tomato defensin family; we chemically synthesized its gamma-motif and tested its antimicrobial activity. here, we demonstrate that the synthetic peptide exhibits potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus a170, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes, and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi, escherichia coli, and helicobacter pylori. in addition, the synthetic peptide shows minimal (<5%) hemolytic activity and absence of cytotoxic effects against thp-1 cells. finally, solyc exerts an anti-inflammatory activity in vitro, as it downregulates the level of the proinflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma.
1-alkyl-(n,n-dimethylamino)pyridinium bromides: inhibitory effect on virulence factors of candida albicans and on the growth of bacterial pathogens.
a homologous series of 1-alkyl-(n,n-dimethylamino)pyridinium bromides, termed compounds 1-11, was synthesized and studied for antibacterial and antifungal activity. of these, compound 8, containing a ten-carbon alkyl chain, showed maximum inhibition against all the tested bacterial strains. the highest antibacterial activity using a disc diffusion method was recorded against mycobacterium smegmatis [zone of inhibition (zoi): 45.75+/-0.25 mm], followed by escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, vibrio cholerae, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella typhi. in addition to antibacterial activity, compounds 3-11 displayed good inhibitory action against the human opportunistic yeast pathogens cryptococcus neoformans and various candida spp. the maximum zoi was observed against cryptococcus neoformans (51.5+/-0.5 mm) using compound 8, with zois of 23.5+/-0.5, 32.0+/-0.0, 27.75+/-0.25 and 41.5+/-0.5 mm against candida albicans, candida glabrata, candida tropicalis and candida krusei, respectively. furthermore, compound 8 caused inhibition of the candidal yeast-hyphae transition at a concentration of 0.29 microm and also inhibited the secretion of extracellular hydrolytic enzyme such as secreted aspartyl proteinase at subinhibitory concentrations. compound 8 showed very little haemolytic activity at a concentration of 0.58 microm (1.315+/-0.75 %), with its highest haemolytic activity (47.806+/-2.32 %) observed at a concentration of 2.9 microm.
effect of frequency and waveform on inactivation of escherichia coli o157:h7 and  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in salsa by ohmic heating.
the effect of frequency of alternating current during ohmic heating on electrode  corrosion, heating rate, inactivation of food-borne pathogens, and quality of salsa was investigated. the impact of waveform on heating rate was also investigated. salsa was treated with various frequencies (60 hz to 20 khz) and waveforms (sine, square, and sawtooth) at a constant electric field strength of 12.5 v/cm. electrode corrosion did not occur when the frequency exceeded 1 khz. the heating rate of the sample was dependent on frequency up to 500 hz, but there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the heating rate when the frequency was increased above 1 khz. the electrical conductivity of the sample increased with a rise in the frequency. at a frequency of 60 hz, the square wave produced a lower heating rate than that of sine and sawtooth waves. the heating rate between waveforms was not significantly (p > 0.05) different when the frequency was >500 hz. as the frequency increased, the treatment time required to reduce escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium to below the detection limit (1 log cfu/g) decreased without affecting product quality. these results suggest that ohmic heating can be effectively used to pasteurize salsa and that the effect of inactivation is dependent on frequency and electrical conductivity rather than waveform.
tlr4 is a target of environmentally relevant concentration of lead.
lead (pb) alters the susceptibility to different pathogens suggesting that macrophage-mediated defense mechanisms, through activation of toll-like receptors (tlrs), may be affected by pb. the aim of this study was to test whether activation of tlr4 is a targeted molecule to the effect of environmentally relevant pb concentrations (0.05, 0.5 and 5mug/dl). the function of macrophages activated through tlr4 was evaluated using as tlr4 ligand lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from two different pathogens: escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. pb induced proliferation, increased the no(-) baseline, il-1beta and il-6 secretion. interestingly, pb exposure induced differential effects on cells stimulated with the two lps used: in macrophages stimulated with lps from e. coli, pb caused an early decrease in proliferation, increase no(-) production, and decrease il-6 and tnf-alpha secretion; in macrophages stimulated with lps from s. typhimurium, pb decreased proliferation after 36h, induced a biphasic effect on no(-) production, and enhance the secretion of il-1beta, il-6 and tnf-alpha. results suggest that tlr4 is a target for the pb effect, which up to 5.0mug/dl affect immune competence against pathogens, dependent on the bacterial species. this effect may be attributable to structural differences that determine lps affinity for tlr4.
reduced na+ affinity increases turnover of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium melb.
the melibiose permease of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (melb(st)) catalyzes symport of melibiose with na(+), li(+), or h(+). bioinformatics and mutational analyses indicate that a conserved gly117 (helix iv) is a component of the na(+)-binding site. in this study, gly117 was mutated to ser, asn, or cys. all three mutations increase the maximum rate (v(max)) for melibiose transport in escherichia coli dw2 and greatly decrease na(+) affinity, indicating that intracellular release of na(+) is facilitated. rapid melibiose transport, particularly by the g117n mutant, triggers osmotic lysis in the lag phase of growth. the findings support the previous conclusion that gly117 plays an important role in cation binding and translocation. furthermore, a spontaneous second-site mutation (p148l between loop(4-5) and helix v) in the g117c mutant prevents cell lysis. this mutation significantly decreases v(max) with little effect on cosubstrate binding in g117c, g117s, and g117n mutants. thus, the p148l mutation specifically inhibits transport velocity and thereby blocks the lethal effect of elevated melibiose transport in the gly117 mutants.
soluble plantain fibre blocks adhesion and m-cell translocation of intestinal pathogens.
dietary fibres may have prebiotic effects mediated by promotion of beneficial bacteria. this study explores the possibility that soluble plant fibre may also improve health by inhibiting epithelial adhesion and translocation by pathogenic bacteria. we have focussed on soluble non-starch polysaccharide (nsp) from plantain bananas (musa spp.) which previous studies showed to be particularly effective at blocking escherichia coli epithelial adherence. in vitro and ex vivo studies assessed the ability of plantain nsp to inhibit epithelial cell adhesion and invasion of various bacterial pathogens, and to inhibit their translocation through microfold (m)-cells and human peyer's patches mounted in ussing chambers. plantain nsp showed dose-related inhibition of epithelial adhesion and m-cell translocation by a range of pathogens. at 5mg/ml, a concentration readily achievable in the gut lumen, plantain nsp inhibited adhesion to caco2 cells by salmonella typhimurium (85.0 +/- 8.2%, p<.01), shigella sonnei (46.6 +/- 29.3%, p<.01), enterotoxigenic e.coli (56.1 +/- 23.7%, p<.05) and clostridium difficile (67.6 +/- 12.3%, p<.001), but did not inhibit adhesion by enteropathogenic e.coli. plantain nsp also inhibited invasion of caco2 cells by s. typhimurium (80.2 +/- 9.7%) and sh. sonnei (46.7 +/- 13.4%); p<.01. plantain nsp, 5mg/ml, also inhibited translocation of s. typhimurium and sh. sonnei across m-cells by 73.3 +/- 5.2% and 46.4 +/- 7.7% respectively (p<.05). similarly, s. typhimurium translocation across peyer's patches was reduced 65.9 +/- 8.1% by plantain nsp (p<.01). soluble plantain fibre can block epithelial adhesion and m-cell translocation of intestinal pathogens. this represents an important novel mechanism by which soluble dietary fibres can promote intestinal health and prevent infective diarrhoea.
the antimicrobial effects of propolis collected in different regions in the basque country (northern spain).
the antimicrobial activity of 19 propolis extracts prepared in different solvents (ethanol and propylene glycol) (eep/pep), was evaluated against some bacterial and fungal isolates using the agar-well diffusion method. it was verified that all the samples tested showed antimicrobial activity, although results varied considerably between samples. results revealed that both types of propolis extracts showed highly sensitive antimicrobial action against gram-positive bacteria and fungi at a concentration of 20% (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisae) with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, with a moderate effect against streptococcus pyogenes (mic from 17 to 26 mg/ml). to our knowledge, this is the first study showing elevated antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria [salmonella enterica (mic from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/ml)] and lesser activity against helicobacter pylori (mic from 6 to 14 mg/ml), while escherichia coli was resistant. this concluded that the basque propolis had a strong and dose-dependent activity against most of the microbial strains tested, while database comparison revealed that phenolic substances were responsible for this inhibition, regardless of their geographical origin and the solvent employed for extraction. statistical analysis showed no significant differences (p </= 0.05) between eep and pep extracts.
a pro-drug approach for selective modulation of ai-2-mediated bacterial cell-to-cell communication.
the universal quorum sensing autoinducer, ai-2, is utilized by several bacteria.  analogs of ai-2 have the potential to modulate bacterial behavior. selectively quenching the communication of a few bacteria, in the presence of several others in an ecosystem, using analogs of ai-2 is non-trivial due to the ubiquity of ai-2 processing receptors in many bacteria that co-exist. herein, we demonstrate that when an ai-2 analog, isobutyl dpd (which has been previously shown to be a quorum sensing, qs, quencher in both escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium) is modified with ester groups, which get hydrolyzed once inside the bacterial cells, only qs in e. coli, but not in s. typhimurium, is inhibited. the origin of this differential qs inhibition could be due to differences in analog permeation of the bacterial membranes or ester hydrolysis rates. such differences could be utilized to selectively target qs in specific bacteria amongst a consortium of other species that also use ai-2 signaling.
antimicrobial food packaging film based on the release of lae from evoh.
the aim of this work was to develop antimicrobial films for active packaging applications containing the natural antimicrobial compound lae (lauramide arginine ethyl ester) in evoh copolymers with different mol % ethylene contents (i.e. evoh-29 and evoh-44). evoh-29 and evoh-44 films were made by casting and incorporating 0.25%, 1%, 5%, and 10% lae in the film forming solution (w/w with respect to polymer weight). previously, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of lae against listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, and salmonella enterica were determined by a microdilution assay. the antimicrobial activity of the resulting films was tested in vitro against these microorganisms in liquid culture media. the activity of the films was also evaluated over time. the results showed that films containing 5% and 10% lae produced total growth inhibition and viable counts decreased with 0.25% and 1% lae. finally, the effectiveness of the films was tested by applying them to an infant formula milk inoculated with l. monocytogenes and s. enterica and stored for 6 days at 4 degrees c. the application of films with lae to infant formula milk inoculated with l. monocytogenes reduced at the end of storage period about 4 log in case of 10% lae and with s. enterica reduced 3.74 log and 3.95 log with evoh 29 5% and 10%, respectively, and evoh-44 5% and 10% lae reduced 1 log and 3.27 log, respectively, at the end of storage. the antimicrobial capacity of evoh-29 films was greater than that of evoh-44 films in all the cases tested. in general, the films were more effective in inhibiting the growth of l. monocytogenes than s. enterica, this inhibition being more acute at the end of the storage time.
antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the leaf essential oil and its constituents furanodienone and curzerenone from lindera pulcherrima (nees.) benth. ex hook. f.
background: lindera pulcherrima (nees.) benth. ex hook. f. (family: lauraceae), an evergreen shrub, is an important medicinal plant distributed in temperate himalayan regions. the leaves and bark are used as spice in cold, fever, and cough. materials and methods: in this study, the terpenoid composition, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of the leaf essential oil and its major constituents are being analyzed. conclusion: the in vitro antioxidant activity showed a potent free radical scavenging activity for the essential oil as evidenced by a low ic(50) value for dpph radical followed by furanodienone (0.087 +/- 0.03 and 1.164 +/- 0.58 mg/ml respectively) and the inhibition of lipid peroxidation for the oil and furanodienone also followed the same order (ic(50) 0.74 +/- 0.13 and 2.12 +/- 0.49 mg/ml, respectively). the oil and the constituents were also tested against three gram negative (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica enterica, and (pasturella multocida) and one gram positive (staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. the essential oil was effective against s. aureus (iz = 19.0 +/- 0.34; mic 3.90 mul/ml) while furanodienone showed potent activity against e. coli and s. enterica enterica (iz = 18.0 +/- 0.14 and 16.0 +/- 0.10 respectively). on the other hand, curzerenone was found to be slightly effective against e. coli (iz = 10.8 +/- 0.52). the mic value of the essential oil was least against s. aureus (mic = 3.90 mul/ml) and that of furanodienone against e. coli (mic = 3.90 mul/ml).
functional and expressional analyses of the anti-flhd4c2 factor gene ydiv in escherichia coli.
although escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium have a similar flagellar regulatory system, the response of flagellar synthesis to nutrient conditions is quite different between the two: that is, in low-nutrient conditions, flagellar synthesis is inhibited in salmonella and enhanced in e. coli. in salmonella, this inhibition is mediated by an anti-flhd(4)c(2) factor, ydiv, which is expressed in low-nutrient conditions and binds to flhd(4)c(2) to inhibit the expression of the class 2 flagellar genes. the fliz gene encodes a repressor of the ydiv gene, and thus is required for efficient flagellar gene expression in low-nutrient conditions in salmonella. in this study, we showed that the e. coli ydiv gene encodes a protein which inhibits motility and flagellar production when expressed from a multicopy plasmid. we showed further that e. coli ydiv binds to flhd(4)c(2) and inhibits its binding to the class 2 flagellar promoter. these results indicate that e. coli ydiv can also act as an anti-flhd(4)c(2) factor. however, although the ydiv gene was transcribed efficiently in e. coli cells, the intracellular level of the ydiv protein was extremely low due to its inefficient translation. consistent with this, e. coli cells did not require fliz for efficient motility development. this indicates that, unlike in salmonella, the fliz-ydiv regulatory system does not work in the nutritional control of flagellar gene expression in e. coli.
superfolder gfp reporters validate diverse new mrna targets of the classic porin  regulator, micf rna.
micf is a textbook example of a small regulatory rna (srna) that acts on a trans-encoded target mrna through imperfect base pairing. discovery of micf as a post-transcriptional repressor of the major escherichia coli porin ompf established the paradigm for a meanwhile common mechanism of translational inhibition, through antisense sequestration of a ribosome binding site. however, whether micf regulates additional genes has remained unknown for almost three decades. here, we have harnessed the new superfolder variant of gfp for reporter-gene fusions to validate newly predicted targets of micf in salmonella. we show that the conserved 5' end of micf acts by seed pairing to repress the mrnas of global transcriptional regulator lrp, and periplasmic protein yaho, while a second targeting region is also required to regulate the mrna of the lipid a-modifying enzyme lpxr. interestingly, micf targets lpxr at both the ribosome binding site and deep within the coding sequence. micf binding in the coding sequence of lpxr decreases mrna stability through exacerbating the use of a native rnase e site proximal to the short micf-lpxr duplex. altogether, this study assigns the classic micf srna to the growing class of hfq-associated regulators that use diverse mechanisms to impact multiple loci.
microelectrode array biosensor for studying carbohydrate-mediated interactions.
carbohydrate-mediated host-pathogen interactions are essential to bacterial and viral pathogenesis, and represent an attractive target for the development of antiadhesives to prevent infection. we present a versatile microelectrode array-based platform to investigate carbohydrate-mediated protein and bacterial binding, with the objective of developing a generalizable method for screening inhibitors of host-microbe interactions. microelectrode arrays are well suited for interrogating biological binding events, including proteins and whole-cells, and are amenable to electrochemical derivitization, facilitating rapid deposition of biomolecules. in this study, we achieve microelectrode functionalization with carbohydrates via controlled polymerization of pyrrole to individual microelectrodes, followed by physisorption of neoglycoconjugates to the polypyrrole-coated electrodes. bioactivity of the immobilized carbohydrates was confirmed with carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) detected by both fluorescent and electrochemical means. the platform's ability to analyze whole-cell binding was demonstrated using strains of escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, and the dose-dependent inhibition of s. enterica by a soluble carbohydrate antiadhesive.
suppression of error prone pathway is responsible for antimutagenic activity of honey.
honey, both unifloral (syzygiumcumini) and bifloral, demonstrated strong antimutagenicity against physical (uv, gamma) and chemical (ethylmethane sulfonate) mutagens as ascertained by rpob/rifr and ames tests. the effect of honey was evaluated in radiation (uv or gamma) exposed escherichia coli cells for sos response, a well known error prone repair pathway known to significantly contribute to mutagenicity by quantifying lexa repressor level, measuring cell filamentation frequency, and prophage induction by sivet (selectable--in-vivo expression technology) assay. lexa was almost completely degraded, phenotypically long filamentous cells ( approximately 30 mum) were formed, and sivet induction frequency was increased in radiation exposed e. coli cultures, however, these changes were significantly inhibited in presence of honey confirming its strong antimutagenic nature. further, rpob/rifr mutation frequency upon uv exposure in e. coli reca- cells was found to be negligible, whereas, e. coliumuc- and umud- knockouts showed comparatively higher mutation frequency. honey did not show any effect on mutagenesis in these knockouts, indicating the sos dependence of the observed mutagenesis. honey was also found to suppress ems induced mutagenesis but through sos independent mechanism. phenolics present in honey were found to be one of the important factors contributing to the antimutagenicity of honey.
the antimicrobial properties of the lowbush blueberry (vaccinium angustifolium) fractional components against foodborne pathogens and the conservation of probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus.
the antimicrobial properties of lowbush blueberry (vaccinium angustifolium) were  studied against escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and lactobacillus rhamnosus to determine which fractional components have antimicrobial effects and which microorganisms are most susceptible to these antimicrobial properties. lowbush blueberry extract (f1) was separated using a c-18 sep-pak cartridge into monomeric phenolics (f2) and anthocyanins plus proanthocyanidins (f3). fraction 3 was further separated into anthocyanins (f4) and proanthocyanidins (f5) using a lh-20 sephadex column. each fraction was initially screened for antimicrobial properties using agar diffusion assay. treatments that demonstrated inhibition were further analyzed for inhibition in liquid culture. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined using a two-fold dilution series and viable cell counts taken at 0 and 24 h to examine growth reduction. fraction 3 demonstrated the lowest mics/mbcs followed by f1, f2, f4, and f5. l. monocytogenes was the most susceptible to blueberry fraction treatment, followed by e. coli o157:h7, and s. typhimurium. l. rhamnosus was the least susceptible to each fraction treatment. the results can be applied to the field of preventive medicine, food safety, and enrich the understanding of the health benefits of lowbush blueberries.
growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens by oenococcus oeni.
to explore the possibility of using oenococcus oeni to inhibit foodborne pathogens, and to characterize antimicrobial compounds produced by o. oeni, 24 strains of o. oeni were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of foodborne pathogens, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enteritidis, and listeria monocytogenes by using the spot-on-lawn method. of the 24 strains, 17 strains were able to inhibit all 3 pathogens in this study. proteases, catalase, and buffer solutions were used for determining the type of inhibitory compounds produced from 4 selected strains with stronger inhibitory activity. antimicrobial activity of 2 strains against the pathogens was completely inactivated by buffer solution, and other 2 strains against e. coli o157:h7 were partially removed. the antimicrobial compound was not sensitive to selected proteases and catalase. practical application: there is little information available about using o. oeni for human pathogens control. the results of this study revealed such discovery and potential applications for pathogen control.
carriage of antibiotic-resistant enteric bacteria varies among sites in galapagos reptiles.
increased overlap between humans and wildlife populations has increased the risk  for novel disease emergence. detecting contacts with a high risk for transmission of pathogens requires the identification of dependable measures of microbial exchange. we evaluated antibiotic resistance as a molecular marker for the intensity of human-wildlife microbial connectivity in the galapagos islands. we isolated escherichia coli and salmonella enterica from the feces of land iguanas (conolophus sp.), marine iguanas (amblyrhynchus cristatus), giant tortoises (geochelone nigra), and seawater, and tested these bacteria with the use of the disk diffusion method for resistance to 10 antibiotics. antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found in reptile feces from two tourism sites (isla plaza sur and la galapaguera on isla san cristobal) and from seawater close to a public use beach near puerto baquerizo moreno on isla san cristobal. no resistance was detected at two protected beaches on more isolated islands (el miedo on isla santa fe and cape douglas on isla fernandina) and at a coastal tourism site (la loberia on isla san cristobal). eighteen e. coli isolates from three locations, all sites relatively proximate to a port town, were resistant to ampicillin, doxycycline, tetracycline, and trimethoprin/sulfamethoxazole. in contrast, only five s. enterica isolates showed a mild decrease in susceptibility to doxycycline and tetracycline from these same sites (i.e., an intermediate resistance phenotype), but no clinical resistance was detected in this bacterial species. these findings suggest that reptiles living in closer proximity to humans potentially have higher exposure to bacteria of human origin; however, it is not clear from this study to what extent this potential exposure translates to ongoing exchange of bacterial strains or genetic traits. resistance patterns and bacterial exchange in this system warrant further investigation to understand better how human associations influence disease risk in endemic galapagos wildlife.
competition and resilience between founder and introduced bacteria in the caenorhabditis elegans gut.
the microbial communities that reside within the intestinal tract in vertebrates  are complex and dynamic. in this report, we establish the utility of caenorhabditis elegans as a model system for identifying the factors that contribute to bacterial persistence and for host control of gut luminal populations. we found that for n2 worms grown on mixed lawns of bacteria, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium substantially outcompeted escherichia coli, even when e. coli was initially present at 100-fold-higher concentrations. to address whether innate immunity affects the competition, the daf-2 and daf-16 mutants were studied; their total gut bacterial levels reflect overall capacity for colonization, but salmonella outcompeted e. coli to an extent similar to wild-type worms. to address the role of virulence properties, salmonella deltaspi-1 deltaspi-2 was used to compete with e. coli. the net differential was significantly less than that for wild-type salmonella; thus, spi-1 spi-2 encodes c. elegans colonization factors. an e. coli strain with repeated in vivo passage had an enhanced ability to compete against an in vitro-passed e. coli strain and against salmonella. our data provide evidence of active competition for colonization niches in the c. elegans gut, as determined by bacterial factors and subject to in vivo selection.
protective effect of probiotics on salmonella infectivity assessed with combined  in vitro gut fermentation-cellular models.
background: accurate assessment of probiotics with targeted anti-salmonella activity requires suitable models accounting for both, microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions in gut environments. here we report the combination of two original in vitro intestinal models closely mimicking the complex in vivo conditions of the large intestine. effluents from continuous in vitro three-stage fermentation colonic models of salmonella typhimurium infection inoculated with immobilized child microbiota and salmonella were directly applied to confluent mucus-secreting ht29-mtx cell layers. the effects of salmonella, addition of two bacteriocinogenic strains, bifidobacterium thermophilum rbl67 (thermophilicin b67) and escherichia coli l1000 (microcin b17), and inulin were tested on salmonella growth and interactions with epithelial cell layers. salmonella adhesion and invasion were investigated and epithelial integrity assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) measurements and confocal microscopy observation. data from complex effluents were compared with pure salmonella cultures. results: salmonella in effluents of all reactors of the colonic fermentation model stabilized at mean values of 5.3 +/- 0.8 log10 cfu/ml effluent. invasion of cell-associated salmonella was up to 50-fold lower in complex reactor samples compared to pure salmonella cultures. it further depended on environmental factors, with 0.2 +/- 0.1% being measured with proximal, 0.6 +/- 0.2% with transverse and 1.3 +/- 0.7% with distal reactor effluents, accompanied by a similar high decrease of ter across cell monolayers (minus 45%) and disruption of tight junctions. subsequent addition of e. coli l1000 stimulated salmonella growth (6.4 +/- 0.6 log10 cfu/ml effluent of all 3 reactors) and further decreased ter, but led to 10-fold decreased invasion efficiency when tested with distal reactor samples. in contrast, presence of b. thermophilum rbl67 revealed a protective effect on epithelial integrity compared to previous e. coli l1000 periods, as reflected by a significant mean increase of ter by 58% in all reactors. inulin addition enhanced salmonella growth and invasion when tested with distal and proximal reactor samples, respectively, but induced a limited decrease of ter (minus 18%) in all reactors. conclusions: our results highlight the benefits of combining suitable cellular and colonic fermentation models to assess strain-specific first-level host protection properties of probiotics during salmonella infection, providing an efficient system biology tool for preclinical development of new antimicrobials.
microbiological and organoleptic characteristics of beef trim and ground beef treated with acetic acid, lactic acid, acidified sodium chlorite, or sterile water in a simulated commercial processing environment to reduce escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella.
the objective of this study was to validate the effectiveness of acetic and lactic acids (2% and 5%), acidified sodium chlorite (1000ppm), and sterile water in reducing escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium in inoculated beef trim in a simulated processing environment. samples were collected to assess microbial characteristics at three processing points. results from this study indicate that all treatments, including sterile water, reduced pathogen concentrations (p<0.05) of both e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium in ground beef up to 0.5 and 0.6 log by 24h, respectively. in some cases, there were no significant differences between the antimicrobial treatments and the sterile water using this application method. triangle sensory test results of non-inoculated beef indicated there were no differences (p<0.05) in the means of correct responses between controls or antimicrobial treatments at 6 or 24h. while interventions are important for beef trim, use of the interventions must be validated under industry conditions to ensure proper effectiveness.
fate of pathogens in a simulated bioreduction system for livestock carcasses.
the eu animal by-products regulations generated the need for novel methods of storage and disposal of dead livestock. bioreduction prior to rendering or incineration has been proposed as a practical and potentially cost-effective method; however, its biosecurity characteristics need to be elucidated. to address this, salmonella enterica (serovars senftenberg and poona), enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli and a lux-marked strain of escherichia coli o157 were inoculated into laboratory-scale bioreduction vessels containing sheep carcass constituents. numbers of all pathogens and the metabolic activity of e. coli o157 decreased significantly within the liquor waste over time, and only e. faecalis remained detectable after 3months. only very low numbers of salmonella spp. and e. faecalis were detected in bioaerosols, and only at initial stages of the trial. these results further indicate that bioreduction represents a suitable method of storing and reducing the volume of livestock carcasses prior to ultimate disposal.
characterization and comparative genomic analysis of a novel bacteriophage, sfp10, simultaneously inhibiting both salmonella enterica and escherichia coli o157:h7.
salmonella enterica and escherichia coli o157:h7 are major food-borne pathogens causing serious illness. phage sfp10, which revealed effective infection of both s. enterica and e. coli o157:h7, was isolated and characterized. sfp10 contains a 158-kb double-stranded dna genome belonging to the vi01 phage-like family myoviridae. in vitro adsorption assays showed that the adsorption constant rates to both salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 were 2.50 x 10(-)(8) ml/min and 1.91 x 10(-)(8) ml/min, respectively. one-step growth analysis revealed that sfp10 has a shorter latent period (25 min) and a larger burst size (>200 pfu) than ordinary myoviridae phages, suggesting effective host infection and lytic activity. however, differential development of resistance to sfp10 in s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 was observed; bacteriophage-insensitive mutant (bim) frequencies of 1.19 x 10(-)(2) cfu/ml for s. typhimurium and 4.58 x 10(-)(5) cfu/ml for e. coli o157:h7 were found, indicating that sfp10 should be active and stable for control of e. coli o157:h7 with minimal emergence of sfp10-resistant pathogens but may not be for s. typhimurium. specific mutation of rfal in s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 revealed the o antigen as an sfp10 receptor for both bacteria. genome sequence analysis of sfp10 and its comparative analysis with homologous salmonella vi01 and shigella phisbom-ag3 phages revealed that their tail fiber and tail spike genes share low sequence identity, implying that the genes are major host specificity determinants. this is the first report identifying specific infection and inhibition of salmonella typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 by a single bacteriophage.
d-fagomine lowers postprandial blood glucose and modulates bacterial adhesion.
d-fagomine is an iminosugar originally isolated from seeds of buckwheat (fagopyrum sculentum moench), present in the human diet and now available as a pure crystalline product. we tested d-fagomine for activities connected to a reduction in the risk of developing insulin resistance, becoming overweight and suffering from an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria. the activities were: intestinal sucrase inhibition in vitro (rat mucosa and everted intestine sleeves), modulation of postprandial blood glucose in rats, bacterial agglutination and bacterial adhesion to pig intestinal mucosa. when ingested together with sucrose or starch, d-fagomine lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner without stimulating insulin secretion. d-fagomine reduced the area under the curve (0-120 min) by 20 % (p < 0.01) and shifted the time to maximum blood glucose concentration (tmax) by 15 min at doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight when administered together with 1 g sucrose/kg body weight. moreover, d-fagomine (0.14 mm) agglutinated 60 % of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium) populations (p < 0.01), while it did not show this effect on bifidobacterium spp. or lactobacillus spp. at the same concentration, d-fagomine significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited the adhesion of enterobacteriaceae (95-99 % cells in the supernatant) and promoted the adhesion of lactobacillus acidophilus (56 % cells in the supernatant) to intestinal mucosa. d-fagomine did not show any effect on bacterial cell viability. based on all this evidence, d-fagomine may be used as a dietary ingredient or functional food component to reduce the health risks associated with an excessive intake of fast-digestible carbohydrates, or an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.
inhibition of growth of highly resistant bacterial and fungal pathogens by a natural product.
the continuous escalation of resistant bacteria against a wide range of antibiotics necessitates discovering novel unconventional sources of antibiotics. b. oleracea l (red cabbage) is health-promoting food with proven anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. however, it has not been researched adequately for its antimicrobial activity on potential resistant pathogens. the methanol crude extract of b. oleracea l. was investigated for a possible anti-microbial activity. the screening method was conducted using disc diffusion assay against 22 pathogenic bacteria and fungi. it was followed by evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). moreover, the antibacterial and the antifungal activities were confirmed using the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) and the minimum fungicidal concentration (mfc), respectively. remarkable, antibacterial activity was evident particularly against highly infectious microorganisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium as well as against human fungal pathogens, trichophyton rubrum and aspergillus terreus. red cabbage is a rich source of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins being the most abundant class, which might explain its potent antimicrobial action. this extract is potentially novel for future antimicrobials, inexpensive, and readily available at a large scale for pharmaceutical companies for further investigation and processing.
evaluation of abelmoschus moschatus extracts for antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities using in vitro assays.
background: abelmoschus moschatus medik. leaves and seeds are considered as valuable traditional medicine. the aromatic seeds of this plant are aphrodisiac, ophthalmic, cardio tonic, antispasmodic and used in the treatment of intestinal complaints and check queasiness. to give a scientific basis for traditional usage of this medicinal plant, the seed and leaf extracts were evaluated for their antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities. methods: in this study, antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities of a. moschatus extracts were evaluated in a series of in vitro assay involving free radicals, reactive oxygen species and their ic50 values were also determined. the antioxidant activities of the seed and leaf extracts of a. moschatus were determined by total antioxidant, dpph, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (frap) methods. in addition, the antiproliferative activity was also evaluated using colorectal adenocarcinoma and retinoblastoma human cancer cell lines. moreover, six bacterial reference strains, two gram-positive (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus), four gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and salmonella enterica paratyphi) and one fungal strain (candida albicans) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial activity. results: the results from this study showed that the antioxidant activities of a. moschatus as determined by the total phenol, flavonoids, total antioxidant and frap methods were higher in leaf than that of the seed extracts. on the other hand, the aqueous overnight seed extract (ams-i) has shown significant radical scavenging activity as in 1, 1- diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph), hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, superoxide and lipid peroxidation as compared to other seed and leaf extracts. the ams-i and aml-iv have shown activity against six and seven microorganisms respectively. simulteneously, ams-iv and aml-iv have demonstrated potential antiproliferative activity against two human cell lines - colorectal adenocarcinoma (colo-205) and retinoblastoma (y79). conclusion: the seed and leaf extracts of a. moschatus possess significant antioxidant activity and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavenger, or substitute, probably as primary antioxidants. the plant possesses moderate antibacterial activity against bacterial strains used in this study. hydroalcoholic seed and leaf extracts also exhibited antiproliferative activity against two human cancer cell lines. a. moschatus may therefore, be a good candidate for functional foods as well as pharmaceutics.
comparative genomics and phylogeny of the inci1 plasmids: a common plasmid type among porcine enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
increasing reports of multidrug resistance conferred by conjugative plasmids of enterobacteriaceae necessitate a better understanding of their evolution. one such group is the narrow-host-range inci1 plasmid type, known for their ability to carry genes encoding resistance to extended-spectrum beta lactamases. the focus of this study was to perform comparative sequencing of inci1 plasmids from porcine enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), isolated irrespective of antimicrobial susceptibility phenotype. five inci1 plasmids of porcine etec origin and one inci1 plasmid from a salmonella enterica serovar kentucky isolate from a healthy broiler chicken were sequenced and compared to existing inci1 plasmid sequences in an effort to better understand the overall genetic composition of the inci1 plasmid lineages. overall, the sequenced porcine etec inci1 plasmids were divergent from other sequenced inci1 plasmids based upon multiple means of inferred phylogeny. high occurrences of inci1 and inca/c plasmid-associated genes and the blatem and blacmy-2 beta lactamase genes were observed among porcine etec. however, the presence of blatem and blacmy-2 did not strongly correlate with inci1 plasmid possession, suggesting that these plasmids in porcine etec are not primarily associated with the carriage of such resistance genes. overall, this work suggests a conservation of the inci1 plasmid backbone among sequenced plasmids with a single locus for the acquisition of accessory genes, such as those associated with antimicrobial resistance. furthermore, the high occurrence of inci1 and inca/c plasmids among clinical e. coli from commercial swine facilities is indicative of extensive horizontal gene transfer among porcine etec.
bacterial carbonic anhydrases as drug targets: toward novel antibiotics?
carbonic anhydrases (cas, ec 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. many pathogenic bacteria encode such enzymes belonging to the alpha-, beta-, and/or gamma-ca families. in the last decade, the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and helicobacter pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from escherichia coli, h. pylori,mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and haemophilus influenzae have been cloned and characterized in detail. for some of these enzymes the x-ray crystal structures were determined, and in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates reported. although efficient inhibitors have been reported for many such enzymes, only for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis, and s. pneumoniae enzymes it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas represent promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.
effect of antimicrobial coatings on the radiosensitization of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and listeria monocytogenes in fresh broccoli.
radiosensitization of listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and aerobic microflora was evaluated in broccoli florets coated by antimicrobial coatings and treated with different doses of gamma-radiation. broccoli florets were inoculated with aerobic microflora isolated from broccoli and with pathogenic bacteria (l. monocytogenes, e. coli, and salmonella typhimurium) at 10(6) cfu/ml. inoculated florets were then coated with methylcellulose-based coating containing various mixtures of antimicrobial agents: organic acids plus lactic acid bacteria (lab metabolites), organic acids plus citrus extract, organic acids plus citrus extract plus spice mixture, and organic acids plus rosemary extract. coated florets were irradiated with various doses (0 to 3.3 kgy), and microbial analyses were conducted to calculate the d(10)-value and relative sensitivity. all antimicrobial coatings had almost the same effect of increasing the radiosensitivity of l. monocytogenes (from 1.31 to 1.45 times) to gamma-irradiation. the coating containing organic acid plus citrus extract was the most efficient formulation for increasing the radiosensitization of e. coli and aerobic microflora, by 2.40 and 1.76 times, respectively, compared with the control without the antimicrobial coating. the coating containing organic acids plus lab metabolites was the most effective formulation for increasing the radiosensitization (by 2.4 times) of salmonella typhimurium. results suggest that the spice extract, when mixed with organic acids and citrus extract, might protect e. coli and aerobic microflora from the effects of gamma-irradiation.
synthesis, characterization and biological properties of thienyl derived triazole schiff bases and their oxovanadium(iv) complexes.
a new series of biologically active thienyl derived triazole schiff bases and their oxovanadium(iv) complexes have been synthesized and characterized on the basis of physical (m.p., magnetic susceptibility and conductivity), spectral (ir, (1)h and (1)(3)c nmr, electronic and mass spectrometry) and microanalytical data. all the schiff base ligands and their oxovanadium(iv) complexes have been subjected to in vitro antibacterial activity against four gram-negative (escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica serover typhi) and two gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis) bacterial strains and, for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifucus, candida albican, aspergillus flavus, microscopum canis, fusarium solani and candida glabrata. brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to check the cytotoxic nature of these compounds.
selectivity of inhibition of n-succinyl-l,l-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase in  bacteria: the product of dape-gene is not the target of l-captopril antimicrobial activity.
the emergence of bacterial strains that are resistant to virtually all currently  available antibiotics underscores the importance of developing new antimicrobial compounds. n-succinyl-l,l-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (dape) is a metallohydrolase involved in the meso-diaminopimelate (mdap)/lysine biosynthetic pathway necessary for lysine biosynthesis and for building the peptidoglycan cell wall. because dape is essential for gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria, dape has been proposed as a good target for antibiotic development. recently, l-captopril has been suggested as a lead compound for inhibition of dape, although its selectivity for this enzyme target in bacteria remains unclear (gillner et al. (2009)). here, we tested the selectivity of l-captopril against dape in bacteria. since dape knockout strains of gram-negative bacteria are viable upon chemical supplementation with mdap, we reasoned that the antimicrobial activity of compounds targeting dape should be abolished in mdap-containing media. although l-captopril had modest antimicrobial activity in escherichia coli and in salmonella enterica, to our surprise, inhibition of bacterial growth was independent both of mdap supplementation and dape over-expression. we conclude that dape is not the main target of l-captopril inhibition in these bacteria. the methods implemented here will be useful for screening dape-selective antimicrobial compounds directly in bacterial cultures.
application of polylactic acid coating with antimicrobials in reduction of escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella stanley on apples.
survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella stanley on apples as affected by application of polylactic acid (pla) coating with antimicrobials was investigated. golden delicious apples were spot inoculated with e. coli o157:h7 or s. stanley and spray coated with pla solutions containing lactic acid (la), disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta), sodium benzoate (sb), potassium sorbate (ps), or their combination (la+edta, sb+la, sb+la+edta). apples without any coating treatment served as controls. coating treatments were allowed to dry fully, and the apples were stored at 4 degrees c for 14 d. antimicrobial coatings reduced populations of e. coli o157:h7 and s. stanley by up to 4 log cfu/cm2 at 1 d and 4.7 log cfu/cm2 at 14 d, compared to controls. sb+la combination had a similar effectiveness as the sb+la+edta combination against both pathogens and was more effective than other coating treatments. without antimicrobial treatment, e. coli o157:h7 and s. stanley were able to survive on apples stored at 4 degrees c for up to 14 d. the antimicrobial pla coating provides an alternative intervention to reduce the pathogens on apples. practical application: antimicrobial pla coatings provide an alternative method to reduce pathogenic contaminations on fruit surface, and therefore, reduce the risk of food-borne outbreaks.
growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens by kimchi prepared with bacteriocin-producing starter culture.
kimchi (starter kimchi) was prepared with leuconostoc citreum gj7, a bacteriocin  producer, with the objective of preventing growth and/or survival of foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhi, and staphylococcus aureus. numbers of the pathogens inoculated to 5.41 to 5.63 log cfu/ml into the filtrate of freshly made starter kimchi remained stable for the first 12 h of incubation at 10 degrees c. reductions of 2.69, 2.88, and 3.42 log cfu/ml were observed 48 h after inoculation with e. coli o157:h7, s. typhi, and s. aureus, respectively. use of the bacteriocin-producing starter culture for kimchi fermentation significantly reduced the numbers of pathogens in the filtrate. reductions of 3.85, 4.45, and 5.19 log cfu/ml were observed 48 h after inoculation for e. coli o157:h7, s. typhi, and s. aureus, respectively. presumably, the antimicrobial activity came from the ingredients of kimchi such as sulfur-containing compounds, low ph (approximately ph 4.5) produced by the conversion of sugars into organic acids and the bacteriocins potentially produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab), such as kimchicin gj7. together, these data suggest that addition of a starter culture capable of producing bacteriocins could serve as a strategy to protect the fermented product from delivering pathogens upon consumption and that the kimchi filtrate itself may be used as a food preservative. practical application: the adaptation of the starter fermentation into kimchi induced a faster die off of the pathogens as compared to natural fermentation. the in situ bateriocin-production by leuc. citreum gj7 in kimchi would act with antimicrobial kimchi ingredients in a synergistic manner to protect the fermented product from delivering pathogens upon consumption.
lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
evaluation of the mutagenicity of sesquiterpenic compounds and their influence on the susceptibility towards antibiotics of two clinically relevant bacterial strains.
sesquiterpenic compounds are natural chemicals present in organisms from different phylae or divisions, which have proved to be important bioactive products, namely in potentiating the action of antibiotics. in the first step, the mutagenicity of nine sesquiterpenic compounds (hydrocarbons and alcohols) was screened in a salmonella typhimurium his(-)-reversion test with strains ta98 and ta100, in the presence or absence of in vitro metabolic activation. under the test conditions, none of the compounds showed mutagenicity up to a concentration of 222mug/plate. trans-farnesol, nerolidol, and alpha-bisabolol displayed cytotoxicity when tested at concentrations ranging from 14 to 222mug/plate. then, the combined effect of antibiotic-sesquiterpenic compounds was evaluated on two clinically relevant pathogens, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, with well-defined resistance-sensitive profiles. the agar-disc diffusion assay revealed that all the combinations of antibiotic-sesquiterpenic compounds increased the antibacterial activity of the antibiotics tested against s. aureus. for e. coli, an antagonistic effect was observed for various combinations on the growth of this bacterium.
inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
the activity of bacteriocins from carnobacterium maltaromaticum ual307 against gram-negative bacteria in combination with edta treatment.
bacteriocins from gram-positive bacteria are potent antimicrobial peptides that inhibit pathogenic and food-spoilage bacteria. they are usually ineffective against gram-negative bacteria because they cannot penetrate the outer membrane (om). disruption of the om of some gram-negative bacteria was reported to sensitize them to certain bacteriocins. this study evaluates the activity of three purified bacteriocins [carnocyclin a (ccla), carnobacteriocin bm1 (cbnbm1) and piscicolin 126 (pisa)] produced by carnobacterium maltaromaticum ual307, which has been approved for preservation of food in united states and canada, against three gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli dh5alpha, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 14207 and salmonella typhimurium atcc 23564). their efficacy is compared with bacteriocins of other classes: the lantibiotics nisin a (positive control) and gallidermin, and the cyclic peptide subtilosin a (suba). in combination with edta, ccla inhibited both e. coli and pseudomonas. pisa inhibited pseudomonas, but cbnbm1 showed weak activity toward pseudomonas. in comparison, nisin and gallidermin inhibited the growth of all three strains, whereas suba was active against e. coli and pseudomonas only at high concentrations. the results reveal that ual307 bacteriocins can inhibit gram-negative bacteria if the om is weakened, and that the different classes of bacteriocins in this study exert unique modes of action toward such bacteria.
molecular epidemiology of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium isolates from cattle in hokkaido, japan: evidence of clonal replacement and characterization of the disseminated clone.
the molecular epidemiology of 545 salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium isolates collected between 1977 and 2009 from cattle in hokkaido, japan, was investigated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). nine main clusters were identified from 116 pfge patterns. cluster i comprised 248 isolates, 243 of which possessed a sequence specific to definitive phage type 104 (dt104) or u302. the cluster i isolates were dominant in 1993 to 2003, but their numbers declined beginning in 2004. beginning in 2002, an increase was observed in the number of cluster vii isolates, consisting of 21 pfge patterns comprising 165 isolates. a total of 116 isolates representative of the 116 pfge profiles were analyzed by multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (mlva). other than two drug-sensitive isolates, 19 isolates within cluster vii were classified in the same cluster by mlva. among the cluster vii isolates, an antibiotic resistance type showing resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, tetracycline, kanamycin, cefazolin, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and a resistance type showing resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, tetracycline, and kanamycin were found in 23 and 125 isolates, respectively. in the 19 isolates representative of cluster vii, the bla(tem-1) gene was found on a salmonella serotype typhimurium virulence plasmid, which was transferred to escherichia coli by electroporation along with resistance to two to four other antimicrobials. genomic analysis by subtractive hybridization and plasmid analysis suggested that the bla(tem-1)-carrying virulence plasmid has a mosaic structure composed of elements of different origin. these results indicate an emerging multidrug-resistant s. typhimurium clone carrying a virulence-resistance plasmid among cattle in hokkaido, japan.
mechanism of bactericidal activity of microcin l in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica.
for the first time, the mechanism of action of microcin l (mccl) was investigated in live bacteria. mccl is a gene-encoded peptide produced by escherichia coli lr05 that exhibits a strong antibacterial activity against related enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium and enteritidis. we first subcloned the mccl genetic system to remove the sequences not involved in mccl production. we then optimized the mccl purification procedure to obtain large amounts of purified microcin to investigate its antimicrobial and membrane properties. we showed that mccl did not induce outer membrane permeabilization, which indicated that mccl did not use this way to kill the sensitive cell or to enter into it. using a set of e. coli and salmonella enterica mutants lacking iron-siderophore receptors, we demonstrated that the mccl uptake required the outer membrane receptor cir. moreover, the mccl bactericidal activity was shown to depend on the tonb protein that transduces the proton-motive force of the cytoplasmic membrane to transport iron-siderophore complexes across the outer membrane. using carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone, which is known to fully dissipate the proton-motive force, we proved that the proton-motive force was required for the bactericidal activity of mccl on e. coli. in addition, we showed that a primary target of mccl could be the cytoplasmic membrane: a high level of mccl disrupted the inner membrane potential of e. coli cells. however, no permeabilization of the membrane was detected.
untangling metabolic and communication networks: interactions of enterics with phytobacteria and their implications in produce safety.
recent outbreaks of vegetable-borne gastrointestinal illnesses across the globe demonstrate that human enteric pathogens can contaminate produce at any stage of production. interactions of enterics with native plant-associated microbiota influence the microbiological safety of produce by affecting the attachment, persistence and proliferation of human pathogens on plants. supermarket surveys have revealed that bacteria, but not fungi or mechanical damage, promote the growth of salmonella enterica on produce. field and laboratory studies have indicated that some plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi facilitate the entry and internalization of human pathogens in plants. conversely, some phytobacteria, including those involved in biocontrol of plant diseases, significantly inhibit attachment and plant colonization by non-typhoidal salmonella and enterovirulent escherichia coli by producing antibiotics or competing for nutrients in the phyllosphere. in this review, we attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of interactions between human enteric pathogens and plant-associated microbiota, and describe how these interactions affect produce safety.
investigating the decay rates of escherichia coli relative to vibrio parahemolyticus and salmonella typhi in tropical coastal waters.
using the size fractionation method, we measured the decay rates of escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and vibrio parahaemolyticus in the coastal waters of peninsular malaysia. the size fractions were total or unfiltered, <250 mum, <20 mum, <2 mum, <0.7 mum, <0.2 mum and <0.02 mum. we also carried out abiotic (inorganic nutrients) and biotic (bacterial abundance, production and protistan bacterivory) measurements at port dickson, klang and kuantan. klang had highest nutrient concentrations whereas both bacterial production and protistan bacterivory rates were highest at kuantan. we observed signs of protist-bacteria coupling via the following correlations: protistan bacterivory-bacterial production: r = 0.773, df = 11, p < 0.01; protist-bacteria: r = 0.586, df = 12, p < 0.05. however none of the bacterial decay rates were correlated with the biotic variables measured. e. coli and salmonella decay rates were generally higher in the larger fraction (>0.7 mum) than in the smaller fraction (<0.7 mum) suggesting the more important role played by protists. e. coli and salmonella also decreased in the <0.02 mum fraction and suggested that these non-halophilic bacteria did not survive well in seawater. in contrast, vibrio grew well in seawater. there was usually an increase in vibrio after one day incubation. our results confirmed that decay or loss rates of e. coli did not match that of vibrio, and also did not correlate with salmonella decay rates. however e. coli showed persistence where its decay rates were generally lower than salmonella.
evaluation and target validation of indole derivatives as inhibitors of the acrab-tolc efflux pump.
indole derivatives 3-amino-6-carboxyl-indole and 3-nitro-6-amino-indole were designed and synthesized based on the tolc structure. they proved to have potent synergistic antibacterial effects on chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli yd2 and fj307 with decreased minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) at 2-64 folds. to research its functional site, escherichia coli bl21(de3)-3 expressing a target-site mutated tolc was constructed by red homologous recombination and the site-directed mutagenesis technique. they did not noticeably affect antimicrobial activity against bl21(de3)-3. all the results indicate that these compounds match our design and can be developed as efflux pump inhibitors for the acrab-tolc efflux pump.
sensitization of microcin j25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
microcin j25 (mccj25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by escherichia coli. mccj25 inhibits rna polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. mccj25 uptake into e. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma. this peptide is active on some e. coli, salmonella, and shigella species strains, while other gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, moraxella catarrhalis, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, are completely resistant. in the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (kff)(3)k made some resistant strains sensitive to mccj25, among them s. typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. the results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (kff)(3)k allows mccj25 penetration in an fhua and sbma-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic salmonella strains.
unexpected consequences of administering bacteriocinogenic probiotic strains for  salmonella populations, revealed by an in vitro colonic model of the child gut.
new biological strategies for the treatment of salmonella infection are needed in response to the increase in antibiotic-resistant strains. escherichia coli l1000 and bifidobacterium thermophilum rbl67 were previously shown to produce antimicrobial proteinaceous compounds (microcin b17 and thermophilicin b67, respectively) active in vitro against a panel of salmonella strains recently isolated from clinical cases in switzerland. in this study, two three-stage intestinal continuous fermentation models of salmonella colonization inoculated with immobilized faeces of a two-year-old child were implemented to study the effects of the two bacteriocinogenic strains compared with a bacteriocin-negative mutant of strain l1000 on salmonella growth, as well as gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity. immobilized e. coli l1000 added to the proximal colon reactor showed a low colonization, and developed preferentially in the distal colon reactor independent of the presence of genetic determinants for microcin b17 production. surprisingly, e. coli l1000 addition strongly stimulated salmonella growth in all three reactors. in contrast, b. thermophilum rbl67 added in a second phase stabilized at high levels in all reactors, but could not inhibit salmonella already present at a high level (>10(7) c.f.u. ml(-1)) when the probiotic was added. inulin added at the end of fermentation induced a strong bifidogenic effect in all three colon reactors and a significant increase of salmonella counts in the distal colon reactor. our data show that under the simulated child colonic conditions, the microcin b17 production phenotype does not correlate with inhibition of salmonella but leads to a better colonization of e. coli l1000 in the distal colon reactor. we conclude that in vitro models with complex and complete gut microbiota are required to accurately assess the potential and efficacy of probiotics with respect to salmonella colonization in the gut.
comparison of phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial profiles in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica from the same dairy cattle farms.
transmission of antimicrobial drug resistance from resistant bacteria to non-resistant strains is an important public health issue. in this study, we have examined the possibility of multiple resistance gene transfer between escherichia coli and salmonella in the natural setting. bacteria isolated from calves concurrently shedding e. coli and salmonella showed similar antimicrobial drug resistance patterns as measured by a broth dilution method. however, microarray analysis of the antibiotic resistance at the gene level revealed several differences in resistance gene profile. resistance profiles of e. coli isolated from different farms were closer than the profile of e. coli and salmonella isolated from the same farm. this shows that the chance of multiple resistance gene transfers between these species is unlikely.
susceptibility of complete bacteria and spheroplasts of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi to rolliniastatin-2.
rolliniastatin-2 is an acetogenin with elevated cytotoxic activity whose effect on bacteria has not yet been analysed and was isolated by cc from the hexanic extract of annona diversifolia saff (annonaceae) seeds. in this study, we evaluated the susceptibility of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi as well as spheroplasts of these bacteria to the compound, determining percent inhibition by turbidimetry. the complete bacteria were susceptible to rolliniastatin-2 (28-40% at 2 mg ml(-1)), while spheroplasts showed an increased susceptibility (55-58%, at 1 ng ml(-1)). the most susceptible bacterium was p. aeruginosa, while the spheroplasts of e. coli and s. typhi were most sensitive to the compound's effects.
lipopolysaccharides directly decrease ca2+ oscillations and the hyperpolarization-activated nonselective cation current if in immortalized hl-1 cardiomyocytes.
lipopolysaccharide (lps) has been implicated in sepsis-mediated heart failure and chronic cardiac myopathies. we determined that lps directly and reversibly affects cardiac myocyte function by altering regulation of intracellular ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]i) in immortalized cardiomyocytes, hl-1 cells. [ca2+]i oscillated (<0.4 hz), displaying slow and transient components. lps (1 microg/ml), derived either from escherichia coli or from salmonella enteritidis, reversibly abolished ca2+ oscillations and decreased basal [ca2+]i by 30-40 nm. hl-1 cells expressed toll-like receptors, i.e., tlr-2 and tlr-4. thus, we differentiated effects of lps on [ca2+]i and ca2+ oscillations by addition of utlrapure lps, a tlr-4 ligand. ultrapure lps had no effect on basal [ca2+]i, but it reduced the rate of ca2+ oscillations. interestingly, pam3csk4, a tlr-2 ligand, affected neither ca2+ parameter, and the effect of ultrapure lps and pam3csk4 combined was similar to that of utlrapure lps alone. thus, unpurified lps directly inhibits hl-1 calcium metabolism via tlr-4 and non-tlr-4-dependent mechanisms. since others have shown that endotoxin impairs the hyperpolarization-activated, nonselective cationic pacemaker current (i(f)), which is expressed in hl-1 cells, we utilized whole cell voltage-clamp techniques to demonstrate that lps (1 microg/ml) reduced i(f) in hl-1 cells. this inhibition was marginal at physiologic membrane potentials and significant at very negative potentials (p < 0.05 at -140, -150, and -160 mv). so, we also evaluated effects of lps on tail currents of fully activated i(f). lps reduced the slope conductance of the tail currents from 498 +/- 140 ps/pf to 223 +/- 65 ps/pf (p < 0.05) without affecting reversal potential of -11 mv. ultrapure lps had similar effect on i(f), whereas pam3csk4 had no effect on i(f). we conclude that lps inhibits activation of i(f), enhances its deactivation, and impairs regulation of [ca2+]i in hl-1 cardiomyocytes via tlr-4 and other mechanisms.
substitution of the arginine/leucine residues in apidaecin ib with peptoid residues: effect on antimicrobial activity, cellular uptake, and proteolytic degradation.
several aspects of the mechanism of action of pro-rich antimicrobial peptides, together with their low toxicity in mammalian cells, make them good candidates for the development of new antibiotic agents. we investigated the effect induced in the insect antimicrobial peptide apidaecin ib by the replacement of a single arginine/leucine residue with a n-substituted glycine. the resulting peptoid-peptide hybrids are more resistant to proteolysis and devoid of any significant cytotoxic activity, but moving the [narg]residue from the n- to the c-terminal end of the molecule progressively reduces the antibacterial activity. cell uptake experiments in e. coli cells suggest that the loss of antibacterial activity of [narg(17)]apidaecin is a consequence of its inability to translocate into bacterial cells. conversely, apidaecin and its peptoid-peptide hybrids are able to cross the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells and to diffuse in the cytosol, although their translocating ability is far less effective than that of other known cell permeant peptides.
the cyclotide cycloviolacin o2 from viola odorata has potent bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria.
objectives: to determine the antibacterial activity of small cyclic plant proteins, i.e. cyclotides, and the importance of the surface exposed charged residues for activity. methods: prototypic cyclotides, including the mobius kalata b1 and the bracelet cycloviolacin o2 (cyo2), were isolated using reversed-phase hplc. initial activity screenings were conducted using radial diffusion assays (rdas) and mic assays with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus as test strains. for the most active peptide, cyo2, time-kill kinetics was determined in sodium phosphate buffer (containing 0.03% trypticase soy broth) against several gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species. charged residues in cyo2 were chemically modified and activity was determined in time-kill assays. results: cyo2 was the most active cyclotide and efficiently inhibited the growth of s. enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 and e. coli in rdas and mic assays, while the other peptides were less active. in time-kill assays, cyo2 also had bactericidal activity against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in contrast, none of the cyclotides had high activity against s. aureus. chemical masking of the charged glu and lys residues in cyo2 caused a near total loss of activity against salmonella, while masking arg caused a less pronounced activity reduction. conclusions: cyo2 is a cyclotide with potent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the charged residues in cyo2 are all required for optimum antibacterial activity. in combination with its previously demonstrated cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and the general stability of cyclotides, cyo2 provides a promising scaffold for future drug design.
antibacterial activity of zno nanoparticles prepared via non-hydrolytic solution  route.
the antibacterial activity of zno nanoparticles has been investigated and presented in this paper. nanoparticles were prepared via non-hydrolytic solution process using zinc acetate di-hydrate (zn(ch(3)coo)(2).2h(2)o) and aniline (c(6)h(5)nh(2)) in 6 h refluxing at approximately 65 degrees c. in the presence of four pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae, the antibacterial study of zinc oxide nanoparticles were observed. the antibacterial activity of zno nanoparticles (zno-nps) were studied by spectroscopic method taking different concentrations (5-45 microg/ml) of zno-nps. our investigation reveals that the lowest concentration of zno-nps solution inhibiting the growth of microbial strain is found to be 5 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae, whereas for e. coli, s. aureus, and s. typhimurium, it was calculated to be 15 microg/ml. the diameter of each zno-nps lies between "20 and 30 nm" as observed from fesem and transmission electron microscopy images. the composition of synthesized material was analyzed by the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and it shows the band of zno at 441 cm(-1). additionally, on the basis of morphological and chemical observations, the chemical reaction mechanism of zno-nps was also proposed.
antimicrobial effect of photodynamic therapy using a highly pure chlorin e6.
the aim of the present study is to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of photodynamic therapy (pdt) using a highly pure chlorin e(6) (ce(6)), against various pathogenic bacteria. to examine the antimicrobial effect of ce(6)-mediated pdt against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, inhibition zone formation, cfu quantification, and bacterial viability were evaluated. inhibition zone analysis showed that ce(6)-mediated pdt is very effective to inhibit the growth of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, but has only minor effect to e. coli and s. typhimurium, which was dependent on the energy density of laser and dose of ce(6). ce(6)-mediated pdt also nearly inhibited the colony formation of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, and partially inhibited that of e. coli and s. typhimurium. in addition, the number of viable bacteria decreased greatly after pdt application with ls-chlorin e6 of 10 microm and laser and energy density of 20 j/cm(2). these results show that ce(6)-mediated pdt can be an effective alternative for antimicrobial treatment.
a soluble form of the pilus protein fima targets the vdac-hexokinase complex at mitochondria to suppress host cell apoptosis.
inhibition of apoptotic response of host cells during an early phase of infection is a strategy used by many enteroinvasive bacterial pathogens to enhance their survival. here, we report the identification of a soluble form of the pilus protein fima from the culture supernatants of e. coli k1, salmonella, and shigella that can potently inhibit bax-mediated release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria. similar to the infected cells, hct116 cells stably expressing fima display a delay in the integration of bax into outer mitochondrial membrane induced by apoptotic stimuli. fima targets to mitochondria through binding to vdac1, which is a prerequisite step for e. coli k1 to render the short-term blockade of apoptotic death in the host cells. interestingly, fima strengthens the vdac1-hexokinase interaction and prevents dissociation of hexokinase from vdac1 triggered by apoptotic stimuli. together, these data thus reveal a paradigm of antiapoptosis mechanism undertaken by the enteroinvasive bacteria.
antibacterial activity of carvacrol and 2-nitro-1-propanol against single and mixed populations of foodborne pathogenic bacteria in corn flour dough.
cereal doughs are an important part of human diet, but at the same time can act as vehicles for the transmission of human pathogenic bacteria. in the present study, four pathogenic or toxinogenic bacteria (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus) were inoculated in a dough made from corn flour in combination with the single antimicrobial compounds carvacrol and 2-nitro-1-propanol (2npoh). survival of single and mixed populations in the treated doughs incubated at 37 degrees c was followed by culture-dependent and independent methods (ttge). all strains were completely inactivated within 24 h by the tested compounds at 5% final concentration, but showed variable inhibition at lower concentrations of 0.5% and 2%. sensitivity to antimicrobial compounds was in general modified when strains were tested in cocultures compared with single cultures. b. cereus was more sensitive to carvacrol (minimum bactericidal concentration, mbc, 0.5%) in coculture with s. aureus. it was also more sensitive to 2npoh in cocultures with s. aureus and with s. enterica (mbc, 2% in both cases). s. aureus was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with b. cereus, e. coli, as well as s. enterica. however, sensitivity to 2npoh was not modified in any of the coculture experiments (mbc, 2%). e. coli was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with s. aureus and with s. enterica. resistance of e. coli to 2npoh also increased in cocultures with b. cereus (mbc, 5%) and with s. aureus (mbc, 2%), but not with s. enterica (mbc, 0.5%). s. enterica was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with e. coli, but it was more sensitive to 2npoh in cocultures with b. cereus as well as with s. aureus (mbc, 2% in both cases). ttge analysis of survivors from cocultures treated with 2npoh or carvacrol allowed a good estimation of the identity of survivors according to their dna band patterns. results from this study indicate that the efficacy of antimicrobials such as carvacrol and 2npoh is greatly influenced by the complexity of the microbial populations under target and the relationships between individual populations.
synthesis of ag/cnt hybrid nanoparticles and fabrication of their nylon-6 polymer nanocomposite fibers for antimicrobial applications.
ag-coated cnts hybrid nanoparticles (ag/cnts) were prepared by ultrasonic irradiation of dimethylformamide (dmf) and silver (i) acetate precursors in the presence of cnts. the morphology of ag/cnts was characterized using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (tem) techniques. the nylon-6 powder and 1 wt% ag/cnts mixture was dispersed uniformly using a noncontact spinning technique. the dried mixture was melted in a single screw extrusion machine and then extruded through an orifice. extruded filaments were later stretched and stabilized by sequentially passing them through a set of tension adjusters and a secondary heater. the nylon-6/ag/cnt hybrid polymer nanocomposite (hpnc) fibers, which were of approximately 80 microm size, were tested for their tensile properties. the failure stress and modulus of the extruded hpnc fibers (doped with 1% ag/cnts) was about 72.19 % and 342.62% higher than the neat extruded nylon-6 fiber, respectively. dsc results indicated an increase in the thermal stability and crystallization for hpnc fibers. the antibacterial activity of the ag-coated cnts, commercial ag, neat nylon-6 and plain cnts were evaluated. ag-coated cnts at 25 microg demonstrated good antimicrobial activity against four common bacterial pathogens as tested by the kirby-bauer assay. the mean diameters of the zones of inhibition were 27.9 +/- 6.72 mm, 19.4 +/- 3.64 mm, 21.9 +/- 4.33 mm, and 24.1 +/- 4.14 mm, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. by comparison, those obtained using the broad spectrum antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were 37.7 +/- 2.13 mm, 28.6 +/- 4.27 mm, 22.6 +/- 1.27 mm, and 27.0 +/- 1.41 mm, respectively, for the same strains. the zones of inhibition obtained for nylon-6 ag-coated cnt powder at 25 microg were also high, ranging from 15.2 to 25.3 mm in contrast to commercial silver or neat nylon-6, which did not inhibit the bacterial strains tested. further, the nylon-6 nanocomposite fibers infused with ag/cnts inhibited bacterial growth by 11-20%. our results suggest that nylon nanocomposite fibers infused with ag-coated cnts have significant antimicrobial activity.
effects of gut microflora on hepatic damage after acute liver injury in rats.
background: liver injury often causes disruption of the gut microflora. the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of microflora variations on acute liver injury. methods: sprague-dawley rats received saline, probiotics, escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, or gentamicin via daily gavage for 7 days. acute liver injury was induced on the eighth day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine except for the normal group. samples were collected 24 hours later. bacterial translocation (bt) was evaluated from the liver, spleen, kidney, and mesenteric lymph nodes. liver enzymes, histologic analysis, endotoxin, serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (il)-6, il-10, il-12, cd3 and cd4 t cells in peripheral blood and peyer's patches, intestinal bacteria, and intestinal mucosal ultrastructure were studied. results: orally administered probiotics, nonpathogenic e. coli, and gentamicin, respectively, markedly attenuated liver damage, decreased bt, and decreased the levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha, il-6, il-10, and il-12. treatment with s. enteritidis had opposite results. only orally supplemented s. enteritidis significantly affected the cd3 and cd4 t cells counts in peripheral blood and peyer's patches. conclusions: we demonstrated that modifications in gut microflora had different effects on the prevention or exacerbation of acute liver injury. moreover, alterations in gut microflora affected liver damage through three major factors: bt and the release of local gut cytokine and endotoxin.
identification of conserved amino acid residues of the salmonella sigmas chaperone crl involved in crl-sigmas interactions.
proteins that bind sigma factors typically attenuate the function of the sigma factor by restricting its access to the rna polymerase (rnap) core enzyme. an exception to this general rule is the crl protein that binds the stationary-phase sigma factor sigma(s) (rpos) and enhances its affinity for the rnap core enzyme, thereby increasing expression of sigma(s)-dependent genes. analyses of sequenced bacterial genomes revealed that crl is less widespread and less conserved at the sequence level than rpos. seventeen residues are conserved in all members of the crl family. site-directed mutagenesis of the crl gene from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and complementation of a deltacrl mutant of salmonella indicated that substitution of the conserved residues y22, f53, w56, and w82 decreased crl activity. this conclusion was further confirmed by promoter binding and abortive transcription assays. we also used a bacterial two-hybrid system (bacth) to show that the four substitutions in crl abolish crl-sigma(s) interaction and that residues 1 to 71 in sigma(s) are dispensable for crl binding. in escherichia coli, it has been reported that crl also interacts with the ferric uptake regulator fur and that fur represses crl transcription. however, the salmonella crl and fur proteins did not interact in the bacth system. in addition, a fur mutation did not have any significant effect on the expression level of crl in salmonella. these results suggest that the relationship between crl and fur is different in salmonella and e. coli.
antimicrobial drug use and antimicrobial resistance in enteric bacteria among cattle from alberta feedlots.
the purpose of this study was to determine whether antimicrobial resistance (amr) in foodborne pathogens (escherichia coli o157, salmonella, and campylobacter) and non-type-specific e. coli obtained from fecal samples of feedlot cattle was associated with antimicrobial drug (amd) use. a secondary objective was to determine if amr in non-type-specific e. coli could be used as a predictor of amr in foodborne pathogens. fecal samples were collected from pen floors in 21 alberta feedlots during march through december 2004, and resistance prevalence was estimated by season (spring, fall) and cattle type (fewest days-on-feed and closest to slaughter). amd exposures were obtained by calculating therapeutic animal daily doses for each drug before sampling from feedlot records. generalized linear mixed models were used to investigate the relationship between each amr and amd use. non-type-specific e. coli was commonly recovered from fecal samples (88.62%), and the highest prevalence of resistance was found toward tetracycline (53%), streptomycin (28%), and sulfadiazine (48%). campylobacter jejuni was recovered from 55.3% of the fecal samples, and resistance was generally less for the drugs that were evaluated (doxycycline 38.1%, ciprofloxacin 2.6%, nalidixic acid 1.64%, erythromycin 1.2%). e. coli o157 and salmonella were recovered much less frequently (7% and 1% prevalence, respectively). the prevalence of recovery for the bacteria studied varied between seasons and cattle types, as did patterns of amr. among non-type-specific e. coli, resistance to tetracycline, streptomycin, and sulfadiazine was found to be positively associated with in-feed exposure as well as injectable tetracycline, but these differences were relatively small and of questionable practical relevance. among c. jejuni isolates, cattle type was significantly associated with doxycycline resistance. results suggested that resistance in non-type-specific e. coli to chloramphenicol, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline might be used as predictors of resistance to these drugs in e. coli o157 recovered from the same fecal samples.
bovine muc1 inhibits binding of enteric bacteria to caco-2 cells.
inhibition of bacterial adhesion to intestinal epithelial receptors by the consumption of natural food components is an attractive strategy for the prevention of microbial related gastrointestinal illness. we hypothesised that muc1, a highly glycosylated mucin present in cows' milk, may be one such food component. purified bovine muc1 was tested for its ability to inhibit binding of common enteric bacterial pathogens to caco-2 cells grown in vitro. muc1 caused dose-dependent binding inhibition of escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium), staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis. this inhibition was more pronounced for the gram negative compared with gram positive bacteria. it was also demonstrated that muc1, immobilised on a membrane, bound all these bacterial species in a dose-dependent manner, although there was greater interaction with the gram negative bacteria. a range of monosaccharides, representative of the muc1 oligosaccharide composition, were tested for their ability to prevent binding of e. coli and s. typhimurium to caco-2 cells. inhibition was structure dependent with sialic acid, l(-) fucose and d(+) mannose significantly inhibiting binding of both gram negative species. n-acetylglucosamine and n-acetylgalactosamine significantly inhibited binding of e. coli whilst galactose, one of the most abundant muc1 monosaccharides, showed the strongest inhibition against s. typhimurium. treatment with sialidase significantly decreased the inhibitory properties of muc1, demonstrating the importance of sialic acid in adhesion inhibition. it is concluded that bovine muc1 prevents binding of bacteria to human intestinal cells and may have a role in preventing the binding of common enteropathogenic bacteria to human intestinal epithelial surfaces.
antimicrobial substances produced by coliform strains active against foodborne pathogens.
in the present study, 31 coliform strains were isolated from salad, cheese, and meat products sold in commercial establishments in rio de janeiro city, and were tested for antibiotic resistance and antimicrobial substance production. thirteen strains (41.9%) were resistant to at least one antibiotic tested, among which one presented resistance to nine different antibiotics. two strains (6.4%) exhibited inhibitory activity against the indicator strains, escherichia coli lmifrj and salmonella enterica i. the antimicrobial substances that they produced were sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, suggesting that they might be bacteriocins. the producer strains were identified as klebsiella ozaenae and raoultella terrigena. although they had similar spectrums of action, the bacteriocins were shown to be different. both of them were able to inhibit e. coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, and salmonella strains, including antibiotic-resistant ones. our results suggest that these bacteriocins, named klebicin k and raoultellin l, could have potential use against some foodborne pathogens.
exposure of escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium to triclosan induces a species-specific response, including drug detoxification.
objectives: the use of triclosan within various environments has been linked to the development of multiple drug resistance (mdr) through the increased expression of efflux pumps such as acrab-tolc. in this work, we investigate the effect of triclosan exposure in order to ascertain the response of two species to the presence of this widely used biocide. methods: the transcriptomes of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 and escherichia coli k-12 mg1655 after exposure to the mic of triclosan (0.12 mg/l) were determined in microarray experiments. phenotypic validation of the transcriptomic data included rt-pcr, ability to form a biofilm and motility assays. results: despite important differences in the triclosan-dependent transcriptomes of the two species, increased expression of efflux pump component genes was seen in both. increased expression of soxs was observed in salmonella typhimurium, however, within e. coli, decreased expression was seen. expression of fabbagi in salmonella typhimurium was decreased, whereas in e. coli expression of fababfh was increased. increased expression of ompr and genes within this regulon (e.g. ompc, csgd and ssra) was seen in the transcriptome of salmonella typhimurium. an unexpected response of e. coli was the differential expression of genes within operons involved in iron homeostasis; these included fhu, fep and ent. conclusions: these data indicate that whilst a core response to triclosan exposure exists, the differential transcriptome of each species was different. this suggests that e. coli k-12 should not be considered the paradigm for the enterobacteriaceae when exploring the effects of antimicrobial agents.
genetic and phenotypic characterization of the bla(cmy) gene from escherichia coli and salmonella enterica isolated from food-producing animals, humans, the environment, and retail meat.
the bla(cmy-2) family of the ampc beta-lactamase genes confer broad-spectrum resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials, including ceftriaxone and ceftiofur, as well as to beta-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid. organisms with the bla(cmy-2) phenotype have been recovered from the environment and from retail meat products, posing a potential public health risk. the objectives of this study were to sequence the bla(cmy-2) gene from escherichia coli and salmonella enterica from multiple sources that had a reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone and to determine the effect of observed mutations in the bla(cmy-2) gene on the antimicrobial resistance phenotype (spectrum and minimum inhibitory concentration/susceptibility patterns) of the isolates. the bla(cmy-2) genes from 52 bacterial isolates were sequenced for this study. sixty-two percent (32/52) were e. coli and 38% (20/52) were s. enterica. of the 32 e. coli isolates, 30 were found to carry a beta-lactamase gene that was 100% homologous to bla(cmy-2). one of the e. coli isolates was found to contain a gene that was 90% homologous to bla(cmy-2). this isolate also had lower minimum inhibitory concentrations to tetracyclines, streptomycin, and the sulfonamide antimicrobials than are commonly expected for isolates containing the bla(cmy-2). of the 20 genes obtained from salmonella isolates, 8 (40%) were found to be homologous to bla(cmy-2), with no altered susceptibility phenotypes observed.
antimicrobial mortar surfaces for the improvement of hygienic conditions.
aims: to evaluate the effectiveness of various antimicrobial mortar formulations  in inhibiting the growth of a selection of pathogens of environmental and hygienic concern. methods and results: mortar prisms containing triclosan-incorporated fibres or different concentrations of silver copper zeolites were incubated with escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica or staphylococcus aureus at 4 or 20 degrees c for 24 h. from plate counting, a substantial bactericidal effect (>4 log units) could only be observed for the mortar specimens containing more than 3% zeolites on cement weight base, the effect being more pronounced at 20 degrees c compared to 4 degrees c. no inhibitory effect could be observed for mortar specimens containing antimicrobial fibres. adenosinetriphosphate (atp) measurements allowed for a rapid indication of the occurrence of antimicrobial activity. conclusions: in order to obtain a bactericidal effect on mortar surfaces, concentrations of silver copper zeolites of more then 3% are required. significance and impact of the study: to our knowledge, this is the first study in which the effectiveness of various antimicrobial mortar mixtures towards the inhibition of pathogens has been evaluated in a quantitative way. antimicrobial concrete mixtures can be used for the improvement of the hygienic conditions in a variety of environments.
antibacterial activity of recombinant human lactoferrin from rice: effect of heat treatment.
the antibacterial activity of recombinant human lactoferrin from rice (rhlf) compared with that of human milk lactoferrin (hlf) was evaluated against escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enteritidis and listeria monocytogenes. the hydrolysates of rhlf and hlf were found to be more active than native proteins against e. coli o157:h7, and their activity was independent of their iron saturation. the effect of different heat treatments on the antibacterial activity of apo-rhlf was studied and compared with hlf. we observed that an htst pasteurization treatment did not affect the antimicrobial activity of lactoferrin against the pathogens studied. furthermore, the activity of apo-rhlf and hlf against e. coli o157:h7 and l. monocytogenes in uht milk and whey was assayed, finding a decrease in the number of bacteria, although lower than that observed in a broth medium. this study shows the similar antibacterial activity of rhlf and hlf which is important in order to consider the addition of rhlf as a supplement in special products.
live and heat-inactivated lactobacilli from feces inhibit salmonella typhi and escherichia coli adherence to caco-2 cells.
a quantitative approach has been proposed to evaluate the competitive inhibition  of escherichia coli and salmonella typhi by live and heat-inactivated laboratory isolated lactobacillus sp. on adhesion to monolayer of caco-2 cells. three species of lactobacillus (l. casei, l. acidophilus, l. agilis) isolated from human neonate feces and two commercial probiotic strains (l. casei, l. acidophilus) have been compared for probiotic activity. all lactobacilli were able to attach to the caco-2 cells, however, the degree of adhesion was bacterial strain-dependent. the adhesion indices of the two commercial probiotic strains were not significantly different from the values obtained for the other two similar fecal strains (p > 0.01). the inhibition of attachment of the pathogenic bacteria by inactivated cells of fecal l. acidophilus was examined and compared to the results of live bacteria. the inhibition pattern was similar for live and heat-inactivated l. acidophilus (p > 0.01). the number of attached pathogenic bacteria to the caco-2 cells decreased when the number of l. acidophilus increased from 10(6) to 10(9) cfu/ml. the heat-inactivated l. acidophilus displayed similar probiotic activity compared to the live bacteria.
quinine is bactericidal.
objective: to determine the antibacterial properties of quinine dihydrochloride and its mic. material and methods: a quasi-experimental study was conducted at the jinnah postgraduate medical centre, karachi from july 2006 to november 2006. two hundred samples of pus, blood, sputum and ascitic fluid, from hospitalized adult patients from medicine ward (w-7) having different bacterial infections were studied. proforma was filled to document the demographic details. samples were collected from different sites, isolated, identified and checked for antimicrobial susceptibility of quinine dihydrochloride by standard methods. results: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi were inhibited at mic of 125 g/ml. streptococcus pyogenes was inhibited at mic of 31.25 g/ml of quinine dihydrochloride (dilution ranges from 31.25 g/ml to 1000 g/ml). conclusion: the concomitant antimalarial and antibacterial action of quinine dihydrochloride may be beneficial in developing countries adding to cost effectiveness of treatment provided to patients belonging to low socioeconomic group.
role of ceftiofur in selection and dissemination of blacmy-2-mediated cephalosporin resistance in salmonella enterica and commensal escherichia coli isolates from cattle.
third-generation cephalosporin resistance of salmonella and commensal escherichia coli isolates from cattle in the united states is predominantly conferred by the cephamycinase cmy-2, which inactivates beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs used to treat a wide variety of infections, including pediatric salmonellosis. the emergence and dissemination of bla(cmy-2)(-)-bearing plasmids followed and may in part be the result of selection pressure imposed by the widespread utilization of ceftiofur, a third-generation veterinary cephalosporin. this study assessed the potential effects of ceftiofur on bla(cmy-2) transfer and dissemination by (i) an in vivo experimental study in which calves were inoculated with competent bla(cmy-2)-bearing plasmid donors and susceptible recipients and then subjected to ceftiofur selection and (ii) an observational study to determine whether ceftiofur use in dairy herds is associated with the occurrence and frequency of cephalosporin resistance in salmonella and commensal e. coli. the first study revealed bla(cmy-2) plasmid transfer in both ceftiofur-treated and untreated calves but detected no enhancement of plasmid transfer associated with ceftiofur treatment. the second study detected no association (p = 0.22) between ceftiofur use and either the occurrence of ceftiofur-resistant salmonellosis or the frequency of cephalosporin resistance in commensal e. coli. however, herds with a history of salmonellosis (including both ceftiofur-resistant and ceftiofur-susceptible salmonella isolates) used more ceftiofur than herds with no history of salmonellosis (p = 0.03) these findings fail to support a major role for ceftiofur use in the maintenance and dissemination of bla(cmy-2)-bearing plasmid mediated cephalosporin resistance in commensal e. coli and in pathogenic salmonella in these dairy cattle populations.
fate of surface-inoculated escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, and  salmonella typhimurium on kippered beef during extended storage at refrigeration and abusive temperatures.
the behavior of escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella  typhimurium on kippered beef was evaluated. individual pieces of the product were separately inoculated on the top and bottom surfaces with each three- to six-strain pathogen cocktail at ca. 6.0 log cfu per piece and stored at 4, 10, 21, or 30 degrees c for up to 28 days in each of two trials. when kippered beef was inoculated with e. coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, or l. monocytogenes and stored at 4, 10, 21, or 30 degrees c for up to 28 days, pathogen numbers decreased ca. 0.4 to 0.9, 1.0 to 1.8, 3.0 to > or = 5.25, and > or = 5.0 to 5.25 log cfu per piece, respectively. average d-values for e. coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and l. monocytogenes stored at 4 to 30 degrees c for 28 days were ca. 41 to 4.6, 40.8 to 5.3, and 29.5 to 4.3 days, respectively. as expected, the higher the storage temperature, the greater the level and rate of inactivation for all three pathogens. these data establish that kippered beef does not provide an environment conducive to proliferation of these pathogens.
escherichia coli and salmonella enterica are protected against acetic acid, but not hydrochloric acid, by hypertonicity.
chapman et al. (b. chapman, n. jensen, t ross, and m. b. cole, appl. environ. microbiol. 72:5165-5172, 2006) demonstrated that an increased nacl concentration prolongs survival of escherichia coli o157 serl 2 in a broth model simulating the aqueous phase of a food dressing or sauce containing acetic acid. we examined the responses of five other e. coli strains and four salmonella enterica strains to increasing concentrations of nacl under conditions of lethal acidity and observed that the average "lag" time prior to inactivation decreases in the presence of hydrochloric acid but not in the presence of acetic acid. for e. coli in the presence of acetic acid, the lag time increased with increasing nacl concentrations up to 2 to 4% at ph 4.0, up to 4 to 6% at ph 3.8, and up to 4 to 7% (wt/wt of water) nacl at ph 3.6. salmonella was inactivated more rapidly by combined acetic acid and nacl stresses than e. coli, but increasing nacl concentrations still decreased the lag time prior to inactivation in the presence of acetic acid; at ph 4.0 up to 1 to 4% nacl was protective, and at ph 3.8 up to 1 to 2% nacl delayed the onset of inactivation. sublethal injury kinetics suggest that this complex response is a balance between the lethal effects of acetic acid, against which nacl is apparently protective, and the lethal effects of the nacl itself. compared against 3% nacl, 10% (wt/wt of water) sucrose with 0.5% nacl (which has similar osmotic potential) was found to be equally protective against adverse acetic acid conditions. we propose that hypertonicity may directly affect the rate of diffusion of acetic acid into cells and hence cell survival.
myxinidin, a novel antimicrobial peptide from the epidermal mucus of hagfish, myxine glutinosa l.
fish epidermal mucus contains innate immune components that provide a first line  of defense against various infectious pathogens. this study reports the bioassay-guided fractionation and characterization of a novel antimicrobial peptide, myxinidin, from the acidic epidermal mucus extract of hagfish (myxine glutinosa l.). edman sequencing and mass spectrometry revealed that myxinidin consists of 12 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 1,327.68 da. myxinidin showed activity against a broad range of bacteria and yeast pathogens at minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 microg/ml. screened pathogens, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium c610, escherichia coli d31, aeromonas salmonicida a449, yersinia ruckeri 96-4, and listonella anguillarum 02-11 were found to be highly sensitive to myxinidin at the mbc of 1.0-2.5 microg/ml; staphylococcus epidermis c621 and yeast (candida albicans c627) had an mbc of 10.0 microg/ml. the antimicrobial activity of myxinidin was found to be two to 16 times more active than a potent fish-derived antimicrobial peptide, pleurocidin (nrc-17), against most of the screened pathogens. the microbicidal activity of myxinidin was retained in the presence of sodium chloride (nacl) at concentrations up to 0.3 m and had no hemolytic activity against mammalian red blood cells. these results suggest that myxinidin may have potential applications in fish and human therapeutics.
antimicrobial activity of lactoperoxidase system incorporated into cross-linked alginate films.
in this study, the antimicrobial effect of lactoperoxidase (lps) incorporated alginate films was investigated on escherichia coli (nrrl b-3008), listeria innocua (nrrl b-33314), and pseudomonas fluorescens (nrrl b-253) in presence of different concentrations of h(2)o(2) (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mm) and kscn (1, 2, and 4 mm). the incorporation of 70 nmol abts/min/cm(2) lps into alginate films gave 0.66 to 0.85 nmol abts/min/cm(2) enzyme activity at 0.2 to 0.8 mm h(2)o(2) concentration range. the antimicrobial activity of lps system on target bacteria changed according to the concentrations of kscn and h(2)o(2). the growth of all tested bacteria was prevented for a 6-h period by applying lps system in presence of 0.4 or 0.8 mm h(2)o(2) and 4 mm kscn. at 0.8 mm h(2)o(2) and 4 mm kscn, the lps system also inhibited growth of l. innocua and p. fluorescens for a 24-h incubation period, whereas e. coli growth could not be inhibited for 24 h under these conditions. at 0.2 mm h(2)o(2) and 1 to 4 mm kscn, a considerable inhibitory effect was obtained only on p. fluorescens. the decreasing order of the resistance of studied bacteria to lps system is as follows: e. coli, l. innocua, and p. fluorescens. the developed antimicrobial system has a good potential for use in meat, poultry, and seafood since alginate coatings are already used in these products. further studies are needed to test the lps incorporated edible films in real food systems.
in vivo transfer of an incfib plasmid harbouring a class 1 integron with gene cassettes dfra1-aada1.
transfer of resistance genes from bacteria from food producing animals to human pathogens is a potential risk to human health. the aim of this study was to determine in vivo transfer of a plasmid harbouring a class 1 integron containing gene cassettes dfra1-aada1 from salmonella to escherichia coli and the influence of the use of antimicrobials on this transfer. thirty four-day-old spf chickens colonized with e. coli k12 were divided into 3 groups of 10 animals each, and placed in separate isolators. eleven days after inoculation with e. coli k12 the chickens were inoculated orally with 10(4)cfu of s. enterica spp. enterica serovar typhimurium containing a plasmid harbouring a class 1 integron with gene cassettes dfra1-aada1. two days after the administration of s. typhimurium 1 group was treated orally with doxycycline, 1 group orally with trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole and 1 group remained untreated (control group). e. coli k12, s. typhimurium and the transconjugants were isolated from cloacal samples on selective macconkey agar plates. transfer of the plasmid was confirmed by plasmid characterization, pcr, pfge and hybridization. plasmid mediated transfer of a class 1 integron was observed almost immediately after inoculation with s. typhimurium. treatment of the chickens with antibiotics had neither a positive nor a negative effect on the transfer rates. in addition to the resistance genes located on the integron, resistance genes encoding for tetracycline and amoxicillin resistance transferred from the donor strain as well. the resistance genes and the integron were located on a 130 kb sized incfib plasmid. our data demonstrate in vivo transfer of an incfib plasmid harbouring a class 1 integron containing gene cassettes dfra1-aada1 from salmonella to e. coli, with or without selective pressure of antibiotics in chickens.
distribution of mutation frequencies among salmonella enterica isolates from animal and human sources and genetic characterization of a salmonella heidelberg hypermutator.
hypermutation is an important mechanism used by different salmonella enterica subspecies enterica to regulate genetic stability in adaptation to changing environments, including antimicrobial treatments and industrial processes. strong hypermutator strains generally contain a mutation in genes of the methyl mismatch repair (mmr) system and have mutation frequencies up to 1000-fold higher than wild type strains. the objectives of this study were to determine the distribution of mutation frequencies from a collection of 209 salmonella strains, to genetically characterize a strong mutator, and to study mmr mutated protein-dna binding interactions. only one strain of s. heidelberg was determined to have a hypermutator phenotype by virtue of its high mutation rate. sequencing of genes of the mmr system showed a 12bp deletion in the muts gene was present. the mmr mutated protein-dna binding interactions were studied by bioanalysis, using the available crystal structure of a similar muts protein from escherichia coli. this analysis showed the small deletion in the salmonella muts was localized within the core domain. a retardation assay with muts from hypermutable and wild type strains showed this mutation has no effect on muts dna binding. a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms of hypermutation will help to anticipate the behavior of hypermutator strains in various conditions.
discovery of novel 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives as anti-gram-positive antibacterial agents.
a number of 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives were synthesized and examined for growth inhibition of several kinds of bacteria. 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone itself exhibited no antibacterial activity, but some of its derivatives showed various antibacterial activities depending on functional groups introduced on the 2-phenyl ring. eighteen out of 24 compounds synthesized in this study appeared to possess antibacterial activities against at least two gram-positive strains of bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, 2-(biphenyl-4-yl)-2',3',4'-trihydroxyacetophenone being the most active with lc(50) of 5.8 mum and 5.6 mum respectively. however, none of the synthesized compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on gram-negative strains, such as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica, suggesting that anti-gram-positive specificity of the antibacterial compounds.
effects of organic matter on acidic electrolysed water for reduction of foodborne pathogens on lettuce and spinach.
aims: to evaluate the efficacy of acidic electrolysed water (ew) in the presence  of organic matter (bovine serum) on the inoculated surfaces of lettuce and spinach. materials and results: lettuce and spinach leaves were inoculated with a cocktail of three strains each of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes and treated with deionized water, acidic ew and acidic ew containing bovine serum (5, 10, 15 and 20 ml l(-1)) for 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 3 min and 5 min at room temperature (22 +/- 2 degrees c). in the absence of bovine serum, acidic ew treatment reduced levels of cells below the detection limit (0.7 log) in 5 min. in the presence of bovine serum, bactericidal activity of acidic ew decreased with increasing serum concentration. conclusions: organic matter reduces the effectiveness of acidic ew for reducing pathogens on the surfaces of lettuce and spinach. significance and impact of the study: from a practical standpoint, organic matter reduces the efficacy of acidic ew. this study was conducted to confirm the effect of organic matter on the properties of acidic ew in the inactivation of foodborne pathogens on the surface of vegetables.
evaluation of antibacterial activity of whey protein isolate coating incorporated with nisin, grape seed extract, malic acid, and edta on a turkey frankfurter system.
the effectiveness of whey protein isolate (wpi) coatings incorporated with grape  seed extract (gse), nisin (n), malic acid (ma), and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (edta) and their combinations to inhibit the growth of listeria monocytogenes, e. coli o157:h7, and salmonella typhimurium were evaluated in a turkey frankfurter system through surface inoculation (approximately 10(6) cfu/g) of pathogens. the inoculated frankfurters were dipped into wpi film forming solutions both with and without the addition of antimicrobial agents (gse, ma, or n and edta, or combinations). samples were stored at 4 degrees c for 28 d. the l. monocytogenes population (5.5 log/g) decreased to 2.3 log/g after 28 d at 4 degrees c in the samples containing nisin (6000 iu/g) combined with gse (0.5%) and ma (1.0%). the s. typhimurium population (6.0 log/g) was decreased to approximately 1 log cycles after 28 d at 4 degrees c in the samples coated with wpi containing a combination of n, ma, gse, and edta. the e. coli o157:h7 population (6.15 log/g) was decreased by 4.6 log cycles after 28 d in samples containing wpi coating incorporated with n, ma, and edta. these findings demonstrated that the use of an edible film coating containing nisin, organic acids, and natural extracts is a promising means of controlling the growth and recontamination of l. monocytogenes, s. typhimurium, and e. coli o157:h7 in ready-to-eat poultry products.
a small-molecule screen identifies the antipsychotic drug pimozide as an inhibitor of listeria monocytogenes infection.
we developed a screening procedure to identify small-molecule compounds that altered infection by listeria monocytogenes to gain insights into bacterial/host cellular processes required for intracellular pathogenesis. a small-molecule library of 480 compounds with known biological functions was screened, and 21 compounds that altered the l. monocytogenes infection of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (bmm) were identified. the identified compounds affected various cellular functions, such as actin polymerization, kinase/phosphatase activity, calcium signaling, and apoptosis. pimozide, an fda-approved drug used to treat severe tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia, was further examined and shown to decrease the bacterial uptake and vacuole escape of l. monocytogenes in bmm. the inhibitory effect of pimozide on internalization was not specific for l. monocytogenes, as the phagocytosis of other bacterial species (bacillus subtilis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and escherichia coli k12) was significantly inhibited in the presence of pimozide. the invasion and cell-to-cell spread of l. monocytogenes during the infection of nonprofessional phagocytic cells also was decreased by pimozide treatment. although pimozide has been reported to be an antagonist of mammalian cell calcium channels, the infection of bmm in a calcium-free medium did not relieve the inhibitory effects of pimozide on l. monocytogenes infection. our results provide a generalizable screening approach for identifying small-molecule compounds that affect cellular pathways that are required for intracellular bacterial pathogenesis. we also have identified pimozide, a clinically approved antipsychotic drug, as a compound that may be suitable for further development as a therapeutic for intracellular bacterial infections.
effect of gamma radiation on heat shock protein expression of four foodborne pathogens.
aims: the effects of gamma radiation on three heat shock proteins (hsps) (groel,  dnak and groes) synthesis in two gram-negative (escherichia coli and salmonella serotype typhimurium) and two gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes) bacteria were investigated. methods and results: the bacterial strains were treated with three radiation doses to induce cell damage, to obtain a viable but nonculturable state, and to cause cell death. western blot analysis and quantification of hsps in bacteria were performed immediately after irradiation treatment. in the four foodborne pathogens, groel was strongly induced by gamma rays in a dose-dependent manner, confirming the involvement of this protein in the cellular response to the stress generated by ionizing radiation. in addition, it was found that e. coli exposed to gamma radiation showed a significantly induction of dnak and groes proteins when compared with nonirradiated bacteria, whereas a groes slight induction and a dnak inhibition were observed in salm. typhimurium. conclusions: the gamma rays influence the synthesis of hsps in foodborne pathogen in a way that critically depends on the radiation dose. significance and impact of the study: the study of stress response to several radiation doses was undertaken to elucidate how bacteria can survive in harsh conditions and cope with gamma radiation used to control foodborne pathogens and to characterize their adaptative response to this treatment.
antimicrobial efficacy of citron essential oil on spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in fruit-based salads.
the aim of this study was the evaluation of the effects of pure citral and citron essential oil on microbial spoilage and growth and survival of pathogenic microorganisms during storage. they were added in the syrup of industrial ready-to-eat fruit salads stored at 9 degrees c. both citral (25 to 125 ppm) and citron essential oil (300, 600, 900 ppm) were able to prolong the microbial shelf life of the fruit-based salads. the essential oil gave excellent results, avoiding the undesirable effects attributable to the cytotoxicity of citral. citron essential oil doubled the time needed for the wild microflora to reach concentrations able to produce a perceivable spoilage in condition of thermal abuse (9 degrees c). the same essential oil had reduced effects on the survival of gram-negative species salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli, but showed a strong inhibition toward the gram-positive pathogen listeria monocytogenes.
citrus products decrease growth of e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium in  pure culture and in fermentation with mixed ruminal microorganisms in vitro.
orange peel and orange pulp are by-products that are included in feedlot and dairy cattle diets because of their low cost and high nutritional quality. the antimicrobial activity of citrus oils has been reported previously. the present study was carried out to determine whether these citrus by-products exert antimicrobial effects on escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium populations that are found in cattle gastrointestinal tracts. the growth of pure cultures (n = 3) of e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium were reduced (p < 0.05) by addition of 2% (w/v) orange pulp and orange peel. ruminal fluid was collected from cattle (n = 2) and e. coli o157:h7 or salmonella typhimurium were added. the addition of orange pulp and peel to in vitro mixed ruminal microorganism fermentations (n = 3) demonstrated that both orange pulp and peel reduced e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium populations at least 2 log(10) in mixed ruminal fluid fermentations. addition of orange pulp reduced (p < 0.05) e. coli o157:h7 populations from 10(5) to 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml and salmonella typhimurium populations (p < 0.05) from 10(4) to 10(2) cfu/ml. these results indicate that orange pulp and/or peel included in ruminant diets could decrease ruminal populations of foodborne pathogenic bacteria. further research is needed to determine whether the antimicrobial activity of orange products against e. coli o157:h7 or salmonella typhimurium is expressed in the lower gastrointestinal tract.
viability of multi-strain mixtures of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, or escherichia coli o157:h7 inoculated into the batter or onto the surface of a soudjouk-style fermented semi-dry sausage.
the fate of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, or escherichia coli o157:h7 were separately monitored both in and on soudjouk. fermentation and drying alone reduced numbers of l. monocytogenes by 0.07 and 0.74 log(10)cfu/g for sausages fermented to ph 5.3 and 4.8, respectively, whereas numbers of s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 were reduced by 1.52 and 3.51 log(10)cfu/g and 0.03 and 1.11 log(10)cfu/g, respectively. when sausages fermented to ph 5.3 or 4.8 were stored at 4, 10, or 21 degrees c, numbers of l. monocytogenes, s. typhimurium, and e. coli o157:h7 decreased by an additional 0.08-1.80, 0.88-3.74, and 0.68-3.17 log(10)cfu/g, respectively, within 30 days. storage for 90 days of commercially manufactured soudjouk that was sliced and then surface inoculated with l. monocytogenes, s. typhimurium, and e. coli o157:h7 generated average d-values of ca. 10.1, 7.6, and 5.9 days at 4 degrees c; 6.4, 4.3, and 2.9 days at 10 degrees c; 1.4, 0.9, and 1.6 days at 21 degrees c; and 0.9, 1.4, and 0.25 days at 30 degrees c. overall, fermentation to ph 4.8 and storage at 21 degrees c was the most effective treatment for reducing numbers of l. monocytogenes (2.54 log(10)cfu/g reduction), s. typhimurium (> or =5.23 log(10)cfu/g reduction), and e. coli o157:h7 (3.48 log(10)cfu/g reduction). in summary, soudjouk-style sausage does not provide a favorable environment for outgrowth/survival of these three pathogens.
combined physico-chemical treatments based on enterocin as-48 for inactivation of gram-negative bacteria in soybean sprouts.
enterocin as-48 was tested for decontamination of soybean sprouts against gram-negative bacteria. although treatment with bacteriocin alone had no effect on salmonella enterica, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was detected at ph 9.0 and in combination with moderate heat treatment. greatest inactivation was achieved for sprouts heated for 5 min at 65 degrees c in an alkaline (ph 9.0) enterocin as-48 solution of 25 microg/ml. bactericidal activity against s. enterica increased greatly when enterocin as-48 was used in washing solutions in combination with several chemical compounds: edta, lactic acid, peracetic acid, polyphosphoric acid, sodium hypochlorite, hexadecylpyridinium chloride, propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, and hydrocinnamic acid. the combined treatment of enterocin as-48 and polyphosphoric acid was tested against several other gram-negative bacteria inoculated on sprouts. the bacteria tested showed great differences in sensitivity to polyphosphoric acid, but synergism with enterocin as-48 was confirmed in all cases. combinations of enterocin as-48 (25 microg/ml) and polyphosphoric acid in a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0% significantly reduced or inhibited growth of the populations of s. enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, shigella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens in sprout samples stored at 6 degrees c and 15 degrees c. the combined treatment could therefore be applied to reduce the risks of gram-negative pathogenic as well as spoilage bacteria on sprouts.
high pressures in combination with antimicrobials to reduce escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella agona in apple juice and orange juice.
the effect of high pressure processing in conjunction with the chemical antimicrobials, dimethyl dicarbonate (dmdc), hydrogen peroxide, cinnamic acid, potassium sorbate, and sodium benzoate (nab) on e. coli o157:h7 strain e009 and salmonella enterica serovar agona was investigated in apple juice and orange juice, respectively. juices were inoculated with approximately 10(6) cfu/ml and subjected to pressures of 550 mpa (e. coli o157:h7 samples) and 400 mpa (salmonella agona samples) for 2 min at 6 degrees c (initial temperature). populations of each pathogen were determined before pressurization, immediately after pressurization, and after samples had been held after treatment for 24 h at 4 degrees c. the most effective treatment for e. coli o157:h7, as determined by plating immediately after pressurization, was 125 ppm of dmdc, which caused a >4.98-log reduction. other treatments that were significantly different from the sample with no added antimicrobial were 62.5 ppm of dmdc, 300 ppm of hydrogen peroxide, and 500 ppm of nab, which produced 4.97-, 5.79-, and 3.91-log total reductions, respectively. after 24 h at 4 degrees c, e. coli o157:h7 was undetectable in all treatment groups (and controls). in samples inoculated with salmonella, the most effective treatment was 62.5 ppm of dmdc, which produced a 5.96-log decrease immediately after pressure treatment. the results for 1,000 ppm of nab, which produced a 3.26-log decrease, also were significantly different from those for the sample containing no antimicrobials. after 24 h at 4 degrees c, all samples with added antimicrobials had near or more than a 5-log total reduction of salmonella agona.
evaluation of nonpathogenic surrogate bacteria as process validation indicators for salmonella enterica for selected antimicrobial treatments, cold storage, and fermentation in meat.
prerigor lean and adipose beef carcass tissues were artificially inoculated individually with stationary-phase cultures of five nonpathogenic escherichia coli cultures that had been previously identified as surrogates for e. coli o157:h7 or a mixture of five salmonella strains in a fecal inoculum. each tissue sample was processed with microbial interventions comparable with those used in the meat industry. the log reductions of the e. coli isolates were generally not statistically different from the salmonellae inoculum within a specific treatment. inoculation experiments were also conducted with ground beef stored at either 4 or -20 degrees c. when compared with the salmonella inoculum, at least three of the five e. coli strains survived in a manner that was not statistically different from the salmonellae. the e. coli strains and the salmonella mixed culture were also inoculated into summer sausage batter, and the population enumerated both before and after fermentation. four of the e. coli strains showed a lower population reduction (higher survival) than the salmonella mixed culture. the five nonpathogenic e. coli strains may be used as individually or collectively for specific process validation indicators for salmonella.
survival of bacterial pathogens during the thermophilic anaerobic digestion of biowaste: laboratory experiments and in situ validation.
anaerobic digestion is continually gaining importance for the processing of the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes. although methods for studying the survival of pathogen exist, these methods often need adaptations, are expensive, time consuming or generally not well suited for the harsh conditions within an anaerobic digestion system. in the present study we investigated the applicability of commercially available, mechanically stable and inexpensive pathogen carriers to validate in situ pathogen inhibition within a 750,000l thermophilic, bio-waste treating anaerobic digester. none of the pathogens investigated (listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni) was capable of survival under the conditions of the biogas reactor for more than 24 h indicating that the temperature and physico-chemical properties of the sludge of the fermenter were effective in inhibiting the survival of these microorganisms.
functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s. cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.
viability of zoonotic pathogens escherichia coli and salmonella in swine manure slurries with and without a urease inhibitor and thymol.
aims: to determine the effects of urine, a urease inhibitor and/or an odour-reducing antimicrobial compound, on zoonotic pathogens in swine manure slurries. methods and results: swine faeces were collected and blended with different amounts of urine. marker strains of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium and escherichia coli o157:h7 were inoculated into the manure slurries with or without the urease inhibitor, n-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide, or the antimicrobial compound thymol. in slurries containing approximately 1 : 1 or 2 : 1 of urine and faeces, the decreases in colony forming units (cfu) of salm. typhimurium and e. coli were similar and few counts were observed after 14 days. when the urine content of the slurry was increased to 5 : 1, both strains died off rapidly. when nbpt was added to the slurries, pathogen cfu was not affected in the 1 : 1 slurry. the 2 : 1 and 5 : 1 slurries had higher urea content and nbpt increased cfu of both pathogens. thymol addition rapidly killed the pathogens and few cfu of salmonella or e. coli were observed after day 1. conclusions: these experiments demonstrate that urea hydrolysis in swine manure affects pathogens. inhibition of urea hydrolysis may promote pathogen viability. significance and impact of the study: manure amendments that prevent urea hydrolysis may promote pathogen persistence. additional treatments with antimicrobials may be required to kill pathogens.
isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
phenotypic and proteomic characterization of multiply antibiotic-resistant variants of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium selected following exposure to disinfectants.
in previous work, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain sl1344 was exposed to sublethal concentrations of three widely used farm disinfectants in daily serial passages for 7 days in an attempt to investigate possible links between the use of disinfectants and antimicrobial resistance. stable variants oxcr1, qacfgr2, and topr2 were obtained following treatment with an oxidizing compound blend, a quaternary ammonium disinfectant containing formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, and a tar acid-based disinfectant, respectively. all variants exhibited ca. fourfold-reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and ampicillin. this coincided with reduced levels of outer membrane proteins for all strains and high levels of acrab-tolc for oxcr1 and qacfgr2, as demonstrated by two-dimensional high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. the protein profiles of oxcr1 and qacfgr2 were similar, but they were different from that of topr2. an array of different proteins protecting against oxidants, nitroaromatics, disulfides, and peroxides were overexpressed in all strains. the growth and motility of variants were reduced compared to the growth and motility of the parent strain, the expression of several virulence proteins was altered, and the invasiveness in an enteric epithelial cell line was reduced. the colony morphology of oxcr1 and qacfgr2 was smooth, and both variants exhibited a loss of modal distribution of the lipopolysaccharide o-antigen chain length, favoring the production of short o-antigen chain molecules. metabolic changes were also detected, suggesting that there was increased protein synthesis and a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to substrate level phosphorylation. in this study, we obtained evidence that farm disinfectants can select for strains with reduced susceptibility to antibiotics, and here we describe changes in protein expression in such strains.
broad-spectrum in vitro antibacterial activities of clay minerals against antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens.
objectives: the capacity to properly address the worldwide incidence of infectious diseases lies in the ability to detect, prevent and effectively treat these infections. therefore, identifying and analysing inhibitory agents are worthwhile endeavours in an era when few new classes of effective antimicrobials have been developed. the use of geological nanomaterials to heal skin infections has been evident since the earliest recorded history, and specific clay minerals may prove valuable in the treatment of bacterial diseases, including infections for which there are no effective antibiotics, such as buruli ulcer and multidrug-resistant infections. methods: we have subjected two iron-rich clay minerals, which have previously been used to treat buruli ulcer patients, to broth culture testing of antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria to assess the feasibility of using clay minerals as therapeutic agents. results: one specific mineral, csag02, demonstrated bactericidal activity against pathogenic escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) e. coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium marinum, and a combined bacteriostatic/bactericidal effect against staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and mycobacterium smegmatis, whereas another mineral with similar structure and bulk crystal chemistry, csar02, had no effect on or enhanced bacterial growth. the <0.2 microm fraction of csag02 and csag02 heated to 200 or 550 degrees c retained bactericidal activity, whereas cation-exchanged csag02 and csag02 heated to 900 degrees c no longer killed e. coli. conclusions: our results indicate that specific mineral products have intrinsic, heat-stable antibacterial properties, which could provide an inexpensive treatment against numerous human bacterial infections.
the use of bulk tank milk samples to monitor trends in antimicrobial resistance on dairy farms.
the routine monitoring of bacteria obtained from bulk tank milk (btm) may be an important tool for detecting farm-level trends in antimicrobial resistance on dairy farms. this study describes and compares antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of salmonella enterica subspecies enterica (salmonella) and escherichia coli recovered from dairy btm. btm from more than 400 dairies in a dairy-intense region of california were sampled eight times at 2- to 3-month intervals over a 29-month period. from salmonella positive and salmonella negative herds any one salmonella and three e. coli isolates per sample were tested for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials. the prevalence of multiple drug resistant (mdr) e. coli was assessed in relation to salmonella on the farm, farm size, season, mdr salmonella, and serovar. at each sampling period, 10-21% and 54-77% of the dairy farms were positive for salmonella and e. coli, respectively. the most commonly recovered salmonella serovars were montevideo (33%), typhimurium (14%), dublin (13%), and give (11%). two-thirds, respectively, of 478 salmonella and 1577 e. coli isolates were pan-susceptible. the antimicrobial resistance patterns of mdr salmonella tended to be serovar dependent and were different from the antimicrobial resistance patterns of mdr e. coli. mdr e. coli were more likely to be recovered from dairies with mdr salmonella. there were no associations between mdr e. coli and season, salmonella serovar detected in the btm, or dairy herd size. bulk milk e. coli and salmonella could be valuable to monitor the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance in dairy milk production.
structure of the ribosomal interacting gtpase yjeq from the enterobacterial species salmonella typhimurium.
the yjeq class of p-loop gtpases assist in ribosome biogenesis and also bind to the 30s subunit of mature ribosomes. yjeq ribosomal binding is gtp-dependent and thought to specifically direct protein synthesis, although the nature of the upstream signal causing this event in vivo is as yet unknown. the attenuating effect of yjeq mutants on bacterial growth in escherichia coli makes it a potential target for novel antimicrobial agents. in order to further explore the structure and function of yjeq, the isolation, crystallization and structure determination of yjeq from the enterobacterial species salmonella typhimurium (styjeq) is reported. whilst the overall styjeq fold is similar to those of the previously reported thematoga maritima and bacillus subtilis orthologues, particularly the gtpase domain, there are larger differences in the three ob folds. although the zinc-finger secondary structure is conserved, significant sequence differences alter the nature of the external surface in each case and may reflect varying signalling pathways. therefore, it may be easier to develop yjeq-specific inhibitors that target the n- and c-terminal regions, disrupting the metabolic connectivity rather than the gtpase activity. the availability of coordinates for styjeq will provide a significantly improved basis for threading gram-negative orthologue sequences and in silico compound-screening studies, with the potential for the development of species-selective drugs.
recipes for antimicrobial wine marinades against bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella enterica.
we have evaluated bactericidal activities against bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella enterica of several antimicrobial wine recipes, each consisting of red or white wine extracts of oregano leaves with added garlic juice and oregano oil. dose-response plots were used to determine the percentage of the recipes that resulted in a 50% decrease in colony-forming units (cfu) at 60 min (ba(50)). studies designed to optimize antibacterial activities of the recipes demonstrated that several combinations of the naturally occurring plant-derived ingredients rapidly inactivated the above mentioned 4 foodborne pathogens. we also showed that (a) incubation temperature affected activities in the following order: 37 degrees c > 21 degrees c > 4 degrees c; (b) varying the initial bacterial concentrations from 10(3) to 10(4) to 10(5) cfu/well did not significantly affect ba(50) values; (c) storage of 3 marinades up to 2 mo did not change their effectiveness against salmonella enterica; and (d) polyphenolic compounds isolated by chromatography from red wine exhibited exceptional activity at nanogram levels against 2 strains of bacillus cereus. these observations suggest that antimicrobial wine formulations have the potential to improve the microbiological safety of foods.
antimicrobial activity of epsilon-polylysine against escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and listeria monocytogenes in various food extracts.
this study compared the antimicrobial effects of epsilon-polylysine (epsilon-pl)  against escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and listeria monocytogenes in 6 food extracts and in broth. the food extracts (10% (w/w) in distilled water) evaluated were fat-free and whole fat milk, beef, bologna, rice, and vegetables (50:50 ratio of broccoli and cauliflower). epsilon-pl was tested at 0.005% and 0.02% (w/v) against e. coli o157:h7 and l. monocytogenes, and 0.02% and 0.04% (w/v) against s. typhimurium. the substrates were inoculated (5 log cfu/ml) and periodically analyzed for surviving populations during storage at 12 degrees c for 6 d. in general, all 3 pathogens reached 7 to 9 log cfu/ml within 2 d in control substrates (no epsilon-pl). immediate bactericidal effects (p < 0.05) following exposure to epsilon-pl were obtained in the rice (all pathogens) and vegetable (e. coli o157:h7 and s. typhimurium) extracts. during storage, antimicrobial effects of epsilon-pl were more pronounced in the food extracts than in the broth medium. the greatest antimicrobial activity for all 3 pathogens was obtained in the rice and vegetable extracts, where counts were reduced (p < 0.05) to below the detection limit (0.0 log cfu/ml) by one or both epsilon-pl concentrations tested. in the other food extracts (fat-free milk, whole fat milk, beef, and bologna), both epsilon-pl concentrations tested generally resulted in lower (p < 0.05) pathogen levels at the end of storage compared to initial counts, with better bactericidal effects exerted by the higher of the 2 epsilon-pl concentrations. additional research is needed to explore the potential antimicrobial effects of epsilon-pl in real food systems.
in hydrolyzed cow's milk helicobacter pylori becomes nonculturable and the growth of salmonella typhi and escherichia coli is inhibited.
the colony forming unit (cfu) of h. pylori is reduced rapidly in lipase hydrolyzed cow's milk and a similar reduction was found in a physiological saline solution when it was supplemented with soluble c4 to c10 fatty acids of milk fat composition. slight cfu decreases were observed for e. coli and s. typhi in hydrolyzed milk buffered to ph 3, while the counts in milk and physiological saline solution at ph 3 stayed almost unchanged for 24 h. e. coli proliferated in glucose-peptone medium, better at ph 4.7 than at ph 3. on the other hand, supplementation of the medium with soluble fatty acids of milk composition completely inhibited growth for 32 h. supplementation of the medium with fatty acids reduced the growth of s. typhi to approximately 1/20 at ph 4.7. therefore, milk hydrolyzed by gastric lipase may damage h. pylori, producing a nonculturable state. with e. coli and s. typhi, hydrolyzed milk does not induce inactivation to a nonculturable state but inhibits their proliferation potently. the latter is considered to be a state prior to vbnc (viable but nonculturable). however, the antibiotic effect will disappear when the fatty acids are absorbed by the intestine.
high-pressure resistance variation of escherichia coli o157:h7 strains and salmonella serovars in tryptic soy broth, distilled water, and fruit juice.
the effect of high pressure on the log reduction of six strains of escherichia coli o157:h7 and five serovars of salmonella enterica was investigated in tryptic soy broth, sterile distilled water, and commercially sterile orange juice (for salmonella) and apple cider (for e. coli). samples were subjected to high-pressure processing treatment at 300 and 550 mpa for 2 min at 6 degrees c. samples were plated onto tryptic soy agar directly after pressurization and after being held for 24 h at 4 degrees c. at 300 mpa, little effect was seen on e. coli o157:h7 strains, while salmonella serovars varied in resistance, showing reductions between 0.26 and 3.95 log cfu/ml. at 550 mpa, e. coli o157:h7 strains exhibited a range of reductions (0.28 to 4.39 log cfu/ml), while most salmonella populations decreased beyond the detection limit (> 5-log cfu/ml reduction). the most resistant strains tested were e. coli e009 and salmonella agona. generally, bacterial populations in fruit juices showed larger decreases than did populations in tryptic soy broth and distilled water. e. coli o157:h7 cultures held for 24 h at 4 degrees c after treatment at 550 mpa showed a significant log decrease as compared with cultures directly after treatment (p < or = 0.05), while salmonella serovars did not show this significant decrease (p > 0.05). all salmonella serovars tested in orange juice treated at 550 mpa for 2 min at 6 degrees c and held for 24 h showed a > 5-log decrease, while e. coli o157:h7 strains require a higher pressure, higher temperature, longer pressurization, or a chemical additive to achieve a 5-log decrease.
oligonucleotide microarray for molecular characterization and genotyping of salmonella spp. strains.
objectives: to characterize and subtype multidrug-resistant salmonella isolates by determining the virulence factors, prophage sequences and antimicrobial resistance genes using a novel salmonella-specific oligonucleotide microarray. methods: preliminary screening of 24 salmonella clinical isolates was carried out by using susceptibility testing, plasmid profiling and class 1 integron pcr. subsequently, oligonucleotide microarray was involved in genotypic characterization and localization of monitored genetic markers. the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes was also detected and confirmed by pcr and subsequent sequencing. the potential spread of emerging bla(shv-2) was investigated by bacterial conjugation. results: all salmonella strains revealed resistance to two or more (up to nine) antibiotics. nineteen of them carried class 1 integrons including dfra1, dfra12, aada1, aada2, bla(pse-1) and bla(tem-1) gene cassettes, respectively. twenty-three out of 24 salmonella isolates possessed one or more plasmids. oligonucleotide microarray characterization and typing revealed the conserved character of salmonella pathogenicity island virulence factors among three salmonella enterica serovars, significant variability in prophage sequences and many different antimicrobial resistance gene patterns. differential labelling of genomic and plasmid dna, respectively, and hybridization to the microarray made it possible to localize important resistance determinants. microarray results were successfully confirmed and verified by using pcr. the emerging bla(shv-2) gene from salmonella kentucky sk10944 conferring resistance to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime was transferred via bacterial conjugation to escherichia coli k-12 3110. conclusions: salmonella isolates were quickly and thoroughly characterized by a novel oligonucleotide microarray, which could become a useful tool for detection of virulence and resistance genes and monitoring of their dissemination among salmonellae and closely related bacteria.
the distribution of acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil bacteria.
most bacteria possess the enzyme acetohydroxyacid synthase, which is used to produce branched-chain amino acids. enteric bacteria contain several isozymes suited to different conditions, but the distribution of acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil bacteria is largely unknown. growth experiments confirmed that escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, and enterobacter aerogenes contain isozymes of acetohydroxyacid synthase, allowing the bacteria to grow in the presence of valine (which causes feedback inhibition of ahas i) or the sulfonylurea herbicide triasulfuron (which inhibits ahas ii) although a slight lag phase was observed in growth in the latter case. several common soil isolates were inhibited by triasulfuron, but pseudomonas fluorescens and rhodococcus erythropolis were not inhibited by any combination of triasulfuron and valine. the extent of sulfonylurea-sensitive acetohydroxyacid synthase in soil was revealed when 21 out of 27 isolated bacteria in pure culture were inhibited by triasulfuron, the addition of isoleucine and/or valine reversing the effect in 19 cases. primers were designed to target the genes encoding the large subunits (ilvb, ilvg and ilvi) of acetohydroxyacid synthase from available sequence data and a approximately 355 bp fragment in bacillus subtilis, arthrobacter globiformis, e. coli and s. enterica was subsequently amplified. the primers were used to create a small clone library of sequences from an agricultural soil. phylogenetic analysis revealed significant sequence variation, but all 19 amino acid sequences were most closely related to published large subunit acetohydroxyacid synthase amino acid sequences within several phyla including the proteobacteria and actinobacteria. the results suggested the majority of soil microorganisms contain only one functional acetohydroxyacid synthase enzyme sensitive to sulfonylurea herbicides.
survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium in iceberg lettuce and the antimicrobial effect of rice vinegar against e. coli o157:h7.
the microbiological safety of fresh produce is a significant concern of consumers and industry. after applying at an inoculated level (about 10(6) cfug(-1)) of e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium on shredded iceberg lettuce and water samples individually, they were stored at 4 degrees c for 14 days and 22 degrees c for 7 days to monitor the growth and survival of pathogens. the results showed that at the end of 4 degrees c storage, populations of two pathogens in lettuce and water decreased approximately 1 log cfug(-1). however, microbial levels on shredded lettuce increased 3 logs within 3 days at 22 degrees c. vinegar (acetic acid) had been used to reduce populations of foodborne pathogens in foods; hence, the antimicrobial effect of rice vinegar on the survival of e. coli o157:h7 in inoculated lettuce (10(4) and 10(7) cfug(-1)) is examined in this study. results were observed that the treatment of inoculated lettuce (10(7) cfug(-1)) with commercial vinegar containing 5% acetic acid (ph 3.0) for 5 min would reduce 3 logs population at 25 degrees c. less than a 1-log decrease in bacterial numbers was recovered during 5 min exposure to 0.5% (ph 3.26) acetic acid.
construction and evaluation of a microbiological positive process internal control for pcr-based examination of food samples for listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enterica.
pcr assays for food-borne pathogens are widely available but have had more limited application to food testing compared with their use in clinical laboratories. when testing food samples, false negative pcr results can occur and may be due to interference with target-cell lysis necessary for nucleic acid extraction, nucleic acid degradation and/or direct inhibition of the pcr. therefore, it is essential to include appropriate controls for the application of pcr to the detection of pathogens in food samples. the purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a novel internal control (ic), capable of monitoring the complete detection procedure, from dna extraction through to amplification and detection. a 'positive process' ic was developed for the reliable application of real-time pcr assays for the detection of salmonella enterica or listeria monocytogenes in enrichment broths. two novel real-time 5' nuclease pcr assays for the detection of a 77 bp fragment of the green fluorescent protein (gfp) gene and a 91 bp fragment of the irob gene of s. enterica were developed. these assays were specific and had detection limits of 5+/-0.88 and 15+/-1.03 cfu per pcr for the gfp and irob genes respectively. the gfp pcr assay was combined with the irob pcr assay, and also with a previously published real-time 5' nuclease pcr assay for the detection of the hlya gene of l. monocytogenes. duplexed assays were optimised such that the target genes were simultaneously amplified at similar sensitivities to single reactions. the gfp gene was cloned into the chromosome of a non-pathogenic strain of escherichia coli and the modified strain successfully encapsulated in lenticule discs. a single disc was added to 1 ml of standard enrichment broths immediately prior to dna extraction, and used as an ic for the detection of l. monocytogenes and s. enterica by pcr. this method was evaluated using 393 naturally contaminated food or environmental samples, 267 for the detection of salmonella spp. and 126 for listeria spp. pcr inhibition was detected in 29 (8%) extracts, although neither pathogens were detected in these broths by culture. s. enterica was detected by pcr in 43 of 45 (96%) broths that were positive by conventional culture. the irob gene was also detected in a further 2 broths by pcr alone. l. monocytogenes was detected in 6 broths by both pcr and conventional culture, plus an additional 7 by pcr only. control strategies such as those described here are important tools for the interpretation of pcr assays by improving the reliability of detection of pathogens in food.
antibody-quantum dot conjugates exhibit enhanced antibacterial effect vs. unconjugated quantum dots.
the effect of a 20-min exposure to antibody-quantum dot (ab-qd) conjugates on colony counts of escherichia coli was assessed by the spread-plate method and compared with exposure to unconjugated qds having only amine or carboxyl groups on their surfaces. under these conditions, ab-qd conjugates generally exhibited >90% reduction in colony-forming units as compared to untreated e. coli and e. coli treated with unconjugated qds after incubation for as long as 41 h. the antibacterial effect of ab-qd conjugates vs. unconjugated qds on salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium was also assessed by means of a disk-diffusion technique which demonstrated greater growth inhibition (approximately 3 mm greater) by ab-qd conjugate-impregnated disks than by unconjugated-qd-only-impregnated disks at a 10-microg disk load. at a 25-microg disk load, both treatment groups exhibited nearly equal growth inhibition.
fepa- and tonb-dependent bacteriophage h8: receptor binding and genomic sequence.
h8 is derived from a collection of salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis bacteriophage. its morphology and genomic structure closely resemble those of bacteriophage t5 in the family siphoviridae. h8 infected s. enterica serotypes enteritidis and typhimurium and escherichia coli by initial adsorption to the outer membrane protein fepa. ferric enterobactin inhibited h8 binding to e. coli fepa (50% inhibition concentration, 98 nm), and other ferric catecholate receptors (fiu, cir, and iron) did not participate in phage adsorption. h8 infection was tonb dependent, but exbb mutations in salmonella or e. coli did not prevent infection; only exbb tolq or exbb tolr double mutants were resistant to h8. experiments with deletion and substitution mutants showed that the receptor-phage interaction first involves residues distributed over the protein's outer surface and then narrows to the same charged (r316) or aromatic (y260) residues that participate in the binding and transport of ferric enterobactin and colicins b and d. these data rationalize the multifunctionality of fepa: toxic ligands like bacteriocins and phage penetrate the outer membrane by parasitizing residues in fepa that are adapted to the transport of the natural ligand, ferric enterobactin. dna sequence determinations revealed the complete h8 genome of 104.4 kb. a total of 120 of its 143 predicted open reading frames (orfs) were homologous to orfs in t5, at a level of 84% identity and 89% similarity. as in t5, the h8 structural genes clustered on the chromosome according to their function in the phage life cycle. the t5 genome contains a large section of dna that can be deleted and that is absent in h8: compared to t5, h8 contains a 9,000-bp deletion in the early region of its chromosome, and nine potentially unique gene products. sequence analyses of the tail proteins of phages in the same family showed that relative to pb5 (oad) of t5 and hrs of bf23, the fepa-binding protein (rbp) of h8 contains unique acidic and aromatic residues. these side chains may promote binding to basic and aromatic residues in fepa that normally function in the adsorption of ferric enterobactin. furthermore, a predicted h8 tail protein showed extensive identity and similarity to pb2 of t5, suggesting that it also functions in pore formation through the cell envelope. the variable region of this protein contains a potential tonb box, intimating that it participates in the tonb-dependent stage of the phage infection process.
rapid and widespread dissemination of multidrug-resistant blacmy-2 salmonella typhimurium in mexico.
objectives: we describe the emergence and dissemination of multidrug-resistant (mdr) salmonella typhimurium in humans, retail meat and food animals from yucatan, mexico. methods: salmonella typhimurium isolates were collected through an active surveillance system and tested for susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents. isolates that were non-susceptible to ceftriaxone were tested with 10 additional antimicrobials and assayed by pcr for the presence of cmy, ctx-m, shv, tem and oxa beta-lactamase genes. plasmid-borne phenotypes were identified by transfer to susceptible escherichia coli. isolates from humans, retail meat and food animals were compared by pfge to determine genetic relatedness. results: mdr salmonella typhimurium containing a plasmid-mediated blacmy-2 ampc beta-lactamase rose from 0% (0/27) during 2000 and 2001 to 75% (63/84) in 2004 and 2005 (p<0.0001). mdr blacmy-2 salmonella typhimurium (n=115) was most common in ill children (44.3%) and pork or swine intestine (36.5%). in several cities, mdr blacmy-2 salmonella typhimurium from retail meat or swine intestine exhibited pfge patterns and antibiograms indistinguishable from those in strains recovered from hospitalized children. the cmy gene was transferred to e. coli by electroporation, along with resistance to three to six other antimicrobials. children with mdr blacmy-2 salmonella typhimurium infection (n=39) had a higher frequency of systemic infection (13% versus 0%), mortality (8% versus 0%) and hospital re-admission due to protracted diarrhoea (28% versus 17%) than children with non-mdr-salmonella typhimurium (n=24), although the difference was not statistically significant. conclusions: the rapid and widespread dissemination of mdr blacmy-2 salmonella typhimurium in mexico calls for urgent interventions to contain this potentially fatal pathogen.
factors affecting compost tea as a potential source of escherichia coli and salmonella on fresh produce.
compost tea (ct) is an unheated on-farm infusion of compost used as a spray or soil drench to promote plant growth and control foliar and root diseases. because food safety involves all aspects from farm to fork, ct should meet basic microbiological criteria for water quality. this report describes the effects of two ct production processes, aerated and nonaerated, on growth and survival of foodborne pathogens and fecal coliforms. seven commercially available nutrients used to supplement ct were tested individually and in combination for their effects on the growth of escherichia coli and salmonella. compost containing 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g initial concentrations of e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella enteritidis were used to assess growth and survival responses to aerated ct (36-h preparations) and nonaerated ct (8.5-day preparations). pathogen and fecal coliform populations were undetectable by 8.5 days in nonaerated ct without nutrient supplements. e. coli o157:h7 decreased to below detection levels in aerated ct at 36 h without the use of supplements. in contrast, the addition of commercially formulated mixtures or combinations of nutrient supplements resulted in growth of e. coli o157: h7, salmonella, and fecal coliforms by 1 to 4 log cfu/g in both aerated and nonaerated ct. when nutrient supplements were added, aerated ct sustained higher concentrations of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella, and fecal coliforms than did nonaerated ct. thus, addition of supplements supports growth of human pathogens from very low initial concentrations in both aerated and nonaerated ct and should be avoided when ct is used on fresh produce.
specific bifidobacterium strains isolated from elderly subjects inhibit growth of staphylococcus aureus.
cell-free, ph-controlled supernatants of thirty-eight bifidobacterium strains isolated from healthy elderly subjects were subjected to antimicrobial activity assay. bioluminescent indicator strains staphylococcus aureus rn4220, escherichia coli k-12, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028 were used as targets of antimicrobial activity. the effect of nutrient depletion on the inhibition was eliminated with spent-culture controls. three out of thirty-eight bifidobacterium strains were capable of inhibiting the growth of s. aureus. the inhibition was equal to 23.2+/-19.1% to 50.4+/-26.7% of the inhibition caused by 50 iu/ml nisin. reuterin-producing positive strain lactobacillus reuteri sd2112 was capable of 86.0+/-24.6% inhibition, but bifidobacterium lactis bb-12, a known probiotic strain, showed no inhibition. none of the strains was capable of inhibiting the growth of e. coli or s. enterica. the observed inhibition by bifidobacteria was related to hydrogen peroxide formation and possible production of heat-stable proteinaceous compounds. the results suggest that production of antimicrobial substances other than organic acids is not common among bifidobacterium strains typical of elderly subjects. however, specific strains were identified which showed considerable inhibitory activity against s. aureus.
polyamine effects on antibiotic susceptibility in bacteria.
biogenic polyamines (e.g., spermidine and spermine) are a group of essential polycationic compounds found in all living cells. the effects of spermine and spermidine on antibiotic susceptibility were examined with gram-negative escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium bacteria and clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and with gram-positive staphylococcus aureus bacteria, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). exogenous spermine exerted a dose-dependent inhibition effect on the growth of e. coli, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and s. aureus but not p. aeruginosa, as depicted by mic and growth curve measurements. while the mics of polymyxin and ciprofloxacin were in general increased by exogenous spermine and spermidine in p. aeruginosa, this adverse effect was not observed in enteric bacteria and s. aureus. it was found that spermine and spermidine can decrease the mics of beta-lactam antibiotics in all strains as well as other types of antibiotics in a strain-dependent manner. significantly, the mics of oxacillin for mrsa mu50 and n315 were decreased more than 200-fold in the presence of spermine, and this effect of spermine was retained when assessed in the presence of divalent ions (magnesium or calcium; 3 mm) or sodium chloride (150 mm). the effect of spermine on the sensitization of p. aeruginosa and mrsa to antibiotics was further demonstrated by population analysis and time-killing assays. the results of checkerboard assays with e. coli and s. aureus indicated a strong synergistic effect of spermine in combination with beta-lactams and chloramphenicol. the decreased mics of beta-lactams implied that the possible blockage of outer membrane porins by exogenous spermine or spermidine did not play a crucial role in most cases. in contrast, only the mic of imipenem against p. aeruginosa was increased by exogenous spermine and spermidine, and this resistance effect was abolished in a mutant strain devoid of the outer membrane porin oprd. in e. coli, the mics of carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline were decreased in two acra mutants devoid of a major efflux pump, acrab. however, retention of the spermine effect on antibiotic susceptibility in two acra mutants of e. coli suggested that the acrab efflux pump was not the target for a synergistic effect by spermine and antibiotics and ruled out the hypothesis of spermine serving as an efflux pump inhibitor in this organism. in summary, this interesting finding of the effect of spermine on antibiotic susceptibility provides the basis for a new potential approach against drug-resistant pathogens by use of existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
microcin j25 has dual and independent mechanisms of action in escherichia coli: rna polymerase inhibition and increased superoxide production.
microcin j25 (mccj25) uptake by escherichia coli requires the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbd, exbb, and sbma. mccj25 appears to have two intracellular targets: (i) rna polymerase (rnap), which has been described in e. coli and salmonella enterica serovars, and (ii) the respiratory chain, reported only in s. enterica serovars. in the current study, it is shown that the observed difference between the actions of microcin on the respiratory chain in e. coli and s. enterica is due to the relatively low microcin uptake via the chromosomally encoded fhua. higher expression by a plasmid-encoded fhua allowed greater uptake of mccj25 by e. coli strains and the consequent inhibition of oxygen consumption. the two mechanisms, inhibition of rnap and oxygen consumption, are independent of each other. further analysis revealed for the first time that mccj25 stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (o(2)(*-)) in bacterial cells, which could be the main reason for the damage produced on the membrane respiratory chain.
antibacterial activities of emblica officinalis and coriandrum sativum against gram negative urinary pathogens.
present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of aqueous infusions  and aqueous decoctions of emblica officinalis (amla) and coriandrum sativum (coriander) against 345 bacterial isolates belonging to 6 different genera of gram negative bacterial population isolated from urine specimens by employing well diffusion technique. aqueous infusion and decoction of emblica officinalis exhibited potent antibacterial activity against escherichia coli (270), klebsiella pneumoniae (51), k. ozaenae (3), proteus mirabilis (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10), salmonella typhi (1), s. paratyphi a (2), s. paratyphi b (1) and serratia marcescens (2) but did not show any antibacterial activity against gram negative urinary pathogens.
specificity of catecholamine-induced growth in escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica.
the present study demonstrates that catecholamine responsiveness in yersinia enterocolitica, a bacterial pathogen whose infectious spectrum is principally limited to the gut, is limited to norepinephrine and dopamine, and not epinephrine; this behavior contrasts with observations for two pathogens with a wider extra-gastrointestinal spectrum, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica, which respond to all three catecholamines. epinephrine showed lower potency than norepinephrine and dopamine in inducing growth of e. coli and s. enterica, and was a potent antagonist of norepinephrine and dopamine growth responsiveness in y. enterocolitica. given that only norepinephrine and dopamine and not epinephrine-containing neurons are found with the enteric nervous system, the results suggest that certain of the more exclusive enteric pathogens may have developed response systems preferentially for those neuroendocrine hormones that are produced by the enteric nervous system as host-derived signals by which to sense the environment and initiate pathogenic processes.
characterization and role of peptidase n from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
atp-independent peptidases are important during the distal steps of cytosolic protein degradation. the contribution of a member of this group, peptidase n (pepn) was studied in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (salmonella typhimurium). the deltapepn strain displays greatly reduced cleavage of 9 out of a total of 13 exopeptidase substrates, demonstrating a significant contribution of pepn to cytosolic aminopeptidase activity. the cleavage profile of purified s. typhimurium pepn is arg>ala>thr, demonstrating broad specificity. comparative biochemical studies with purified pepn from escherichia coli and s. typhimurium revealed the latter to be distinct: s. typhimurium pepn cleaves thr-amc more efficiently and is less sensitive to inhibition by n-ethylmaleimide. studies with deltapepn and pepn overexpression demonstrated its importance for growth during nutritional downshift in combination with high temperature stress. in summary, s. typhimurium pepn contributes significantly to cytosolic aminopeptidase activity and its role is manifested under selected stress conditions.
in vitro antibacterial activity of lactobacillus helveticus strain ks300 against  diarrhoeagenic, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated bacteria.
aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate in vitro the antibacterial activity of the lactobacillus helveticus strain ks300 against vaginosis-associated bacteria including gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia, uropathogenic escherichia coli, and diarrhoeagenic salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. methods and results: the ks300 strain inhibited the growth of g. vaginalis, p. bivia, s. typhimurium, and pathogenic e. coli. after direct co-culture, data show that the lactobacillus strain decreased the viability of g. vaginalis, p. bivia, s. typhimurium, and pathogenic e. coli. the adhering ks300 strain inhibited the adhesion of g. vaginalis dsm 4944 and uropathogenic dr-positive e. coli ih11128 onto hela cells. moreover, the ks300 strain inhibited the internalization of uropathogenic dr-positive e. coli ih11128 within hela cells and s. typhimurium sl1344 within caco-2/tc7 cells. conclusions: the findings demonstrate that l. helveticus strain ks300 is adhesive onto cultured human cells and has antagonistic activities against vaginosis-associated, uropathogenic and diarrhoeagenic pathogens. significance and impact of the study: adhering l. helveticus strain ks300 is a potential probiotic strain displaying a strain-specific array of in vitro antibacterial activities.
bafoudiosbulbins a, and b, two anti-salmonellal clerodane diterpenoids from dioscorea bulbifera l. var sativa.
two clerodane diterpenoids, bafoudiosbulbins a 1, and b 2, together with five known compounds: tetracosanoic acid, 1-(tetracosanoyl)-glycerol, trans-tetracosanylferulate, beta-sitosterol and 3-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-beta-sitosterol were isolated from the tubers of dioscorea bulbifera l. var sativa. their structures were established by spectroscopic methods (1d and 2d-nmr, ms) and x-ray crystallographic diffraction analysis of compound 1. the ch2cl2-soluble portion of the crude extract and the two clerodanes were screened for anti-bacterial activity using both agar diffusion and broth dilution techniques against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, salmonella paratyphi a and salmonella paratyphi b. they both showed significant activities against p. aeruginosa, s. typhi, s. paratyphi a and s. paratyphi b.
gene-specific effects of antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer-peptide conjugates on escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in pure culture and in tissue culture.
the objective was to improve efficacy of antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino  oligomers (pmos) by improving their uptake into bacterial cells. four different bacterium-permeating peptides, rffrffrffxb, rtrtrflrrtxb, rxxrxxrxxb, and kffkffkffkxb (x is 6-aminohexanoic acid and b is beta-alanine), were separately coupled to two different pmos that are complementary to regions near the start codons of a luciferase reporter gene (luc) and a gene required for viability (acpp). luc peptide-pmos targeted to luc inhibited luciferase activity 23 to 80% in growing cultures of escherichia coli. in cell-free translation reactions, luc rtrtrflrrtxb-pmo inhibited luciferase synthesis significantly more than the other luc peptide-pmos or the luc pmo not coupled to peptide. acpp peptide-pmos targeted to acpp inhibited growth of e. coli or salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium to various extents, depending on the strain. the concentrations of acpp rffrffrffxb-pmo, acpp rtrtrflrrtxb-pmo, acpp kffkffkffkxb-pmo, and ampicillin that reduced cfu/ml by 50% after 8 h of growth (50% inhibitory concentration [ic(50)]) were 3.6, 10.8, 9.5, and 7.5 microm, respectively, in e. coli w3110. sequence-specific effects of acpp peptide-pmos were shown by rescuing growth of a merodiploid strain that expressed acpp with silent mutations in the region targeted by acpp peptide-pmo. in caco-2 cultures infected with enteropathogenic e. coli (epec), 10 microm acpp rtrtrflrrtxb-pmo or acpp rffrffrffxb-pmo essentially cleared the infection. the ic(50) of either acpp rtrtrflrrtxb-pmo or acpp rffrffrffxb-pmo in epec-infected caco-2 culture was 3 microm. in summary, rffrffrffxb, rtrtrflrrtxb, or kffkffkffxb, when covalently bonded to pmo, significantly increased inhibition of expression of targeted genes compared to pmos without attached peptide.
characterization of the sigmae-dependent rpoep3 promoter of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
using a two-plasmid system, we recently identified sigma(e)-dependent promoters directing expression of the sigma(e) regulon genes in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium). comparison of the promoters revealed a consensus sequence almost identical to the sigma(e)-dependent rpoep3 promoter directing expression of rpoe. this two-plasmid system was previously optimized to identify nucleotides critical for the rpoep3 promoter activity. however, two highly conserved nucleotides in the sigma(e) consensus sequence were not identified by this screening. in the present study, we have improved the two-plasmid screening system using a new optimized error-prone pcr mutagenesis. together with site-directed mutagenesis, we further identified nucleotides critical for activity of the rpoep3 promoter and quantified the effect of the particular mutation upon promoter activity. all the identified critical nucleotides of the rpoep3 promoter (in capital) were located in the -35 (ggaactt) and -10 (gtctaa) regions and corresponded to the most conserved nucleotides in the sigma(e) consensus sequence. the expression of the wild-type and mutated rpoep3 promoters was confirmed in s. typhimurium and was found to exhibit a different pattern of sigma(e) activation compared with escherichia coli, with a peak rpoep3 promoter activity in early stationary phase followed by a decrease in late stationary phase.
comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.
inhibition of salmonella enterica and escherichia coli o157:h7 on roasted turkey  by edible whey protein coatings incorporating the lactoperoxidase system.
the effects of whey protein isolate (wpi) coatings incorporating a lactoperoxidase system (lpos) on the inhibition of salmonella enterica and escherichia coli o157:h7 on roasted turkey were studied by testing the initial inhibition as well as the inhibition during storage. the initial antimicrobial effects of wpi coatings incorporating lpos (lpos-wpi coatings) were examined with various inoculation levels and lpos concentrations. lpos-wpi coatings with 7 and 4% of lpos demonstrated initial 3- and 2-log cfu/g reductions of s. enterica and e. coli o157:h7, respectively. the antimicrobial effect was observed regardless of whether the turkey was inoculated before or after coating. storage studies were conducted for 42 days at 4 and 10 degrees c with s. enterica (6.0 log cfu/g)- or e. coli o157:h7 (5.6 log cfu/g)-inoculated sliced turkey. lpos concentrations for the storage studies of s. enterica and e. coli o157:h7 were 5 and 3% (wt/wt), respectively, in the coating solution and in an lpos solution for spreading. lpos-wpi coatings inhibited the growth of both s. enterica and e. coli o157:h7 in turkey at both 4 and 10 degrees c for 42 days. the inhibition was more pronounced when the coating was formed on the surface of the turkey prior to inoculation than when the coating was formed on the inoculated surface. more effective inhibition of s. enterica and e. coli o157:h7 was observed with the lpos-wpi coatings than with the lpos solution-spreading treatment. lpos-wpi coatings also retarded the growth of total aerobes during storage.
characterisation of antimicrobial resistance patterns and class 1 integrons among escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar choleraesuis strains isolated from humans and swine in taiwan.
escherichia coli isolates from humans (n=110) and swine (n=61) and salmonella enterica serovar choleraesuis isolates (n=95) from swine in southern taiwan were characterised for antimicrobial resistance patterns and class 1 integrons. all e. coli isolates and s. choleraesuis isolates were multidrug resistant and demonstrated high resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracycline, sulfonamides, spectinomycin, chloramphenicol and nalidixic acid. by polymerase chain reaction and dna sequencing, 104 (61%) e. coli isolates and 31 (33%) s. choleraesuis isolates were found to carry class 1 integrons. the gene cassette array dfra12-orff-aada2 was the most prevalent (24%) among the human and swine e. coli isolates, whilst the gene cassette array dfra12-orff-aada2-sul1 was the most prevalent (24%) among s. choleraesuis strains. for e. coil isolates, all class 1 integrons were located on conjugated plasmids. meanwhile, human and swine e. coli isolates carrying identical gene cassettes were genetically unrelated. our results revealed that multidrug resistance and class 1 integrons were widely present in e. coli and s. choleraesuis isolates obtained in taiwan and that class 1 integrons might play an important role in contributing to the horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance.
analyses of the red-dry-rough phenotype of an escherichia coli o157:h7 strain and its role in biofilm formation and resistance to antibacterial agents.
in a previous study, we identified congo red-binding and -nonbinding phase variants of escherichia coli serotype o157:h7 strain atcc 43895. the congo red-binding variant, strain 43895or, produced a dry, aggregative colony that was similar to the red, dry, and rough (rdar) phenotype characteristic of certain strains of salmonella. in contrast, variant 43895ow produced a smooth and white colony morphology. in this study, we show that, similar to rdar strains of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, strain 43895or forms large aggregates in broth cultures, firm pellicles at the air-medium interface on glass, and dense biofilms on glass and polystyrene. however, unlike s. enterica serovar typhimurium, strain 43895or does not stain positive for cellulose production. when strain 43895or was fixed on agar, scanning electron microscopy showed cells expressing extracellular matrix (ecm) containing curli fibers. strain 43895ow was devoid of any ecm or curli fibers on agar but showed expression of curli fibers during attachment to glass. strain 43895or produced >4-fold-larger amounts of biofilm than strain 43895ow on polystyrene, glass, stainless steel, and teflon; formation was >3-fold higher in rich medium than in nutrient-limited medium. biofilm-associated cells of both strains showed statistically greater resistance (p < 0.05) to hydrogen peroxide and quaternary ammonium sanitizer than their respective planktonic cells. this study shows that the rdar phenotype of e. coli o157:h7 strain 43895or is important in multicellular growth, biofilm formation, and resistance to sanitizers. however, the lack of cellulose production by strain 43895or indicates important differences in the ecm composition compared to that of salmonella.
inactivation of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium dt104, and listeria monocytogenes on inoculated alfalfa seeds with a fatty acid-based sanitizer.
alfalfa seeds were inoculated with a three-strain cocktail of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium dt104, or listeria monocytogenes by immersion to contain approximately 6 to 8 log cfu/g and then treated with a fatty acid-based sanitizer containing 250 ppm of peroxyacid, 1,000 ppm of caprylic and capric acids (emery 658), 1,000 ppm of lactic acid, and 500 ppm of glycerol monolaurate at a reference concentration of 1x. inoculated seeds were immersed at sanitizer concentrations of 5x, 10x, and 15x for 1, 3, 5, and 10 min and then assessed for pathogen survivors by direct plating. the lowest concentration that decreased all three pathogens by >5 log was 15. after a 3-min exposure to the 15x concentration, populations of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium dt104, and l. monocytogenes decreased by >5.45, >5.62, and >6.92 log, respectively, with no sublethal injury and no significant loss in seed germination rate or final sprout yield. the components of this 15x concentration (treatment a) were assessed independently and in various combinations to optimize antimicrobial activity. with inoculated seeds, treatment c (15,000 ppm of emery 658, 15,000 ppm of lactic acid, and 7,500 ppm of glycerol monolaurate) decreased salmonella typhimurium, e. coli o157:h7, and l. monocytogenes by 6.23 and 5.57 log, 4.77 and 6.29 log, and 3.86 and 4.21 log after 3 and 5 min of exposure, respectively. treatment d (15,000 ppm of emery 658 and 15,000 ppm of lactic acid) reduced salmonella typhimurium by >6.90 log regardless of exposure time and e. coli )157:h7 and l. monocytogenes by 4.60 and >5.18 log and 3.55 and 3.14 log after 3 and 5 min, respectively. no significant differences (p > 0.05) were found between treatments a, c, and d. overall, treatment d, which contained emery 658 and lactic acid as active ingredients, reduced e. coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and l. monocytogenes populations by 3.55 to >6.90 log and may provide a viable alternative to the recommended 20,000 ppm of chlorine for sanitizing alfalfa seeds.
evaluation of bacterial and protozoal contamination of commercially available raw meat diets for dogs.
objective: to evaluate bacterial and protozoal contamination of commercially available raw meat diets for dogs. design: prospective longitudinal study. sample population: 240 samples from 20 raw meat diets for dogs (containing beef, lamb, chicken, or turkey), 24 samples from 2 dry dog foods, and 24 samples from 2 canned dog foods. procedure: each product was purchased commercially on 4 dates approximately 2 months apart. three samples from each product at each sampling period were evaluated via bacterial culture for non-type-specific escherichia coli (ntsec), salmonella enterica, and campylobacter spp. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on selected isolates. polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect dna from cryptosporidium spp, neospora spp, and toxoplasma spp in samples obtained in the third and fourth sampling periods. results: one hundred fifty-three of 288 (53%) samples were contaminated with ntsec. both raw and prepared foods contained ntsec during at least 1 culture period. salmonella enterica was recovered from 17 (5.9%) samples, all of which were raw meat products. campylobacter spp was not isolated from any samples. in 91 of 288 (31.6%) samples, there was no gram-negative bacterial growth before enrichment and in 48 of 288 (16.7%) samples, there was no aerobic bacterial growth before enrichment. susceptibility phenotypes were variable. cryptosporidium spp dna was detected in 3 samples. conclusions and clinical relevance: bacterial contamination is common in commercially available raw meat diets, suggesting that there is a risk of foodborne illness in dogs fed these diets as well possible risk for humans associated with the dogs or their environments.
cmy-16, a novel acquired ampc-type beta-lactamase of the cmy/lat lineage in multifocal monophyletic isolates of proteus mirabilis from northern italy.
we report multifocal detection (four different cities in northern italy) of proteus mirabilis isolates resistant to both oxyimino- and 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins and producing a novel acquired ampc-like beta-lactamase. the enzyme, named cmy-16, is a variant of the cmy/lat lineage, which differs from the closest homologues, cmy-4 and cmy-12, by a single amino acid substitution (a171s or n363s, respectively) and from cmy-2 by two substitutions (a171s and w221r). expression of the cloned bla(cmy-16) gene in escherichia coli decreased susceptibility to penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam. tazobactam was more effective than clavulanate at antagonizing the enzyme activity. genotyping, by random amplification of polymorphic dna and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic dna digested with sfii, showed that isolates were clonally related to each other, although not identical. the bla(cmy-16) gene was not transferable to e. coli by conjugation or transformation. in all isolates, it was chromosomally located and inserted in a conserved genetic environment. pcr mapping experiments revealed that the bla(cmy-16) was flanked by isecp1 and the blc gene, similar to other genes of this lineage from plasmids of salmonella enterica, klebsiella spp., and e. coli. overall, these results revealed multifocal spreading of a cmy-16-producing p. mirabilis clone in northern italy. this finding represents the first report of an acquired ampc-like beta-lactamase in proteus mirabilis from italy and underscores the emergence of similar resistance determinants in the european setting.
antimicrobial activity of essential oils and structurally related synthetic food  additives towards selected pathogenic and beneficial gut bacteria.
aims: to assess the potential of essential oils and structurally related synthetic food additives in reducing bacterial pathogens in swine intestinal tract. methods and results: the antimicrobial activity of essential oils/compounds was measured by determining the inhibition of bacterial growth. among 66 essential oils/compounds that exhibited > or =80% inhibition towards salmonellatyphimurium dt104 and escherichia coli o157:h7, nine were further studied. most of the oils/compounds demonstrated high efficacy against s. typhimurium dt104, e. coli o157:h7, and e. coli with k88 pili with little inhibition towards lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. they were also tolerant to the low ph. when mixed with pig cecal digesta, these oils/compounds retained their efficacy against e. coli o157:h7. in addition, they significantly inhibited e. coli and coliform bacteria in the digesta, but had little effect on the total number of lactobacilli and anaerobic bacteria. conclusions: some essential oils/compounds demonstrated good potential, including efficacy, tolerance to low ph, and selectivity towards bacterial pathogens, in reducing human and animal bacterial pathogens in swine intestinal tract. significance and impact of the study: this study has identified candidates of essential oils/compounds for in vivo studies to develop antibiotic substitutes for the reduction of human and animal bacterial pathogens in swine intestinal tract.
butyrate specifically down-regulates salmonella pathogenicity island 1 gene expression.
invasion of intestinal epithelial cells by salmonella enterica is decreased after exposure to butyric acid. to understand the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon, a comparative transcriptomic analysis of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium grown in medium supplemented with butyrate was performed. we found that butyrate down-regulated the expression of 19 genes common to both serovars by a factor of twofold or more, and 17 of these genes localized to the salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (spi1). these included the spi1 regulatory genes hild and invf. of the remaining two genes, amph has 91% homology to an escherichia coli penicillin-binding protein and sope2 encodes a type iii-secreted effector protein associated with invasion but located at a separate site on the chromosome from spi1.
characterization of escherichia coli and salmonella enterica from cattle feed ingredients.
the objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the frequency with which feed ingredients or mixed feeds in cattle feedlots were contaminated with escherichia coli and salmonella spp. and (2) to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of non-type-specific escherichia coli and salmonella spp. recovered from feed ingredients or mixed feeds. approximately 30 individual samples were collected from each of several feed commodities present on two cattle feedlots each month for 1 year. half of the samples were cultured for escherichia coli, and the other half were cultured for salmonella spp. e. coli was recovered from 48.2% (516/1070) of the samples and from all feed ingredient types at least once. salmonella spp. were recovered from 5.3% (57/1070) of samples. overall, 40.3% (207/514) of e. coli isolates and 54.4% (31/57) of salmonella spp. isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested in the panel. bacterial contamination of feed ingredients used at cattle feedlots with enteric bacteria is relatively common. in some cases, the enteric organisms are resistant to one or more antimicrobials. feed ingredients may be a source of genetic elements associated with antimicrobial resistance for feedlot cattle. to be successful in minimizing foodborne pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in the cattle feedlot setting, it is important to consider the myriad of potential sources of these organisms or genetic elements.
cora affects tolerance of escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium to the lactoperoxidase enzyme system but not to other forms of oxidative stress.
the enzyme lactoperoxidase is part of the innate immune system in vertebrates and owes its antimicrobial activity to the formation of oxidative reaction products from various substrates. in a previous study, we have reported that, with thiocyanate as a substrate, the lactoperoxidase system elicits a distinct stress response in escherichia coli mg1655. this response is different from but partly overlapping with the stress responses to hydrogen peroxide and to superoxide. in the current work, we constructed knockouts in 10 lactoperoxidase system-inducible genes to investigate their role in the tolerance of e. coli mg1655 to this antimicrobial system. five mutations resulted in a slightly increased sensitivity, but one mutation (cora) caused hypersensitivity to the lactoperoxidase system. this hypersensitive phenotype was specific to the lactoperoxidase system, since neither the sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide nor to the superoxide generator plumbagin was affected in the cora mutant. salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium cora had a similar phenotype. although cora encodes an mg2+ transporter and at least three other inducible open reading frames belonged to the mg2+ regulon, repression of the mg stimulon by mg2+ did not change the lactoperoxidase sensitivity of either the wild-type or cora mutant. prior exposure to 0.3 mm ni2+, which is also transported by cora, strongly sensitized mg1655 but not the cora mutant to the lactoperoxidase system. furthermore, this ni2+-dependent sensitization was suppressed by the cora-specific inhibitor co(iii) hexaammine. these results indicate that cora affects the lactoperoxidase sensitivity of e. coli by modulating the cytoplasmic concentrations of transition metals that enhance the toxicity of the lactoperoxidase system.
impact of phages on two-species bacterial communities.
a long history of experimental work has shown that addition of bacteriophages to  a monoculture of bacteria leads to only a temporary depression of bacterial levels. resistant bacteria usually become abundant, despite reduced growth rates relative to those of phage-sensitive bacteria. this restoration of high bacterial density occurs even if the phages evolve to overcome bacterial resistance. we believe that the generality of this result may be limited to monocultures, in which the resistant bacteria do not face competition from bacterial species unaffected by the phage. as a simple case, we investigated the impact of phages attacking one species in a two-species culture of bacteria. in the absence of phages, escherichia coli b and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium were stably maintained during daily serial passage in glucose minimal medium (m9). when either of two e. coli-specific phages (t7 or t5) was added to the mixed culture, e. coli became extinct or was maintained at densities that were orders of magnitude lower than those before phage introduction, even though the e. coli densities with phage reached high levels when salmonella was absent. in contrast, the addition of a phage that attacked only salmonella (sp6) led to transient decreases in the bacterial number whether e. coli was absent or present. these results suggest that phages can sometimes, although not always, provide long-term suppression of target bacteria.
resistance to the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin requires myristoylation of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium lipid a.
attachment of positively charged, amine-containing residues such as 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-ara4n) and phosphoethanolamine (petn) to escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium lipid a is required for resistance to the cationic antimicrobial peptide, polymyxin. in an attempt to discover additional lipid a modifications important for polymyxin resistance, we generated polymyxin-sensitive mutants of an e. coli pmra(c) strain, wd101. a subset of polymyxin-sensitive mutants produced a lipid a that lacked both the 3'-acyloxyacyl-linked myristate (c(14)) and l-ara4n, even though the necessary enzymatic machinery required to synthesize l-ara4n-modified lipid a was present. inactivation of lpxm in both e. coli and s. typhimurium resulted in the loss of l-ara4n addition, as well as, increased sensitivity to polymyxin. however, decoration of the lipid a phosphate groups with petn residues was not effected in lpxm mutants. in summary, we demonstrate that attachment of l-ara4n to the phosphate groups of lipid a and the subsequent resistance to polymyxin is dependent upon the presence of the secondary linked myristoyl group.
switching aconitase b between catalytic and regulatory modes involves iron-dependent dimer formation.
in addition to being the major citric acid cycle aconitase in escherichia coli the aconitase b protein (acnb) is also a post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression. the acnb proteins represent a distinct branch of the aconitase superfamily that possess a heat-like domain (domain 5). the heat domains of other proteins are implicated in protein:protein interactions. gel filtration analysis has now shown that cell-free extracts contain high-molecular-weight species of acnb. furthermore, in vitro and in vivo protein interaction experiments have shown that acnb forms homodimers. addition of the iron chelator bipyridyl to cultures inhibited the dimer-dependent readout from an acnb bacterial two-hybrid system. a similar response was observed with a catalytically inactive acnb variant, acnb(c769s), suggesting that the monomer-dimer transition is not mediated by the state of the acnb iron-sulphur cluster. the iron-responsive interacting unit was accordingly traced to the n-terminal region (domains 4 and 5) of the acnb protein, and not to domain 3 that houses the iron-sulphur cluster. thus, it was shown that a polypeptide containing acnb n-terminal domains 5 and 4 (acnb5-4) interacts with a second acnb5-4 to form a homodimer. acnb has recently been shown to initiate a regulatory cascade controlling flagella biosynthesis in salmonella enterica by binding to the ftsh transcript and inhibiting the synthesis of the ftsh protease. a plasmid encoding acnb5-4 complemented the flagella-deficient phenotype of a s. enterica acnb mutant, and the isolated acnb5-4 polypeptide specifically recognized and bound to the ftsh transcript. thus, the n-terminal region of acnb is necessary and sufficient for promoting the formation of acnb dimers and also for acnb binding to target mrna. furthermore, the relative effects of iron on these processes provide a simple iron-mediated dimerization mechanism for switching the acnb protein between catalytic and regulatory roles.
persistence of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella newport, and salmonella poona in the gut of a free-living nematode, caenorhabditis elegans, and transmission to progeny and uninfected nematodes.
a study was undertaken to determine the persistence of escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonellae in the gut of a free-living nematode, caenorhabditis elegans, as affected by temperature and relative humidity and to determine if infected worms transmit salmonella enterica serotype newport to progeny and uninfected worms. worms were fed cells of a non-pathogenic strain of e. coli (op50), e. coli o157:h7, s. enterica serotype newport, and s. enterica serotype poona, followed by incubating at 4, 20, or 37 degrees c for up to 5 days. initial populations of ingested pathogens significantly increased by up to 2.93 log(10) cfu/worm within 1 day at 20 degrees c on k agar and remained constant for an additional 4 days. when worms were placed on bacto agar, populations of ingested pathogens remained constant at 4 degrees c, decreased significantly at 20 degrees c, and increased significantly at 37 degrees c within 3 days. worms fed e. coli op50 or s. newport were incubated at 4 or 20 degrees c at relative humidities of 33%, 75%, or 98% to determine survival characteristics of ingested bacteria. fewer cells of the pathogens survived incubation at 33% relative humidity compared to higher relative humidities. populations of ingested e. coli op50 and s. newport decreased by up to 1.65 and 3.44 log(10) cfu/worm, respectively, in worms incubated at 20 degrees c and 33% relative humidity. placement together on k agar of adult worms, labeled with green fluorescent protein (gfp) in the pharynx area, that had ingested gfp-labeled s. newport and uninfected wild type worms resulted in transfer of the pathogen to gut of wild type worms. s. newport was isolated from c. elegans two generations removed from exposure to the pathogen. results of these studies show that c. elegans may serve as a temporary reservoir of foodborne pathogens, and could perhaps be a vector for contaminating preharvest fruits and vegetables, thus potentially increasing the risk of enteric infections associated with consumption of raw produce.
antibacterial activity of bee honey and its therapeutic usefulness against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium infection.
the authors studied the effect of storage period and heat on the physical and chemical properties of honey and proceeded to study the antibacterial effect of honey on escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. in samples of honey (egyptian clover honey) that were heat-treated and stored over a long period of time, water content decreased, hydroxymethyl furfural (hmf) was produced and increased in concentration, and enzyme activity decreased. colour, measured in optical density, was markedly affected in honey samples stored over long periods of time, as was the refractive index, but electrical conductivity remained unaffected by storage or heating. similarly, the storage period had no effect on ph value. to study the therapeutic effect of honey on e.coli and s. typhimurium, 25 isolates of e. coil o157:h7 (18.5%) and 49 isolates of s. typhimurium (36.2%) were isolated from 135 samples taken from children and calves (30 stool samples from children and 105 samples from calf organs and faecal swabs). most e. coli o157:h7 and s. typhimurium isolates were highly resistant to most antibiotic discs. in vitro, the antibacterial effect of honey was more pronounced on e. coil o157:h7 than on s. typhimurium. water content, ph value, hmf and the presence of h2o, all played an important role in the potency of olover honey as an antibacterial agent. in vivo, mice were used as a model for studying the parenteral usefulness of honey as an antibacterial agent against both pathogens. the antibacterial activity of honey that had been stored over a long period of time decreased and high concentrations of honey proved more effective as antibacterial agents. in this study there was lower mortality among mice treated with honey but the parenteral application of honey and its therapeutic properties require further investigation.
co-regulation of salmonella enterica genes required for virulence and resistance  to antimicrobial peptides by slya and phop/phoq.
analysis of the transcriptome of slya mutant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium revealed that many slya-dependent genes, including pagc, pagd, ugtl, mig-14, virk, phon, pgte, pipb2, sopd2, pagj and pagk, are also controlled by the phop/phoq regulatory system. many slya- and phop/phoq-co-regulated genes have functions associated with the bacterial envelope, and some have been directly implicated in virulence and resistance to antimicrobial peptides. purified his-tagged slya binds to the pagc and mig-14 promoters in regions homologous to a previously proposed 'slya-box'. the pagc promoter lacks a consensus phop binding site and does not bind phop in vitro, suggesting that the effect of phop on pagc transcription is indirect. stimulation of pagc expression by phop requires slya. levels of slya protein and mrna are not significantly changed under low-magnesium phop-inducing conditions in which pagc expression is profoundly elevated, however, indicating that the phop/phoq system does not activate pagc expression by altering slya protein concentration. models are proposed in which phop may control slya activity via a soluble ligand or slya may function as an anti-repressor to allow phop activation. the absence of almost all slya-activated genes from the escherichia coli k12 genome suggests that the functional linkage between the slya and phop/phoq regulatory systems arose as salmonella evolved its distinctive pathogenic lifestyle.
identification of the outer-membrane protein pagc required for the serum resistance phenotype in salmonella enterica serovar choleraesuis.
serum resistance is a crucial virulence factor for the development of systemic infections, including bacteraemia, by many pathogenic bacteria. salmonella enterica serovar choleraesuis is an important enteric pathogen that causes serious systemic infections in swine and humans. here, it was found that, when introduced into escherichia coli, a recombinant plasmid carrying the pagc gene from a plasmid-based genomic library of s. enterica serovar choleraesuis conferred a high-level resistance to the bactericidal activity of pooled normal swine serum. the resistance was equal to the level conferred by rck, a gene encoding a 17 kda outer-membrane protein which promotes the serum resistance phenotype in s. enterica serovar typhimurium. insertional mutagenesis of the cloned pagc gene generated a mutation that resulted in the loss of the serum resistance phenotype in e. coli. when this mutation was introduced into the chromosome of s. enterica serovar choleraesuis by homology recombination with the wild-type allele, the resulting strain could not produce pagc, and it showed a decreased level of resistance to complement-mediated killing. the mutation could be restored by introduction of the intact pagc gene on a plasmid, but not by introduction of the point-mutated pagc gene. in addition, pagc was able to promote serum resistance in the s. enterica serovar choleraesuis lps mutant strain, which is highly sensitive to serum killing. although pagc is not thought to confer serum resistance directly, these results strongly suggest that pagc is an important outer-membrane protein that plays an important role in the serum resistance of s. enterica serovar choleraesuis.
behavior of yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella typhimurium in crottin goat's  cheese.
in order to evaluate the behavior of yersinia enterocolitica and salmonella typhimurium in crottin goat's cheese, inoculated products stored at 5, 15 and 25 degrees c were analysed together with chemical and microbiological characteristics of the cheese. in general, low counts of microorganisms were detected. none of the samples showed the presence of escherichia coli, salmonella spp. or y. enterocolitica. in the inoculation tests, y. enterocolitica and s. typhimurium were inhibited during storage; nevertheless, these bacteria survived for extensive periods. the counts at the end of the experiments at 5 and 15 degrees c were high, indicating that contamination with high bacterial numbers represents a potential health hazard. the primary mathematical models used to analyse the behavior of y. enterocolitica and s. typhimurium were the vitalistic, gompertz's empirical and churchill's model. the mean square error was calculated for the three models in order to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of each one. for y. enterocolitica, the vitalistic model was the best at the three temperatures. for s. typhimurium, there was no significant difference between the three models at 5 and 15 degrees c; the churchill model was clearly the best at 25 degrees c. these results confirm that, in order to predict the risk of transmission of pathogenic microorganisms in foods using mathematical models, it is essential to analyse their behavior in specific foods.
multidrug resistance in salmonella enterica serovar typhi isolated from patients  with typhoid fever complications in lagos, nigeria.
objective: the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of salmonella enterica serovar typhi in patients with pyrexia of unknown origin (puo), and antimicrobial resistance in strains isolated from patients with s. typhi in lagos, nigeria. study design: in total, 103 patients were included in this study, subdivided into two categories. category a comprised 74 patients presenting with puo, and category b comprised 29 patients harbouring s. typhi who did not respond to initial treatment. methods: blood samples were cultured for bacterial isolates and identified by standard procedures. susceptibility testing was performed according to the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. plasmid dna extraction was performed using the alkaline lysis method with escherichia coli v517 used as the standard. conjugation and transformation experiments were performed using standard methods. for the latter, e. coli k12 hb 101 (ara-14, galk2, hsd 520, lacyl, leu, mtl-1, pro a2, rec a13, rps l20, sup e44, thii xyl-5) was used as the recipient and plasmid pbr 322 was used as the positive control. results: the prevalence of s. typhi in puo was 16.2% (12/74). in all, 25 of 41 (61.0%) cases were multidrug resistant (mdr) with phenotypic-resistant patterns: acoct, actces, actcoce and acts were commonly encountered among the strains. interestingly, four of the strains harbouring similar plasmid dna were isolated from patients with hepatosplenomegaly, and a strain harbouring a large transferable plasmid of 81.2mda was isolated from a psychosis patient. conclusions: our study confirmed the circulation of mdr s. typhi in lagos, nigeria. periodic review of antibiotics used in hospitals is essential as the efficacies of chloramphenicol, ampicillin and cotrimoxazole are now doubtful. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are effective drugs for treatment of typhoid fever, but with current trends of drug abuse in nigeria, resistance is likely to develop. these results, therefore, provide an early warning signal for the prudent use of fluoroquinolone antimicrobials to preserve their usefulness.
multidrug-resistant salmonella enterica serovar muenchen from pigs and humans and potential interserovar transfer of antimicrobial resistance.
salmonella serovars are important reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance. recently, we reported on multidrug-resistant (mdr) salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strains among pigs with resistance to ampicillin, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline (resistance [r] type akssut) and resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline (r type axacssut). in the present study, 67 isolates (39 from humans and 28 from pigs) of clinically important salmonella serovar muenchen were characterized. among the porcine isolates, 75% showed resistance to seven antimicrobials: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and kanamycin (r type acssutaxk). one isolate from humans showed resistance to 10 of the 12 antimicrobials: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, kanamycin, gentamicin, cephalothin, and ceftriaxone (r type acssutaxkgcfcro). pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed no clonality between the porcine and the human strains. the porcine and the human mdr strains carried class 1 integrons of 2.0 and 1.0 kb, respectively. genes specific to the porcine strain included aada2, apha1-iab, and teta(b). dna sequencing revealed that the porcine isolates carried bla(oxa-30) on a class 1 integron. genes specific to the human strain included bla(tem), stra, strb, cmla, teta(a), and aada2. no bla(cmy-2) gene was detected. serovar muenchen strains of porcine and human origin were able to transfer resistance genes to laboratory strain escherichia coli mg1655 by conjugation. plasmid restriction with four restriction enzymes, ecori, bamhi, hindiii, and psti, showed that the conjugative plasmids from porcine salmonella serovar muenchen and typhimurium r-type mdr strains isolated from the same farms at the same time were similar on the basis of the sizes and the numbers of bands and southern hybridization. the plasmid profiles among the salmonella serovar muenchen isolates from the two host species were different. this is the first report to show a high frequency of mdr salmonella serovar muenchen strains from pigs and a human strain that is similar to the mdr isolates with the ampc enzyme previously reported among salmonella serovars newport and typhimurium strains. the mdr strains from the two host species independently represent public health concerns, as salmonella serovar muenchen is among the top 10 causes of salmonellosis in humans.
bile-induced dna damage in salmonella enterica.
in the absence of dna adenine methylase, growth of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium is inhibited by bile. mutations in any of the muth, mutl, and muts genes suppress bile sensitivity in a dam(-) background, indicating that an active muthls system renders dam(-) mutants bile sensitive. however, inactivation of the muthls system does not cause bile sensitivity. an analogy with escherichia coli, in which the muthls system sensitizes dam(-) mutants to dna-injuring agents, suggested that bile might cause dna damage. in support of this hypothesis, we show that bile induces the sos response in s. enterica and increases the frequency of point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. mutations in muth, mutl, or muts cause partial relief of virulence attenuation in a dam(-) background (50- to 100-fold by the oral route and 10-fold intraperitoneally), suggesting that an active muthls system reduces the ability of salmonella dam(-) mutants to cope with dna-damaging agents (bile and others) encountered during the infection process. the dna-damaging ability of bile under laboratory conditions raises the possibility that the phenomenon may be relevant in vivo, since high bile concentrations are found in the gallbladder, the niche for chronic salmonella infections.
regulation of uptake and processing of the quorum-sensing autoinducer ai-2 in escherichia coli.
ai-2 is a quorum-sensing signaling molecule proposed to be involved in interspecies communication. in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, extracellular ai-2 accumulates in exponential phase, but the amount decreases drastically upon entry into stationary phase. in s. enterica serovar typhimurium, the reduction in activity is due to import and processing of ai-2 by the lsr transporter. we show that the lsr transporter is functional in e. coli, and screening for mutants defective in ai-2 internalization revealed lsrk and glpd. unlike the wild type, lsrk and glpd mutants do not activate transcription of the lsr operon in response to ai-2. lsrk encodes the ai-2 kinase, and the lsrk mutant fails to activate lsr expression because it cannot produce phospho-ai-2, which is the lsr operon inducer. glpd encodes the glycerol-3-phosphate (g3p) dehydrogenase, which is involved in glycerol and g3p metabolism. g3p accumulates in the glpd mutant and represses lsr transcription by preventing cyclic amp (camp)-catabolite activator protein (cap)-dependent activation. dihydroxyacetone phosphate (dhap) also accumulates in the glpd mutant, and dhap represses lsr transcription by a camp-cap-independent mechanism involving lsrr, the lsr operon repressor. the requirement for camp-cap in lsr activation explains why ai-2 persists in culture fluids of bacteria grown in media containing sugars that cause catabolite repression. these findings show that, depending on the prevailing growth conditions, the amount of time that the ai-2 signal is present and, in turn, the time that a given community of bacteria remains exposed to this signal can vary greatly.
application of antimicrobial ice for reduction of foodborne pathogens (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes) on the surface of fish.
aims: the efficacy of antimicrobial ice was evaluated for the reduction of foodborne pathogens on the surface of fish. methods and results: antimicrobial ice containing chlorine dioxide (clo2) was utilized to control foodborne pathogens in laboratory media and on fish skin. escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella serotype typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes strains were treated with antimicrobial ice for 30 min on plates of selective agar and for 120 min on fish skin at room temperature, and then incubated for enumeration. after treatment with 100 ppm clo2 for 30 min, 5.4, 4.4 and 3.2 log10 reduction was obtained with e. coli o157:h7, salm. typhimurium and l. monocytogenes on laboratory media, respectively. when antimicrobial ice (100 ppm clo2) was applied to fish skin for 120 min, total reduction of e. coli o157:h7, salm. typhimurium and l. monocytogenes was 4.8, 2.6 and 3.3 log10, respectively. conclusion: the initial load of foodborne pathogens was reduced by antimicrobial ice and the lowered microbial level was maintained during treatment. significance and impact of the study: the application of antimicrobial ice is a simple and effective method for the safe preservation of fish.
antibacterial activities of plant essential oils and their components against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica in apple juice.
we evaluated 17 plant essential oils and nine oil compounds for antibacterial activity against the foodborne pathogens escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella enterica in apple juices in a bactericidal assay in terms of % of the sample that resulted in a 50% decrease in the number of bacteria (ba(50)). the 10 compounds most active against e. coli (60 min ba(50) range in clear juice, 0.018-0.093%) were carvacrol, oregano oil, geraniol, eugenol, cinnamon leaf oil, citral, clove bud oil, lemongrass oil, cinnamon bark oil, and lemon oil. the corresponding compounds against s. enterica (ba(50) range, 0.0044-0.011%) were melissa oil, carvacrol, oregano oil, terpeineol, geraniol, lemon oil, citral, lemongrass oil, cinnamon leaf oil, and linalool. the activity (i) was greater for s. enterica than for e. coli, (ii) increased with incubation temperature and storage time, and (iii) was not affected by the acidity of the juices. the antibacterial agents could be divided into two classes: fast-acting and slow-acting. high-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that the bactericidal results are related to the composition of the oils. these studies provide information about new ways to protect apple juice and other foods against human pathogens.
the omptin family of enterobacterial surface proteases/adhesins: from housekeeping in escherichia coli to systemic spread of yersinia pestis.
the omptins are a family of enterobacterial surface proteases/adhesins that share high sequence identity and a conserved beta-barrel fold in the outer membrane. the omptins are multifunctional, and the individual omptins exhibit differing virulence-associated functions. the pla plasminogen activator of yersinia pestis contributes by several mechanisms to bacterial invasiveness and the systemic, uncontrolled proteolysis in plague. pla proteolytically activates the human proenzyme plasminogen and inactivates the antiprotease alpha2-antiplasmin, and its binding to laminin localizes the uncontrolled plasmin activity onto basement membranes. these properties enhance bacterial migration through tissue barriers. pla also degrades circulating complement proteins and functions in bacterial invasion into human epithelial cells. pgte of salmonella enterica and ompt of escherichia coli have been shown to degrade cationic antimicrobial peptides from epithelial cells or macrophages. pgte and sopa of shigella flexneri appear important in the intracellular phases of salmonellosis and shigellosis, whereas functions of ompt have mainly been associated with protein degradation in e. coli cells. the differing virulence roles and functions have been attributed to minor sequence variations at the surface-exposed regions important for substrate recognition, to the dependence of omptin functions on lipopolysaccharide, and to the different regulation of omptin expression.
survival of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes in kimchi.
the survival of gram-positive and gram-negative foodborne pathogens in both commercial and laboratory-prepared kimchi (a traditional fermented food widely consumed in japan) was investigated. it was found that escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes could survive in both commercial and laboratory-prepared kimchi inoculated with these pathogens and incubated at 10 degrees c for 7 days. however, when incubation was prolonged, the s. aureus level decreased rapidly from the initial inoculum level to the minimum detectable level within 12 days, whereas salmonella enteritidis and l. monocytogenes took 16 days to reach similar levels in commercial kimchi. on the other hand, e. coli o157:h7 remained at high levels throughout the incubation period. for laboratory-prepared kimchi, the s. aureus level decreased rapidly from the initial inoculum level to the minimum detectable level within 12 days, and l. monocytogenes took 20 days to reach a similar level. e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella enteritidis remained at high levels throughout the incubation period. the results of this study suggest that the contamination of kimchi with e. coli o157:h7, salmonella enteritidis, s. aureus, or l. monocytogenes at any stage of production or marketing could pose a potential risk.
fibronectin binding to the salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium shda autotransporter protein is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody recognizing the a3 repeat.
shda is a large outer membrane protein of the autotransporter family whose passenger domain binds the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and collagen i, possibly by mimicking the host ligand heparin. the shda passenger domain consists of approximately 1,500 amino acid residues that can be divided into two regions based on features of the primary amino acid sequence: an n-terminal nonrepeat region followed by a repeat region composed of two types of imperfect direct amino acid repeats, called type a and type b. the repeat region bound bovine fibronectin with an affinity similar to that for the complete shda passenger domain, while the nonrepeat region exhibited comparatively low fibronectin-binding activity. a number of fusion proteins containing truncated fragments of the repeat region did not bind bovine fibronectin. however, binding of the passenger domain to fibronectin was inhibited in the presence of immune serum raised to one truncated fragment of the repeat region that contained repeats a2, b8, a3, and b9. furthermore, a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognized an epitope in a recombinant protein containing the a3 repeat inhibited binding of shda to fibronectin.
activation of bis-electrophiles to mutagenic conjugates by human o6-alkylguanine-dna alkyltransferase.
o(6)-alkylguanine dna-alkyl transferase (agt) has been shown to conjugate both 1,2-dibromoethane and dibromomethane, yielding agt inactivation, dna-agt cross-linking, and enhanced mutagenicity. a variety of related chemicals were examined to determine if similar phenomena occur. among the compounds examined in these systems (histidine operon reversion in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium tester strains), a strong halide order was generally observed, with increasing activities in the order i > br >> cl. at least one br atom appeared to be required for human agt-dependent mutations, and compounds with only cl did not inhibit agt and were not activated to genotoxins. of a series of haloforms tested (chx(3), x = br or cl), all were without effect. among a series of alpha,omega-disubstituted dihaloalkanes (br or i), the inactivation of agt increased with methylene chain length (at least up to n = 5) but the most mutagenic activity (agt-dependent) was seen with n = 1-3. the effects with n = 1 or 2 were expected from previous results; the mutagenic effect with n = 3 and the reduction with n > 3 may represent a balance between agt reaction, stability, and reactivity, in the absence of anchimeric assistance. a strong agt-dependent mutation was observed for 1,3-butadiene diepoxide. we conclude that numerous bis-electrophiles show agt-dependent activation to mutagenic conjugates. haloforms and dichloroalkanes are therefore not an issue, but bromohaloalkanes and 1,3-butadiene diepoxide are potential problems. these observations are of relevance in considering toxicity and risks of some chemicals used in industrial applications.
incidence of the recently described sulfonamide resistance gene sul3 among german salmonella enterica strains isolated from livestock and food.
the sul3 gene recently described in escherichia coli was found in 22 of 512 (4.3%) german salmonella isolates from different regions and sources and of different serotypes, antimicrobial resistance phenotypes, and genomic groups. this is the first report on the prevalence of sul3 among salmonella strains, and the findings support the strong potential of this determinant to spread within bacterial populations.
inhibition of salmonella enterica serovars by microcin j25.
escherichia coli microcin j25 (mccj25) is a 2107-da peptide antibiotic whose uptake into e. coli is mediated by the outer-membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma. a survey of the sensitivity of several salmonella enterica serovars showed that the antibiotic was highly active against some serovars, while s. typhimurium, s. derby, and some s. enteritidis strains were completely resistant. resistant strains became hypersensitive to mccj25 when given the fhua gene of e. coli, indicating that insensitivity is due to the inability of the fhua protein to mediate penetration of mccj25. whereas in e. coli mccj25 targets rna polymerase, in s. typhimurium it inhibits not only rna synthesis but also cell respiration. fluorescence viability staining showed that s. typhimurium cells exposed to mccj25 remain viable but are unable to form colonies.
lipid raft microdomains mediate class a scavenger receptor-dependent infection of brucella abortus.
brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular bacterium that can survive inside macrophages. intracellular replication of b. abortus requires the virb complex, which is highly similar to the conjugative dna transfer system. in this study, we showed that a class a scavenger receptor (sr-a) of macrophages is required to internalize b. abortus and contributes to the establishment of bacterial infection in mice. macrophages from sr-a-deficient mice inhibited internalization and intracellular replication of both wild type strain and the virb4 mutant, and that bacterial proliferation was inhibited in sr-a-deficient mice. adding lipopolysaccharide from b. abortus and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, but not from escherichia coli, to macrophages inhibited bacterial internalization. virb-dependent bacterial internalization induced localization of sr-a into detergent-resistant membrane lipid rafts. these results indicate that b. abortus internalizes into macrophages by using sr-a as a receptor and that the virb type iv secretion system of b. abortus regulates signal transduction dependent on sr-a to form replicative phagosomes, and which is mediated by lipid rafts.
the in vitro antibacterial/synergistic activities of withania somnifera extracts.
the methanol, hexane and diethyl ether extracts from both leaves and roots of withania somnifera were evaluated for the antibacterial/synergistic activity by agar plate disc-diffusion assay against salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli. different concentrations of tibrim, a combination of rifampicin and isoniazid, were tested to find out the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), which came out to be 0.1 mg/ml for s. typhimurium and e. coli. from the six extracts tested, only methanol and hexane extracts of both leaves and roots were found to have potent antibacterial activity. a synergistic increase in the antibacterial effect of tibrim was noticed when mic of tibrim was supplemented with these extracts.
isolation, identification, and selection of lactic acid bacteria from alfalfa sprouts for competitive inhibition of foodborne pathogens.
several studies have investigated the control of pathogens on alfalfa sprouts, and some treatments have been shown to be effective in reducing pathogen populations. however, control methods investigated thus far only provide pathogen control at a given point in the sprouting process and can affect germination. competitive inhibition of pathogens with lactic acid bacteria might provide pathogen control throughout the sprouting process and up to consumption. the purpose of this study was to isolate and identify lactic acid bacteria from alfalfa sprouts to inhibit the growth of foodborne pathogens. fifty-eight lactic acid bacteria isolates were obtained from alfalfa seeds and sprouts. these isolates were evaluated for inhibitory action against salmonella enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, and listeria monocytogenes by agar spot tests. all pathogens were inhibited by 32 (55%) of the isolates, s. enterica by 56 (97%), e. coli o157:h7 by 49 (84%), and l. monocytogenes by 41 (71%). the isolates were identified by the analytical profile index evaluation of carbohydrate utilization. isolates obtained from a sample of alfalfa seeds and identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis showed zones of inhibition of 4.0 mm or greater for all pathogens. one of these isolates, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (l7), and an isolate previously obtained, pediococcus acidilactici (d3), were evaluated for competitive inhibition of s. enterica, e. coli o157:h7, and l. monocytogenes in deman rogosa sharpe agar and broth. pathogen populations were significantly reduced by day 5. the selected isolates will be further evaluated in future studies for inhibitory action toward s. enterica, e. coli o157:h7, and l. monocytogenes during sprouting.
functional comparison of the mouse dc-sign, signr1, signr3 and langerin, c-type lectins.
the mouse (m) dc-sign family consists of several homologous type ii transmembrane proteins located in close proximity on chromosome 8 and having a single carboxyl terminal carbohydrate recognition domain. we first used transfected non-macrophage cell lines to compare the polysaccharide and microbial uptake capacities of three of these lectins--dc-sign, signr1 and signr3--to another homologue mlangerin. each molecule shares a potential mannose-recognition epn-motif in its carbohydrate recognition domain. using an anti-tag antibody to follow tag-labeled transfectants, we found that each molecule could be internalized, although the rates differed. however, mdc-sign was unable to take up fitc-dextran, fitc-ovalbumin, zymosan or heat-killed candida albicans. the other three lectins showed distinct carbohydrate recognition properties, assessed by blocking fitc-dextran uptake at 37 degrees c and by mannan binding activity at 4 degrees c. furthermore, only signr1 was efficient in mediating the capture by transfected cells of gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, while none of the lectins tested were competent to capture gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus. interestingly, transfectants with signr1 lacking the cytoplasmic domain were capable of binding fitc-zymosan in a manner that was abolished by edta or mannan, but not laminarin. in addition, resident peritoneal cd11b+ cells expressing signr1 bound zymosan at 4 degrees c in concert with a laminarin-sensitive receptor. therefore these homologous c-type lectins have distinct recognition patters for microbes despite similarities in the carbohydrate recognition domains.
[resistance to quinolones and beta-lactams in salmonella enterica due to mutations in topoisomerase-encoding genes, altered cell permeability and expression of an active efflux system].
background: the mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams were studied in isolates of salmonella enterica resistant to both antimicrobial groups, isolated over time from two patients treated with fluoroquinolones. methods: the clonal relationships among the various strains was established by serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. mics for beta-lactams, quinolones, chloramphenicol and tetracycline were determined. presence of beta-lactamases was ruled out by a colorimetric assay. quinolone resistance-determining regions of the gyra, gyrb, parc, and pare genes were sequenced, and the relevance of the mutations in these regions was evaluated by complementation assays. outer membrane protein profiles, the effect of phenylalanyl-arginyl-naphthylamide (pan, 20 mg/l) on the mics of several quinolones, and norfloxacin accumulation in the absence and in the presence of a metabolic inhibitor were also determined. results: the following mutations were found: gyra (asp87 --> gly; ser83 --> phe; asp87 --> lys), gyrb (ser463 --> phe) and parc (glu84 --> gly). altered outer membrane protein profiles, including decreased expression of a porin equivalent to ompf from escherichia coli was observed. active efflux of norfloxacin was proved in both a clinical isolate and a mutant obtained in vitro. in the presence of pan, nalidixic acid mics decreased 4-32 times (except in one strain), pefloxacin mics decreased 4-16 times for 5 out of 9 evaluated strains, and mics of both norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin did not change or changed within a single dilution step. conclusions: quinolone-resistance is the consequence of a combination of mutations in topoisomerase-encoding genes, altered permeability and active efflux. altered permeability and active efflux would also contribute to decreased susceptibility to beta-lactams.
rapid screening method for the detection of antimicrobial substances.
bioluminescence is phenomenon where living organisms produce light and this production is directly dependent on metabolic activity of the organism. genes encoding enzymes, luciferases, responsible for light production can be cloned into indicator strains, thus allowing sensitive detection of antimicrobial activity. this study utilized bacterial luciferase genes cloned into staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium indicator strains and showed that the detection of antimicrobial activity can be obtained already in 2 h without laborious plate counting and overnight incubation. indicator strains used in the study harboured luxab genes responsible of producing light as well as luxcde genes for synthesis of long-chain fatty aldehyde as substrate for light production. as a consequence, no exogenous aldehyde addition was needed allowing stable light production. furthermore, the method was used for the detection of antimicrobial activity from lactic acid bacteria after the effect of organic acids was eliminated.
harmonization of antimicrobial susceptibility testing among veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five nordic countries.
a total of 100 bacterial strains (25 escherichia coli, 25 salmonella enterica, 25 staphylococcus aureus, and 25 enterococcus strains) and four reference strains were tested for susceptibility toward 8-12 antimicrobial agents in 12 veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five nordic countries using routine methodology. in addition, the 25 enterococcus strains were identified to species level. a total of 22,598 (97.2%) out of 23,259 test results were in accordance when the data were categorized as susceptible or resistant. when the reported results were categorized according to the national committee of clinical laboratory standards breakpoints, the percentage of concordant results increased to 98.4% and the performance between laboratories varied between 94.2 and 99.4% concordant results. for e. coli, s. aureus, and salmonella, all laboratories except one had more than 97% concordant results, whereas for enterococcus spp., two laboratories had less than 90% concordant results. susceptibility testing of salmonella to fluoroquinolones gave rise to almost 0.5% nonconcordant results and susceptibility testing of s. aureus to vancomycin resulted in that 1.8% of the strains were incorrectly reported as vancomycin resistant. ten laboratories identified the enterococcus spp. to species level. all five enterococcus faecium and 10 enterococcus faecalis selected from the strain collection at the danish veterinary institute were correctly identified by all laboratories, whereas some problems were observed identifying other enterococcal species. this study showed a good performance and agreement in antimicrobial susceptibility testing at the 12 participating laboratories and that surveillance data covering susceptibility test results of e. coli, s. aureus, and salmonella from animals in the nordic countries are comparable. but it also showed that some aspects can be improved. in addition, the study showed that the different laboratories are capable of identifying e. faecalis and e. faecium.
antimicrobial activity of a low-molecular-weight chitosan obtained from cellulase digestion of chitosan.
a water-soluble chitosan hydrolysate with high activity against escherichia coli  was obtained during cellulase digestion of chitosan for 18 h. this 18-h hydrolysate is composed of low-molecular-weight chitosan (lmwc), with a molecular weight of 12.0 kda, and chitooligosaccharides, which are composed of sugars with a degree of polymerization of 1 to 8. lmwc has a strong activity at 100 ppm against many pathogens and yeast species, including bacillus cereus, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, and saccharomyces cerevisiae, while the chitooligosaccharides have much weaker antimicrobial activity than does lmwc. accordingly, the antimicrobial activity against e. coli in the 18-h hydrolysate proved to come mainly from the presence of lmwc.
viability loss and morphology change of foodborne pathogens following exposure to hydrostatic pressures in the presence and absence of bacteriocins.
cell suspensions of three pathogens were exposed to hydrostatic pressure (hp), bacteriocin mixture (nisin and pediocin) or a combination of hp+bacteriocins and changes in colony forming units (cfu) and cell-morphology by scanning electron microscopy (sem) were studied. cell viability loss, as determined from the reduction in cfu before and after a treatment, occurred in listeria monocytogenes by all three treatments and in salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli o157:h7 by hp and hp+bacteriocin combination. cell wall and cell membrane collapse and cell lysis was indicated in l. monocytogenes exposed to bacteriocin or hp+bacteriocin and in salmonella and e. coli exposed to hp or hp+bacteriocin.
salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium rama, intracellular oxidative stress response, and bacterial virulence.
escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium have evolved genetic systems, such as the soxr/s and mara regulons, to detoxify reactive oxygen species, like superoxide, which are formed as by-products of metabolism. superoxide also serves as a microbicidal effector mechanism of the host's phagocytes. here, we investigate whether regulatory genes other than soxr/s and mara are active in response to oxidative stress in salmonella and may function as virulence determinants. we identified a bacterial gene, which was designated rama (342 bp) and mapped at 13.1 min on the salmonella chromosome, that, when overexpressed on a plasmid in e. coli or salmonella, confers a pleiotropic phenotype characterized by increased resistance to the redox-cycling agent menadione and to multiple unrelated antibiotics. the rama gene is present in salmonella serovars but is absent in e. coli. the gene product displays 37 to 52% homology to the transcriptional activators soxr/s and mara and 80 to 100% identity to a multidrug resistance gene in klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi a. although a rama soxr/s double null mutant is highly susceptible to intracellular superoxide generated by menadione and displays decreased mn-superoxide dismutase activity, intracellular survival of this mutant within macrophage-like raw 264.7 cells and in vivo replication in the spleens in ityr mice are not affected. we concluded that despite its role in the protective response of the bacteria to oxidative stress in vitro, the newly identified rama gene, together with soxr/s, does not play a role in initial replication of salmonella in the organs of mice.
genetic analysis and complete primary structure of microcin l.
escherichia coli lr05, in addition to producing mccb17, j25, and d93, secretes microcin l, a newly discovered microcin that exhibits strong antibacterial activity against related enterobacteriaceae, including salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium and enteritidis. microcin l was purified using a two-step procedure including solid-phase extraction and reverse-phase c(18) high-performance liquid chromatography. a 4,901-bp region of the dna plasmid of e. coli lr05 was sequenced revealing that the microcin l cluster consists of four genes, mclc, mcli, mcla, and mclb. the structural gene mclc encoded a 105-amino-acid precursor with a 15-amino-acid n-terminal extension ending with a gly-ala motif upstream of the cleavage site. this motif is typical of the class ii microcins and other gram-positive bacteriocins exported by abc transporters. the mcli immunity gene was identified upstream of the mclc gene and encodes a 51-amino-acid protein with two potential transmembrane domains. located on the reverse strand, two genes, mcla and mclb, encoded the proteins mcla and mclb, respectively. they bear strong relatedness with the abc transporter proteins and accessory factors involved in the secretion of microcins h47, v, e492, and 24. the microcin l genetic system resembles the genetic organization of mccv. furthermore the mccl primary structure has been determined. it is a 90-amino-acid peptide of 8,884 da with two disulfide bridges. the n-terminal region has significant homologies with several gram-positive bacteriocins. the c-terminal 32-amino-acid sequence is 87.5% identical to that of mccv. together, these results strongly indicate that microcin l is a gram-negative class ii microcin.
antimicrobial resistance of commensal escherichia coli from dairy cattle associated with recent multi-resistant salmonellosis outbreaks.
the use of antimicrobial drugs in livestock is suspected to contribute to bacterial antimicrobial resistance (ar) development. dairy farms experiencing recent outbreaks of salmonellosis involving multi-resistant (mr) salmonella strains were compared to control farms with respect to ar among bovine commensal e. coli isolates. for most antimicrobials tested, the percentage of ar e. coli isolated from salmonellosis-affected farms was significantly higher than that from control farms. calf e. coli from both case and control farms had greater levels of ar than cow isolates. commensal e. coli isolates from case farms and calves tended to more frequently be mr. these data are consistent with the existence of higher antimicrobial selection pressure on farms with recent salmonellosis outbreaks, however, the directionality of the relationship remains to be elucidated. an improved understanding of the epidemiology of ar bacteria in livestock production, both at the herd and molecular level, is essential to mitigate risk to public health and food safety.
antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of natural extracts in vitro and in ground beef.
inhibition of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and listeria monocytogenes by grape seed extract (activin) and pine bark extract (pycnogenol) and the effect of these natural extracts on the oxidative stability of raw ground beef were studied. in an agar dilution test, the mics of activin and pycnogenol were determined to be 4.0 mg/ml for 4.43 log cfu per plate of e. coli o157:h7 and 4.0 mg/ml for 4.38 log cfu per plate of l. monocytogenes. in an inhibition curve test, populations of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and l. monocytogenes fell to below the detection limit (10 cfu/ml) after 16 h of incubation. the numbers of e. coli o157:h7, l. monocytogenes, and salmonella typhimurium declined by 1.08, 1.24, and 1.33 log cfu/g, respectively, in raw ground beef treated with 1% pycnogenol after 9 days of refrigerated storage. activin (1%) and oleoresin rosemary (1%) resulted in an approximately 1-log cfu/g reduction in the populations of all three pathogens after 9 days. the addition of 1% activin and pycnogenol contributed to the maintenance of an acidic ph of 5.80 and 5.58, respectively, in raw ground beef. compared to the control, all treatments increased in l* (lightness), with the exception of activin. activin and oleoresin rosemary had the highest a* (redness) and b* (yellowness) values, respectively. activin most effectively retarded lipid oxidation, followed by pycnogenol. the results suggest that these natural extracts have potential to be used with other preservative methods to reduce pathogenic numbers, lipid oxidation, and color degradation in ground beef.
adaptive resistance to biocides in salmonella enterica and escherichia coli o157  and cross-resistance to antimicrobial agents.
the mechanisms by which bacteria resist killing by antibiotics and biocides are still poorly defined, although repeated exposure to sublethal concentrations of antibacterial agents undoubtedly contributes to their development. this study aimed both to investigate the potential of salmonella enterica and escherichia coli o157 for adaptive resistance to commonly used biocides and to determine any cross-resistance to antibiotics. strains were repeatedly passaged in media containing increasing concentrations of a biocide or antibiotic until adaptive resistance was obtained. a wide panel of antimicrobial agents was then screened by using the adapted strain to determine cross-resistance, if any. adaptive resistance was readily achieved for both s. enterica and e. coli o157. cross-resistance in adaptively resistant s. enterica varied with the serotype; salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis expressed cross-resistance to chloramphenicol, whereas salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium expressed cross-resistance to chlorhexidine. benzalkonium chloride-resistant salmonella enterica serovar virchow showed elevated resistance to chlorhexidine; however, chlorhexidine-resistant salmonella serovar virchow did not demonstrate reciprocal cross-resistance to benzalkonium chloride, suggesting specific rather than generic resistance mechanisms. e. coli o157 strains acquired high levels of resistance to triclosan after only two sublethal exposures and, when adapted, repeatedly demonstrated decreased susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents, including chloramphenicol, erythromycin, imipenem, tetracycline, and trimethoprim, as well as to a number of biocides. these observations raise concern over the indiscriminate and often inappropriate use of biocides, especially triclosan, in situations where they are unnecessary, whereby they may contribute to the development of microbial resistance mechanisms.
enhancement of nisin, lysozyme, and monolaurin antimicrobial activities by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and lactoferrin.
a microtiter plate assay was employed to systematically assess the interaction between ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) or lactoferrin and nisin, lysozyme, or monolaurin against strains of listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, and pseudomonas fluorescens. low levels of edta acted synergistically with nisin and lysozyme against l. monocytogenes but edta and monolaurin interacted additively against this microorganism. edta synergistically enhanced the activity of nisin, monolaurin, and lysozyme in tryptic soy broth (tsb) against two enterohemorrhagic e. coli strains. in addition, various combinations of nisin, lysozyme, and monolaurin with edta were bactericidal to some gram-negative bacteria whereas none of the antimicrobials alone were bactericidal. lactoferrin alone (2000 microg ml(-1)) did not inhibit any of the bacterial strains, but did enhance nisin activity against both l. monocytogenes strains. lactoferrin in combination with monolaurin inhibited growth of e. coli o157:h7 but not e. coli o104:h21. while lactoferrin combined with nisin or monolaurin did not completely inhibit growth of the gram-negative bacteria, there was some growth inhibition. all combinations of edta or lactoferrin with antimicrobials were less effective in 2% fat uht milk than in tsb. s. enteritidis and p. fluorescens strains were consistently more resistant to antimicrobial combinations. resistance may be due to differences in the outer membrane and/or lps structure.
characterization of salmonella enterica serotype newport isolated from humans and food animals.
salmonella enterica serotype newport isolates resistant to at least nine antimicrobials (including extended-spectrum cephalosporins), known as serotype newport mdr-ampc isolates, have been rapidly emerging as pathogens in both animals and humans throughout the united states. resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins is associated with clinical failures, including death, in patients with systemic infections. in this study, 87 salmonella serotype newport strains were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing and examined for the presence of class 1 integrons and bla(cmy) genes. thirty-five pfge patterns were observed with xbai, and three of these patterns were indistinguishable among isolates from humans and animals. fifty-three (60%) salmonella serotype newport isolates were identified as serotype newport mdr-ampc, including 16 (53%) of 30 human isolates, 27 (93%) of 29 cattle isolates, 7 (70%) of 10 swine isolates, and 3 (30%) of 10 chicken isolates. however, 28 (32%) salmonella serotype newport isolates were susceptible to all 16 antimicrobials tested. the bla(cmy) gene was present in all serotype newport mdr-ampc isolates. furthermore, the plasmid-mediated bla(cmy) gene was transferable via conjugation to an escherichia coli strain. the transconjugant showed the mdr-ampc resistance profile. thirty-five (40%) of the isolates possessed class 1 integrons. sequence analyses of the integrons showed that they contained aada, which confers resistance to streptomycin, or aada and dhfr, which confer resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. one integron from a swine isolate contained the sat-1 gene, which encodes resistance to streptothricin, an antimicrobial agent that has never been approved for use in the united states. in conclusion, salmonella serotype newport mdr-ampc was commonly identified among salmonella serotype newport isolates recovered from humans and food animals. these findings support the possibility of transmission of this organism to humans through the food chain.
activity of natural antimicrobial compounds against escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
aims: the objective of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory activity of several natural organic compounds alone or in combination with nisin against escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. methods and results: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of five natural organic compounds were determined, and the effect of their combinations with nisin was evaluated by the checkerboard assay using the bioscreen c. as expected, nisin by itself showed no inhibition against either of the gram-negative bacteria. thymol was found to be the most effective with the lowest mic values of 1.0 and 1.2 mmol 1-1 against salm. typhimurium and e. coli, respectively. after thymol, the antimicrobial order of the natural organic compounds was carvacrol > eugenol > cinnamic acid > diacetyl. however, the combination of nisin with the natural organic compounds did not result in the enhancement of their antimicrobial activities. on the contrary, combination of nisin with diacetyl against salm. typhimurium resulted in an antagonism of diacetyl activity. conclusions: while the individual natural organic compounds showed inhibitory activity against the two gram-negatives, their combinations with nisin showed no improvement of antimicrobial activity. significance and impact of the study: this study shows the potential of the natural organic compounds to control e. coli and salm. typhimurium.
thin pilus pilv adhesins of plasmid r64 recognize specific structures of the lipopolysaccharide molecules of recipient cells.
inci1 plasmid r64 encodes a type iv pilus called a thin pilus, which includes pilv adhesins. seven different sequences for the c-terminal segments of pilv adhesins can be produced by shufflon dna rearrangement. the expression of the seven pilv adhesins determines the recipient specificity in liquid matings of plasmid r64. salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 was recognized by the pilva' and pilvb' adhesins, while escherichia coli k-12 was recognized by the pilva', pilvc, and pilvc' adhesins. lipopolysaccharide (lps) on the surfaces of recipient cells was previously shown to be the specific receptor for the seven pilv adhesins. to identify the specific receptor structures of lps for various pilv adhesins, r64 liquid matings were carried out with recipient cells consisting of various s. enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 and e. coli k-12 waa mutants and their derivatives carrying various waa genes of different origins. from the mating experiments, including inhibition experiments, we propose that the glcnac(alpha1-2)glc and glc(alpha1-2)gal structures of the lps core of s. enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 function as receptors for the pilvb' and pilvc' adhesins, respectively, while the pilvc' receptor in the wild-type lt2 lps core may be masked. we further propose that the glcnac(beta1-7)hep and glc(alpha1-2)glc structures of the lps core of e. coli k-12 function as receptors for the pilvc and pilvc' adhesins, respectively.
activity of faropenem and imipenem for ciprofloxacin-resistant bacteria.
aim: to determine whether an association exists between ciprofloxacin and faropenem resistance in bacteria including multiply drug-resistant isolates. methods: the mics were determined for 150 fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria, plus 20 nalidixic acid-resistant strains of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. results: faropenem was very active against escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae, but 5/31 staphylococcus aureus and 2/26 bacteroides fragilis required > or =16 mg/l for inhibition. of 30 multiply drug-resistant isolates with a phenotype suggestive of enhanced efflux, only for one strain (a bacteroides fragilis) was the faropenem mic higher than that associated with the other isolates of the same species. conclusions: faropenem was in general as active as imipenem. there was no association between resistance to ciprofloxacin and faropenem or imipenem resistance.
in vitro growth responses of bifidobacteria and enteropathogens to bovine and human lactoferrin.
a series of in vitro experiments was performed to test the ability of bovine and  human lactoferrin to influence the growth of the gram-positive probiotic bacteria, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis, and lactobacillus acidophilus, as well as the gram-negative enteric bacteria, e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium. none of the lactoferrin preparations stimulated the growth of the tested strains. however, iron-free apo-lactoferrin (bovine and human) and 66% iron-saturated bovine lactoferrin dramatically slowed the growth of e. coli o157:h7 in single culture experiments, while 98% iron-saturated preparations had no effect. in coculture experiments of b. infantis and e. coli, the iron-limited preparations of lactoferrin also slowed the growth of the latter without inhibiting the bifidobacteria. these results suggest that lactoferrin in iron-limited forms may have the potential to be combined with probiotic bacteria in biotherapeutic products, which could help balance human gut microflora and limit the overgrowth of certain enteric microorganisms.
competitive exclusion by bacillus subtilis spores of salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis and clostridium perfringens in young chickens.
cost effective control of avian diseases and food borne pathogens remains a high  priority for all sectors of the poultry industry with cleansing and disinfection, vaccination and competitive exclusion approaches being used widely. previous studies showed that bacillus subtilis py79(hr) was an effective competitive exclusion agent for use in poultry to control avian pathogenic escherichia coli serotype o78:k80. here we report experiments that were undertaken to test the efficacy of b. subtilis py79(hr) in the control of salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis and clostridium perfringens in young chickens. to do this, 1-day-old and 20-day-old specific pathogen free (spf) chicks were dosed with a suspension of b. subtilis spores prior to challenge with s. enteritidis (s1400) and c. perfringens, respectively. for both challenge models, a single oral inoculum of 1x10(9) spores given 24h prior to challenge was sufficient to suppress colonisation and persistence of both s. enteritidis and c. perfringens. in particular, the faecal shedding of s. enteritidis, as measured by a semi-quantitative cloacal swabbing technique, was reduced significantly for the 36 days duration of the experiment. b. subtilis persisted in the intestine although with decreasing numbers over the same period. these data add further evidence that b. subtilis spores may be effective agents in the control of avian diseases and food borne pathogens.
a two-stage continuous culture system to study the effect of supplemental alpha-lactalbumin and glycomacropeptide on mixed cultures of human gut bacteria challenged with enteropathogenic escherichia coli and salmonella serotype typhimurium.
aims: certain milk factors may promote the growth of a gastrointestinal microflora predominated by bifidobacteria and may aid in overcoming enteric infections. this may explain why breast-fed infants experience fewer intestinal infections than their formula-fed counterparts. the effect of formula supplementation with two such factors was investigated in this study. methods and results: infant faecal specimens were used to ferment formulae supplemented with glycomacropeptide (gmp) and alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-la) in a two-stage compound continuous culture model. at steady state, all fermenter vessels were inoculated with 5 ml of 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.2) containing 108 cfu ml-1 of either enteropathogenic escherichia coli 2348/69 (o127:h6) or salmonella serotype typhimurium (dsmz 5569). bacteriology was determined by independent fluorescence in situ hybridization. vessels that contained breast milk (bm), as well as alpha-la and gmp supplemented formula had stable total counts of bifidobacteria while lactobacilli increased significantly only in vessels with breast milk. bacteroides, clostridia and e. coli decreased significantly in all three groups prior to pathogen addition. escherichia coli counts decreased in vessels containing bm and alpha-la while salmonella decreased significantly in all vessels containing bm, alpha-la and gmp. acetate was the predominant acid. significance and impact of the study: supplementation of infant formulae with appropriate milk proteins may be useful in mimicking the beneficial bacteriological effects of breast milk.
application of hexanal, e-2-hexenal, and hexyl acetate to improve the safety of fresh-sliced apples.
the aims of this work were to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of hexanal, (e)-2-hexenal, hexyl acetate, and their mixtures on the fate of pathogenic species such as escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, and listeria monocytogenes inoculated in model systems as well as the antimicrobial activity against the target species of the chosen molecules when added to the packaging atmosphere of inoculated fresh-sliced apples. the result obtained in this work pointed out the potential use of compounds such as hexanal, (e)-2-hexenal, and hexyl acetate for both the extension of shelf life and an improvement of hygienic safety of "minimally processed foods". in fact, hexanal, (e)-2-hexenal, and hexyl acetate had a significant inhibitory effect against pathogen microorganisms frequently isolated from raw materials (e. coli, s. enteritidis, and l. monocytogenes) when inoculated in both model and real systems. in this last condition, these compounds, at the levels used (150, 150, and 20 ppm for hexanal, hexyl acetate, and (e)-2-hexenal, respectively), displayed a bactericide effect on l. monocytogenes and they exhibited significant extensions of lag phase of e. coli and s. enteritidis inoculated at levels of 10(4)-10(5) cfu/g.
origin of lipid a species modified with 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose in polymyxin-resistant mutants of escherichia coli. an aminotransferase (arnb) that generates udp-4-deoxyl-l-arabinose.
in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, addition of the 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-ara4n) moiety to the phosphate group(s) of lipid a is required for resistance to polymyxin and cationic antimicrobial peptides. we have proposed previously (breazeale, s. d., ribeiro, a. a., and raetz, c. r. h. (2002) j. biol. chem. 277, 2886-2896) a pathway for l-ara4n biosynthesis that begins with the arna-catalyzed c-4" oxidation and c-6" decarboxylation of udp-glucuronic acid, followed by the c-4" transamination of the product to generate the novel sugar nucleotide udp-l-ara4n. we now show that arnb (pmrh) encodes the relevant aminotransferase. arnb was overexpressed using a t7lac promoter-driven construct and shown to catalyze the reversible transfer of the amino group from glutamate to the acceptor, uridine 5'-(beta-l-threo-pentapyranosyl-4"-ulose diphosphate), the intermediate that is synthesized by arna from udp-glucuronic acid. a 1.7-mg sample of the putative udp-l-ara4n product generated in vitro was purified by ion exchange chromatography, and its structure was confirmed by 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy. arnb, which is a cytoplasmic protein, was purified to homogeneity from an overproducing strain of e. coli and shown to contain a pyridoxal phosphate cofactor, as judged by ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry. the pyridoxal phosphate was converted to the pyridoxamine form in the presence of excess glutamate. a simple quantitative radiochemical assay was developed for arnb, which can be used to assay the enzyme either in the forward or the reverse direction. the enzyme is highly selective for glutamate as the amine donor, but the equilibrium constant in the direction of udp-l-ara4n formation is unfavorable (approximately 0.1). arnb is a member of a very large family of aminotransferases, but closely related arnb orthologs are present only in those bacteria capable of synthesizing lipid a species modified with the l-ara4n moiety.
effect of feeding the ionophores monensin and laidlomycin propionate and the antimicrobial bambermycin to sheep experimentally infected with e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium.
escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella are widely recognized as important agents of foodborne disease with worldwide distribution. the use of ionophores in feeding growing ruminants is widespread in the united states and has attracted recent interest due to the apparent temporal relationship between initial ionophore use and the increase in human e. coli o157:h7 cases. two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of short-term feeding of ionophores on fecal shedding, intestinal concentrations, and antimicrobial susceptibility of e. coli o157:h7 and s. typhimurium in growing lambs. sixteen lambs were used in each experiment, four lambs per treatment group: monensin, laidlomycin propionate, bambermycin, and a control treatment. lambs were fed a grain and hay (50:50) diet with their respective ionophore for 12 d before experimental inoculation with e. coli o157:h7 or s. typhimurium. animals were maintained on their respective diets an additional 12 d, and fecal shedding of inoculated pathogens was monitored daily. lambs were killed and tissues and contents were sampled from the rumen, cecum, and rectum. no differences (p > 0.05) in fecal shedding of salmonella or e. coli o157:h7 were observed due to treatment. occurrence of salmonella or e. coli in luminal contents and tissue samples from the rumen, cecum, and rectum did not differ (p > 0.05) among treatments. feeding monensin decreased (p < 0.05) the incidence of scours in sheep infected with salmonella compared with the other treatments. no differences in antimicrobial susceptibility were found in any of salmonella or e. coli o157:h7 isolates. results from these studies indicate that short-term ionophore feeding had very limited effects on e. coli and salmonella shedding or on antimicrobial susceptibility in experimentally infected lambs.
antagonistic action of cells of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in fresh meat systems.
cells of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis rm2-5 were added to various meat model systems that had been inoculated with escherichia coli o157:h7 or salmonella typhimurium to determine whether these lactobacilli were antagonistic to the pathogens during storage at 5 degrees c. experiments in which l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis rm2-5 was directly applied to the surfaces of beefsteaks resulted in significant (p < 0.05) reductions in the growth of psychrotrophs and coliforms plus a slight decrease in the numbers of e. coli o157:h7 over time relative to those for control samples to which no lactobacilli had been added. experiments involving the direct application of l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis rm2-5 to the surfaces of freshly slaughtered beef and pork carcass samples inoculated with either e. coli o157:h7 or salmonella typhimurium showed significant (p < 0.05) declines in numbers of the pathogens as well as a reduction in the growth of psychrotrophs during storage at 5 degrees c for 6 days. the results of the experiments suggest that lactobacillus cultures have potential for use in an intervention technology for the control of foodborne pathogens, especially on the surfaces of beef and pork carcasses. the results of this study also suggest that an extension of the shelf life of meat can result from the decreased growth of psychrotrophic spoilage organisms.
utilization of carbonate and ammonia-based treatments to eliminate escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium dt104 from cattle manure.
aims: the objective of this study was to investigate alkaline treatments of cattle manure to kill coliforms, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium dt104 based on their inhibition by carbonate ion and ammonia. methods and results: pure cultures of s. typhimurium dt104 and e. coli o157:h7 strains were treated with sodium carbonate and ammonia to determine threshold inhibitory concentrations. fresh cattle manure samples were inoculated with the same strains and their survival was determined after addition of sodium hydroxide, ammonium sulphate, sodium carbonate and/or urea. control of co and nh3 concentrations in manure by ph adjustment to 9.5 with sodium hydroxide to more than 5 and 30 mmol l-1, respectively, killed more than 106 cells g-1 in 7 days. addition of sodium carbonate enhanced the killing effect of naoh by increasing the co and nh3 concentrations. addition of 100 mmol l-1 urea, produced high levels of co and nh3 and decreased all bacterial counts by at least 106 cells g-1 after 7 days. conclusions: reduction of food-borne pathogens in manure can be achieved by a combination of high concentrations of co and nh3 which are ph-dependent parameters. significance and impact of study: addition of urea could provide a simple manure treatment by combining both antimicrobial factors.
structural and biological characterization of highly purified hepta-acyl lipid a  present in the lipopolysaccharide of the salmonella enterica sv. minnesota re deep rough mutant strain r595.
one major component of the salmonella enterica sv. minnesota re deep rough mutant (strain r595) lipopolysaccharide is hepta-acyl lipid a (la(hepta)). in a recent publication [tanamoto k-i, azumi s. salmonella-type heptaacylated lipid a is inactive and acts as an antagonist of lipopolysaccharide action on human line cells. j immunol 2000; 164: 3149-3156] the corresponding synthetic hepta-acyl lipid a (compound 516) was reported to be agonistically inactive but to rather suppress pro-inflammatory activation by the endotoxic hexa-acyl lipid a (la(hexa), compound 506) and s-form lps from escherichia coli in the human macrophage-like cell lines thp-1 and u937. these results, however, were in contrast to previous findings with human mononuclear cells (hmnc) isolated from peripheral blood, in which compound 516 was found to be an agonist, expressing low, but significant, cytokine-inducing activity as compared to la(hexa). we have investigated the structure of natural la(hepta) from the s. enterica sv. minnesota re deep rough mutant strain (r595) by tlc immunoblot, maldi-tof mass spectrometry and nmr spectroscopy. using these techniques, the structural identity between la(hepta) and the synthetic compound 516 was confirmed. in corroboration of previous findings with studies employing compound 516, purified la(hepta) was found to induce the production of tnf-alpha, il-1beta and il-6 in hmnc, thus displaying moderate agonistic activity. furthermore, we showed that la(hepta) agonistically activated nuclear translocation of nf-kappab in thp-1 cells, thus clearly ruling out the possibility that la(hepta) is an antagonist and that its biological activity is influenced by the type of human myeloid cells used for testing endotoxicity (hmnc versus thp-1 cells).
eggshell matrix proteins as defense mechanism of avian eggs.
this study focused on the role of eggshell matrix proteins as a function of potential natural antimicrobial defenses of avian eggs. the electrophoretic profile of sds-page showed that the soluble eggshell matrix proteins had three major bands of 15 000, 36 000, and 66 000 and several minor bands comprising 17 000, 25 000, 30 000, and 75 000, while insoluble matrix proteins were consisting of various bands comprising at least 16 distinct migration bands between 10 000 and 200 000. three bacteria species, pseudomonas aureginosa, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus, were found to be inhibited in the presence of soluble eggshell matrix proteins (100 microg/ml). on the other hand, escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis were weakly inhibited at only an early stage of incubation time (up to 4 h). scanning electron microscopy revealed that eggshell matrix proteins might interact and disrupt the membrane integrity of bacteria. the present study clearly indicated that avian eggshell matrix proteins possess a potential of novel antimicrobial defensin mechanism.
in vitro adhesion of an avian pathogenic escherichia coli o78 strain to surfaces  of the chicken intestinal tract and to ileal mucus.
the role of fimbria in adherence of an avian pathogenic escherichia coli (apec) o78 strain 789 to chicken intestine was studied. bacterial adhesion to tissue sections representing the regions within the chicken intestinal tract was determined by using immunohistochemical methods. e. coli 789 grown to express the type 1 fimbria adhered efficiently to the crop epithelium, to the lamina propria of intestinal villi, and to the apical surfaces of both the mature as well as the crypt-located enterocytes in intestinal villi, whereas no adhesion to mucus-producing goblet cells was detected. the adhesion was inhibited by mannoside and the role of type 1 fimbriae in the observed adhesion was confirmed with a recombinant strain expressing type 1 fimbriae genes cloned from e. coli and salmonella enterica. e. coli 789 strain grown to favor ac/i fimbriae expression as well as the recombinant e. coli strain expressing the fac genes adhered to goblet cells but only poorly to the other epithelial sites. e. coli strain 789 as well as s. enterica serovar typhimurium ir715 and s. enterica serovar enteriditis tn2 strains were able to multiply in ileal mucus medium. the type 1 fimbria expressing bacteria adhered to the ileal mucus, whereas the ac/i fimbriated strains showed poor adherence to the mucus. the adhesion of e. coli 789 onto the crop epithelium and the follicle associated epithelium of the chicken ileum was efficiently inhibited by an adhesive strain st1 of lactobacillus crispatus isolated from chicken, whereas poor inhibition of e. coli adherence was observed with the weakly adhesive l. crispatus strain 134mi. the type 1 fimbriae may be important in colonization of the chicken intestine by apec and salmonella.
prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among pigeon isolates of streptococcus gallolyticus, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium.
thirty-three streptococcus gallolyticus, 60 escherichia coli and 18 salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium var. copenhagen strains isolated from homing pigeons (columba livia) were tested for susceptibility to the antimicrobials most commonly used to treat pigeons. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined using the agar dilution technique. aminoglycosides (gentamicin and kanamycin), trimethoprim and flumequine were relatively inactive against the streptococci tested. acquired tetracycline resistance amounted to 85%, and lincomycin and macrolide (erythromycin) resistance to 48 and 45%, respectively. fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacin) resistance was found in four s. gallolyticus strains. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin. with the e. coli strains, resistance was found to all antibiotics tested. over one-half of them were resistant to tetracycline and to broad-spectrum penicillins (ampicillin); however, none showed extended spectrum beta-lactamase activity, implying that the cephalosporins (ceftiofur) remained active. resistance to trimethoprim, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolone ranked next. in contrast to the s. gallolyticus and e. coli strains, the s. enterica strains were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested.
bactericidal activities of plant essential oils and some of their isolated constituents against campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella enterica.
an improved method of sample preparation was used in a microplate assay to evaluate the bactericidal activity levels of 96 essential oils and 23 oil compounds against campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella enterica obtained from food and clinical sources. bactericidal activity (ba50) was defined as the percentage of the sample in the assay mixture that resulted in a 50% decrease in cfu relative to a buffer control. twenty-seven oils and 12 compounds were active against all four species of bacteria. the oils that were most active against c. jejuni (with ba50 values ranging from 0.003 to 0.009) were marigold, ginger root, jasmine, patchouli, gardenia, cedarwood, carrot seed, celery seed, mugwort, spikenard, and orange bitter oils; those that were most active against e. coli (with ba50 values ranging from 0.046 to 0.14) were oregano, thyme, cinnamon, palmarosa, bay leaf, clove bud, lemon grass, and allspice oils; those that were most active against l monocytogenes (with ba50 values ranging from 0.057 to 0.092) were gardenia, cedarwood, bay leaf, clove bud, oregano, cinnamon, allspice, thyme, and patchouli oils; and those that were most active against s. enterica (with ba50 values ranging from 0.045 to 0.14) were thyme, oregano, cinnamon, clove bud, allspice, bay leaf, palmarosa, and marjoram oils. the oil compounds that were most active against c. jejuni (with ba50 values ranging from 0.003 to 0.034) were cinnamaldehyde, estragole, carvacrol, benzaldehyde, citral, thymol, eugenol, perillaldehyde, carvone r, and geranyl acetate; those that were most active against e. coli (with ba50 values ranging from 0.057 to 0.28) were carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, eugenol, salicylaldehyde, geraniol, isoeugenol, citral, perillaldehyde, and estragole; those that were most active against l monocytogenes (with ba50 values ranging from 0.019 to 0.43) were cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, thymol, carvacrol, citral, geraniol, perillaldehyde, carvone s, estragole, and salicylaldehyde; and those that were most active against s. enterica (with ba50 values ranging from 0.034 to 0.21) were thymol, cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol, eugenol, salicylaldehyde, geraniol, isoeugenol, terpineol, perillaldehyde, and estragole. the possible significance of these results with regard to food microbiology is discussed.
identification and characterization of snra, an inducible oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium ta1535.
the biological activity of many nitrosubstituted compounds, many of which are produced commercially or have been identified as environmental contaminants, is dependent on metabolic activation catalyzed by nitroreductases. in the current study, we have cloned a nitroreductase gene, salmonella typhimurium nitroreductase a (snra), from s. enterica serovar typhimurium strain ta1535, and characterized the purified gene product. snra is 240 amino acids in length and shares 87% sequence identity to the escherichia coli homolog, e. coli nitroreductase a (nfsa). snra is the major nitroreductase in s. enterica serovar typhimurium strain ta1535 and catalyzes nitroreduction through a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism in a nadph and flavine mononucleotide (fmn) dependent manner. snra exhibits extremely low levels of fmn reductase activity but the nitroreductase activity of snra is competitively inhibited by exogenously added fmn. treatment of ta1535 with paraquat resulted in induction of nitroreductase activity, suggesting that snra is a member of the s. enterica serovar typhimurium soxrs regulon associated with cellular defense against oxidative damage. examination of the microbial genomes databases shows that snra homologs are widely distributed in the microbial world, being present in isolates of both archea and eubacteria. southern hybridization and pcr failed to detect the snra gene in the closely related s. enterica serovar typhimurium strain ta1538. s. enterica serovar typhimurium strains ta1535 and ta1538 and their derivatives are commonly used in mutagenicity testing. differences in metabolic capacity between these two strains may have implications for the interpretation of mutagenicity data.
in vitro inhibition of salmonella enterica serovars choleraesuis and typhimurium, escherichia coli f-18, and escherichia coli o157:h7 by a porcine continuous-flow competitive exclusion culture.
a competitive exclusion (ce) culture of porcine cecal bacteria was developed as a continuous-flow culture in chemostats, was designated rpcf, and was used as a model to determine its usefulness against in vitro colonization by salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium and choleraesuis, escherichia coli strain f-18, and e. coli serotype o157:h7 (933). chemostats with or without rpcf were inoculated with 10(6) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml of typhimurium, choleraesuis, f-18, or o157:h7. chemostats were sampled for salmonellae and e. coli at 15 min, 7 h, and every 24 h thereafter. in control chemostats without rpcf, typhimurium, choleraesuis, f-18, and o157:h7 rapidly established colonization and had concentrations of 10(6) cfu/ml for 96-120 h post-inoculation. in the chemostats that contained rpcf, reductions (p < 0.05) of choleraesuis, f-18, and o157:h7 were observed at 24 h post-inoculation. typhimurium was decreased (p < 0.05) at 48 h post-inoculation, and by 120 h post-inoculation, all chemostats were negative for the four challenge microorganisms. these results demonstrate that rpcf cultures were able to inhibit the growth of typhimurium, choleraesuis, and e. coli strains f-18 and o157:h7 in vitro and suggest the potential for the use of ce in swine to prevent disease induced by these microorganisms.
screening of some siberian medicinal plants for antimicrobial activity.
the antimicrobial activity of crude ethanolic extracts of 16 siberian medicinal plants was tested against five species of microorganisms: bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans. of the 16 plants tested, 12 showed antimicrobial activity against one or more species of microorganisms. the most active antimicrobial plants were bergenia crassifolia, chelidonium majus, rhaponticum carthamoides, sanguisorba officinalis, and tussilago farfara.
inorganic polyphosphate is essential for long-term survival and virulence factors in shigella and salmonella spp.
the importance of inorganic polyphosphate (poly p) and poly p kinase (ppk), the enzyme principally responsible for its synthesis, has been established previously for stationary-phase survival of escherichia coli and virulence in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the gene (ppk) that encodes ppk is highly conserved among many bacterial pathogens, including shigella and salmonella spp. in view of the phylogenetic similarity of the enteropathogens and the frequency with which virulence factors are expressed in stationary phase, the ppk gene of pathogenic shigella flexneri, salmonella enterica serovar dublin, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium have been cloned and deleted. in some of these mutants lacking ppk, the phenotypes included features indicative of decreased virulence such as: (i) growth defects, (ii) defective responses to stress and starvation, (iii) loss of viability, (iv) polymyxin sensitivity, (v) intolerance to acid and heat, and (vi) diminished invasiveness in epithelial cells. thus ppk may prove, as it has with p. aeruginosa, to be an attractive target for antibiotics, with low toxicity because ppk is not found in higher eukaryotes.
intracellular cyclic amp concentration is decreased in salmonella typhimurium fur mutants.
it is known that the fur protein negatively regulates iron-uptake systems in different bacterial species, including salmonella typhimurium. in this study it has been shown that the intracellular concentration of cyclic amp (camp) is lower in a knockout s. typhimurium fur mutant than in the wild-type strain. according to this, the expression of two camp-regulated genes, such as pepe (encoding an alpha-aspartyl dipeptidase) and the escherichia coli lac operon, is decreased in s. typhimurium fur cells in comparison with wild-type cells. introduction of an additional mutation in cpda, encoding a cyclic 3',5'-camp phosphodiesterase, recovers wild-type intracellular camp concentration in the s. typhimurium fur mutant. likewise, expression of pepe and the e. coli lac operon was the same in the s. typhimurium fur cpda double mutant and the wild-type strain. moreover, these results also demonstrate that the s. typhimurium fur protein positively regulates the expression of the flhd master operon governing the flagellar regulon. this positive control must be mediated by binding of the s. typhimurium fur protein to the flhd promoter as indicated by the fact that this promoter tests positive in a fur titration assay.
effects of antibacterial dishwashing liquid on foodborne pathogens and competitive microorganisms in kitchen sponges.
in response to increasing concern about home hygiene, the use of antibacterial products to reduce microorganisms in kitchen sponges and cleaning cloths is strongly promoted by some producers of detergent for domestic use. the effects of an antibacterial dishwashing liquid on escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus were investigated in a modified suspension test and in used sponges with and without food residues under laboratory conditions. a limited study was conducted in households to assess the efficacy of antibacterial dishwashing liquid as used by the consumer. in the suspension tests, s. aureus and b. cereus were shown to be susceptible to low concentrations of antibacterial dishwashing liquid (0.5%), whereas e. coli and salmonella enteritidis maintained their initial numbers for at least 24 h at 25 degrees c. at higher concentrations (2 to 4%), all test organisms decreased to below the detection limit after 24 h. over a 24-h period, the antibacterial dishwashing liquid did not significantly reduce these organisms in used sponges in which food residues were present. the antibacterial product did not reduce the competitive microorganisms either. similar results were found for sponges involved in daily household use. the results of this study demonstrate that the antibacterial dishwashing liquid was effective in reducing pathogens in the suspension test but not in the used sponges. this finding indicates that to determine the efficacy of antibacterial products, their use in a household setting must be considered.
an inhibitory factor for cell-free protein synthesis from salmonella enteritidis  exhibits cytopathic activity against chinese hamster ovary cells.
a factor inhibiting cell-free protein synthesis was purified from salmonella enteritidis cell lysate by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatography on anion exchange and hydrophobic interaction columns, and polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. the purified factor, which was named sips (salmonella inhibitor of protein synthesis), inhibited in vitro protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and had a molecular mass of 38 kda, estimated by page under denaturing conditions. sips was also cytopathic for chinese hamster ovary cells. the n-terminal amino acid sequence (20 residues) of sips was found to be identical to that of mature l-asparaginase ii of escherichia coli. indeed, the purified sips exhibited asparaginase activity, e. coli l-asparaginase ii had cytopathic activity and inhibited in vitro protein synthesis. the results suggest that at least a part of cytotoxicity and inhibition of cell-free protein synthesis caused by s. enteritidis is a property of the bacterial l-asparaginase.
emerging food-borne pathogens.
the epidemiology of foodborne diseases is changing. while in many developing nations the efficient treatment of diarrhoeal diseases through oral rehydration has probably led to the prevention of many food related deaths, the underlying problems have not been solved. in these countries, the disease incidence of food-and waterborne disease is still increasing, and now data from other parts of the world indicate that new foodborne pathogens have emerged as important public health problems. over the last two decades, bacterial infections caused by campylobacter and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli have emerged, well-recognized pathogens, such as salmonella eoteritidis, have increased dramatically in disease incidence and important foodborne pathogens have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. the future strategy for prevention of foodborne disease should be founded in scientifically based evaluations of the whole food production chain 'from farm to table', including a description of the most important (risk) factors. epidemiological studies of outbreaks as well as sporadic cases should be aimed at a better understanding of these factors. in terms of public health importance of the problem, the focus should be on the size of the problem, and the potential for improvement. the indications are that both in developed and developing countries there is significant potential for an improvement of the situation. with this aim in mind, international effort should focus on scientific assessments of the potential for risk reduction under different regional conditions.
[comparative study of effects of escherichia coli m-17 exometabolites and fructooligosaccharides on the growth and antagonistic activity of lactobacilli].
facts concerning the evaluation of the influence of e. coli m17 exometabolites and fructooligosaccharides (fos) on the growth and antagonistic activity of lactobacilli are presented. as revealed by these facts, preparation "aktoflor" accelerates the growth of lactobacillary cultures, increases the final yield of biomass and antagonistic activity. e. coli m17 exometabolites contained in "aktoflor" have been shown to be more active in comparison with fos. the character of their influence on lactobacilli is discussed and the conclusion is made that the restoration and maintenance of eubiosis is greatly determined by the pool of metabolites excreted by the bacteria.
[genotoxicity studies of cefmatilen hydrochloride hydrate (s-1090)].
cefmatilen hydrochloride hydrate (s-1090), a new non-ester type of orally active  cephem antibiotic synthesized in shionogi research laboratories, was evaluated for its genotoxic potential using three assay systems. in a reverse mutation test with bacteria of salmonella typhimurium ta100, ta1535, ta98, and ta1537, and escherichia coli wp2uvra using the preincubation method, the number of revertant colonies in the s-1090 treated plates was almost equal to that in the negative control plates in all strains with and without metabolic activation system with s9 mix (maximum dose, 100 micrograms/plate in ta98). in a chromosomal aberration test with cultured chinese hamster lung cells (chl/iu), s-1090 did not induce structural chromosome aberrations or polyploid cells either in the absence or presence of s9 mix up to the 50% growth inhibition doses. the potential of inducing clastogenicity and/or disruption of mitotic apparatus in vivo by s-1090 was evaluated by a micronucleus test with bone marrow cells of male jc1:icr mice. s-1090 suspended in 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose was administered by oral gavage up to 2000 mg/kg/day in single and double dosing groups. no induction of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was observed 24 hr after the last dosing in each group. as all three genotoxicity tests showed negative responses, s-1090 is thought to have no genotoxic potential.
genetic characterization of the klebsiella pneumoniae waa gene cluster, involved  in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
a recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in klebsiella pneumoniae c3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to escherichia coli k-12. the recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coad genes, as was found in e. coli k-12. pcr amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative k. pneumoniae strains. partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. complementation analysis of known waa mutants from e. coli k-12 and/or salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the enterobacteriaceae. k. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. analysis of a constructed k. pneumoniae waae deletion mutant suggests that the waae protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-d-glc to the o-4 position of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose i, a feature shared by k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and yersinia enterocolitica.
enhancement of translation by the epsilon element is independent of the sequence  of the 460 region of 16s rrna.
the epsilon enhancer element is a pyrimidine-rich sequence that increases expression of t7 gene 10 and a number of escherichia coli mrnas during initiation of translation and inhibits expression of the recf mrna during elongation. based on its complementarity to the 460 region of 16s rrna, it has been proposed that epsilon exerts its enhancer activity by base pairing to this complementary rrna sequence. we have tested this model of enhancer action by constructing mutations in the 460 region of 16s rrna and examining expression of epsilon-containing cat reporter genes and recf-lacz fusions in strains expressing the mutant rrnas. replacement of the 460 e.coli stem-loop with that of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium or a stem-loop containing a reversal of all 8 bp in the helical region produced fully functional rrnas with no apparent effect on cell growth or expression of any epsilon-containing mrna. our experiments confirm the reported effects of the epsilon elements on gene expression but show that these effects are independent of the sequence of the 460 region of 16s rrna, indicating that epsilon-rrna base pairing does not occur.
[effect of actoflor preparations on survival of escherichia coli m-17 and salmonella enteritidis under starvation conditions in mixed cultures].
the viability of e. coli m-17 and s. enteritidis under starvation conditions in mono- and mixed cultures was studied. e. coli m-17 showed greater capacity for survival in mixed cultures than in monocultures, while for s. enteritidis the contrary was true. preparations "actoflor" enhanced the antagonistic activity of e. coli m-17, ensuring its absolute selective advantage under starvation conditions in mixed cultures. the role of e. coli m-17 low-molecular exometabolites is discussed; they are probably an important factor in the antagonistic activity of these microorganisms.
a phop/phoq-induced lipase (pagl) that catalyzes 3-o-deacylation of lipid a precursors in membranes of salmonella typhimurium.
pathogenic bacteria modify the structure of the lipid a portion of their lipopolysaccharide in response to environmental changes. some lipid a modifications are important for virulence and resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides. the two-component system phop/phoq plays a central role in regulating lipid a modification. we now report the discovery of a phop/phoq-activated gene (pagl) in salmonella typhimurium, encoding a deacylase that removes the r-3-hydroxymyristate moiety attached at position 3 of certain lipid a precursors. the deacylase gene (pagl) was identified by assaying for loss of deacylase activity in extracts of 14 random tnphoa::pag insertion mutants. the pagl gene encodes a protein of 185 amino acid residues unique to s. typhimurium and closely related organisms such as salmonella typhi. heterologous expression of pagl in escherichia coli on plasmid pwlp21 results in loss of the r-3-hydroxymyristate moiety at position 3 in approximately 90% of the lipid a molecules but does not inhibit cell growth. pagl is synthesized with a 20-amino acid n-terminal signal peptide and is localized mainly in the outer membrane, as judged by assays of separated s. typhimurium membranes and by sds-polyacrylamide gel analysis of membranes from e. coli cells that overexpress pagl. the function of pagl is unknown, given that s. typhimurium mutants lacking pagl display no obvious phenotypes, but pagl might nevertheless play a role in pathogenesis if it serves to modulate the cytokine response of an infected animal host.
comparison between the growth of yersinia enterocolitica, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. in ground beef packed by three commercially used packaging techniques.
growth of the pathogens yersinia enterocolitica, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7 and strains of salmonella were compared in ground beef packed in modified atmospheres of 60% co2/40% n2/0.4% co (high co2/low co mixture), 70% o2/30% co2 (high o2 mixture) and in chub packs (stuffed in plastic casings). the ground beef was inoculated with rifampicin-resistant or nalidixic acid/streptomycin-resistant strains of the pathogens (final concentration 10(2) - 10(3) bacteria/g) and stored at 4 and 10 degrees c for up to 14 days. at 4 degrees c the shelf life, based on colour stability and background flora development, was prolonged for the high co2/low co mixture compared to the two other packaging methods, but at 10 degrees c the shelf life was < 8 days for all the packaging methods. growth of y. enterocolitica was nearly totally inhibited both at 4 and 10 degrees c in the high co2/low co mixture, while the bacterial numbers in the samples packed in the high o2 mixture increased from about 5 x 10(2) bacteria/g at day 0 to about 10(4) at day 5 at 4 degrees c and to 10(5) at 10 degrees c. growth in the chub packs was even higher. l. monocytogenes showed very little growth at 4 degrees c in all treatments. at 10 degrees c there was slow growth from about 5 x 10(3) bacteria/g to about 10(4) at day 5 in the high co2/low co mixture, while the numbers in the high o2 mixture and the chub packs were about 10 times higher. growth of e. coli o157:h7 at 10 degrees c in the ground beef was nearly totally inhibited in both the high co2/low co mixture and the high o2 mixture. growth in the chub packs was higher, as the number of bacteria increased 3 log in 5 days. the salmonella strains (s. typhimurium, s. dublin, s. enteritidis and s. enterica 61:k:1,5,(7)) in the ground beef stored at 10 degrees c for 5 and 7 days grew to a higher number in the high co2/low co mixture than in the high o2 mixture. this study shows that the growth of y. enterocolitica and l. mononcytogenes in ground beef stored in the high co2 /low co mixture was not increased as a result of prolonging the shelf life. however, the observed growth of strains of salmonella at 10 degrees c in this mixture and in chub packs does emphasise the importance of temperature control during storage.
effect of antemortem feeding regimes on bacterial numbers in the stomachs and ceca of pigs.
three groups, each of 45 pigs, were either not fasted, fasted for 15 h during lairage at the abattoir, or fasted for 15 h before dispatch from the piggery to the abattoir. three subgroups, each of 15 pigs from each group, were held at the abattoir for additional times of either 0 to 1 h, 2 to 3 h, or 4 to 5 h. immediately after slaughter, stomach and cecal contents were collected for ph measurement and enumeration of coliforms, escherichia coli biotype 1 and lactic acid bacteria (lab). stomach ph changed from 4.1 to 3.1 as additional abattoir holding time increased from 0 to 1 h to 4 to 5 h but was unaffected by feed withdrawal (mean ph, 3.5). cecal ph (range 6.4 to 7.2) increased in response to both treatments. coliform and e. coli biotype 1 numbers in the stomach, means 4.6 and 4.5 log cfu/g, respectively, were not affected by feed withdrawal but decreased 0.8 log units as additional abattoir holding time increased from 0 to 1 to 4 to 5 h. lab in the stomach decreased in response to both feed withdrawal and holding at the abattoir. cecal numbers of coliforms and e. coli biotype 1 increased 0.8 and 1.0 log units to 7.8 and 7.6 log cfu/g, respectively, as a result of feed withdrawal, and 0.6 log units to 7.6 and 7.5 log cfu/g, respectively, as additional abattoir holding time increased to 4 to 5 h. the lab in the cecum (mean 9.4 log cfu/g) increased slightly with increasing abattoir holding time. in the event of release of stomach or cecal contents onto the meat during carcass dressing, larger numbers of e. coli per g would be released from the ceca and fewer per g from the stomachs of pigs that have had feed withdrawn as compared to pigs not subjected to feed withdrawal.
trfa-dependent inner membrane-associated plasmid rk2 dna synthesis and association of trfa with membranes of different gram-negative hosts.
trfa, the replication initiator protein of broad-host-range plasmid rk2, was tested for its ability to bind to the membrane of four different gram-negative hosts in addition to escherichia coli: pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and rhodobacter sphaeroides. cells harboring trfa-encoding plasmids were fractionated into soluble, inner membrane, and outer membrane fractions. the fractions were subjected to western blotting, and the blots were probed with antibody to the trfa proteins. trfa was found to fractionate with the cell membranes of all species tested. when the two membrane fractions of these species were tested for their ability to synthesize plasmid dna endogenously (i.e., without added template or enzymes), only the inner membrane fraction was capable of extensive synthesis that was inhibited by anti-trfa antibody in a manner similar to that of the original host species, e. coli. in addition, although dna synthesis did occur in the outer membrane fraction, it was much less extensive than that exhibited by the inner membrane fraction and only slightly affected by anti-trfa antibody. plasmid dna synthesized by the inner membrane fraction of one representative species, p. aeruginosa, was characteristic of supercoil and intermediate forms of the plasmid. extensive dna synthesis was observed in the soluble fraction of another representative species, r. sphaeroides, but it was completely unaffected by anti-trfa antibody, suggesting that such synthesis was due to repair and/or nonspecific chain extension of plasmid dna fragments.
a phop-regulated outer membrane protease of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium promotes resistance to alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides.
the outer membrane protein contents of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strains with phop/phoq regulon mutations were compared by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. at least 26 species of outer membrane proteins (omps) were identified as being regulated by phop/phoq activation. one phop/phoq-activated omp was identified by semiautomated tandem mass spectrometry coupled with electronic database searching as pgte, a member of the escherichia coli ompt and yersinia pestis pla family of outer membrane proteases. salmonella pgte expression promoted resistance to alpha-helical cationic antimicrobial peptides (alpha-camps). strains expressing pgte cleaved c18g, an 18-residue alpha-camp present in culture medium, indicating that protease activity is likely to be the mechanism of ompt-mediated resistance to alpha-camps. phop/phoq did not regulate the transcription or export of pgte, indicating that another phop/phoq-dependent mechanism is required for pgte outer membrane localization. pgte is a posttranscriptionally regulated component of the phop/phoq regulon that contributes to salmonella resistance to innate immunity.
adjuvant activity of a nontoxic mutant of escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin on systemic and mucosal immune responses elicited against a heterologous antigen carried by a live salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine strain.
systemic and mucosal antibody responses against both the major subunit of colonization factor antigen i (cfa/i) of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) and the somatic lipopolysaccharide expressed by recombinant bivalent salmonella vaccine strains were significantly enhanced by coadministration of a detoxified derivative with preserved adjuvant effects of the etec heat-labile toxin, lt((r192g)). the results further support the adjuvant effects of lt((r192g)) and represent a simple alternative to improve responses against passenger antigens expressed by orally delivered salmonella vaccine strains.
the nramp proteins of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli are selective manganese transporters involved in the response to reactive oxygen.
nramps (natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins) have been characterized in mammals as divalent transition metal transporters involved in iron metabolism and host resistance to certain pathogens. the mechanism of pathogen resistance is proposed to involve sequestration of fe2+ and mn2+, cofactors of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic catalases and superoxide dismutases, not only to protect the macrophage against its own generation of reactive oxygen species, but to deny the cations to the pathogen for synthesis of its protective enzymes. nramp homologues are also present in bacteria. we report the cloning and characterization of the single nramp genes in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica ssp. typhimurium, and the cloning of two distinct nramp genes from pseudomonas aeruginosa and an internal fragment of an nramp gene in burkholderia cepacia. the genes are designated mnth because the two enterobacterial nramps encode h+-stimulated, highly selective manganese(ii) transport systems, accounting for all mn2+ uptake in each species under the conditions tested. for s. typhimurium mnth, the km for 54mn2+ ( approximately 0.1 microm) was ph independent, but maximal uptake increased as ph decreased. monovalent cations, osmotic strength, mg2+ and ca2+ did not inhibit 54mn2+ uptake. ni2+, cu2+ and zn2+ inhibited uptake with kis greater than 100 microm, co2+ with a ki of 20 microm and fe2+ with a ki that decreased from 100 microm at ph 7. 6 to 10 microm at ph 5.5. fe3+ and pb2+ inhibited weakly, exhibiting kis of 50 microm, while cd2+ was a potent inhibitor with a ki of about 1 microm. e. coli mnth had a similar inhibition profile, except that kis were three- to 10-fold higher. both s. typhimurium and e. coli mnth also transport 55fe2+ however, the kms are equivalent to the kis for fe2+ inhibition of mn2+ uptake, and are thus too high to be physiologically relevant. in both s. typhimurium and e. coli, mnth:lacz constructs were strongly induced by hydrogen peroxide, weakly induced by edta and unresponsive to paraquat, consistent with the presence of fur and oxyr binding sites in the promoters. strains overexpressing mnth were more susceptible to growth inhibition by mn2+ and cd2+ than wild type, and strains lacking a functional mnth gene were more susceptible to killing by hydrogen peroxide. in s. typhimurium strain sl1344, mnth mutants showed no defect in invasion of or survival in cultured hela or raw264.7 macrophage cells; however, expression of mnth:lacz was induced severalfold by 3 h after invasion of the macrophages. s. typhimurium mnth mutants showed only a slight attenuation of virulence in balb/c mice. thus, the nramp mn2+ transporter mnth and mn2+ play a role in bacterial response to reactive oxygen species and possibly have a role in pathogenesis.
evidence for active efflux as the primary mechanism of resistance to ciprofloxacin in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
the occurrence of active efflux and cell wall modifications were studied in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium mutants that were selected with enrofloxacin and whose phenotypes of resistance to fluoroquinolones could not be explained only by mutations in the genes coding for gyrase or topoisomerase iv. mutant bn18/21 exhibited a decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (mic = 0.125 microg/ml) but did not have a mutation in the gyra gene. mutants bn18/41 and bn18/71 had the same substitution, gly81cys in gyra, but exhibited different levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin (mics = 2 and 8 microg/ml, respectively). none of the mutants had mutations in the parc gene. evidence for active efflux was provided by a classical fluorimetric method, which revealed a three- to fourfold decrease in ciprofloxacin accumulation in the three mutants compared to that in the parent strain, which was annulled by addition of the efflux pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. in mutant bn18/71, a second fluorimetric method also showed a 50% reduction in the level of accumulation of ethidium bromide, a known efflux pump substrate. immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments with an anti-acra antibody revealed that the resistance phenotype was strongly correlated with the expression level of the acrab efflux pump and suggested that decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin due to active efflux probably related to overproduction of this pump could occur before that due to gyra mutations. alterations were also found in the outer membrane protein and lipopolysaccharide profiles of the mutants, and these alterations were possibly responsible for the decrease in the permeability of the outer membrane that was observed in the mutants and that could act synergistically with active efflux to decrease the level of ciprofloxacin accumulation.
activity of hydrolysed lactoferrin against foodborne pathogenic bacteria in growth media: the effect of edta.
lactoferrin was hydrolysed with pepsin and the antimicrobial activity of the resulting hydrolysate (hlf) was studied in 1% peptone, 0.05% yeast extract, 1% glucose (pyg) medium and tryptic soy broth (tsb). hlf was effective against listeria monocytogenes, enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis in pyg, however, the highest studied concentration (1.6 mg ml-1) did not inhibit growth of any of these organisms in tsb. the addition of edta enhanced the activity of hlf in tsb, indicating that the decreased activity of hlf may have been due, in part, to excess cations in the medium.
inhibition of pathogenic salmonella enteritidis growth mediated by escherichia coli microcin j25 producing strains.
for the first time, microcin-producing strains showing inhibitory activities against enteropathogen salmonella enteritidis were isolated from poultry intestinal contents. among the numerous strains isolated, two strains of escherichia coli, named j02 and j03, showing the greatest activities against s. enteritidis, were studied. biochemical tests and purification identified the main antagonist compound produced as microcin j25. in order to evaluate the protective potential of e. coli j02 and j03 against s. enteritidis infection, the ability of these strains to inhibit growth of s. enteritidis was investigated in mixed culture. a strong antagonist activity was obtained with a preculture phase of the active strain in minimal medium before incubation with s. enteritidis. in a bioreactor experiment simulating the chicken gastric and intestinal tract environment, a mixture of the two strains e. coli j02 and j03, provided an enhanced inhibitory effect. microcinogenic strain activities were not affected by bile, pancreatic enzymes addition, or acidic conditions. these results suggest the relevant role of microcin-producing microorganisms in microbial intestinal ecology. to conclude, this study shows that microcin j25 strains could exert a beneficial protective effect against s. enteritidis growth in situ.
neutralization of il-18 reduces neutrophil tissue accumulation and protects mice  against lethal escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium endotoxemia.
in addition to stimulating ifn-gamma synthesis, il-18 also possesses inflammatory effects by inducing synthesis of the proinflammatory cytokines tnf and il-1beta and the chemokines il-8 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha. we hypothesized that neutralization of il-18 would have a beneficial effect in lethal endotoxemia in mice. il-1beta converting enzyme (ice)-deficient mice, lacking the ability to process mature il-18 and il-1beta, were completely resistant to lethal endotoxemia induced by lps derived from either escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium. in contrast, both wild-type and il-1beta-/- mice were equally susceptible to the lethal effects of lps, implicating that absence of mature il-18 or ifn-gamma but not il-1beta in ice-/- mice is responsible for this resistance. however, ifn-gamma-deficient mice were not resistant to s. typhimurium lps, suggesting an ifn-gamma-independent role for il-18. anti-il-18 abs protected mice against a lethal injection of either lps. anti-il-18 treatment also reduced neutrophil accumulation in liver and lungs. the increased survival was accompanied by decreased levels of ifn-gamma and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 in anti-il-18-treated animals challenged with e. coli lps, whereas ifn-gamma and tnf concentrations were decreased in treated mice challenged with s. typhimurium. in conclusion, neutralization of il-18 during lethal endotoxemia protects mice against lethal effects of lps. this protection is partly mediated through inhibition of ifn-gamma production, but mechanisms involving decreased neutrophil-mediated tissue damage due to the reduction of either chemokines (e. coli lps) or tnf (s. typhimurium lps) synthesis by anti-il-18 treatment may also be involved.
effect of chelators and nisin produced in situ on inhibition and inactivation of  gram negatives.
the ability of chelators and nisin generated in situ to inhibit and inactivate e. coli and other gram negatives in a model substrate was investigated. the effect of various chelators and different concentrations of exogenous nisin on inhibition of e. coli in broth medium showed that only edta and pyrophosphates were able to cause appreciable inhibition of e. coli by nisin. in a broth where l. lactis ncfb 497 produced nisin in a concentration of 250-300 iu/ml, pyrophosphates were unable to inactivate e. coli. under the same conditions, addition of edta led to inactivation of e. coli at neutral and slightly acidic ph only. a cocktail of strains of e. coli was less sensitive than e. coli atcc 25922 alone. pseudomonas aeruginosa was more sensitive and salmonellae more resistant. edta also caused a slight reduction in the l. lactis population and its biochemical activity as regards ph drop and acid production. some of the inhibition of e. coli could be ascribed to the physical presence of lactococcus cells rather than their metabolites excreted into the medium. failure to observe any inhibition in fermented broths at their natural ph (4.0) was ascribed to the poor chelating power of edta under acid conditions.
effect of the raw extract of arthrinium strains (hyphomycetes, dematiaceae) on the growth of pathogenic bacteria in poultry feed.
poultry feed contains a significant reservoir of bacteria and is a possible source of salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, which can potentially infect farm animals and humans. the objective of this study was to determine whether the extract obtained from the culture of some arthrinium species was able to inhibit the growth of these bacteria. the results obtained showed that the raw extracts of arthrinium aureum, arthrinium serenensis and arthrinium phaeospermum inhibited the growth of escherichia coli in poultry feed. in some cases the percentage inhibition of the growth of escherichia coli was > 80%. with the raw extract of arthrinium in poultry feed, the rate of growth of s. typhimurium fell to between 50% and 80%. the raw extract of a. serenensis had the lowest inhibitory activity. s. aureus counts were not affected by any arthrinium raw extracts.
intestinal colonisation of gnotobiotic pigs by salmonella organisms: interaction  between isogenic and unrelated strains.
the effect of intestinal colonisation by a salmonella strain on the establishment in the gut of an isogenic mutant administered orally 24 h after the first strain was studied in gnotobiotic pigs. irrespective of the clinical outcome of the infection, the extensive colonisation of one salmonella strain prevented a similar degree of colonisation by an otherwise isogenic antibiotic resistant strain; in some cases the second strain was hardly detectable. the poor colonisation of the challenge salmonella strains was generally reflected in very low counts of organisms in the tissues. colonisation by a strain of escherichia coli reduced the rate of establishment of an isogenic e. coli, strain but did not prevent colonisation by an s. typhimurium strain. s. typhimurium with mutations in the tsr (serine chemotaxis receptor protein) or oxra (transcriptional regulator of anaerobic metabolism) genes did not inhibit colonisation. mutations in cya (adenylate cyclase), tar and trg (chemotaxis receptor proteins for aspartate and ribose respectively) genes were less inhibitory, while motb (non-motile) and cher (impaired motility) mutants were fully inhibitory.
effect of diacetyl on controlling escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium in the presence of starter culture in a laboratory medium and during meat fermentation.
diacetyl is a flavor compound that possesses antimicrobial activity and is found  in several dairy products. the effect of diacetyl on controlling the growth of two foodborne pathogens, escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium, when grown with pediococcus acidilactici as a meat starter culture was evaluated in a laboratory medium and during salami fermentation. diacetyl (50 ppm) added to each mixed culture system strongly inhibited the growth of e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium in the laboratory medium (brain heart infusion, 2.3% of nacl, 0.75% of dextrose) (p < 0.05). during meat fermentation, the growth of e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium was inhibited significantly by addition of diacetyl (300 ppm) (p < 0.05) after 24 h fermentation. however, the acid production and growth of p. acidilactici were not affected by the addition of diacetyl (p > 0.05). after 24 h meat fermentation, about a 1.0-log cfu/g difference occurred in numbers of each foodborne pathogen mixed with p. acidilactici (p < 0.05) with and without 300 ppm diacetyl. diacetyl and the acid produced by the meat starter culture reduced the growth of the two foodborne pathogens during salami fermentation. these results suggest that diacetyl can be used as a food ingredient during meat fermentation to control e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium without harmful effects on the growth and acid production of p. acidilactici.
resistance of escherichia coli and salmonella against nisin and curvacin a.
we have determined the effects of the following factors on the resistance of gram-negative bacteria against nisin and curvacin a: (i) chemotype of the lipopolysaccharide (lps), (ii) addition of agents permeabilizing the outer membrane, (iii) the fatty acid supply of the growth medium, and (iv) the adaptation to acid and salt stress. bacteriocin activity was determined against growing and resting cells as well as protoplasts. all smooth strains of escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium were highly resistant towards the bacteriocins, whereas mutants that possess the core of the lps, but not the o antigen, as well as deep rough lps mutants were sensitive. antibiotics with outer membrane permeabilizing activity, polymyxin b and polymyxin b nonapeptide, increased the sensitivity of smooth e. coli towards nisin, but not that of deep rough mutants. incorporation of 1 g l(-1) of either oleic acid or linoleic acid to the growth media greatly increased the susceptibility of e. coli lth1600 and lth4346 towards bacteriocins. both strains of e. coli were sensitive to nisin and curvacin a at a ph of less than 5.5 and more than 3% (w/v) nacl. adaptation to sublethal ph or higher nacl concentrations (ph 4.54 and 5.35 or 4.5% (w/v) nacl) provided only limited protection against the bacteriocidal activity of nisin and curvacin a. adaptation to 4.5% (w/v) nacl did not result in cross protection to bacteriocin activity at ph 4.4, but rendered the cells more sensitive towards bacteriocins.
development of a rapid response biosensor for detection of salmonella typhimurium.
an integrated optic interferometer for detecting foodborne pathogens was developed. the interferometer is a planar waveguide with two thin antibody-coated channels of immunochemically selective agents that interact with antigen molecules. one channel is coated with antibody to salmonella as a sample, and the other is coated with human immunoglobulin g as a reference channel by using reductive amination. salmonella was introduced onto the sensing channels through the flow cell on the channels. phase shift (pi) generated by refractive index variation, as determined by interfering the perturbed sample channel with an unperturbed reference channel and observing the fringe shift, was used for detection. salmonella typhimurium (heat-treated or boiled) was detected by binding to antibody against salmonella common structural antigen immobilized on a silane-derived sensor surface at concentrations in the range of 1x10(5) to 1x10(7) cfu/ml. salmonella (1x10(7) cfu/ml) mixed with escherichia coli (1x10(7) cfu/ml) were readily detected without any decrease in sensitivity by the direct assay. application of a sandwich assay with a second antibody or a gold-conjugated antibody increased the detection limit to 1x10(5) cfu/ml within a 10-min reaction time. various methods for the immobilization of the capture antibody to the biosensor channels were compared. the greatest binding response was observed in a direct reductive amination method with a long reaction period and increased the detection limit of direct binding of salmonella antigen to 1x10(4) cfu/ml. the biosensor was able to detect salmonella typhimurium in chicken carcass wash fluid originally inoculated at a level of 20 cfu/ml after 12 h of nonselective enrichment. the planar optic biosensor shows promise as a fast, sensitive, reliable, and economical means of detecting food pathogens in the future.
cloning, sequence analyses, expression, and distribution of ampc-ampr from morganella morganii clinical isolates.
shotgun cloning experiments with restriction enzyme-digested genomic dna from morganella morganii 1, which expresses high levels of cephalosporinase, into the pbkcmv cloning vector gave a recombinant plasmid, ppon-1, which encoded four entire genes: ampc, ampr, an hybf family gene, and orf-1 of unknown function. the deduced ampc beta-lactamase of pi 7.6 shared structural and functional homologies with ampc from citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, enterobacter cloacae, and serratia marcescens. the overlapping promoter organization of ampc and ampr, although much shorter in m. morganii than in the other enterobacterial species, suggested similar ampr regulatory properties. the mics of beta-lactams for e. coli mc4100 (ampc mutant) harboring recombinant plasmid pacyc184 containing either ampc and ampr (pac-1) or ampc (pac-2) and induction experiments showed that the ampc gene of m. morganii 1 was repressed in the presence of ampr and was activated when a beta-lactam inducer was added. moreover, transformation of m. morganii 1 or of e. coli jrg582 (delta ampde) harboring ampc and ampr with a recombinant plasmid containing ampd from e. cloacae resulted in a decrease in the beta-lactam mics and an inducible phenotype for m. morganii 1, thus underlining the role of an ampd-like protein in the regulation of the m. morganii cephalosporinase. fifteen other m. morganii clinical isolates with phenotypes of either low-level inducible cephalosporinase expression or high-level constitutive cephalosporinase expression harbored the same ampc-ampr organization, with the hybf and orf-1 genes surrounding them; the organization of these genes thus differed from those of ampc-ampr genes in c. freundii and e. cloacae, which are located downstream from the fumarate operon. finally, an identical ampc beta-lactamase (dha-1) was recently identified as being plasmid encoded in salmonella enteritidis, and this is confirmatory evidence of a chromosomal origin of the plasmid-mediated cephalosporinases.
comparative survival of salmonella typhimurium dt 104, listeria monocytogenes, and escherichia coli o157:h7 in preservative-free apple cider and simulated gastric fluid.
this study compared the survival of three-strain mixtures (ca. 10(7) cfu ml(-1) each) of salmonella typhimurium dt104, listeria monocytogenes, and escherichia coli o157:h7 in pasteurized and unpasteurized preservative-free apple cider (ph 3.3-3.5) during storage at 4 and 10 degrees c for up to 21 days. s. typhimurium dt104 populations decreased by <4.5 log10 cfu ml(-1) during 14 days storage at 4 and 10 degrees c in pasteurized cider, and by > or =5.5 log10 cfu ml(-1) during 14 days in unpasteurized cider stored at these temperatures. however, after 7 days at 4 degrees c, the s. typhimurium dt104 populations had decreased by only about 2.5 log10 cfu ml(-1) in both pasteurized and unpasteurized cider. listeria monocytogenes populations decreased below the plating detection limit (10 cfu ml(-1)) within 2 days under all conditions tested. survival of e. coli o157:h7 was similar to that of s. typhimurium dt104 in pasteurized cider at both 4 and 10 degrees c over the 21-days storage period, but e. coli o157:h7 survived better (ca. 5.0 log10 cfu ml(-1) decrease) than s. typhimurium dt104 (> 7.0 log10 cfu ml(-1) decrease) after 14 days at 4 degrees c in unpasteurized cider. in related experiments, when incubated in simulated gastric fluid (ph 1.5) at 37 degrees c, s. typhimurium dt104 and l. monocytogenes were eliminated (5.5-6.0 log10 cfu ml(-1) decrease) within 5 and 30 min, respectively, whereas e. coli o157:h7 concentrations decreased only 1.60-2.80 log10 cfu ml(-1) within 2 h.
biological properties of structurally related alpha-helical cationic antimicrobial peptides.
a series of alpha-helical cationic antimicrobial peptide variants with small amino acid changes was designed. alterations in the charge, hydrophobicity, or length of the variant peptides did not improve the antimicrobial activity, and there was no statistically significant correlation between any of these factors and the mic for pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, or salmonella typhimurium. individual peptides demonstrated synergy with conventional antibiotics against antibiotic-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa. the peptides varied considerably in the ability to bind e. coli o111:b4 lipopolysaccharide (lps), and this correlated significantly with their antimicrobial activity and ability to block lps-stimulated tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 production. in general, the peptides studied here demonstrated a broad range of activities, including antimicrobial, antiendotoxin, and enhancer activities.
destruction of salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7 and listeria monocytogenes in chicken manure by drying and/or gassing with ammonia.
escherichia coli o157:h7 and listeria monocytogenes were able to grow for a period of 2 days in fresh chicken manure at 20 degrees c with a resulting 1-2 log units increase in cfu; salmonella typhimurium remained stable. prolongation of the storage time to 6 days resulted in a 1-2 log decreases of s. typhimurium compared to the initial count and a 3-4 log decrease of e. coli o157:h7; the number of l. monocytogenes did not decrease below the initial. these changes were accompanied by an increase in ph and accumulation of ammonia in the manure. the destruction of the three microorganisms was greatly increased by drying the manure to a moisture content of 10% followed by exposure to ammonia gas in an amount of 1% of the manure wet weight; s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 were reduced by 8 log units, l. monocytogenes by 4.
phenotype of mice and macrophages deficient in both phagocyte oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase.
the two genetically established antimicrobial mechanisms of macrophages are production of reactive oxygen intermediates by phagocyte oxidase (phox) and reactive nitrogen intermediates by inducible nitric oxide synthase (nos2). mice doubly deficient in both enzymes (gp91(phox-/-)/nos2(-/-)) formed massive abscesses containing commensal organisms, mostly enteric bacteria, even when reared under specific pathogen-free conditions with antibiotics. neither parental strain showed such infections. thus, phox and nos2 appear to compensate for each other's deficiency in providing resistance to indigenous bacteria, and no other pathway does so fully. macrophages from gp91(phox-/-)/nos2(-/-) mice could not kill virulent listeria. their killing of s. typhimurium, e. coli, and attenuated listeria was markedly diminished but demonstrable, establishing the existence of a mechanism of macrophage antibacterial activity independent of phox and nos2.
[hydrogen peroxide modulates intracellular levels of thiols and potassium in escherichia coli cells].
exposure of growing escherichia coli k12 cells to 2.0-11.0 mm h2o2 resulted in an increase in the intracellular level of low-molecular-weight thiols (lmwt), whereas exposure to 25 mm h2o2 resulted in its decrease. an inverse correlation between levels of lmwt and potassium was revealed. the treatment of e. coli delta oxyr cells, which are incapable of the adaptive response to h2o2, with 10 mm h2o2 caused a decrease in the lmwt level. in e. coli oxyr2 cells, which constitutively express oxyr-controlled proteins, the same treatment caused a 20% increase in the lmwt level. in response to treatment with the oxidant, delta oxyr mutants lost two times more potassium than wild-type cells (oxyr+). a time course study of the levels of lmwt and potassium in mutants with an affected katg gene, which encodes the hpi catalase and is under the control of oxyr, showed that oxyr may regulate lmwt and potassium levels indirectly, through the regulation of catalase activity. a relationship between catalase activity and the lmwt level was revealed in hydrogen peroxide-treated e. coli cells.
salmonella invg forms a ring-like multimer that requires the invh lipoprotein for outer membrane localization.
salmonella species translocate virulence effector proteins from the bacterial cytoplasm into mammalian host cells by means of a type iii secretion apparatus, encoded by the pathogenicity island-1 (spi-1). little is known about the assembly and structure of this secretion apparatus, but the invg protein is essential and could be an outer membrane secretion channel for the effector proteins. we observed that in recombinant escherichia coli, the yield of invg was enhanced by co-expression of invh, and showed that mutation of invh decreased the level of invg in wild-type salmonella typhimurium. in e. coli, invg alone was able to form an sds-resistant multimer, but invg localization to the outer membrane was dependent upon invh, a lipoprotein itself located in the outer membrane, and no other spi-1 specific protein. invg targeted to the outer membrane by invh became accessible to extracellular protease. invg and invh did not, however, appear to form a stable complex. electron microscopy of invg membrane protein purified from e. coli revealed that it forms an oligomeric ring-like structure with inner and outer diameters, 7 nm and 15 nm respectively.
salmonella enteritidis: ampc plasmid-mediated inducible beta-lactamase (dha-1) with an ampr gene from morganella morganii.
dha-1, a plasmid-mediated cephalosporinase from a single clinical salmonella enteritidis isolate, conferred resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins (cefotaxime and ceftazidime) and cephamycins (cefoxitin and moxalactam), and this resistance was transferable to escherichia coli hb101. an antagonism was observed between cefoxitin and aztreonam by the diffusion method. transformation of the transconjugant e. coli strain with plasmid pnh5 carrying the ampd gene (whose product decreases the level of expression of ampc) resulted in an eightfold decrease in the mic of cefoxitin. a clone with the same ampc susceptibility pattern with antagonism was obtained, clone e. coli jm101(psal2-ind), and its nucleotide sequence was determined. it contained an open reading frame with 98. 7% dna sequence identity with the ampc gene of morganella morganii. dna sequence analysis also identified a gene upstream of ampc whose sequence was 97% identical to the partial sequence of the ampr gene (435 bp) from m. morganii. the gene encoded a protein with an amino-terminal dna-binding domain typical of transcriptional activators of the lysr family. moreover, the intercistronic region between the ampc and ampr genes was 98% identical to the corresponding region from m. morganii dna. ampr was shown to be functional by enzyme induction and a gel mobility-shift assay. an ampg gene was also detected in a southern blot of dna from the s. enteritidis isolate. these findings suggest that this inducible plasmid-mediated ampc type beta-lactamase, dha-1, probably originated from m. morganii.
characterization of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed at the lipopolysaccharide of chlamydia pneumoniae.
identification of protective epitopes is one of the first steps in the development of a subunit vaccine. one approach to accomplishing this is to identify structures or epitopes by using monoclonal antibodies (mab) that can attenuate infectivity in vitro and in vivo. to date attempts to use this approach with chlamydia pneumoniae have failed. this report is the first description of a mab directed to the lipopolysaccharide (lps) of chlamydia that neutralizes both in vitro and in vivo the infectivity of c. pneumoniae. mab cp-33, an immunoglobulin g2b (igg2b), was identified from a fusion using splenocytes from mice immunized with c. pneumoniae tw-183. by western blot analysis, mab cp-33 exhibited genus-specific reactivity in that it recognized the lpss of c. pneumoniae, chlamydia trachomatis, and chlamydia psittaci. mab cp-33 did not react with 15 genera of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and candida albicans. by using isolated lps of re mutants of escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar minnesota, and recombinants expressing the 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (kdo) transferase gene kdta of c. trachomatis, mab cp-33 was shown to require for binding the presence of the genus-specific trisaccharide epitope alphakdo(2-->8)alphakdo(2-->4)alphakdo. by employing synthetic oligosaccharides and neoglycoconjugates in an enzyme immunoassay (eia) and eia inhibition, it was further shown that mab cp-33 differed from the extensively investigated prototype chlamydial lps mab s25-23. most likely, mab cp-33 recognizes a conformational epitope in which the alphakdo(2-->8)alphakdo(2-->4)alphakdo trisaccharide is an essential structural component. when tested in an in vitro neutralization assay, mab cp-33 gave a 50% neutralization titer of 8 ng/ml against c. pneumoniae tw-183. however, this mab did not neutralize other c. pneumoniae strains, c. trachomatis, or c. psittaci. c. pneumoniae tw-183 was treated with either mab cp-33 or a control igg and then used to inoculate mice by the respiratory route. five days after inoculation, there was a difference between the mice inoculated with the control igg-treated inoculum and those inoculated with the mab cp-33-treated organisms as to the number of mice infected as well as the number of inclusion-forming units recovered from lung cultures (p < 0.05). in summary, a chlamydia-specific lps mab was able to neutralize in vitro the infectivity of c. pneumoniae tw-183.
catalytic defects in mutants of class ii histidyl-trna synthetase from salmonella typhimurium previously linked to decreased control of histidine biosynthesis regulation.
the expression of histidine biosynthetic genes in enteric bacteria is regulated by an attenuation mechanism in which the level of histidyl-trna serves as a key sensor of the intracellular histidine pool. among the early observations that led to the formation of this model for salmonella typhimurium were the identification of mutants in the gene (hiss) encoding histidyl-trna synthetase. we report here the detailed biochemical characterization of five of these s. typhimurium bradytrophic mutants isolated by selection for resistance to histidine analogs, including identification of the deduced amino acid substitutions and determination of the resulting effects on the kinetics of adenylation and aminoacylation. using the crystal structure of the closely related escherichia coli histidyl-trna synthetase (hisrs) as a guide, two mutants were mapped to a highly conserved proline residue in motif 2 (p117s, p117q), and were correlated with a fivefold decrease in the kcat for the pyrophosphate exchange reaction, as well as a tenfold increase in the km for trna in the aminoacylation reaction. another mutant substitution (a302t) mapped to a residue adjacent to the histidine binding pocket, leading to a tenfold increase in km for histidine in the pyrophosphate exchange reaction. the remaining two mutants (s167f, n254t) substitute residues in or directly adjacent to the hinge region, which joins the insertion domain between motif 2 and motif 3 to the catalytic core, and cause the km for trna to increase four- to tenfold. the kinetic analysis of these mutants establishes a direct link between critical interactions within the active site of hisrs and regulation of histidine biosynthesis, and provides further evidence for the importance of local conformational changes during the catalytic cycle.
physical limitations on salmonella typhi entry into cultured human intestinal epithelial cells.
kinetic studies of salmonella typhi invasion of int407 cells at different multiplicities of infection (mois) have revealed a strict physical limitation on s. typhi entry at mois of >/=40. staining of infected monolayers to distinguish intracellular from extracellular bacteria revealed that all monolayer cells are susceptible to infection and that internalized bacteria are typically contained in one to three separate clusters per cell during the first 60 min. scanning and transmission electron microscopic analyses of time course-infected monolayers showed that at early times postinfection, bacteria bind to shortened, coalesced microvilli in one to three focal aggregate structures per host cell surface. as reported previously for s. typhimurium, focal aggregates progress to conical membrane ruffles that appear to engulf one or a few centrally contained s. typhi cells by a macropinocytic process, which enhanced the entry of simultaneously added escherichia coli hb101 about 30-fold. additionally, kinetic studies showed that at an moi of approximately 400, maximal s. typhi entry is virtually completed within 30 to 35 min. monolayers pretreated with s. typhi for 30 min to saturate the entry process were severely reduced in the ability to internalize subsequently added kanamycin-resistant strains of s. typhi or s. typhimurium, but e. coli hb101(pri203) expressing the cloned yersinia inv gene was not reduced in entry. in invasion inhibition assays, anti-beta1 integrin antibodies markedly reduced e. coli hb101(pri203) invasion efficiency but did not reduce s. typhi entry. collectively, these data provide direct physical and visual evidence which indicates that s. typhi organisms are internalized at a limited number (i.e., two to four) of sites on host cells. s. typhi and s. typhimurium likely share int407 cell entry receptors which do not appear to be members of the beta1 integrin superfamily.
effects of bicyclomycin on rna- and atp-binding activities of transcription termination factor rho.
bicyclomycin is a commercially important antibiotic that has been shown to be effective against many gram-negative bacteria. genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that the antibiotic interferes with rna metabolism in escherichia coli by inhibiting the activity of transcription termination factor rho. however, the precise mechanism of inhibition is not completely known. in this study we have used in vitro transcription assays to analyze the effects of bicyclomycin on the termination step of transcription. the rho-dependent transcription termination region located within the hisg cistron of salmonella typhimurium has been used as an experimental system. the possible interference of the antibiotic with the various functions of factor rho, such as rna binding at the primary site, atp binding, and hexamer formation, has been investigated by rna gel mobility shift, photochemical cross-linking, and gel filtration experiments. the results of these studies demonstrate that bicyclomycin does not interfere with the binding of rho to the loading site on nascent rna. binding of the factor to atp is not impeded, on the contrary, the antibiotic appears to decrease the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for atp in photochemical cross-linking experiments. the available evidence suggests that this decrease might be due to an interference with the correct positioning of atp within the nucleotide-binding pocket leading b an inherent block of atp hydrolysis. possibly, as a consequence of this interference, the antibiotic also prevents atp-dependent stabilization of rho hexamers.
prevalence of the "high-pathogenicity island" of yersinia species among escherichia coli strains that are pathogenic to humans.
the fyua-irp gene cluster contributes to the virulence of highly pathogenic yersinia (yersinia pestis, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and yersinia enterocolitica 1b). the cluster encodes an iron uptake system mediated by the siderophore yersiniabactin and reveals features of a pathogenicity island. two evolutionary lineages of this "high pathogenicity island" (hpi) can be distinguished on the basis of dna sequence comparison: a y. pestis group and a y. enterocolitica group. in this study we demonstrate that the hpi of the y. pestis evolutionary group is disseminated among species of the family enterobacteriaceae which are pathogenic to humans. it prevails in enteroaggregative escherichia coli and in e. coli blood culture isolates (93 and 80%, respectively), but is rarely found in enteropathogenic e. coli, enteroinvasive e. coli, and enterotoxigenic e. coli isolates. in contrast, the hpi was absent from enterohemorrhagic e. coli, shigella, and salmonella enterica strains investigated. polypeptides encoded by the fyua, irp1, and irp2 genes located on the hpi could be detected in e. coli strains pathogenic to humans. however, these e. coli strains showed a reduced sensitivity to the bacteriocin pesticin, whose uptake is mediated by the fyua receptor. escherichia strains do not possess the hms gene locus thought to be a part of the hpi of y. pestis. deletions of the jua-irp gene cluster affecting solely the fyua part of the hpi were identified in 3% of the e. coli strains tested. these results suggest horizontal transfer of the hpi between y. pestis and some pathogenic e. coli strains.
organotin complexes with pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde monoacylhydrazones. synthesis,  spectroscopic properties, antimicrobial activity, and genotoxicity.
a series of organotin complexes with pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde 2-hydroxybenzoylhydrazone (h3mfps) and pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde 2-picolinoylhydrazone (h2mfpp) was investigated. the ir, 1h, and 119sn nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic characterization of all the compounds is reported and discussed in connection with the ligand behaviour of the hydrazone and the structure of the organotin complex. complexes exhibit antibacterial properties higher than those of the corresponding ligands but they turn out to be less potent than the parent organotin compounds. sn(h3mfps) (c6h5)2cl2.2h2o and sn(hmfpp)(n-c4h9)2cl are the most active antibacterial compounds showing mic values between 3-6 micrograms/ml against bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus and between 6-25 micrograms/ml against escherichia coli; the first compound also strongly inhibits the growth of aspergillus niger. all the ligands and complexes are devoid of dna-damaging activity in the bacillus subtilis rec-assay. h2mfpp and its complexes sn(hmfpp)(c2h5)2cl and sn3(hmfpp)(mfpp) (c6h5)3cl6 are shown by the salmonella-microsome assay to be mutagenic substances in the presence of a metabolic activation system. the obtained results are discussed on the basis of structure-activity relationships.
carbon starvation of salmonella typhimurium does not cause a general increase of  mutation rates.
mutation rates in bacteria can vary depending on the genetic target studied and the specific growth conditions of the cells. here, two different methods were used to determine how rates of mutation to antibiotic resistance, auxotrophy, and prototrophy were influenced by carbon starvation on agar plates. the rate of mutation to rifampin resistance was increased by starvation as measured by fluctuation tests, similar to what has been reported previously for escherichia coli. in contrast, the rates of mutation to various types of auxotrophy were unaffected or decreased as measured by both fluctuation tests and a repeated-streaking procedure. similarly, the rates of reversion to prototrophy of his and lac nonsense and missense mutations were unaffected by starvation. thus, mutation rates of different genetic targets can be affected differently by starvation and we conclude that carbon starvation is not generally mutagenic in salmonella typhimurium.
comparative genotoxicity of halogenated acetic acids found in drinking water.
three short-term assays (sos chromotest, ames fluctuation test and newt micronucleus test) were performed to detect the genotoxic activity of organohalides, compounds likely to be found in chlorinated and/or ozonated drinking water: monochloro-, dichloro- and trichloroacetic acids and monobromo-, dibromo- and tribromoacetic acids. with the sos chromotest, only three of the chemicals studied (dichloroacetic acid, dibromo- and tribromoacetic acids) were found to induce primary dna damage in escherichia coli pq 37. in the ames fluctuation test, all the compounds except monochloroacetic acid showed mutagenic activity in salmonella typhimurium strain ta100. in these two in vitro tests, a good correlation between increasing number of substituents and decreasing mutagenicity was observed. namely, the toxicity of brominated and chlorinated acetic acids decreased when the number of substituents increased. the newt micronucleus test detected a weak clastogenic effect on the peripheral blood erythrocytes of pleurodeles waltl larvae for trichloroacetic acid only.
genotoxic effects of three fusarium mycotoxins, fumonisin b1, moniliformin and vomitoxin in bacteria and in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes.
the genotoxic effects of three widespread fusarium toxins, vomitoxin (vom), moniliformin (mon) and fumonisin b1 (fb1) were investigated in bacterial tests and in micronucleus (mn) and chromosomal aberration (ca) assays with primary rat hepatocytes. all three toxins were devoid of activity in gene mutation assays with salmonella typhimurium strains ta98 and ta100 and in sos chromotests with e. coli strain pq37 in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. fb1 and vom gave negative results in differential dna repair assays with e. coli k-12 strains (343/753, uvrb/reca and 343/765, uvr+/rec+); with mon, a marginal effect was seen in the absence of metabolic activation mix at relatively high concentrations (> or = 55 micrograms/ml). in metabolically competent rat hepatocytes stimulated to proliferate with egf and subphysiological ca2+ concentrations, a decrease of cell division was observed with all three toxins at concentrations > or = 10 micrograms/ml, vom was strongly cytotoxic at 100 micrograms/ml. all three mycotoxins caused moderate increases of the mn frequencies at low concentrations (< or = 1 microgram/ml), but no clear dose-response effects were seen and at higher exposure levels the mn frequencies declined. in the ca experiments with hepatocytes, pronounced dose-dependent effects were observed with all three toxins. mon caused a 9-fold increase over the spontaneous background level after exposure of the cells to 1 microgram/ml for 3 h, with fb1 and vom, the increases were 6- to 7-fold under identical experimental conditions. this is the first report on clastogenic effects of vom and fb1 in mammalian cells, with mon induction of cas in v-79 cells has been described earlier. since all three mycotoxins caused cas at very low concentration levels in liver cells in vitro, it is possible that such effects may also occur in humans and mammals upon consumption of fusarium-infected cereals.
antibacterial effect of the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb.
the spent culture supernatant of the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. it decreased the in vitro viability of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp. in contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. the antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. activity against s. typhimurium sl1344 infecting human cultured intestinal caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional c3h/he/oujco mouse model with s. typhimurium c5 infection and oral treatment with the lb spent culture supernatant.
molecular characterization of a large borrelia burgdorferi motility operon which  is initiated by a consensus sigma70 promoter.
a large motility operon, referred to as the flgb operon, was identified, characterized, and mapped at 310 to 320 kb on the linear chromosome of the spirochete borrelia burgdorferi. this is the first report that a sigma70-like promoter rather than a sigma28-like promoter is involved in the transcription of a major motility operon in bacteria. from these results in conjunction with results from a previous study (y. ge and n. w. charon, gene, in press), we have identified 26 genes in this operon that are relevant to motility and flagellar synthesis. with few exceptions, the gene order and deduced gene products were most similar to those of other spirochetes and bacillus subtilis. primer extension analysis indicated that transcription initiated from a conserved sigma70-like promoter immediately upstream of flgb; this promoter mapped within the heat-shock-induced protease gene hslu. reverse transcriptase pcr analysis indicated that a single transcript of 21 kb initiated at this promoter and extended through flge and (with our previous results) onto the putative motility gene flbe. the flgb promoter element had strong activity in both escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. as expected, a mutant of s. typhimurium with an inactivated flagellum-specific sigma28 factor did not affect the function of this promoter. western blot analysis indicated that b. burgdorferi recombinant flig and flii were antigenically similar to those of e. coli and other spirochetes. although complementation of e. coli or s. typhimurium flig or flii mutants with the b. burgdorferi genes was unsuccessful, b. burgdorferi recombinant flii completely inhibited flagellar synthesis and motility of wild-type e. coli and s. typhimurium. these results show that spirochete motility genes can influence flagellar synthesis in other species of bacteria. finally, western blot analysis with sera from infected humans and animals indicated a weak or nondetectable response to recombinant flig and flii. these results indicate that these antigens are not favorable candidate reagents to be used in the diagnosis of lyme disease.
escherichia coli transcytosis in a caco-2 cell model: implications in neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) is a serious gastrointestinal disorder of preterm infants. other than an association with prematurity and gastrointestinal feeding, no single factor or mechanism has been consistently linked to this disease. we have previously demonstrated that escherichia coli isolates obtained from the stool of infants with nec caused nec-like injury in a weanling rabbit ileal loop model; this injury, in turn, could be blocked by coinfection with selected gram(+) bacteria (enterococcus faecium) isolated from asymptomatic controls. using caco-2 cells in a trans-well system, we now demonstrate that the same e. coli isolates can cross epithelial cell monolayers in the absence of ultrastructural change or damage. these results with e. coli contrast with those seen with salmonella typhimurium, which passed through the monolayer at a higher rate and were associated with striking ultrastructural damage. transcytosis of e. coli was reduced 3-5-fold in the presence of e. faecium previously shown to block nec-like injury in the loop model. there was a mild increase in the rate of e. coli transcytosis when studies were conducted with younger, undifferentiated cells; these immature cells had no brush border, had decreased production of brush border-specific enzymes, but retained well defined tight junctions, as demonstrated by transepithelial electrical resistance and electron microscopy. a further reduction/ complete blockage of e. coli transcytosis was observed when e. faecium was used as the coinfectant in studies with these undifferentiated cells. we hypothesize that the ability of e. coli to cross epithelial cell layer is a critical initial step in the cascade of events which lead ultimately to nec; blockage or reduction in e. coli transcytosis in the presence of certain gram(+) organisms may play a significant role in prevention of nec.
identification of a domain in rck, a product of the salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid, required for both serum resistance and cell invasion.
rck is encoded on the salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid and is a member of a family of related 17- to 19-kda outer membrane proteins of enterobacteriaceae, including ail (yersinia enterocolitica) and pagc (s. typhimurium). structural models for these proteins predict eight membrane-spanning domains alternating with hydrophilic inner and outer loops. when expressed in escherichia coli, rck and ail, but not pagc, confer high-level resistance to the bactericidal activity of complement as well as the ability to adhere to and invade mammalian cell lines. to identify functional domains of rck, we made and screened random mutations in rck for decreased bioactivity. we found that a single amino acid substitution (glycine to aspartic acid) in the putative third outer loop greatly reduced rck-mediated serum resistance and eukaryotic cell invasion. we then constructed two chimeric proteins between rck and pagc. substitution of the c-terminal half of rck with the corresponding pagc fragment containing both the third and the fourth outer loops abolishes the rck-mediated serum resistance and invasion phenotypes. substitution of rck with a smaller c-terminal portion of pagc containing the fourth outer loop did not affect the invasive phenotype or serum resistance. these data reveal that the third putative outer membrane loop region is important for the virulence-associated properties of the rck protein and suggest a similarity between the mechanism of serum resistance and epithelial cell invasion involving the same domain of rck.
growth suppression in early-stationary-phase nutrient broth cultures of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli is genus specific and not regulated by sigma s.
we have studied the growth suppression seen in early-stationary-phase lb broth cultures of salmonella typhimurium. multiplication of small numbers of an antibiotic-resistant s. typhimurium mutant was prevented when the mutant was added to 24-h cultures of the antibiotic-sensitive parent strain, whereas an antibiotic-resistant mutant of an escherichia coli strain added to the same culture grew well. a 24-h e. coli culture produced a similar specific bacteriostatic inhibition against e. coli. in older cultures, a specific bactericidal effect similar to that observed by m. m. zambrano and r. kolter (j. bacteriol. 175:5642-5647, 1993) was also observed. whether incubated statically or shaken, sufficient nutrients were present in the filtered supernatants of 24-h cultures for small inocula of the same strain to multiply to ca. 10(9) cfu/ml after reincubation. introduction of the rpos mutation had no effect on the specific bacteriostatic inhibition. similar specific inhibition was also observed in strains of citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and shigella spp. experiments in which the 24-h culture was physically separated from the antibiotic-resistant mutant by using a dialysis membrane were carried out. these results indicated that the inhibition might be mediated by a diffusible but labile chemical mediator.
molecular cloning, mapping, and regulation of pho regulon genes for phosphonate breakdown by the phosphonatase pathway of salmonella typhimurium lt2.
two pathways exist for cleavage of the carbon-phosphorus (c-p) bond of phosphonates, the c-p lyase and the phosphonatase pathways. it was previously demonstrated that escherichia coli carries genes (named phn) only for the c-p lyase pathway and that enterobacter aerogenes carries genes for both pathways (k.-s. lee, w. w. metcalf, and b. l. wanner, j. bacteriol. 174:2501-2510, 1992). in contrast, here it is shown that salmonella typhimurium lt2 carries genes only for the phosphonatase pathway. genes for the s. typhimurium phosphonatase pathway were cloned by complementation of e. coli delta phn mutants. genes for these pathways were proven not to be homologous and to lie in different chromosomal regions. the s. typhimurium phn locus lies near 10 min; the e. coli phn locus lies near 93 min. the s. typhimurium phn gene cluster is about 7.2 kb in length and, on the basis of gene fusion analysis, appears to consist of two (or more) genes or operons that are divergently transcribed. like that of the e. coli phn locus, the expression of the s. typhimurium phn locus is activated under conditions of pi limitation and is subject to pho regulon control. this was shown both by complementation of the appropriate e. coli mutants and by the construction of s. typhimurium mutants with lesions in the phob and pst loci, which are required for activation and inhibition of pho regulon gene expression, respectively. complementation studies indicate that the s. typhimurium phn locus probably includes genes both for phosphonate transport and for catalysis of c-p bond cleavage.
activity of p-aminobenzoic acid compared with other organic acids against selected bacteria.
the antibacterial activity of p-aminobenzoic acid against listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli was compared with the activity of commonly used acidulants: formic, propionic, acetic, lactic and citric acids. viable count evaluations and mic determinations indicated that p-aminobenzoic acid caused greater inhibitory effects than the other organic acids. the activity of p-aminobenzoic acid on the growth of the test organisms at selected ph values indicated that p-aminobenzoic acid was more active at low ph than at high ph. uptake studies showed that the uptake of p-aminobenzoic acid by e. coli was markedly decreased as the ph values increased. electron micrographs of e. coli cells grown in the presence of p-aminobenzoic acid indicate that p-aminobenzoic acid caused marked damage to the cell envelope. it is suggested that p-aminobenzoic acid has at least two mechanisms of action: one mechanism in common with other organic acids and the other mechanism by interfering with the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer by an action on the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme.
[antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in salmonella typhimurium].
it is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of propionibacterium shermanii, p. pentosaceum, p. thoenii, p. coccoides, p. acnes, lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus, str. faecalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, and escherichia coli ab 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) in salmonella typhimurium ta 100 decreases significantly. the highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. the cells passaged in the medium containing 4-nqo demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. thiol accumulation in culture liquid from p. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. over 24 h thiol content decreased. the maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. it is suggested that desmutagenesis of the bacteria studied towards 4-nqo is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.
mucosal t cells induce systemic anergy for oral tolerance.
heat-labile enterotoxin (lt) from enterotoxigenic escherichia coli is known to possess strong immunoregulatory potential in terms of inhibition of the induction of oral tolerance and adjuvanticity in oral immunization. we found that oral administration of an immunogenic peptide of lt [lt-b(26-45); spanning the residues 26-45 of lt-b] induced systemic unresponsiveness in balb/c mice resulting in diminished serum igg responses. it was also shown that the spleen (sp) cd4+ t cells of tolerized mice failed to proliferate, whereas the peyer's patches (pp) cd4+ t cells responded to the peptide. rt-pcr revealed that the sp cd4+ t cells did not generate il-2 mrna, while the pp cd4+ t cells expressed significant levels of ifn-gamma, il-2, il-4, and tgf-beta mrna. adoptive transfer of lt-b-specific intraepithelial lymphocytes to the tolerant mice abrogated the tolerance. in the reversed mice, lt-b(26-45)-stimulated sp cd4+ t cells expressed significant levels of ifn-gamma, il-2, il-4, and il-6 mrna. these results indicate that pp cd4+ t cells induce oral tolerance due to systemic t cell anergy.
destruction of gram-negative food-borne pathogens by high ph involves disruption  of the cytoplasmic membrane.
high ph has been shown to rapidly destroy gram-negative food-borne pathogens; however, the mechanism of destruction has not yet been elucidated. escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enteritidis atcc 13706, and listeria monocytogenes f5069 were suspended in nahco3-naoh buffer solutions at ph 9, 10, 11, or 12 to give a final cell concentration of approximately 5.2 x 10(8) cfu/ml and then held at 37 or 45 degrees c. at 0, 5, 10, and 15 min the suspensions were sterilely filtered and each filtrate was analyzed for material with a260. viability of the cell suspensions was evaluated by enumeration on nonselective and selective agars. cell morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. a260 increased dramatically with ph and temperature for both e. coli and s. enteritidis; however, with l. monocytogenes material with a260 was not detected at any of the phs tested. at ph 12, numbers of e. coli and s. enteritidis decreased at least 8 logs within 15 s, whereas l. monocytogenes decreased by only 1 log in 10 min. there was a very strong correlation between the initial rate of release of material with a260 and death rate of the gram-negative pathogens (r = 0.997). at ph 12, gram-negative test cells appeared collapsed and showed evidence of lysis while gram-positive l. monocytogenes did not, when observed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. it was concluded that destruction of gram-negative food-borne pathogens by high ph involves disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane.
plasminogen, absorbed by escherichia coli expressing curli or by salmonella enteritidis expressing thin aggregative fimbriae, can be activated by simultaneously captured tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-pa).
curli are fimbrial structures expressed by escherichia coli that specifically interact with matrix proteins such as fibronectin and laminin. similar structures are also expressed by salmonella enteritidis and have been denoted thin aggregative fimbriae. bacteria expressing curli and thin aggregative fimbriae were found to bind radiolabelled plasminogen as well as the tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-pa). by contrast, e. coli carrying a gene locus with an insertionally inactivated chromosomal curlin subunit were unable to bind the two human proteins. the purified subunit polypeptides of curli and thin aggregative fimbriae bound plasminogen and t-pa with high affinity (1 x 10(8) to 2 x 10(8) m-1). the binding of plasminogen and t-pa to curli-expressing e. coli was only partially inhibited by fibronectin and laminin. plasminogen absorbed from human plasma by curli-expressing e. coli was readily converted to plasmin by t-pa; both plasmin and t-pa were functionally active when bound to the bacteria. a simultaneous binding of fibrinolytic proteins and matrix proteins to fimbriae of e. coli and s. enteritidis could provide these pathogens with both adhesive and invasive properties.
a salmonella protein that is required for resistance to antimicrobial peptides and transport of potassium.
the ability of invading pathogens to proliferate within host tissues requires the capacity to resist the killing effects of a wide variety of host defense molecules. sap mutants of the facultative intracellular parasite salmonella typhimurium exhibit hypersensitivity to antimicrobial peptides, cannot survive within macrophages in vitro and are attenuated for mouse virulence in vivo. we conducted a molecular genetic analysis of the sapg locus and showed that it encodes a product that is 99% identical to the nad+ binding protein trka, a component of a low-affinity k+ uptake system in escherichia coli. sapg exhibits similarity with other e. coli proteins implicated in k+ transport including kefc, a glutathione-regulated efflux protein, and kch, a putative transporter similar to eukaryotic k+ channel proteins, sapg mutants were killed by the antimicrobial peptide protamine in the presence of both high and low k+, indicating that protamine hypersensitivity is not due to k+ starvation. strains with mutations in sapg and either sapj or the sapabcdf operon were as susceptible as sapg single mutants, suggesting that the proteins encoded by these loci participate in the same resistance pathway. sapg may modulate the activities of sapabcdf and sapj to mediate the transport of peptides and potassium.
survival, physiological response and recovery of enteric bacteria exposed to a polar marine environment.
survival, sublethal injury, and recoverability of escherichia coli, enterococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica were investigated by using diffusion chambers over 54 to 56 days of in situ exposure to a polar marine environment (-1.8 degrees c; salinity, 34.5 ppt) at mcmurdo station, antarctica. plate counts were used to assess recoverability and injury, whereas direct viable counts (dvcs) and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (ctc) reduction were utilized to determine substrate responsiveness and respiratory activity, respectively. t90 values (times for 10-fold decreases in numbers of recoverable cells) on nonselective medium were ca. 216 to 259 h for e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica and 432 h for e. faecalis. sublethal injury was greater in populations of indicator bacteria than in pathogens. dvcs, ctc reduction, and plate counts indicated progressive increases in viable but nonculturable cells in e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica cultures throughout the 54-day exposure. forty-eight-day exposure of e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica resulted in decreased optimal incubation temperatures for colony formation and inability to form colonies at 37 degrees c. the detection of responsive e. coli, s. typhimurium, and y. enterocolitica by the dvc and ctc methods remained within 1% of inoculum values during 54 days of exposure, indicating some long-term persistence in the viable-but-nonculturable state. percentages of respiring e. coli and s. typhimurium increased significantly upon addition of nutrients at all temperatures tested, indicating that nutrient availability rather than temperature limited enteric bacterial activity in this very cold environment. large nutrient inputs to low-temperature marine environments may thus allow for the long-term persistence of enteric bacteria in a nonrecoverable state.
mannan-binding protein-like activity in the sera of newborn piglets.
the mechanism of the antibody-independent bactericidal activity of the sera of newborn piglets deprived of colostrum was studied using rough strains of e. coli and s. typhimurium. although all strains were invariably killed by all newborn piglet sera tested, two different mechanisms of killing were encountered. using specific anti-pig c1q antiserum, strains s. typhimurium lt2ml and e. coli k-12, strain gal 23 were found to be killed by a c1q-dependent mechanism, while the killing of e. coli s 16, e. coli k-12, strain w 3100 and e. coli b 41 could not be inhibited by anti-c1q antiserum. in order to test whether a mannan-binding protein is responsible for the bactericidal effect in the latter group of strains, we examined the inhibitory activity of two types of mannans isolated from s. cerevisiae and h. capsulata, respectively. the use of a purified rabbit mannan-binding protein showed that only strains killed by the c1q-independent mechanism were sensitive to the mbp-dependent mechanism of killing, the inhibitory activities of both mannans were found to be equal. as expected, the inhibitory effect of mannan on the bactericidal activity of newborn piglet sera was also detected only in strains killed by the c1q-independent mechanism. surprisingly, only the phosphomannan isolated from h. capsulata was found to be an effective inhibitor of the bactericidial activity of piglet sera against e. coli s 16 and e. coli k-12, strain w 3100, while the mannan isolated from s. cerevisiae was inactive. hence the factor present in newborn piglet sera is either mbp with slightly different binding properties, or a completely different protein.
mutations in fira, encoding the second acyltransferase in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, affect multiple steps in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
the product of the fira (ssc) gene is essential for growth and for the integrity  of the outer membrane of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. recently, kelly and coworkers (t. m. kelly, s. a. stachula, c. r. h. raetz, and m. s. anderson, j. biol. chem., 268:19866-19874, 1993) identified fira as the gene encoding udp-3-o-(r-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-glucosamine n-acyltransferase, the third step in lipid a biosynthesis. we studied the effects of six different mutations in fira on lipopolysaccharide synthesis. all of the fira mutants of both e. coli and s. typhimurium examined had a decreased lipopolysaccharide synthesis rate. e. coli and s. typhimurium strains defective in fira produced a lipid a that contains a seventh fatty acid, a hexadecanoic acid, when grown at the nonpermissive temperature. analysis of the enzymatic activity of other enzymes involved in lipid a biosynthesis revealed that the fira mutations pleiotropically affect lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. in addition to that of udp-3-o-(r-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-glucosamine n-acyltransferase, the enzymatic activity of the lipid a 4' kinase (the sixth step of lipid a biosynthesis) was decreased in strains with each of the fira mutations examined. however, overproduction of fira was not accompanied by overexpression of the lipid a 4' kinase.
the effects of captan and captafol on different bacterial strains and on c-mitosis in v79 chinese hamster fibroblasts.
the mutagenic activity of captan and captafol was tested using ames strains and strains showing an sos response. captafol was mutagenic in s. typhimurium strain ta102 (uvr+) and captan in strain ta104 (uvrb). both captan and captafol elicit damages in dna recognized by correndonuclease ii, as shown by the repair test, and induced the sos repair system in e. coli pq37 (uvra) strain. only captafol induced the sos system in pq35 (uvr+). the lack of induction of beta-galactosidase at nonpermissive temperature in e. coli md332 (dnacs uvra) strain showed that neither chemical was able to produce dna breaks. in v79 chinese hamster fibroblasts higher induction of c-mitosis by captafol than by captan (22% and 15% over the control, respectively) was accompanied by a higher decrease in nonprotein sulfhydryl groups, mainly gsh (41% and 77%, respectively). the content of protein sulfhydryl groups was decreased by either fungicide to a similar extent.
hc1-mediated effects on dna structure: a potential regulator of chlamydial development.
chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria which undergo a unique developmental cycle, alternating between non-replicative elementary bodies (ebs) and replicative reticulate bodies (rbs). the transition from rb to eb is characterized by condensation of the chromosome into a dense nucleoid structure. the chlamydial histone homologue hc1 is sufficient to induce formation of a similar structure in escherichia coli. high-level hc1 expression in e. coli is self-limiting and down-regulates transcription, translation, and replication at concentrations similar to those observed in chlamydial elementary bodies. expression of hc1 at sub-structural levels may have specific regulatory functions through its interaction with chromosomal dna. in e. coli this is reflected in a dramatic shift in the pattern of gene expression. the differential expression of the outer membrane porin proteins ompc and ompf and analysis of lacz fusions with promoter regions sensitive to supercoiling suggests that low-level hc1 expression results in a net relaxation of chromosomal dna. topological analysis of plasmid dna from both e. coli and chlamydia trachomatis supports a decrease in superhelicity preceding nucleoid formation. in vitro analysis of purified hc1-dna interactions supports preferential binding based upon dna conformation. these results suggest a dual role in which hc1-mediated changes in gene expression may precede metabolic inactivity.
outer membrane permeability barrier to azithromycin, clarithromycin, and roxithromycin in gram-negative enteric bacteria.
mutations which severely affect the function of the outer membrane of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium (lpxa and fira mutations of lipid a synthesis and rfae mutation of the lipopolysaccharide inner-core synthesis) were found to decrease the mics of erythromycin, roxithromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin by factors of 32 to 512, 32 to 1,024, 64 to 512, and 16 to 64, respectively. the sensitization factors for three other hydrophobic antibiotics (rifampin, fusidic acid, and mupirocin) ranged from 16 to 300. the outer membrane permeability-increasing agents polymyxin b nonapeptide (3 micrograms/ml) and deacylpolymyxin b (1 microgram/ml) sensitized wild-type e. coli to azithromycin by factors of 10 and 30, respectively. quantitatively very similar sensitization to the other macrolides took place. polymyxin-resistant pmra mutants of s. typhimurium displayed no cross-resistance to azithromycin. proteus mirabilis mutants which were sensitized to polymyxin by a factor of > or = 300 to > or = 1,000 had a maximal two- to fourfold increase in sensitivity to azithromycin. these results indicate that azithromycin and the other new macrolides use the hydrophobic pathway across the outer membrane and that the intact outer membrane is an effective barrier against them. furthermore, the results indicate that azithromycin, in contrast to polymyxin, does not effectively diffuse through the outer membrane by interacting electrostatically with the lipopolysaccharide.
proteolytic cleavage by neutrophil elastase converts inactive storage proforms to antibacterial bactenecins.
bac5 and bac7, antibiotics of the bactenecin (proline/arginine-rich peptide) family, are stored as proforms in the large granules of bovine neutrophils [zanetti, m., litteri, l., gennaro, r., horstmann, h. and romeo, d. (1990) j. cell biol. 111, 1363-1371]. these proforms have been purified to homogeneity from granule extracts by immunoaffinity and reverse-phase chromatography. while mature bactenecins efficiently kill escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6-12 micrograms/ml, probac5 and probac7 do not affect the growth of the same microorganisms, even at 500 micrograms/ml. previous investigations have suggested that the conversion of probactenecins into mature antimicrobial peptides is catalyzed by a neutral serine protease stored in the azurophil granules. purified probac5 and probac7 were thus treated with elastase, cathepsin g or proteinase 3, which constitute the pool of neutral serine proteases of the azurophils, and the reaction products were identified by western blot analysis, mass spectrometry, and n-terminal sequence analysis. of the three proteases, only elastase is able to catalyze the stepwise cleavage of probactenecins into the corresponding mature peptides, which have the same mass, n-terminal sequence and antibiotic activity of authentic bac5 and bac7. these results point to the importance of cooperation between azurophils and large granules in mounting a defense reaction.
tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors block invasin-promoted bacterial uptake by epithelial cells.
the ability to enter into (invade) mammalian cells is an essential virulence determinant of many pathogenic bacteria and intracellular parasites. these organisms are internalized by host cells upon attachment to their surface. however, the mechanisms used by intracellular parasites to induce internalization into host cells have not been defined. we found that the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine blocks invasion by some pathogenic bacteria, including yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis. using escherichia coli containing the cloned y. enterocolitica invasion gene inv (which codes for invasin, an integrin-binding protein), we found that staurosporine inhibits invasion by blocking bacterial internalization. two specific tyrosine protein kinase inhibitors, genistein and tyrphostin, also block the internalization but not the binding of bacteria, suggesting that bacterial uptake may be dependent on the activity of this enzyme class in host hela cells. in contrast to invasion promoted by invasin, the invasion of hela cells by salmonella typhimurium is not inhibited by any of these drugs.
formycins a and b and some analogues: selective inhibitors of bacterial (escherichia coli) purine nucleoside phosphorylase.
formycin b (fb), a moderate inhibitor (ki approximately 100 microm) of mammalian  purine nucleoside phosphorylase (pnp), and formycin a (fa), which is totally inactive vs. the mammalian enzyme, are both effective inhibitors of the bacterial (escherichia coli) enzyme (ki approximately 5 microm). examination of a series of n-methyl analogues of fa and fb led to the finding that n(6)-methyl-fa, virtually inactive vs. the mammalian enzyme, is the most potent inhibitor of e. coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (ki approximately 0.3 um) at neutral ph. inhibition is competitive not only with respect to ino, but also relative to 7-methyl-guo and 7-methyl-ado, as substrates. both oxoformycins a and b are relatively poor inhibitors. for the most potent inhibitor, n(6)-methyl-fa, it was shown that the enzyme preferentially binds the neutral, and not the cationic, form. in accordance with this the neutral, but not the cationic form, of the structurally related n(1)-methyl-ado was found to be an excellent substrate. reported data on tautomerism of formycins were profited from, and extended, to infer which tautomeric species and ionic forms are the active inhibitors. a commercially available (sigma) bacterial pnp, of unknown origin, was shown to differ from the e. coli enzyme by its inability to phosphorylase ado; this enzyme was also resistant to fa and fb. these findings have been extended to provide a detailed comparison of the substrate/inhibitor properties of pnp from various microorganisms.
bactericidal activities of rat defensins and synthetic rabbit defensins on staphylococci, klebsiella pneumoniae (chedid, 277, and 8n3), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid strains), salmonella typhimurium (ra, rc, rd, and re of lps mutants) and escherichia coli.
rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. staphylococcus aureus (209p, cowan i, smith diffuse and smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, micrococcus lysodeikticus and bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and k) and klebsiella pneumoniae (chedid, 277, and 8n3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (lps) of salmonella typhimurium lt2, such as ra, rc, rd, and re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. lysozyme did not show any bactericidal activity except against m. lysodeikticus and b. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against s. typhimurium and s. aureus. with regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, np1, np4, and np5, np1 showed strong bactericidal activity against k. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. neither np4 nor np5 showed any bactericidal activity, while np5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of np1 against k. pneumoniae 277.
the cysp promoter of salmonella typhimurium: characterization of two binding sites for cysb protein, studies of in vivo transcription initiation, and demonstration of the anti-inducer effects of thiosulfate.
the cysptwa operons of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium encode components of periplasmic transport systems for sulfate and thiosulfate and are regulated as part of the cysteine regulons. in vitro transcription initiation from the cysp promoter was shown to require both cysb protein and either o-acetyl-l-serine or n-acetyl-l-serine, which act as inducers, and was inhibited by the anti-inducer sulfide. thiosulfate was found to be even more potent than sulfide as an anti-inducer. dnase i protection experiments showed two discrete binding sites for cysb protein in the presence of n-acetyl-l-serine. cbs-p1 is located between positions -85 and -41 relative to the major transcription start site, and cbs-p2 is located between positions -19 and +25. without n-acetyl-l-serine, the cysb protein protected the region between positions -63 and -11, which was designated cbs-p3. in gel mobility shift assays, the mobility of cysb protein-cysp promoter complexes was increased by o-acetyl-l-serine, n-acetyl-l-serine had no effect in gel shift experiments, presumably because its anionic charge results in its rapid removal from the complex during electrophoresis. comparison of dna fragments differing with respect to binding site position indicated that complexes with cysb protein contain dna that is bent somewhere between cbs-p1 and cbs-p2 and that o-acetyl-l-serine decreases dna bending. binding studies with fragments containing either cbs-p2 alone, cbs-p1 alone, or the entire cysp promoter region suggest a model in which the complex of bent dna observed in the absence of o-acetyl-l-serine contains a single cysb protein molecule bound to cbs-p3. at relatively low cysb protein concentrations, o-acetyl-l-serine would cause a single cysb protein molecule to bind tightly to cbs-p1, rather than to cbs-p3, thereby decreasing dna bending and increasing complex electrophoretic mobility. at higher cysb protein concentrations, o-acetyl-l-serine would cause a second molecule to bind at cbs-p2, giving a more slowly migrating complex.
selected faecal bacteria and nutrients essential for antagonism of salmonella typhimurium in anaerobic continuous flow cultures.
as few as five of the species of bacteria commonly found in human faeces--escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, bacteroides ovatus and fusobacterium varium--when grown together in anaerobic continuous flow cultures exerted antagonistic effects on salmonella typhimurium as great as those given by mixed bacteria from extracts of human faeces. in a single culture, the population of s. typhimurium was c. 10(8) cfu/ml but in mixed cultures with the five antagonistic bacteria or mixed faecal bacteria it was reduced to c. 10(3) cfu/ml. antagonism appeared to be the result of competition for the growth limiting amino acids, arginine, serine, threonine and aspartic acid. optimal manifestation of antagonism required the presence of carbon sources fermentable only by antagonistic bacteria, such as lactose 0.1%, w/v, sucrose 0.1% (w/v) and starch 0.2-0.3% w/v. these carbohydrates promoted the growth of the antagonistic bacteria, particularly e. coli and b. ovatus. however, an increase in concentration by several fold of any one of four growth-limiting amino acids in the medium diminished the antagonistic effects and the population of s. typhimurium rose 10(2)-10(3)-fold.
initiator (dnaa) protein concentration as a function of growth rate in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium.
the dnaa protein concentration was determined in five different escherichia coli  strains and in salmonella typhimurium lt2 growing at different growth rates. the dnaa protein concentration was found to be invariant over a wide range of growth rates in the four e. coli k-12 strains and in s. typhimurium. in e. coli b/r the dnaa protein concentration was generally higher than in the k-12 strains, and it increased with decreasing growth rates. for all the strains, there appears to be a correlation between the dnaa protein concentration and the initiation mass. this supports the concept of the concentration of dnaa protein setting the initiation mass and, thus, that the dnaa protein is a key molecule in the regulation of initiation of chromosome replication in members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
inhibition of macrophage phagosome-lysosome fusion by salmonella typhimurium.
salmonella typhimurium-infected macrophages were examined by electron microscopy  to determine whether intracellular survival of s. typhimurium is associated with failure of bacteria containing phagosomes to fuse with secondary lysosomes. s. typhimurium 14028 actively inhibited phagosome-lysosome fusion and appeared to preferentially divide within unfused phagocytic vesicles. in comparison with escherichia coli, s. typhimurium inhibited phagosome-lysosome fusion in peritoneal macrophages, j774 macrophages, and bone marrow-derived macrophages from both balb/c (itys) and swr/j (ityr) mice. the mechanism responsible for salmonella inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion is unknown but requires viable salmonellae, is not blocked by opsonization with fresh normal mouse serum, and is not due to lipopolysaccharide. inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion may play a critical role in survival of salmonellae within macrophages and in virulence.
expression of salmonella typhi and escherichia coli ompc is influenced differently by medium osmolarity; dependence on escherichia coli ompr.
ompc, a major outer-membrane protein, is highly expressed when salmonella typhi is grown in nutrient broth (nb) of either low (nb + 0% sucrose) or high (nb + 20% sucrose) osmolarity. this contrasts with the expression of escherichia coli ompc, which is inhibited in low osmolarity and enhanced in high osmolarity, as has been described previously (van alphen and lugtenberg, 1977; verhoef et al., 1979; kawaji et al., 1979). nevertheless, expression of s. typhi ompc is dependent on the e. coli ompr transcriptional activator. these findings suggest differences between the mechanisms of osmoregulation of gene expression in both bacteria, although common effectors appear to be shared.
inhibition by fatty acids of direct mutagenicity of n-nitroso compounds.
fatty acids inhibited the direct mutagenicity of n-nitroso compounds in salmonella typhimurium ta1535, escherichia coli wp2 and wphcr-, and e. coli h/r30r (wild) and hs30r (uvra). this inhibitory activity was dependent on the concentration of fatty acids, and fatty acids with longer alkyl chain were more potent. of the n-nitroso compounds tested, alpha-hydroxy nitrosamines underwent the strongest inhibitory effect. the rate of decomposition was not changed by addition of fatty acids. the partitioning property of the mutagens was altered but not to such a degree as to explain the amount of inhibition. no significant difference in alkylating activity of the n-nitroso compounds was observed in phosphate and acetate buffers. a stronger inhibition of mutagenicity by a butylating mutagen was detected in e. coli wp2 than in wp2hcr- and in e. coli h/r30r than in hs30r, suggesting that excision repair was a possible mechanism of inhibition. the mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of alpha-hydroxy nitrosamines in chinese hamster v79 cells were also inhibited by acetate.
molecular cloning of the salmonella typhimurium lep gene in escherichia coli.
a system is described which enabled the selection of a heterologous lep gene, encoding signal peptidase i, in escherichia coli. it is based on complementation of an e. coli mutant, in which the synthesis of signal peptidase i can be regulated. with this system the lep gene of salmonella typhimurium was cloned and the nucleotide sequence was determined. the s. typhimurium lep gene encodes a protein of 324 amino acids. expression of the gene in the e. coli mutant resulted in suppression of growth inhibition and in the restoration of processing activity under conditions where synthesis of e. coli signal peptidase i was repressed. the cloned s. typhimurium signal peptidase i had an apparent molecular weight of 36,000 daltons, which is in agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 35,782 daltons. the system described for selection of the s. typhimurium lep gene may permit the cloning and expression of other heterologous signal peptidase i genes.
activity of kb-5246 against outer membrane mutants of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium.
the inhibitory activity of kb-5246 against escherichia coli dna gyrase and the antibacterial activity and apparent uptake in e. coli and salmonella typhimurium outer membrane mutants of kb-5246 were measured. the 50% inhibitory concentrations of kb-5246, ciprofloxacin, oflaxacin, and norfloxacin for e. coli kl-16 dna gyrase were 0.72, 0.62, 0.84, and 1.16 micrograms/ml, respectively. the activity of kb-5246 was twofold lower against an ompf-deficient mutant and twofold higher against a mutant which produced ompf constitutively than against the parent with osmoregulated ompf production. kb-5246 had twofold-higher activity against a deep rough mutant of s. typhimurium than against the parent. the apparent uptake of kb-5246 in the ompf-deficient mutant was decreased and its uptake in the deep rough mutant was increased when compared with those in the parents. these results suggest that kb-5246 is taken up by porin and nonporin pathways and has strong inhibitory activity against dna gyrase, resulting in potent antibacterial activity.
low-ph-induced effects on patterns of protein synthesis and on internal ph in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium.
escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium were grown in a supplemented minimal  medium (smm) at a ph of 7.0 or 5.0 or were shifted from ph 7.0 to 5.0. two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of proteins labeled with h2(35)so4 for 20 min during the shift showed that in e. coli, 13 polypeptides were elevated 1.5- to 4-fold, whereas in s. typhimurium, 19 polypeptides were increased 2- to 14-fold over the ph 7.0 control. upon long-term growth at ph 5.0, almost double the number of polypeptides were elevated twofold or more in s. typhimurium compared with e. coli. in e. coli, there was no apparent induction of heat shock proteins upon growth at ph 5.0 in smm. however, growth of e. coli in a complex broth to ph 5.0, or subsequent growth of fresh e. coli cells in the filtrate from this culture, showed that a subset of five polypeptides is uniquely induced by low ph. two of these polypeptides, d60.5, the inducible lysyl-trna synthetase, and c62.5, are known heat shock proteins. measurements of the internal ph (phi) and growth rates of both organisms were made during growth in smm at ph 7.0, ph 5.0, and upon the ph shift. the data show that the phi of e. coli decreases more severely than that of s. typhimurium at an external ph of 5.0; the growth rate of e. coli is about one-half that of s. typhimurium at this ph, whereas the two organisms have the same growth rate at ph 7.0. the two-dimensional gel, growth, and phi experiments collectively suggest that, at least in smm, s. typhimurium is more adaptive to low-ph stress than is e. coli.
pausing, switching and speed fluctuation of the bacterial flagellar motor and their relation to motility and chemotaxis.
wild-type escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium cells, tethered to glass by their flagella, rotate with brief intermittent pauses, the prevalence of which is decreased by attractants and increased by repellents. by attaching latex beads to filaments of a s. typhimurium mutant having straight rather than helical flagella, it was established that the flagella on free cells also pause intermittently. pausing is therefore an intrinsic feature of the motor and not an artifact associated with tethering. in tethered cells of wild-type strains and non-chemotactic mutants defective in transducers, chemotaxis proteins, or the flagellar switch, both the classical response to chemotactic stimuli (change in direction of rotation from counterclockwise to clockwise or vice versa), and the pausing response to such stimuli, were linked together. no separate signal for pausing was found. in comparing different strains under different stimulation conditions, it was found that cells that never reversed seldom if ever paused, while cells that reversed frequently paused frequently. it is suggested that pausing is the result of futile switching events. a modified description of tumbling and chemotaxis is provided in which pausing, as well as reversal, has a role. suppression of reversals and pauses by attractant stimuli commonly resulted in an increase in the speed of counterclockwise rotation; this may be because of suppression of pauses or reversals that are too brief to be detected. the clockwise rotation rate of unstimulated cells, which commonly was faster than their counterclockwise rate, was not further increased by repellent stimuli. the rotation rate of any given cell under any given condition was found to fluctuate on all time-scales measured. the study also revealed that some of the common repellents of e. coli and s. typhimurium slow down or stop the motor; these effects are not mediated by the chemotaxis machinery or intracellular ph.
binding and killing of bacteria by bismuth subsalicylate.
bismuth subsalicylate (bss) is a compound without significant aqueous solubility  that is widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. bss was able to bind bacteria of diverse species, and these bound bacteria were subsequently killed. a 4-log10 reduction of viable bacteria occurred within 4 h after a 10 mm aqueous suspension of bss was inoculated with 2 x 10(6) escherichia coli cells per ml. binding and killing were dependent on the levels of inoculated bacteria, and significant binding but little killing of the exposed bacteria occurred at an inoculum level of 2 x 10(9) e. coli per ml. intracellular atp decreased rapidly after exposure of e. coli to 10 mm bss and, after 30 min, was only 1% of the original level. extracellular atp increased after exposure to bss, but the accumulation of extracellular atp was not sufficient to account for the loss of intracellular atp. the killing of bacteria exposed to bss may have been due to cessation of atp synthesis or a loss of membrane integrity. bactericidal activity of bss was also investigated in a simulated gastric juice at ph 3. killing of e. coli at this ph was much more rapid than at ph 7 and was apparently due to salicylate released by the conversion of bss to bismuth oxychloride. it is proposed that the binding and killing observed for bss contribute to the efficacy of this compound against gastrointestinal infections such as traveler's diarrhea.
envm genes of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli.
conjugation and bacteriophage p1 transduction experiments in escherichia coli showed that resistance to the antibacterial compound diazaborine is caused by an allelic form of the envm gene. the envm gene from salmonella typhimurium was cloned and sequenced. it codes for a 27,765-dalton protein. the plasmids carrying this dna complemented a conditionally lethal envm mutant of e. coli. recombinant plasmids containing gene envm from a diazaborine-resistant s. typhimurium strain conferred the drug resistance phenotype to susceptible e. coli cells. a guanine-to-adenine exchange in the envm gene changing a gly codon to a ser codon was shown to be responsible for the resistance character. upstream of envm a small gene coding for a 10,445-dalton protein was identified. incubating a temperature-sensitive e. coli envm mutant at the nonpermissive temperature caused effects on the cells similar to those caused by treatment with diazaborine, i.e., inhibition of fatty acid, phospholipid, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, induction of a 28,000-dalton inner membrane protein, and change in the ratio of the porins ompc and ompf.
characterization of the cysjih regions of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia  coli b. dna sequences of cysi and cysh and a model for the siroheme-fe4s4 active center of sulfite reductase hemoprotein based on amino acid homology with spinach nitrite reductase.
the hemoprotein component of salmonella typhimurium sulfite reductase (nadph) (ec 1.8.1.2) was purified to homogeneity from cysj266, a mutant strain lacking sulfite reductase flavoprotein. the siroheme- and fe4s4-containing enzyme was isolated as a monomeric 63-kda polypeptide and consisted of a mixture of unligated enzyme and a complex with sulfite. following reduction with 5'-deazaflavin-edta and reoxidation, the complex was converted to the uncomplexed, high spin ferri-siroheme state seen previously with escherichia coli sulfite reductase hemoprotein preparations. the s. typhimurium hemoprotein exhibited catalytic and physical properties identical to the hemoprotein prepared by urea dissociation of e. coli sulfite reductase holoenzyme and was fully competent in reconstituting nadph-sulfite reductase activity when combined with excess purified sulfite reductase flavoprotein. the dna sequences of cysi and cysh from s. typhimurium and e. coli b were determined and, together with previously reported data, confirmed the organization of this region as promoter-cysj-cysi-cysh with all three genes oriented in the same direction from the promoter. molecular weights deduced for the cysi-encoded sulfite reductase hemoprotein and for the cysh-encoded 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate sulfotransferase were approximately 64,000 and 28,000, respectively. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of sulfite reductase hemoprotein with that of spinach nitrite reductase (back, e., burkhart, w., moyer, m., privalle, l., and rothstein, s. (1988) mol. gen. genet. 212, 20-26), which also contains siroheme and an fe4s4 cluster, showed two groups of cysteine-containing sequences with the structures cys-(x)3-cys and cys-(x)5-cys, which are homologous in the two enzymes and are postulated to provide the ligands of the fe4s4 cluster in both proteins. from these sequences and from crystallographic (mcree, d. e., richardson, d. c., richardson, j. s., and siegel, l. m. (1986) j. biol. chem. 261, 10277-10281) and spectroscopic data in the literature, a model is proposed for the structure of the active center of these two enzymes.
biocidal activity of ozone versus formaldehyde against poultry pathogens inoculated in a prototype setter.
ozone was evaluated as an alternative hatchery disinfectant to replace formaldehyde in the event that the environmental protection agency regulates the use of formaldehyde under the toxic substances control act. cultures of staphylococcus, streptococcus, and bacillus species previously isolated from poultry hatcheries and selected culture collections of escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescences, salmonella typhimurium, proteus species, and aspergillus fumigatus were spread-plated on open petri plates and independently fumigated with ozone or formaldehyde in a prototype laboratory poultry setter. ozone (1.52% to 1.65% by weight) resulted in bacterial reductions of greater than 4 to 7 log10 and fungal reductions of greater than 4 log10, whereas formaldehyde achieved reductions of greater than 7 log10 and greater than 5 log10, respectively, after 8 min of exposure to either disinfectant. potential mutagenic effects were observed in ozonated e. coli colonies resulting in decreased superoxide dismutase activity and increased catalase activity when compared with nonozonated control colonies. in this study ozone reduced microorganism counts but not as much as formaldehyde. ozone may be used as a disinfectant against selected microorganisms, although further testing under actual hatchery conditions is needed before making recommendations to the industry.
conditions required for the antibacterial activity of zidovudine.
in a study to determine the conditions required for its antibacterial activity, zidovudine was found to be bactericidal against escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium in nutrient broth over 6 h. zidovudine was also found to be active against ten clinical isolates of salmonella and escherichia coli at 1 mg/l, which is a clinically achievable concentration of the drug. bacterial protein synthesis was required for the bactericidal activity of zidovudine against both escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. zidovudine was found to be inactive against non-dividing bacteria, as it was unable to kill bacteria of either species when they were suspended in pbs.
survival and activity of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli in tropical  freshwater.
the survival of salmonella typhimurium lt2 and escherichia coli was studied in situ in a tropical rain forest watershed using membrane diffusion chambers. numbers were determined by acridine orange staining and a coulter counter. population activity was determined by microautoradiography, cell respiration, frequency of dividing cells, and by nucleic acid composition. numbers of salm, typhimurium and e. coli decreased less than 1 log unit after 105 h as measured by direct count methods. activity as measured by respiration, acridine orange activity, frequency of dividing cells, and microautoradiography indicated that both bacteria remained moderately active during the entire study. after 24 h, e. coli was more active than salm. typhimurium, as measured by nucleic acid composition, and frequency of dividing cells. both e. coli and salm. typhimurium survived and remained active in this tropical rain forest watershed for more than 5 d, suggesting that salm. typhimurium may be of prolonged public health significance once it is introduced into tropical surface waters. as e. coli was active and survived for a long time in this natural environment, it would seem to be unsuitable as an indicator of recent faecal contamination in tropical waters.
augmentation of resistance of mice to bacterial infection by a polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (pspg) extracted from lactobacillus casei.
a water-soluble polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (pspg) was prepared from heat-killed lactobacillus casei by digesting the bacteria with n-acetylmuramidase. the molecular weight of pspg was over 30,000, and the polysaccharide portion of pspg, its main component was composed of rhamnose, glucose, galactose, glucosamine and galactosamine. mice pretreated intraperitoneally with pspg survived after a lethal infection with listeria monocytogenes or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the growth of infecting bacteria (l. monocytogenes, p. aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli) in both the peritoneal cavity and the liver was inhibited markedly in the mice that had been treated with pspg. it was suggested that macrophages may be the main effector for the anti-infectious effect of pspg since treatment of mice with carrageenan, a selective macrophage blocker, markedly reduced the anti-infectious effect of pspg.
comparative in vitro activity of the new oral cephalosporin cefixime.
cefixime was 8 to 10 times more active than cefaclor and augmentin against isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi, mic90 values ranging from 0.06 to 0.25 micrograms/ml. however, none of these three drugs was particularly active against isolates of more resistant gram-negative bacilli such as enterobacter, serratia, citrobacter, acinetobacter, providencia and achromobacter spp. the lowest mic values for gram-negative bacilli were seen with ciprofloxacin, except for isolates of acinetobacter, where cotrimoxazole was the most active of the five drugs studied. augmentin and ciprofloxacin exhibited the lowest mics for isolates of streptococci and corynebacteria. although cefixime may be among the most active oral beta-lactam drugs, it does not appear to be useful for treatment of infections caused by more resistant gram-negative bacilli.
analysis of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli by using agents which specifically block incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate.
antibacterial agents which specifically inhibit ctp:cmp-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase activity were used to block the incorporation of 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate (kdo) into lipopolysaccharide. lipopolysaccharide synthesis ceased, molecules similar in structure to lipid a accumulated, and bacterial growth ceased following addition of such agents to cultures of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli. although four major species of lipid a accumulated in s. typhimurium, their kinetics of accumulation were different. the least polar of the major species was iva [o-(2-amino-2-deoxy-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-(1----6)-2-amino-2-deoxy-a lph a- d-glucose, acylated at positions 2, 3, 2', and 3' with beta-hydroxymyristoyl groups and bearing phosphates at positions 1 and 4'], a molecule previously isolated from bacteria containing a kdsa mutation (c. r. h. raetz, s. purcell, m. v. meyer, n. qureshi, and k. takayama, j. biol. chem. 260:16080-16088, 1985). species iva accumulated first and to the greatest extent following addition of the inhibitor, with other more polar derivatives appearing only after iva attained half its maximal level. in contrast, only two major species of precursor accumulated in e. coli following addition of the inhibitor. one of these species was identical to iva from s. typhimurium on the basis of chemical composition, fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy, and comigration on silica gel h, and it also accumulated prior to a more polar species of related structure. we conclude that the addition of kdo to precursor species iva is the major pathway of lipid a-kdo formation in both s. typhimurium lt2 and e. coli and that accumulation of the more polar species lacking kdo only occurs in response to accumulation of species iva following inhibition of the normal pathway.
rapid response to osmotic upshift by osmoregulated genes in escherichia coli and  salmonella typhimurium.
the rapid in vivo response of both escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium osmoregulated genes to an osmotic upshift was analyzed in detail by using chromosomal operon fusions. within 10 min after the addition of 0.3 m nacl to the culture medium, the differential rates of expression of both an s. typhimurium prou-lac fusion and a prop-lac fusion increased by 180- and 17-fold respectively, while an e. coli ompc-lac fusion increased by 3.4-fold. for all three stimulated promoters, the increased rate of expression was maintained until about 40 min after the osmotic upshift. thereafter, prou expression continued at a steady-state rate that was 27-fold higher than that of the control, while prop and ompc expression fell to 1.4- and 2-fold of the control rates, respectively. in contrast, expression of an e. coli ompf-lac fusion decreased twofold within 2.5 min. for prou, the length of the lag phase, which preceded the onset of the rapid response, increased with the degree of osmotic upshift, above a threshold of 0.2 m nacl; the onset of the rapid prou response also preceded the resumption of growth. the rapid response phase, which was first quantitated for prou, prop, ompc, and ompf in this study, is an important component of the osmoregulation of these promoters. the addition of the osmoprotectant glycine betaine at the time of osmotic upshift decreased both the length of the rapid response and the subsequent steady-state of expression of prou.
effect of nutritional factors on aflatoxin b1 inhibition of growth in escherichia coli and salmonella typhi.
the extent of growth inhibition by aflatoxin b1 in s. typhi and e. coli was greater in the presence of sodium citrate or sodium phosphate, palmitic and stearic acid than aflatoxin b1 alone. the addition of amino acids (glycine or glutamic acid) stimulated growth in e. coli and inhibited in s. typhi in the presence of aflatoxin b1. other nutrients, such as yeast extract, lactose, or salt addition did not alter aflatoxin b1 antibacterial activity but decreased growth was observed in the presence of peptone.
[the function of salmonella typhi at different stages in the pathogenesis of typhoid infection].
the complex study of the adhesive, colicinogenic and antigenic properties of s. typhi of different origin has revealed that adhesive properties can be observed more frequently in the strains isolated from the blood and bile and are completely absent in the strains isolated from feces. s. typhi strains of various origin do not essentially differ in their sensitivity to colicins and in the capacity for their production. among the strains isolated from feces and bile, agents in the w-form occur more frequently than among the strains isolated from the blood. escherichia coli, isolated from typhoid patients and carriers at the moment of the persistence of s. typhi in the body, are characterized by faintly pronounced antagonistic properties, enhanced sensitivity to colicins and rather pronounced hemagglutinating activity.
inhibition of colonization of the chicken alimentary tract with salmonella typhimurium gram-negative facultatively anaerobic bacteria.
oral administration of strains of food poisoning salmonellas to day-old chickens  produced a profound inhibition in the subsequent colonization of the caeca by a strain of salmonella typhimurium given one day later. closely related genera were unable to produce a similar inhibition. the inhibition was not the result of bacteriophages produced by the first strain. neither was it the result of an immunological response by the host induced by the first strain. in additional experiments in day-old chickens, inhibition of an escherichia coli nalr strain and of a citrobacter sp. nalr strain was produced by the antibiotic-sensitive forms of the homologous strains while strains from other genera did not produce any inhibition. when an avirulent mutant of s. typhimurium was used for pre-treatment a statistically significant reduction in the excretion of the super-infecting s. typhimurium nalr strain over several weeks was produced. a genus specific inhibition was reproduced in vitro by mixed culture experiments. live cultures were necessary for in vitro inhibition. killed cells or a culture supernatant produced no inhibition.
evolution of the enterobacterial sula gene: a component of the sos system encoding an inhibitor of cell division.
the lexa-regulated sula (sfia) gene of escherichia coli encodes an unstable protein which inhibits cell division. by determining the nucleotide sequences of the corresponding genes from the related bacteria salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes and serratia marcescens it was found that the regulatory region and the lexa binding site (sos box) have been better conserved during evolution than the coding sequence. the n terminus of the sula protein [amino acid (aa) residues 1-30] has diverged extensively during the evolution of enterobacteriaceae, whereas the central region (aa residues 31-149) has been well conserved. at the c terminus a sequence showing some homology to the n protein of phage lambda was detected that may represent a recognition site for the lon protease, which is known to degrade both polypeptides. when expressed in e. coli, the foreign sula genes did not block cell division suggesting that their products are inactive. this may indicate that the n terminus of the sula protein is involved in recognizing the cell division apparatus.
neutralization and lipoprotein binding of lipopolysaccharides in tolerant rabbit  serum.
we examined the ability of sera drawn from rabbits made tolerant to lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli o18 to inhibit heterologous lps-induced gelation of limulus lysate. compared with a pool of pretolerant sera, a pool of tolerant sera from these rabbits neutralized 5.5-fold more lps from salmonella typhimurium, 4.9-fold more lps from pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 10.0-fold more lps from klebsiella pneumoniae. because previous studies have found that lps bound to lipoprotein is less toxic than unbound lps, we also studied the binding of lps lipoprotein fractions in the serum pools by using fractionation with a cesium chloride-equilibrium density gradient. radiolabeled lps from e. coli o113 bound much more rapidly to lipoprotein fractions in tolerant serum than in pretolerant serum (after 11 min of incubation, 66.1% vs. 16.5% binding, respectively).
inhibition of colonization of the chicken caecum with salmonella typhimurium by pre-treatment with strains of escherichia coli.
simultaneous oral administration of broth cultures of three strains of escherichia coli isolated from sewage and an abattoir strongly inhibited the colonization of a subsequently administered strain of salmonella typhimurium. the three strains were protective against the s. typhimurium strain under a variety of conditions: in different breeds and in chickens fed different diets. the strains were not equally effective against other salmonella strains. oral administration of the strains produced a statistically significant reduction in the excretion of the s. typhimurium strain over a period of 7 weeks.
stabilization of glucose-starved escherichia coli k12 and salmonella typhimurium  lt2 by peptidase-deficient mutants.
escherichia coli k12 and salmonella typhimurium lt2 cells were stabilized during  carbon starvation in the presence of peptidase-deficient mutant strains. the rate of loss of viability of the wild-type s. typhimurium strain was decreased an average of 2-fold, and the rate for the wild-type e. coli strain was decreased about 2.3-fold, when either was starved in the presence of the multiply peptidase-deficient s. typhimurium strain tn852; other peptidase-deficient strains exhibited similar stabilizing effects. starving wild-type s. typhimurium lt2 cells utilized peptides excreted by the starving peptidase-deficient cells for protein synthesis, and, to a lesser extent, as respiratory substrates. provision of free amino acids in steady-state levels to starving e. coli k12 cells in a cell recycle apparatus had a stabilizing effect similar to that of mixing with peptidase-deficient cells.
opp-lac operon fusions and transcriptional regulation of the escherichia coli trp-linked oligopeptide permease.
the transcriptional regulation of the escherichia coli trp-linked opp operon that encodes the oligopeptide permease was investigated by using lambda plac mu51-generated lac operon fusions. synthesis of beta-galactosidase by strains harboring oppa-lac, oppb-lac, and oppd-lac fusions occurred at a basal level when the fusion-containing strains were grown in minimal medium. the addition of l-leucine or l-alanine to exponentially growing, aerobic cultures or shifting the aerobic fusion-containing strains to anaerobic growth medium increased the synthesis of beta-galactosidase from all opp-lac fusions. when transcription of the opp operon was induced by l-leucine, the differential rate of beta-galactosidase synthesis from each opp-lac fusion increased 8- to 10-fold; this increased rate of lacz expression from the opp-lac fusions resulted in a 5- to 6-fold increase in total beta-galactosidase activity after maximum expression was achieved. importantly, when f'123 derivatives harboring independently isolated e. coli opp-lac operon fusions were introduced into e. coli and salmonella typhimurium, the data clearly demonstrated that the e. coli opp operon was expressed identically and responded to the same transcriptional regulatory signals in both e. coli and s. typhimurium. a comparison of beta-galactosidase synthesis by e. coli strains harboring an opp-lac operon fusion and either an oppe+ locus or an oppe mutation demonstrated that the reduction in peptide transport produced by the oppe mutation does not result from a decrease in the level of opp operon transcription.
sensitivity of a salmonella typhimurium aspc mutant to sulfometuron methyl, a potent inhibitor of acetolactate synthase ii.
sulfometuron methyl is a potent and specific inhibitor of acetolactate synthase ii in salmonella typhimurium. mutant strains sensitive to sulfometuron methyl on minimal medium were isolated following mutagenesis with tn10. a conditionally auxotrophic insertion mutant, strain sms409, which required aspartate at high temperatures or in the presence of tyrosine, was found among the 15 mutants isolated. the tn10 insertion in strain sms409 was mapped by conjugation and transduction to the region between aroa and pncb at 20 min on the chromosome of s. typhimurium; this location is similar to the genetic location of aspc in escherichia coli. the specific activity of the aspc product, aspartate aminotransferase, was severely reduced in strain sms409. this indicated that the tn10 insertion in strain sms409 inactivated aspc. an aspc mutant of e. coli was also inhibited by either sulfometuron methyl or tyrosine. we present a hypothesis which relates the observed alpha-ketobutyrate accumulation in sulfometuron methyl-inhibited cultures of strain sms409 to aspartate starvation.
glutathione: a protective agent in salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli as measured by mutagenicity and by growth delay assays.
cultures of some aerobically grown strains of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli contain up to 24 microm extracellular glutathione (gsh) [owens ro, hartman pe (1985): environ mutagen 7(suppl 3): 47] in addition to having intracellular gsh concentrations in the millimolar range. the addition of 26 microm gsh to cultures of salmonella typhimurium strain ta1534 partially protected the bacteria from the toxic effects causing growth delay by 54 microm n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng). when mnng was preincubated with equimolar gsh, the mutagenicity of the mnng was neutralized. the addition of micromolar gsh to cultures of an escherichia coli gsh- strain protected the cells from growth inhibition by micromolar concentrations of mercuric chloride, methyl mercuric chloride, silver nitrate, cisplatin, cadmium chloride, cadmium sulfate, and iodoacetamide. in the cases of mercuric chloride, cisplatin, mnng, silver nitrate, and iodoacetamide, reaction products with gsh were detected by paper chromatography. in contrast to reduced gsh, micromolar concentrations of oxidized glutathione (gssg) provided little or no protection and formed no detectable reaction products. export of gsh by enteric bacteria may provide an important defense mechanism against exogenous toxic agents otherwise active in the micromolar range.
efficiency of various bacterial suspensions derived from cecal floras of conventional chickens in reducing the population level of salmonella typhimurium in gnotobiotic mice and chicken intestines.
the antagonistic effect exerted towards salmonella typhimurium by the flora issued from conventional chickens was studied in gnotobiotic animals. in germfree chickens and mice inoculated with s. typhimurium, the highest bacterial counts were observed in ceca, and were not significantly different in either host. the protection afforded by the inoculation of cecal flora issued from a conventional chicken was more effective when this flora was inoculated first into germfree chickens than when it was given only after inoculation with s. typhimurium. administration of a cecal flora from a 15-day-old chick to gnotobiotic mice and chicken resulted in the inhibition of a further intestinal colonization by s. typhimurium in both hosts. sixteen strains were isolated among the predominant populations of the fecal flora from chicken flora recipient mice. association of 14 strains of strictly anaerobic bacteria with 2 strains of escherichia coli and streptococcus faecium only decreased the number of s. typhimurium in the ileum of gnotobiotic mice, but not in their cecum. anaerobe cultures were obtained from 10(-6) and 10(-8) dilutions prepared from the fecal flora of gnotobiotic recipient mice. antagonistic bacteria were present only in cultures from the 10(-6) dilution. cecal concentrations of volatile fatty acids were shown not to be the sole factor implicated in the antagonistic effect against s. typhimurium.
mutagenic characteristics of formaldehyde on bacterial systems.
the mutagenic characteristics of formaldehyde on bacteria were examined. all the  tester strains of escherichia coli deficient in dna-repair enzymes tested in the present study were significantly more sensitive to the killing effect of formaldehyde than the corresponding wild-type strain. among the e. coli b strains, h/r30r (wild-type) and hs30r (uvra) were mutable, whereas ng30 (reca) and o16 (pola) were not. there is no appreciable difference in mutation frequency of e. coli b between the wild-type and the uvra strains in a dose range below 4 mm. however, the mutation frequency of the wild-type strain started to decrease in a higher concentration range, whereas that of the uvra strain continued to increase linearly. this was confirmed with the e. coli b/r tester strains. the decrease in mutation frequency may be produced by prolongation of the lag period before entering the s-phase so as to give the cells a greater chance for dna repair through the excision mechanism. in fact, it was evidenced that formaldehyde retarded to a remarkable extent the initiation of dna synthesis of the cells at the higher dose range used for mutation assay. some discrepancies found between the results obtained in this study and those previously reported by nishioka (1973) were pointed out.
regulation of a cya-lac fusion by cyclic amp in salmonella typhimurium.
cya-lac and crp-lac operon fusions were isolated in salmonella typhimurium by using the phage mu d1(lac cts apr). both transduction and reversion analyses have indicated that lac expression is controlled by the appropriate promoter, e.g., either crpp or cyap. by using chromosomal mobilization techniques, we found that cya had a clockwise direction of transcription on the standard s. typhimurium map. the cya-lac fusions could be complemented by escherichia coli f'133, which covers cya, with a resultant 17 to 38% decrease in cya expression. cyclic amp was found to be able to repress the expression of the cya-lac fusion ninefold when present at 25 mm. this repression was not seen in crp backgrounds, and hence is mediated by the camp receptor protein. repression of cya was also found upon growth on carbon sources known to elicit high cyclic amp levels.
in vitro pyocin activity of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains pretreated with antibiotics.
fifty-six selected strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa belonging to 8 different pyocin types (h, i, 15, 6, pti-1, pti-2, pti-3, pti-4) were treated with subinhibitory concentrations (mic/2) of either gentamicin or carbenicillin. both treatments induced changes in pyocin patterns for all types but at different levels. the percentage of strains that retained their pyocin pattern were more or less equal in both treatments. in treated and untreated producers, the growth inhibition ability for 5 different strains of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli k12, e. coli eb, proteus vulgaris, salmonella typhi, shigella flexneri) was also investigated. in all pyocin patterns the number of producers that inhibit the growth of these strains was lower after treatment with gentamicin or with carbenicillin, a smaller decrease was detected in the latter treatment. it appeared that the subinhibitory concentrations of these antibiotics are capable of protecting the enterobacteriaceae strains from the action of the pyocins.
purification of a new restriction endonuclease, styi, from escherichia coli carrying the hsd+ miniplasmid.
a new restriction endonuclease, styi, free of contaminating nuclease activities,  has been isolated from escherichia coli carrying the hsd+ miniplasmid of salmonella typhi origin. in the presence of 10 mm mg2+, it recognizes and cleaves a hexanucleotide sequence of 5'-c decreases c(at)(at)gg. the advantages of the styi endonuclease include its stability, high yield (more than 2 x 10(3) units/g of wet cells), easy handling of producer cells, and the ability to recognize new sequences, ccaagg and ccttgg.
[protective properties of plasma from burned and irradiated rats in relation to the in vivo lethal effects of endotoxins].
the intraperitoneal injection of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli endotoxins into previously irradiated rats killed 80% of the animals within 24 hours. after the combined injection of these endotoxins with the heterologous plasma of intact rats mortality rate decreased to 12% and 19%, respectively. a deep burn of the skin, acute radiation sickness and combined radiation and thermal lesion did not abolish this phenomenon of humoral detoxication; at different periods after the action of heat, radiation or both the plasma of the test rats exerted its protective effect practically to the same extent as in the controls.
evidence for involvement of pyrh+ of an escherichia coli k-12 f-prime factor in inhibiting construction of hybrid merodiploids with salmonella typhimurium.
transconjugants were not recovered in matings between salmonella typhimurium and  escherichia coli k-12 strains carrying the chromosomal region between leu and argf on an f-prime factor, even when a restriction-deficient recipient was used. a mutant f-prime factor compatible for transfer to s. typhimurium was constructed by transposon mutagenesis and characterized as being deficient in directing the synthesis of ump kinase (encoded by pyrh). other compatible f-prime factors were readily constructed by employing a procedure designed to select for strains carrying f-prime factors harboring pyrh mutations.
effect of growth temperature on the acquisition of iron by salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli.
we have examined the effect of growth temperature on three systems normally induced under conditions of iron limitation: synthesis of the siderophore enterochelin (enterobactin), transport of ferric enterochelin, and production of the outer membrane protein which serves as the colicin i receptor. we found that although salmonella typhimurium produces less enterochelin when grown at 42 degrees c, synthesis of this siderophore was not diminished in escherichia coli grown under the same conditions. growth at 42 degrees c under a condition of iron stress led to a reduction in the ability of cells to transport ferric enterochelin in both organisms. a two- to threefold decrease in the number of colicin i receptors was observed in cells of e. coli or s. typhimurium grown at 42 degrees c as compared with the number of receptors observed in cells grown at 37 degrees c. the colicin i receptor was shown not to be inherently unstable at 42 degrees c. by using a cir-lacz operon fusion, it was shown that at least part of the decrease in receptor levels found in cells grown at high temperature was the result of decreased transcription of cir, the receptor structural gene. the effect of growth temperature on these systems was shown to be independent of fur, a regulatory element which mediates their enhanced production in response to iron stress. we suggest that a second regulatory element common to gene products involved in iron sequestration may be responsible for temperature regulation of these systems.
selection of ion channel elements in the serine and aspartate methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins of bacteria.
two plausible, transmembrane ion channel elements (these 'elements' are alpha-helical sequences of 24 amino acids in which polar, hydrophilic side chains occupy one side and hydrophobic side chains the other) have been identified in the serine chemoreceptor-methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein (mcp) (serr) of e. coli and the aspartate chemoreceptor-mcp (aspr) of s. typhimurium. that the chemoreceptor might serve as, or activate, an ion channel is supported strongly by the occurrence of membrane depolarization, specific peptide methylation and neurotoxin inhibition of response in the chemotaxis of s. aurantia (e.p. greenberg, refs. 13-18).
the survival of multi-antibacterial drug-resistant escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium in stored static slurry from a veal calf unit.
salmonella typhimurium phage type dt 193 survived in small numbers, in stored static slurry derived from veal calves, for the 7-week period of observation. the viable coliform count fell by 1 1/2 logs during the first 2 weeks of storage, thereafter there were only relatively small fluctuations in the coliform population. in all 735 of 752 escherichia coli isolates examined from eight samples of slurry were resistant to 3-6 antibacterial drugs. there was no dramatic change in the overall level of drug resistance amongst the e. coli with time. chloramphenicol resistance was recorded in 400 (55%) of the e. coli. it was always associated with multiple resistance, with 96% of the strains being resistant to 5 or 6 drugs, although the proportion of isolates of each of the ten most prevalent o-serotypes resistant to chloramphenicol was variable and ranged between none and 97.5%. the use of biotyping together with o-serotyping indicated that the e. coli population was extremely complex, although certain components of the population remained relatively stable within the dominant flora with time since several of the more common o-serotype/biotype combinations were isolated from more than half of the eight slurry samples examined.
mutagenicity of chloroalkene epoxides in bacterial systems.
6 alpha-chloroepoxides have been tested for in vitro activity in a variety of systems. the epoxides were cis- and trans-1-chloropropene oxide, cis- and trans-1,3-dichloropropene oxide, trichloroethylene oxide and tetrachloroethylene oxide. the epoxides were assayed for mutagenicity in the absence of metabolic activation in s. typhimurium ta1535 and e. coli wp2 uvra and for preferential inhibition of growth of dna-repair-deficient e. coli. all 6 epoxides possessed dna-modifying activity as evidenced by their ability to preferentially inhibit dna polymerase-deficient e. coli. all of the test chemicals except trichloroethylene oxide were mutagenic for s. typhimurium and all except trichloroethylene oxide and tetrachloroethylene oxide were mutagenic for e. coli wp2 uvra. cis- and trans-1,3-dichloropropene oxide were the most potent mutagens and dna modifiers. for all cases, the cis isomers were more active than the corresponding trans isomers. alpha-chloroepoxides are considered likely to be the active intermediates of the carcinogenic parent halo-olefins. these mutagenicity studies are considered relevant in assessing the carcinogenicity of the parent hydrocarbons.
killing of gram-negative bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes: role of an o2-independent bactericidal system.
previous studies have suggested that a cationic bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi) present in both rabbit and human polymorphonuclear leukocytes is the principal o2-independent bactericidal agent of these cells toward several strains of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium (1978. j. biol. chem. 253: 2664--2672; 1979. j. biol. chem. 254: 11000--11009). to further evaluate the possible role of this protein in the killing of gram-negative bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, we have measured the bactericidal activity of intact rabbit peritoneal exudate leukocytes under aerobic or anaerobic conditions and of intact human leukocytes from a patient with chronic granulomatous disease. anaerobic conditions were created by flushing the cells under a nitrogen stream. effective removal of oxygen was demonstrated by the inability of nitrogen-flushed leukocytes to mount a respiratory burst (measured as increased conversion of 1-[14c]glucose leads to 14co2 or by superoxide production) during bacterial ingestion. at a bacteria/leukocyte ratio of 10:1, killing of gram-positive, bpi-resistant, staphylococcus epidermidis is markedly impaired in the absence of oxygen (76.4 +/- 3.3% killing in room air, 29.2 +/- 8.2% killing in nitrogen). essentially all increased bacterial survival is intracellular. in contrast, both a nonopsonized rough strain (mr-10) and an opsonized smooth strain (ms) of s. typhimurium 395 are killed equally well in room air and nitrogen. a maximum of 70--80 mr-10 and 30--40 ms are killed per leukocyte either in the presence or absence of oxygen. there is no intracellular bacterial survival in either condition indicating that intracellular o2-independent bactericidal system(s) of rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes can at least match the leukocyte's ingestive capacity. whole homogenates and crude acid extracts manifest similar bactericidal capacity toward s. typhimurium 395. this activity can be accounted for by the bpi content of these cell fractions and is virtually eliminated by immune (anti-bpi), but not by preimmune goat igg-rich fractions. opsonization of smooth ms, required for bacterial killing by intact leukocytes, does not alter bacterial sensitivity to bpi in crude or purified form. leukocytes of a patient with chronic granulomatous disease killed ingested s. typhimurium 396 ms nearly as well as did normal leukocytes. the bactericidal activity toward e. coli (j5) of crude acid extracts of the cgd and normal human leukocytes was virtually the same and was nearly completely inhibited by anti-bpi igg-rich fractions, but not by preimmune igg-rich fractions. these findings suggest that the killing of gram-negative bacteria such as s. typhimurium by intact polymorphonuclear leukocytes may also be attributed to the action of bpi.
mutagenicity evaluation of kb-944, a new calcium antagonist, in the ames bacterial system.
evaluation of the mutagenic activity of diethyl 4-(benzothiazol-2-yl) benzylphosphonate (kb-944) was performed using bacteria. the method consisted of mutagens or kb-944 with and without metabolic activation, and two bacteria; salmonella typhimurium 5 test strains, ta 1535, ta 100, ta 1537, ta 1538 and ta 98, and escherichia coli wp 2 uvr a. results indicated that kb-944 had no mutagenic activity against s. typhimurium and e. coli.
mode of antibiotic action of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde from streptomyces viridans.
the free ligand, deferroviridomycin a, and its iron(ii) complex, viridomycin a, were detected in culture supernatant fluids of streptomyces viridans 1671 and were structurally characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde and tris(4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehydato-n3,o4)ferrate(ii), respectively. we investigated the antibiotic activity of the above compounds and of the chemically synthesized bis copper(ii), tris cobalt(iii), and tris nickel(ii) complexes against escherichia coli nihj, salmonella typhimurium lt-2z, staphylococcus aureus 209p, streptococcus faecium 10541, and bacillus cereus, t. the free ligand and its kinetically labile copper(ii) and nickel(ii) complexes displayed activity against all of the above organisms, whereas the kinetically inert iron(ii) and cobalt(iii) complexes displayed activity only against s. aureus and b. cereus. the antibiotic activity of the substitutionally labile metal complexes was attributed to dissociation of the free ligand. the mode of antibiotic action of the free ligand against e. coli appears to be interference with the structural and functional integrity of the cell membrane.
human alveolar macrophages: effects of endotoxin in vitro.
experiments were performed to evaluate the in vitro effects of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide on viability and function of human alveolar macrophages. alveolar macrophages were obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy and saline bronchial lavage from 12 normal, nonsmoking volunteers. cells were incubated with different concentrations of e. coli endotoxin for 1 and 24 h. endotoxin (10 microgram/ml and more) was cytotoxic for alveolar macrophages after 24 h of incubation and induced significant inhibition of phagocytosis, adherence, and spreading. the effects of endotoxin on alveolar macrophage viability and function were dose and time dependent and were not influenced by indomethacin. thus, human alveolar macrophages, like other mononuclear phagocytes, are extremely sensitive to endotoxin effects; these observations may be relevant in conditions in which endotoxin may be in contact with alveolar macrophages in vivo: endobronchial infections with gram-negative organisms, byssinosis, chronic bronchitis of grain handles, and humidifier fever.
mutagenicity of antibiotics in microbial assays. problems of evaluation.
5 antibiotics, 4 of which inhibit protein synthesis in different ways, and 1 of which inhibits bacterial cell-wall synthesis, were tested in a battery of microbial assays for possible genetic effects. all the antibiotics, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, gentamicin, oleandomycin and phosphonomycin induced forward mutation to l-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid resistance in escherichia coli wp2. this response was closely correlated with the toxic effects and was inferred to be deletion mutation. in addition, chloramphenicol was weakly active in reversion of the frame-shift mutation in salmonella typhimurium ta98, gentamicin caused petite induction in s. cerevisiae at ph 4.4--4.7 and tetracycline gave a significant reponse with gene conversion and petite induction also in s. cerevisiae but at ph 7.2. the results, particularly those with e. coli, cast doubts on the validity of testing specifically designed antibacterial agents in bacteria, and raise serious problems in the evaluation of such data in terms to human populations.
effect of nosiheptide as a feed additive in chicks on the quantity, duration, prevalence of excretion, and resistance to antibacterial agents of salmonella typhimurium; on the proportion of escherichia coli and other coliforms resistant to antibacterial agents; and on their degree and spectrum of resistance.
in the first experiment two groups (b and d) each of ten, 15-day-old chicks were  fed for 33 days a diet supplemented with nosiheptide (20 g/t) and 2 groups (a and c) of 10 each a diet without medication. groups a and b were inoculated with salmonella typhimurium, var. copenhagen (variant resistant to nalidixic acid of the strain dvr 101) 5 days after treatment was started. at intervals of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 21, and 28 days postinoculation the following data were collected: the number of salmonella excreted per gram of feces, their duration and prevalence of excretion, and the proportion of salmonella resistant to 9 antibacterial agents commonly used in human and veterinary medicine, as well as their degree and spectrum of resistance. in the second experiment two groups of 10 chicks each were fed either a basal diet (control group) or a diet supplemented with nosiheptide at 20 g/t (treated group). immediately before and at the end of treatment, the proportions of fecal coliforms, particularly e. coli, which were resistant to 11 commonly used antibacterial agents, and their degree and spectrum of resistance were determined in the 2 groups of chicks. all the strains isolated before treatment started were e. coli sensitive to the 11 antibacterial agents. the strains isolated at the end of treatment were coliforms otherthan e. coli (40% in the control group, 32% in the treated group) and e. coli (60 and 68%, respectively). coliforms other than e. coli were, as is usual, resistant to ampicillin and sensitive to the other antibacterial agents. the e. coli strains were either sensitive to all the antibacterial agents or resistant to tetracycline and furazolidone (51.8% in the control group, 34.1% in the treated group), or resistant to furazolidone alone (3.7% in the control group, 5.8% in the treated group). in both experiments these determinations showed no appreciable differences between treated and untreated chicks.
cellular effects in microbial tester strains caused by exposure to microwaves or  elevated temperatures.
several tester strains of salmonella typhimurium, ta-98, ta-100, ta-1535, and ta-1538; escherichia coli, w3110 (pol a+) and p3438 (pol a-, repair deficient); and saccharomyces cerevisiae, d3, d4, and d5 were tested for lethal and mutagenic events when exposed to elevated temperatures or to x-band, pulsed microwave radiation at various power densities. when compared to e. coli pol a+ under growing conditions, e. coli pol a- exhibited decreased cell growth when exposed to microwave radiation at power levels at or above 20 mw/cm2 as well as to temperature levels above 42 degrees c. all yeast and other bacterial strains showed cellular lethality at similar microwave intensities and elevated temperatures. when exposed to elevated temperatures in saline, both quiescent yeast and salmonella strains exhibited lethal events. however, the salmonella strains tested showed comparatively less induction of genetic events in the quiescent state compared to induction when the cell were actively growing in broth. these results demonstrate that elevated temperatures generated by microwave exposure could produce genetic events in microbial assay systems. if such systems are to be of value in examining the nonthermal genetic potential of microwave radiation, careful control over exposure conditions will be required to eliminate heat-induced genetic events.
plasmid (pkm101)-mediated weigle reactivation in escherichia coli k12 and salmonella typhimurium lt2: genetic dependence, kinetics of induction, and effect of chloramphenicol.
in escherichia coli k12 the reactivation of uv-irradiated phage in uv-irradiated  cells (weigle reactivation) is inhibited if the protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol is present during the post-irradiation incubation. in contrast, in e. coli k12 or salmonella typhimurium lt2 containing the plasmid pkm101 the kinetics of the w-reactivation response were not affected by chloramphenicol. under the conditions used, protein synthesis was greater than 99% inhibited and no preferential synthesis of plasmid-coded proteins was apparent in the residual protein synthesis. this increased capacity to reactivate irradiated phage decayed over 2 h if the cells were allowed to grow but was relatively stable if they were incubated in 10 mm mgso4. whereas the capacity of uv-irradiated bacteria with or without pkm101 to carry out w-reactivation had largely decayed by the end of a 2 h post-irradiation incubation in minimal-glucose with chloramphenicol, the capacity to synthesize high levels of the reca protein had not. post-irradiation treatment with chloramphenicol did not abolish the uv-protective effect of pkm101 or r46. pkm101-mediated w-reactivation is reca+-dependent in s. typhimurium and reca+ lexa+-dependent in e. coli k-12. the inefficiency of s. typhimurium lt2 relative to e. coli in carrying out w-reactivation is not due to the presence of the cryptic plasmid in the lt2 strains. two possible models are discussed.
the control of bacterial contamination in carcass meal with propionic acid.
the effect of the addition of 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10% respectively of propionic acid on known numbers of bacteria added to or contained in carcass meal was examined. escherichia coli was totally inhibited by 2% propionic acid, while 5% of the acid both inhibited salmonella typhimurium and brought about a 74,7% reduction in the total aerobic bacterial count.
absence of competition between salmonella phage p22 and coliphage p1 for adsorption sites on a salmonella typhosa - escherichia coli hybrid strain.
salmonella typhimurium mutants sensitive to coliphage p1 are resistant to salmonella phage p22 and lose their p1-sensitivity upon reversion to p22-sensitivity. a tryptophan-requiring salmonella typhosa - escherichia coli hybrid, which has the unique ability to serve as recipient in transduction mediated by both p22 and p1, was sued to determine if p22 and p1 adsorb at the same or overlapping sites: (i) the adsorption of each of p1 and p22 is similar when added individually or together to the hybrid at a saturating multiplicity of infection (moi). (ii) p1 grown on trp+ e. coli yields the maximum frequency of trp+ abortive transductions at an moi of 6 with the trp hybrid recipient; the presence of increasing numbers of p22 grown on trp s. typhimurium does not decrease the number of trp+ transduction from p1. (iii) a mixture of p1 (grown on trp+ e. coli) and p22 (grown on trp+ s. typhimurium) yields more abortive transductions than does p1 alone. thus phages p1 and p22 adsorb to the hybrid cells on different sites.
2-amino-5-methyl-5-hexenoic acid, a methionine analog produced by streptomyces sp. mf374-c4.
2-amino-5-methyl-5-hexenoic acid (amha), a new methionine analog, was isolated from a fermentation broth of streptomyces sp. mf374-c4 based on its reversal of the effect of n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) in a test system that determines the size of growth zones of revertants (his+) of salmonella typhimurium ta1535. amha also inhibited growth of the tester strain in a synthetic medium. these amha activities were abolished by methionine. the incidence of spontaneous streptomycin-resistant mutations of escherichia coli k12 was not decreased by amha at concentrations where cell growth was partially inhibited. amha inhibited protein synthesis but not dna or rna synthesis in s. typhimurium ta1535 and e. coli k-12. the analog inhibited formation of methionyl-trna but not of valyl-trna in a cell-free system of e. coli, and supported atp-ppi exchange in the cell-free system. at concentrations where it inhibited cell growth, amha decreased the number of foci, induced by rous sarcoma virus, on cultured sheets of chick-embryo fibroblasts. the effects of amha on focus formation and on the cell growth were overcome by methionine.
mutants defective in the 33k outer membrane protein of salmonella typhimurium.
salmonella typhimurium lt2 lines, if phenotypically rough, are fully sensitive to bacteriocin 4-59, produced by salmonella canastel strain sl1712. bacteriocin-resistant mutants fell into three classes. those resistant to phage es18 and to albomycin proved to be mutants of class chr (equivalent to tonb of escherichia coli); these mutants still adsorb the bacteriocin and so are classified as tolerant. another class of (incompletely) tolerant mutants was resistant to phage ph51; their envelope fractions lacked the band corresponding to outer membrane protein 34k, known to serve for adsorption of phage ph51. a third class of mutants, which did not adsorb the bacteriocin, was unaltered in sensitivity to phages. their envelopes lacked the 33k band, indicating absence of the outer membrane protein 33k, considered to correspond to outer membrane protein ii* of e. coli, which in that species is determined at locus ompa (formerly tolg or con). phage p22 ht105/1 cotransduced the 33k s. typhimurium gene (to be called ompa, to accord with e. coli usage) with pyrd+ at about 30% frequency when the donor allele was ompa+ or one ompa, but at only 3 to 11% when the donor allele was another ompa. when the donor carried either of two long deletions of the put (proline utilization) operon, phage p22 ht105/1 cotransduced put (and ompa+) with pyrd+ at low frequency. the cotransduction data indicate that ompa of s. typhimurium is located between pyrd and put, nearer the former. this corresponds to the map position of ompa in e. coli k-12.
evaluation of the mutagenicity and dna-modifying activity of carcinogens and noncarcinogens in microbial systems.
the mutagenicity of 99 chemicals was determined in a standard salmonella typhimurium assay with the use of strains ta1535 and ta1538; the dna-modifying capacity was determined with normal and dna polymerase-deficient escherichia coli strains. the following categories of chemicals were studied: alkylating agents (15); nitrosamines, hydrazines, and related substances (8); heterocyclics (10); aromatic amines (36); polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (11); amides, ureas, and acylating agents (7); antimetabolites (5); inorganics (4); and promoters (3). of the substances studied, 21 were known noncarcinogens, 21 were ultimate carcinogens, and 45 were procarcinogens. of the noncarcinogens, 35, 30, and 25% were positive in the salmonella, e. coli, and both systems, respectively. all of the ultimate carcinogens were detectable as mutagens of dna-modifying agents; 79, 100, and 79% gave positive tests in the salmonella, e. coli, and both systems, respectively. of the procarcinogens 72% were identifiable by these procedures: 52, 67, and 48% in the salmonella, e. coli, and both assays, respectively. a tabulation of the combined data for ultimate carcinogens and procarcinogens indicates that 77% of the carcinogens gave positive results: 61, 74, and 59% in the salmonella, e. coli, and both assays, respectively. we suggest that, for prescreening procedures with microbial assays, s. typhimurium strains ta98 and ta100 be included and the standard e. coli dna polymerase-deficient assay be run in tandem with the salmonella mutagenicity assay. when the standard e. coli dna polymerase-deficient assay does not give interpretable results because of the lack of zones of growth inhibition, a modified assay with the use of liquid suspension should be performed.
combined effect of intercalating agents and antibiotics on r-factor carrying bacteria in broth culture.
growth of salmonella typhimurium lt2 and escherichia coli k12 bearing any of four r-factors of the fi+ and fi- group in repressed and derepressed form was not inhibited by a combination of ethidium bromide with ampicillin and kanamycin.
[r factors influence on motility of "e. coli" and "s. typhimurium" (author's transl)].
influence on the motility of e. coli and s. typhimurium strains by several r factors has been studied; both classes of inhibiting and stimulating r factors have been detected; the plasmidic effect on the motility can be inverted by transfer to another carrier strain.
marmoset species variation in the humoral antibody response: in vivo and in vitro studies.
a comparison of the in vivo and in vitro antibody response capabilities of two marmoset species, saguinus fuscicollis and saguinus oedipus oedipus, revealed the former to be superior in elaborating humoral antibody. in vivo challenges with escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps) and salmonella typhi flagella consistently yielded higher antibody titres in s. fuscicollis; indeed, with lps antigen, multiple inoculations of s.o. oedipus marmosets led ultimately to a decrease in antibody formation, in contrast to the anamnestic response of s. fuscicollis. this species differential in immune competence was also suggested in the in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood leucocytes (pbl) and spleen cells with sheep red blood cells (rbc). none of 55 s.o. oedipus pbl cultures and 49 of 89 (55%) s. fuscicollis cultures responded to the test antigen. a similar differential in response to sheep rbc was noted with the spleen cells of each species, although this report contrasts the antibody-forming potential of two marmoset species, a comparison of the immunological response profile of marmosets to those of other laboratory animals challenged with similar antigens suggests these primates may be relatively incompetent. the possible relationship between the haemopoietic chimerism of marmosets and a diminished immune competence is discussed.
antibacterial activity of cefamandole in vitro.
cefamandole, a new cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against a cross-section of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated clinically. gram-positive cocci, except for streptococcus faecalis, were extremely susceptible to cefamandole; penicillin g-resistant staphylococcus aureus also was highly susceptible. minimal bactericidal concentrations for gram-positive cocci approximated the minimal inhibitory concentrations. strains of haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to the drug. most strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and proteus species were inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole, salmonella typhi, including ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant strains, was inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole. susceptible bacteria became increasingly resistant as the inoculum size was increased. strains of pseudomonas were resistant to cefamandole.
permease-specific mutations in salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli that release the glycerol, maltose, melibiose, and lactose transport systems from regulation by the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system.
several carbohydrate permease systems in salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli are sensitive to regulation by the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. mutant salmonella strains were isolated in which individual transport systems had been rendered insensitive to regulation by sugar substrates of the phosphotransferase system. in one such strain, glycerol uptake was insensitive to regulation; in another, the maltose transport system was resistant to inhibition; and in a third, the regulatory mutation specifically rendered the melibiose permease insensitive to regulation. an analogous mutation in e. coli abolished inhibition of the transport of beta-galactosides via the lactose permease system. the mutations were mapped near the genes which code for the affected transport proteins. the regulatory mutations rendered utilization of the particular carbohydrates resistant to inhibition and synthesis of the corresponding catabolic enzymes partially insensitive to repressive control by sugar substrates of the phosphotransferase system. studies of repression of beta-galactosidase synthesis in e. coli were conducted with both lactose and isopropyl beta-thiogalactoside as exogenous sources of inducer. employing high concentrations of isopropyl beta-thiogalactoside, repression of beta-galactosidase synthesis was not altered by the lactose-specific transport regulation-resistant mutation. by contrast, the more severe repression observed with lactose as the exogenous source of inducer was partially abolished by this regulatory mutation. the results support the conclusions that several transport systems, including the lactose permease system, are subject to allosteric regulation and that inhibition of inducer uptake is a primary cause of the repression of catabolic enzyme synthesis.
mutagenicity of fume particles from stainless steel welding.
welding fume particles collected from different welding procedures were tested for mutagenicity in escherichia coli, with the inhibition zone in pol a- as compared to pol a+, and in salmonella typhimurium, ta 100 strain. while no mutagenicity was found with mild steel welding, a mutagenic effect was established with samples from stainless steel welding. this mutagenicity was particularly associated with manual metal arc (mma) welding, and less so with metal inert-gas welding. a decrease in or an elimination of the effect occurred with a liver microsomal metabolizing system (s-9 mix). the mma samples produced the strongest mutagenic effect. more-detailed investigations on these samples showed that the mutagenic agent(s) is water soluble. an increased mutagenicity, which also revealed the induction of frame shift mutations, was found with ta 98. the same welding fume sample was used for a mutagenicity test (resistance to 6-thioguanine) with v 79 hamster cells. because of the high toxicity of these welding fume particles on the cells, only very low concentrations could be tested, but the increase of mutations, when compared to the negative control, was significant. it is suggested that hexavalent chromium may be involved in the mutagenic effect of the welding fumes.
comparative studies of rna polymerase subunits from various bacteria.
the molecular structure of rna polymerases from escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella anatum,serratia marcescens, aerobacter aerogens, proteus mirabilis and bacillus subtilis were compared based on:i) inhibition of the enzyme activity by treatment with antibodies against e. coli rna polymerase subunits;ii) analysis of antibody precipitates by sodium ododecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and iii) analysis of antibody precipitates by urea-isoelectrofocusing followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-slab gel electrophoresis in the second dimension. all the bacterial rna polymerases examined cross-react equally with anti-e. coli holopolymerase but exhibit different extents of cross-reaction with antibodies against individual subunits. except for b. subtilis rna polymerase, the molecular weight and isoelectric point of the enzyme subunits are close to those of e. coli polymerase. however, minor difference were found at least within the resolution of the techniques employed:s. anatum polymerase has sigma subunit larger than e. coli sigma subunit; p. mirabilis enzyme has sigma subunit larger in size and more acidic in charge, and alpha subunit smaller and more basic than corresponding e. coli subunits. the electrophoretic map of b. subtilis enzyme subunits is completely different from that of e. coli enzyme.
genetics of sensitivity of salmonella species to colicin m and bacteriophages t5, t1, and es18.
nearly all of 62 strains of salmonella paratyphi b were sensitive to colicin m and phage t5 but resistant to phages t1 and es18 and to colicin b. all tested s. typhimurium strains were resistant to colicin m and phage t5, and many were sensitive to phage es18. a rough s. typhimurium lt2 strain given the tona region of escherichia coli or s. paratyphi b became sensitive to colicin m and phage t5. we infer that the tona allele of s. paratyphi b, like that of e. coli, determines an outer membrane protein that adsorbs t5 and colicin m but not phage es18, whereas the s. typhimurium allele determines a protein able to adsorb only es18. the partial t1 sensitivity of a rough lt2 strain with a tona allele from e. coli or s. paratyphi b and also the tonb(+) phentotype of an e. coli b trp-tonb delta mutant carrying an f' trp of lt2 origin showed that s. typhimurium lt2 has a tonb allele like that of e. coli with respect to determination of sensitivity to colicins and phage t1. rough s. paratyphi b, although t5 sensitive, remained resistant to t1 even when given f' tonb(+) of e. coli origin. classes of salmonella mutants selected as resistant to colicin m included: t5-resistant mutants, probably tona(-); mutants unchanged except for m resistance, perhaps tolerant; and exb(+) mutants, producing a colicin inhibitor (presumably enterochelin). some exb(+) mutants were resistant to a bacteriocin inactive on e. coli but active on all tested s. paratyphi b and s. typhimurium strains (and on nearly all other tested salmonella). a survey showed sensitivity to colicin m in several other species of salmonella.
[entobacterial transformation by r6k plasmid dna].
preparations of dna of r6k plasmide obtained by various methods on the basis of the "clarified" lysate: by gel filtration on sepharose 4b, centrifugation in cesium chloride with ethidium bromide gradient, were analysed in the e. coli c600. s. typhimurium ag37, pr. vulgaris 4636, s. marcescens 20-10 transformation. the frequency of transformation proved to depend on the extent of dna purification. factors influencing the e. coli c600 competence and the transformation efficacy (the phase of the culture growth, the concentration of cells in the mixture with dna, thecacl2 concentration, the time of the cell incubation at 42 degrees c) were studied. kinetics of the phenotypical expression of the plasmide signs of ampicillin and streptomycin resistance in transformation was also studied in this work.
anatomical locus of the common enterobacterial antigen.
cell walls, membrane vesicles and the soluble cytoplasmic components have been isolated from escherichia coli 0:14 and salmonella typhimurium and examined by electron microscopy as well as hemagglutination inhibition with heterologous antisera for enterobacterial common antigen (eca). the outer and cytoplasmic membranes also were isolated and examined for common antigen. although common antigen was present in the isolated surface structures it was not localized exclusively in these fractions. additional experiments revealed that, whatever the nature of the integration of eca of kunin into the cell envelope, it is a much more stable association in e. coli 0:14 than in s. typhimurium.
production of a precursor to the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine.
the supernatant fluid from cultures of escherichia coli w-11, a pur e mutant, prevented the inhibition of growth of e. coli b in a medium containing adenine or adenosine. adenine inhibition was prevented more readily than adenosine inhibition. more than 90% of the biological activity of the supernatant fluid was recovered in the anionic fraction after treatment with dowex-50 (nh4+). the cationic fraction, containing large amounts of 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleoside (airs), did not prevent adenine inhibition. the w-11 supernatant fluid was shown by bioautography to contain only one compound that prevented adenine inhibition. proliferating and non-proliferating cultures produced only one compound that prevented adenine inhibition. the compound was shown to be an intermediate (int-1) in the biosynthesis of the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine, int-1 was stable during sterilization at 121 c for 15 min, during concentration by either flask evaporation or lyophilization, and after storage for several days at 4 c or at -- 20 c. int-1 was distinguishable from other known derivatives or intermediates of the pyrimidine moiety. a scheme is presented that illustrates the proposed relationship between int-1 and the synthesis of thiamine.
on the mode of action of 5-diazouracil on bacterial cell division.
cell division by strains of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium is inhibited by 5-diazouracil (5-du). division recovers in the presence of the inhibitor after a period which is temperature-dependent. recovery is probably due to breakdown of 5-du and the rate of this breakdown is apparently increased at alkaline ph. growth with 5-du caused only a slight reduction in the rate of murein synthesis and no alteration in the properties or composition of membranes of s. typhimurium. the agent caused chaining in streptococcus fecalis and inhibition of the penicillin-induced lysis of s. typhimurium. these effects may have been due to direct inhibition of lysin activity but an indirect effect seems more likely. the most marked effect of 5-du on s. typhimurium was to cause a transient inhibition of dna synthesis. since 5-du did not stop uncoupled cell division (i.e. division occurring independently of dna replication) and since lon- strains were more sensitive to 5-du than lon+ strains, it was concluded that 5-du acts on cell division via an inhibitory effect on dna replication.
effect of chemical modification by (di)imidoesters on cells and cell envelope components of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium.
cells and cell envelope components of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium were treated with mono- and bifunctional imidates like methylbutyrimidate, methyl-4-mercaptobutyrimidate and dimethylsuberimidate, and after determination of the appropriate conditions, the effects on structure and function were investigated. within 10 min after treatment of the bacteria with 5 mm of the (di)imidoesters, active transport, dna-, rna-, protein- and lipid-synthesis were severely inhibited. after crosslinking, cell envelope components, e.g. phospholipids, lipopolysaccharide, and periplasmic proteins, became partly inextractable. crosslinked cells showed increased resistance to ultrasonic treatment and osmotic or detergent induced lysis. by the reaction of (di)imidoesters with phospholipids containing no amino groups, it could be demonstrated that non-amidine products were also formed. in addition, freeze-fracturing and freeze-etching demonstrated distinct crosslinked areas in the cell envelope of e. coli b.
gene expression of the histidine operon.
histidine biosynthesis in salmonella typhi-murium and escherichia coli is regulated through repression and feedback inhibition. repression is triggered by the intracellular level of histidyl-trna whereas feedback inhibition is brought about by histidine itself, an allosteric inhibitor of the first biosynthetic enzyme. several lines of evidence indicate that these two processes are interconnected and the first biosynthetic enzyme is itself a regulatory molecule for the his operon. the regulation seems to be exerted in a negative fashion, although a positive control cannot be excluded.
on the mechanism of inhibition of enzyme induction in escherichia coli by distamycin a.
the mechanism of the interference of the antiviral antibiotic distamycin a with the bacterial cell has been investigated. labelled distamycin a is firmly bound by e. coli cells and the binding process does not require metabolic energy as indicated by the use of inhibitors. the antibiotic does not induce gross alteration in the cell membrane but inhibits cyclic amp accumulation in the cells exposed to a glucose-free medium. this inhibition is concomitant with that exerted on the synthesis of an inducible enzyme such as beta-galactosidase. by the method of pulse induction it appears that distamycin a exterts its inhibiting effect on inducible synthesis at the level of transcription. this effect is probably related to an interference with the positive control of enzyme synthesis performed via the system represented by cyclic amp and the crp protein.
mutations affecting aromatic amino acid transport in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium.
a genetic locus, arot, located between chr and the trp operon in salmonella typhimurium, and similar genes, aror and aros, near the trp locus of escherichia coli, were found to be involved in the transport of aromatic amino acids. genetic lesions at these loci cause a variable diminution in uptake and accumulation of aromatic amino acids, alanine and glycine compared with the wild type. the f'trp episome carries the aro r locus. curing an e. coli strain of the f'trp episome which covers a chromosomal deletion from cysb through the trp operon and tonb regions, results in a 60 to 80% decrease in tryptophan uptake. the introduction of f'trp into a trp operon-deleted s. typhimurium of low transport ability restores transportability, suggesting that arot in this organism may be homologous with aror in e. coli. in e. coli, tryptophan accumulation is normally increased by prior growth in l-tryptophan, while in s. typhimurium it is repressed. in both genera, the trpr gene appears to have no effect on the tryptophan transport capabilities in response to changes in the concentration of l-tryptophan in the medium. tryptophan transport in the s. typhimurium f'trp hybrid was subject to repression, while in the e. coli strain which carries f'trp covering the equivalent chromosomal delection, an increase in tryptophan accumulation was shown after growth in l-tryptophan supplemented medium.
minimal inhibitory concentrations of twenty antimicrobial agents to animal pathogens.
minimal inhibitory concentration (m.i.c.) values as determined by an agar-plate-dilution method for 60 bacterial isolates, consisting of salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus of animal origin against 20 antimicrobial drugs are presented. of all the drugs, gentamicin had the best in vitro antibacterial activity in terms of m.i.c. when considering all the species of organisms together, while spectinomycin had the least activity.an inoculum replicator was a convenient tool in carrying out the agar-plate-dilution method.a comparison of the m.i.c. values of 42 isolates of s. typhimurium with the results obtained by low level method and the bauer-kir-by method showed that with few exceptions, there is a general agreement.
outer membrane proteins of escherichia coli. iv. differences in outer membrane proteins due to strain and cultural differences.
when the 42,000-dalton major outer membrane protein of escherichia coli o111 is examined on alkaline polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, it is resolved into three distinct bands designated as proteins 1, 2, and 3. band 3 consists of two distinct polypeptides, proteins 3a and 3b. e. coli k-12 does not make any protein 2, but makes proteins similar to 1, 3a, and 3b as indicated by comparison of cyanogen bromide peptide patterns. several shigella species and most other strains of e. coli resemble e. coli k-12 in that they lack protein 2, whereas salmonella typhimurium is more similar to e. coli o111. in addition to these species and strain differences, cultural differences resulted in differences in the outer membrane protein profiles. under conditions of catabolite repression, the level of protein 2 in e. coli o111 decreased while the level of protein 1 increased. an enterotoxin-producing strain similar to e. coli o111 produced no protein 1 and an elevated level of protein 2 under conditions of low catabolite repression. the levels of proteins 1 and 3 are also different in different phases of the growth curve, with protein 1 being the major species in the exponential-phase cells and protein 3 being the major species in stationary-phase cells. a multiply phage-resistant mutant of e. coli k-12 with no obvious cell wall defects produced no protein 1 or 2, but made increased amounts of protein 3. thus, the major outer membrane proteins of e. coli and related species may vary considerably without affecting outer membrane integrity.
new method for study of peptide transport in bacteria.
the transport system for glycylmethionine in escherichia coli b and salmonella typhimurium lt2 was examined by a new approach which may be applied to other types of exogenous materials. physiological auxotrophs were prepared by growing wild strains in a methionine-containing medium to repress the methionine biosynthetic enzymes. immediate protein synthesis was shown to take place in such physiological auxotrophs only in the presence of either exogenous methionine or a methionine peptide, e.g., glycylmethionine. protein synthesis was dependent on glycylmethionine taken up by the cell and was indicated by assaying for the inducible enzyme lysine decarboxylase at 5- to 15-min intervals. uptake was studied by using low concentrations of glycylmethionine, therefore making uptake by permease the limiting step in incorporation of methionine into protein, and by addition of competitor peptides to media containing saturating concentrations of glycylmethionine. lysine decarboxylase activity in s. typhimurium lt2 was about 80 times that present in e. coli b. glycylmethionine transport had a k(m) of the order of 1 mum in s. typhimurium. structural specificities observed for peptide transport by other workers were confirmed for e. coli b. competitive inhibition of glycylmethionine uptake by dipeptides was observed in e. coli.
bacteriophage restriction in salmonella typhimurium by r factors and transfer factors.
a total of 2716 r factors and transfer factors isolated from escherichia coli and salmonellas of human and animal origin were studied for their phage-restrictive effects in salmonella typhimurium phage type 36. all of 1402 wild fi(+) factors were non-restricting. the f factor of e. coli k12 was unique among the f-like factors tested in that it inhibited lysis of type 36 by one typing phage. in contrast, eleven distinct changes in the phage type of 36 were produced by fi(-) i-like factors. i-like plasmids can thus be subdivided by this method.i-like r factors and transfer factors from human and animal enterobacteria were categorized by their phage-restrictive effects in type 36. factors resembling delta in this respect predominated among fi(-) i-like factor from human e. coli and s. typhimurium and from porcine e. coli. delta-like and coli-like fi(-) factors were equally distributed in bovine s. typhimurium. coli-like factors were commonest in bovine and avian e. coli.
lipopolysaccharide layer protection of gram-negative bacteria against inhibition  by long-chain fatty acids.
growth, amino acid transport, and oxygen consumption of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium are inhibited by short-chain (c(2)-c(6)) but not by medium or long-chain fatty acids (c(10)-c(18)) at concentrations at which these processes are completely inhibited in bacillus subtilis. the resistance of gram-negative organisms is not correlated with their ability to metabolize fatty acids, since an e. coli mutant unable to transport oleic acid is still resistant. however, mutants of both e. coli and s. typhimurium in which the lipopolysaccharide layer does not contain the residues beyond the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate core are inhibited by medium (c(10)) but not by long-chain (c(18)) fatty acids. furthermore, removal of a portion of the lipopolysaccharide layer by ethylenediaminetetraacetate treatment renders the organisms sensitive to medium and partially sensitive to long-chain fatty acids. the intact lipopolysaccharide layer of gram-negative organisms apparently screens the cells against medium and long-chain fatty acids and prevents their accumulation on the inner cell membrane (site of amino acid transport) at inhibitory concentrations. these results are relevant to the use of antimicrobial food additives, and they allow the characterization of gram-positive versus gram-negative bacteria and their lipopolysaccharide mutants.
regulation of methionyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase formation in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium.
the control of methionyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (trna) synthetase (l-methionine: soluble rna ligase [adenosine monophosphate]) was studied in methionyl-trna synthetase mutants of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the results of activity determinations with crude extracts indicate that this enzyme of the e. coli mutant strain possessed a reduced affinity for methionine-trna, whereas this enzyme of the s. typhimurium mutant exhibited a decreased affinity for l-methionine. the differential rate of methionyl-trna synthetase formation in these two mutants was several-fold greater than that of the respective parental strains. on the other hand, the level of in vivo aminoacylation of methionine-trna was only about one-third that of the parent strains. these results suggest that aminoacylation of methionine-trna is a necessary step in repression control of methionyl-trna synthetase of both e. coli and s. typhimurium strains.
effect of the proline analogue baikiain on proline metabolism in salmonella typhimurium.
a proline analogue, 4,5-dehydro-l-pipecolic acid (baikiain) induces the formation in salmonella typhimurium of the two enzymes catalyzing the degradation of proline, proline oxidase and delta(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (p5c) dehydrogenase. the level of induction by 20 mm baikiain is about 10% of the maximum level induced by proline. since the analogue is a substrate of proline oxidase the first enzyme of the proline catabolic pathway, the oxidation derivative rather than baikiain itself might be the actual effector. baikiain is also an inducer of proline oxidase in escherichia coli k-12 and e. coli w. an additional effect of this analogue on proline degradation in s. typhimurium is inhibition of p5c dehydrogenase. at a concentration of 5 x 10(-4)m, baikiain inhibits completely the growth of strains constitutive for proline oxidase. this inhibition, which can be overcome by proline, occurs in the presence or absence of p5c dehydrogenase activity. three spontaneously occurring mutants resistant to baikiain were isolated from constitutive strains. all are pleiotropic-negative for the proline-degrading enzymes. the sites of these mutations are linked to the put region. although the mechanism of toxicity has not been determined, baikiain provides a simple and direct selection for obtaining mutants unable to degrade proline. in addition, it allows selection for strains with an inducible rather than constitutive phenotype.
fertility of salmonella typhimurium crosses with escherichia coli.
at least one factor that causes low fertility of salmonella typhimurium lt2 strains in crosses with escherichia coli k-12 hfr's can be inhibited by growing the female strains in supplemented minimal salts medium rather than in nutrient broth and by incubating the female strains at 50 c immediately before mating with the hfr. these pretreatments can enhance the recovery of prototrophic recombinants for markers injected early by the hfr by a factor of as much as 10(4). the heat treatment is effective only on the female in intergeneric crosses and gradually loses (within 50 min) its effectiveness after return of heat-treated cells to 37 c. it is concluded that the restriction system of the female is heat-sensitive. since markers injected late by the male enter females in which the heat-impaired restriction system has recovered, few recombinants for late markers are found. the presence of the leading end of an e. coli hfr in an s. typhimurium-e. coli hybrid enhances by up to sevenfold the frequency of lac(+) recombinants in subsequent crosses with an e. coli hfr if the e. coli segment is integrated into the chromosome of the hybrid; the effect is less marked if the e. coli segment is not integrated.
combined effects of diphenyliodonium chloride, pine oils, and mustard oil soaps on certain microorganisms.
bactericidal and bacteriostatic activities of an emulsion containing 10.0% (v/v)  terpineol, 0.5% (w/v) diphenyliodonium chloride, 11.0% (v/v) ethyl alcohol, and 5.62% saponified mustard oil were tested against a number of different types of organisms. the bactericidal concentration for salmonella typhosa was 1:400. in the presence of 5.0% horse serum, it increased to 1:250. the bacteriostatic concentration varied from organism to organism; escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus required 4,000 mug/ml for complete bacteriostasis, whereas corynebacterium diphtheriae, salmonella paratyphi-a, and shigella required only 2,000 mug/ml for complete inhibition. a 4.0% concentration of the emulsion killed the spores of bacillus subtilis within 6 hr.
polynucleotide sequence relationships among members of enterobacteriaceae.
polynucleotide relationships were examined among many representatives of the enterobacteriaceae by means of agar, membrane filter, and hydroxyapatite procedures. the amount of deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) that reassociated was dependent, especially in interspecific reactions, on the annealing temperature. in only three cases: escherichia coli-shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium-s. typhi, and proteus mirabilis-p. vulgaris, was relative interspecific duplex formation 80% or higher. in most cases interspecies dna duplex formation was 40% or less of that obtained from intraspecies dna reassociation reactions. the stability of e. coli-s. flexneri dna duplexes formed at either 60 or 75 c was virtually identical to that of homologous e. coli dna duplexes, and the degree of interspecies duplex formation was minimally affected by the temperature increase (86% at 60 c; 77% at 75 c). the thermal stability of dna duplexes formed at 60 c between dna from e. coli and dna from strains of aerobacter aerogenes, s. typhimurium, s. typhi, and p. mirabilis was about 12 to 14 c below that of reassociated e. coli dna. at 75 c, the formation of the interspecific dna duplexes was markedly decreased, but the stability of the dna able to reassociate at this temperature approximated that of reassociated e. coli dna. the degree of reassociation and the thermal stability of e. coli-s. flexneri dna duplexes suggests relatively little evolutionary divergence in these organisms. the other enterobacteria tested, however, have diverged to a point where less than one-half of their dna can reanneal with e. coli dna at 60 c and less than 10% reacts at 75 c. the degree of divergence between various enterobacteria does not appear to be uniform along the dna molecule. ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rna)-specific sequences are conserved among most enterobacteria. an examination of messenger rna relatively specific for the lactose operon suggests that specific chromosomal genes may diverge more or less than the genome as a whole.
induction of adenosine deaminase in escherichia coli.
supplementing the salts-glucose medium of escherichia coli with adenine initiates induction of adenosine deaminase (adenosine aminohydrolase, ec 3.5.4.4), growth inhibition, and an increased potential for the net deamination of adenine. the extent and duration of these events are proportional to the initial adenine concentration and are dependent upon adenylate pyrophosphorylase and repression of histidine biosynthesis for maximal expression. the conversion of adenine to hypoxanthine, though limited in rate, occurs concurrently with induction and accounts for the progressively decreasing rate of deaminase induction, since hypoxanthine is a relatively ineffective inducer. the subsequent decrease in deaminase activity is due to dilution by continued cell division and by enzyme inactivation which occurs during the late-log and early-stationary phases. the partially purified deaminase is labile to a number of environmental conditions, particularly to phosphate buffers of ph 6.8 or less. a disproportionately slow rate of adenine deamination by cells utilizing lactate permits a more prolonged period of induction and, consequently, a greater quantity of enzyme to be synthesized; cell division, but not enzyme inactivation, reduces enzyme concentration. the adenosine deaminases of aerobacter aerogenes and salmonella typhimurium are not inducible.
thermal stability of escherichia coli-salmonella typhimurium deoxyribocleic acid  duplexes.
single-stranded, labeled deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) fragments from escherichia coli were incubated at 60 and 66 c with a large excess of single-stranded, unlabeled dna fragments from e. coli and salmonella typhimurium. the resulting reassociated dna was adsorbed to hydroxylapatite and eluted in a series of washes at increasing temperatures. the thermal stability of the reassociated dna was determined by means of this procedure. neither the extent of reassociation nor stability of the reassociated e. coli dna was affected by increasing the incubation temperature from 60 to 66 c. the double-stranded molecules resulting from the reassociation of e. coli dna with s. typhimurium dna had a markedly lower thermal stability than reassociated e. coli dna. more reassociation occurred between e. coli and s. typhimurium at 60 c than at 66 c. in addition, the product of interspecies reassociation occurring at 66 c had a higher thermal stability than that occurring at 60 c. preliminary results indicate that the decreased thermal stability of the interspecies duplex is in part the result of unpaired bases.
selective inhibition of escherichia coli in the presence of salmonella typhimurium by phenethyl beta-d-galactopyranoside.
phenethyl beta-d-galactopyranoside (peg) was hydrolyzed by the beta-galactosidase of escherichia coli to form the toxic product phenethyl alcohol. salmonella typhimurium did not hydrolyze peg. in mixed culture, the ratio of s. typhimurium to e. coli was increased by growing the organisms in lactose broth containing 2.5% peg. the high concentration of peg required for inhibition of e. coli can be attributed to inadequate cell permeability rather than to prevention of beta-galactosidase induction.
detoxification of salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide by ionizing radiation.
the efficiency of ionizing radiation in detoxifying the lethal determinant(s) of  the lipopolysaccharide (lps) of salmonella typhimurium, s. enteritidis, and escherichia coli in aqueous solution and associated with heat-killed s. typhimurium cells in suspension decreased with doses above 1 mrad. the 50% end point of inactivation was more than 7.0 mrad for heat-killed salmonellae and 4.8, 4.5, and 1.0 mrad for the lps of s. typhimurium, s. enteritidis, and e. coli, respectively. after exposure to 20 mrad, s. typhimurium lps retained a small portion of its lethal properties although the ld(50) was much greater than 9.5 mg per 20-g mouse. however, at -184 c, no inactivation of the lethal determinant(s) occurred after exposure to as much as 20 mrad. this demonstrated the significance of the indirect effect and the mobility and formation of free radicals. at 22 c, the optical density at 400 mmu increased and the ph decreased with increasing radiation dose, but no qualitative changes were observed in the infrared spectrum. no change was observed in the pyrogenicity of s. typhimurium lps; a slight decrease in antigenicity was revealed when 6 days, but not when 1 day, elapsed between vaccination and challenge in the mouse protection test. the results were interpreted as evidence of the existence of two or more lethal and antigenic determinants. the differential effect of radiation on these properties and on the pyrogenic component(s) probably are indicative of separate functional sites for lethal, antigenic, and pyrogenic activities.
