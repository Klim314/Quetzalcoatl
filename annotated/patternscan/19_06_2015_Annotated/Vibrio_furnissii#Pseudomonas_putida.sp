TI  == isolation of vibrio and pseudomonas from brown shrimp (penaeus californiensis holmes) intestine.
AB  == bacteria of the genera vibrio, pseudomonas and aeromonas were isolated from the intestine of apparently healthy brown shrimp (penaeus californiensis holmes) cultured in a tidal pond. species from these genera of bacteria have been reported as shrimp pathogens and have been involved in human gastrointestinal disorders related to seafood consumption. isolation was done first in marine broth, then in selective media (tcbs, cetrimide and macconkey). the oxidase negative strains were discarded as insignificant to shrimp culture. the identification of oxidase positive strains was based in morphological and colonial characteristics, biochemical capabilities, and both salinity and temperature tolerance. api 20e system and fatty acid analysis were also included. three potentially pathogenic bacteria, vibrio parahaemolyticus, vibrio furnissii  and pseudomonas putida were isolated and identified from healthy shrimp intestine.
