investigating the mobilome in clinically important lineages of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis.
background: the success of enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis evolving as multi-resistant nosocomial pathogens is associated with their ability to acquire and share adaptive traits, including antimicrobial resistance genes encoded by mobile genetic elements (mges). here, we investigate this mobilome in successful hospital associated genetic lineages, e. faecium sequence type (st)17 (n=10) and st78 (n=10), e. faecalis st6 (n=10) and st40 (n=10) by dna microarray analyses. results: the hybridization patterns of 272 representative targets including plasmid backbones (n=85), transposable elements (n=85), resistance determinants (n=67), prophages (n=29) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cas sequences (n=6) separated the strains according to species, and for e. faecalis also according to sts. rcr-, rep_3-, repa_n- and inc18-family plasmids were highly prevalent and with the exception of rep_3, evenly distributed between the species. there was a considerable difference in the replicon profile, with rep 17/prum , rep 2/pre25 , rep 14/efnp1 and rep 20/plg1 dominating in e. faecium and rep 9/pcf10 , rep 2/pre25 and rep 7 in e. faecalis strains. we observed an overall high correlation between the presence and absence of genes coding for resistance towards antibiotics, metals, biocides and their corresponding mges as well as their phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. although most is families were represented in both e. faecalis and e. faecium, specific is elements within these families were distributed in only one species. the prevalence of is256-, is3-, isl3-, is200/is605-, is110-, is982- and is4-transposases was significantly higher in e. faecium than e. faecalis, and that of is110-, is982- and is1182-transposases in e. faecalis st6 compared to st40. notably, the transposases of is981, isefm1 and is1678 that have only been reported in few enterococcal isolates were well represented in the e. faecium strains. e. faecalis st40 strains harboured possible functional crispr-cas systems, and still resistance and prophage sequences were generally well represented. conclusions: the targeted mges were highly prevalent among the selected sts, underlining their potential importance in the evolution of hospital-adapted lineages of enterococci. although the propensity of inter-species horizontal gene transfer (hgt) must be emphasized, the considerable species-specificity of these mges indicates a separate vertical evolution of mges within each species, and for e. faecalis within each st.
antimicrobial action of oleanolic acid on listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis.
this study investigated the antimicrobial action of oleanolic acid against listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis. to determine the cytotoxicity of oleanolic acid, hep-2 cells were incubated with oleanolic acid at 37 degrees c. mics (minimal inhibition concentrations) for l. monocytogenes, e. faecium, and e. faecalis were determined using two-fold microdilutions of oleanolic acid, and bacterial cell viability was then assessed by exposing the bacteria to oleanolic acid at 2 x mic. to investigate the mode of antimicrobial action of oleanolic acid, we measured leakage of compounds absorbing at 280 nm, along with propidium iodide uptake. scanning electron microscope (sem) images were also analysed. the viability of hep-2 cells decreased (p < 0.05) at oleanolic acid concentrations greater than 128 mug ml(-1). the mics were 16-32 mug ml(-1) for l. monocytogenes and 32-64 mug ml(-1) for e. faecium and e. faecalis, and bacterial cell viability decreased (p < 0.05) about 3-4 log cfu ml(-1) after exposure to 2 x mic of oleanolic acid. leakage of 280 nm absorbing materials and propidium iodide uptake was higher in oleanolic acid -treated cells than in the control. the cell membrane was damaged in oleanolic acid-treated cells, but the control group had intact cell membrane in sem images. the results indicate that oleanolic acid can kill l. monocytogenes, e. faecium, and e. faecalis by destroying the bacterial cell membrane.
new antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging. in search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. the antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth of the nosocomial pathogens staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical e. faecalis, e. faecium, and s. aureus isolates. it also strongly reduced the growth of legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of escherichia coli in urine. we postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.
antibiotic resistance prevalence in routine bloodstream isolates from children's  hospitals varies substantially from adult surveillance data in europe.
background: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (amr) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing amr levels. it is unclear whether childhood amr patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult patients. methods: resistance percentages of nonduplicate staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the antibiotic resistance and prescribing in european children (arpec) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network (ears-net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. in addition, resistance percentages were compared between arpec isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. results: resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for arpec isolates compared with ears-net. e. coli and k. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone resistance percentages were substantially lower in arpec (13.4% and 17.9%) than in ears-net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in p. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in arpec, 19.3% in ears-net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in arpec and 20.5% in ears-net), and for s. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. for many gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. conclusions: age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.
in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.
baseline activity of telavancin against gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented infections in u.s. hospitals (2011-2012) as determined by the revised susceptibility testing method.
telavancin had mic50 and mic90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml (100.0% susceptible), respectively, against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococcus aureus. telavancin was active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 100% susceptible) and enterococcus faecium (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mug/ml), while higher mic values were obtained against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (mic50/90, 1/2 mug/ml) and e. faecalis (mic50/90, >2/>2 mug/ml). streptococci showed telavancin modal mic results of </= 0.015 mug/ml, except against streptococcus agalactiae (i.e., 0.03 mug/ml). this study reestablishes the telavancin spectrum of activity against isolates recovered from the united states (2011-2012) using the revised broth microdilution method.
selection of potential probiotic enterococcus faecium isolated from portuguese fermented food.
four enterococcus faecium strains isolated from fermented products were evaluated for potential use as probiotic strains. in addition to efaafm gene, commonly found in e. faecium food isolates, none of the isolates possessed virulence genes and none had positive reactions for the production of tyramine, histamine, putrescine and cadaverine in the screening medium used. all of these four isolates proved to be resistant to 65 degrees c. e. faecium 119 did not show antimicrobial activity against any of the target bacteria investigated. e. faecium 85 and 101 inhibited listeria innocua and e. faecium dsmz 13590. the strain e. faecium 120 inhibited seven target bacteria (listeria monocytogenes 7946, l. monocytogenes 7947, l. innocua 2030c, l. innocua nctc 11286, e. faecium dsmz 13590, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213) and was chosen as the representative to assess the ability to survive gastrointestinal tract passage simulation, as well as the protective role of two food matrices (skim milk and alheira) during its passage. for both matrices used, no significant differences (p<0.05) were obtained between the types of digestion - quick and slow passage simulation. in the skim milk matrix the isolate was reduced to values below the detection limit of the enumeration technique by the end of the two digestions, in contrast to the alheira matrix, for which isolate 120 showed a reduction of only ca. 1 log cfu/ml. the e. faecium strain 120 was shown to be a potential candidate for further investigations as a potential probiotic culture.
what's new in the treatment of enterococcal endocarditis?
enterococcus spp. are among the common pathogens causing infective endocarditis (ie). despite major medical advances and new potent antimicrobial agents, the mortality has not significantly improved for several decades. the usual lack of bactericidal activity of penicillin or ampicillin, the toxicity from the combination of penicillin plus aminoglycosides, and the increased reports of high-level resistance to aminoglycosides have led to the exploration of other regimens for treatment of enterococcus faecalis ie. as an example, ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is now a well-recognized regimen for this organism. however, the emerging of new drug resistances in enterococcus faecium dramatically reduces the therapeutic alternatives for this organism in ie which continues to be an immense challenge for clinicians even with the availability of newer antimicrobial agents. this article summarizes the current treatment options for enterococcal endocarditis and reviews of recent publications on the topic.
structures of new phenolics isolated from licorice, and the effectiveness of licorice phenolics on vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
licorice, which is the underground part of glycyrrhiza species, has been used widely in asian and western countries as a traditional medicine and as a food additive. our continuous investigation on the constituents of roots and stolons of glycyrrhiza uralensis led to the isolation of two new phenolics, in addition to 14 known compounds. structural studies including spectroscopic and simple chemical derivatizations revealed that both of the new compounds had 2-aryl-3-methylbenzofuran structures. an examination of the effectiveness of licorice phenolics obtained in this study on vancomycin-resistant strains enterococcus faecium fn-1 and enterococcus faecalis nctc12201 revealed that licoricidin showed the most potent antibacterial effects against both of e. faecalis and e. faecium with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 1.9 x 10-5 m. 8-(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)-wighteone, isoangustone a, 3'-(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)-kievitone, glyasperin c, and one of the new 3-methyl-2-phenylbenzofuran named neoglycybenzofuran also showed potent anti-vancomycin-resistant enterococci effects (mic 1.9 x 10-5-4.5 x 10-5 m for e. faecium and e. faecalis). the hplc condition for simultaneous detection of the phenolics in the extract was investigated to assess the quality control of the natural antibacterial resource, and quantitative estimation of several major phenolics in the extract with the established hplc condition was also performed. the results showed individual contents of 0.08%-0.57% w/w of etoac extract for the major phenolics in the materials examined.
bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.
modified lactic acid bacteria detect and inhibit multiresistant enterococci.
we designed lactococcus lactis to detect enterococcus faecalis. upon detection, l. lactis produce and secrete antienterococcal peptides. the peptides inhibit enterococcal growth and reduce viability of enterococci in the vicinity of l. lactis. the enterococcal sex pheromone ccf10 serves as the signal for detection. expression vectors derived from pcf10, a ccf10-responsive e. faecalis sex-pheromone conjugative plasmid, were engineered in l. lactis for the detection system. recombinant host strains were engineered to express genes for three bacteriocins, enterocin a, hiracin jm79 and enterocin p, each with potent antimicrobial activity against e. faecalis. sensitive detection and specific inhibition occur both in agar and liquid media. the engineered l. lactis also inhibited growth of multidrug-resistant e. faecium strains, when induced by ccf10. the presented vectors and strains can be components of a toolbox for the development of alternative antibiotic technologies targeting enterococci at the site of infection.
urinary tract infection caused by enterococcus isolates: aetiology and antimicrobial resistance patterns.
the purpose of this study was to analyse the data on resistance in enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolated from urine samples of inpatients from january 2010 to december 2013. compared to e. faecalis, e. faecium isolates were significantly more resistant to ampicilin, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin in the antimicrobial agents evaluated. both species showed higher resistance to high-level gentamicin. the rate of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) in e. faecium was higher as compared to that of e. faecalis, and we found that apparent increase in the frequency of vre e. faecalis clinical isolates in the 4-year study period. in our study, analysis of the antimicrobial resistance trends showed resistance to linezolid and vancomycin were <30.2% and <20.3% in both species, respectively. of noteworthy is the high rate of mdr in two species from inpatients. this study highlights that it is of importance for clinicians to promote rational drug utilization and delay the emergence of resistant organisms.
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium active dimeric isobutyrylphloroglucinol from ivesia gordonii.
bioassay-guided fractionation of the chloroform soluble fraction of stem, leaf, and flower extracts of the american plant ivesia gordonii led to the isolation of a new dimeric acylphloroglucinol, 3,3'-diisobutyryl-2,6'-dimethoxy-4,6,2',4'-tetrahydroxy-5,5'dimethyldiphenyl methane (1), to which we have assigned the trivial name ofivesinol (1), together with a known monomeric acylphloroglucinol, 1,5-dihydroxy-2-(2'-methylpropionyl)-3-methoxy-6-methylbenzene (2). the structures of the isolated compounds were characterized using 1d- and 2d- nmr spectroscopy, including cosy, hmqc, hmbc, and roesyexperiments, as well as mass spectrometry. ivesinol (1) showed potent activity against staphylococcus aureus (sa) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) with ic50/mic/mbc values of 0.10/1.25/>20 microg/ml and 0.05/0.31/>20 microg/ml, respectively (vs. ic50/mic/mbc 0.13/0.5/1.0 microg/ml and 0.13/0.5/1.0 microg/ml of ciprofloxacin), while the corresponding monomer 2 was found to be less active. compound 1 also demonstrated strong activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) with ic50/mlc/mbc values of 0.22/1.25/>20 microg/ml, whereas the reference standard ciprofloxacin was found to be inactive against this strain. in addition, compound 2 showed moderate activity against two species of candida and cryptococcus neoformans, while 1 was inactive against these fungi. in order to evaluate the influence of the acyl group(s) in phloroglucinol (3) as a ligand, the mono- (4) and diacetylphloroglucinol (5) were prepared from 3, and evaluated for their in vitro sa, mrsa, and vre activities; 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (5) showed potent activity, like 1, against sa, mrsa, and vre (atcc 700221) with ic50/mic values of 0.3/2.5, 0.23/2.5, and 0.86/2.5 microg/ml, respectively, while 4 was inactive.
prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species: a hospital-based study in china.
objective: to investigate the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species isolated from a university hospital, and explore the mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial resistance, so as to provide clinical evidence for the inappropriate clinical use of antimicrobial agents and the control and prevention of enterococcal infections. methods: a total of 1,157 enterococcal strains isolated from various clinical specimens from january 2010 to december 2012 in the general hospital of ningxia medical university were identified to species level with a vitek-2 compact fully automated microbiological system, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus species was determined using the kirby-bauer disc diffusion method. the multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates were screened from the clinical isolates of enterococcus species from the burns department. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin was determined with the agar dilution method, and the changes in the mic of enterococcus species to the three fluoroquinolones following reserpine treatment were evaluated. the beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, macrolide, glycopeptide resistance genes and the efflux pump emea genes were detected in the enterococcal isolates using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. results: the 1,157 clinical isolates of enterococcus species included 679 e. faecium isolates (58.7%), 382 e. faecalis isolates (33%), 26 e. casseliflavus isolates (2.2%), 24 e. avium isolates (2.1%), and 46 isolates of other enterococcus species (4%). the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance varied significantly between e. faecium and e. faecalis, and </= 1.1% of these two enterococcus species were found to be resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin or linezolid. in addition, the enterococcus species isolated from different departments of the hospital exhibited various resistances to the same antimicrobial agent, while reserpine treatment reduced the resistance of enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. the beta-lactamase gene tem, aminoglycoside-modifying-enzyme genes aac(6')-aph(2"), aph(3')-iii, ant(6)-i and ant(2")-i, tetracycline resistance gene tetm, erythromycin resistance gene ermb, vancomycin resistance gene vana and the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emea gene were detected in 77%, 62%, 26%, 13%, 36%, 31%, 66%, 5% and 55% of the 100 multiple-drug resistant enterococcal isolates. conclusions: similar to previous findings, e. faecium and e. faecalis are predominant conditionally pathogenic bacteria that cause hospital-acquired infections that can cause urinary and respiratory system infections. multiple and high-level antimicrobial resistance is highly prevalent in the hospital isolates of enterococcus species. reserpine treatment inhibits the active efflux of enterococcus species to ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin in vitro and reduces the mic of enterococcus species to these three fluoroquinolones. the presence of the enterococcal multidrug resistance efflux emea gene is associated with the resistance to antibiotics in enterococcus species. the monitoring of the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species is of great significance to guide the control and prevention of enterococcal infections.
enterococcal bacteriocins and antimicrobial proteins that contribute to niche control
enterococci, which belong to the group of lactic acid bacteria (lab), have received increased attention in recent years for various reasons (fisher & phillips, 2009; franz, huch, abriouel, holzapfel, & galvez, 2011; leavis, bonten, & willems, 2006). while lactobacilli, another group of lab, have been shown to confer numerous benefits and are often regarded as health-bringing organisms, enterococci have become more recognized as emerging human pathogens despite the fact that they are as numerous as the lactobacilli in our gastrointestinal tractgastrointestinal tract. enterococcus faecalis is the dominant enterocuccus in the gastrointestinal tract, followed by e. faecium; however, e. avium and e. hirae, as well as other enterococcal species, are frequently found in human stool samples. the commensal/probiotic role of enterococci in humans and animals has evolved through thousands of years in mutual coexistence-but the ability of the enterococci to behave in a way that causes problems to human health is only beginning to be understood. virulence, which may evolved as an adaptation to the "modern lifestyle," including the profligate use of antibiotics in medical practice and animal husbandry, needs to be understood and limited where possible. on the other side, enterococci have many positive traits that have been appreciated in food fermentation and preservation, and may also serve as probiotics to promote health. bacteriocin-producing bacteria are found in all environments. in many lab isolates, bacteriocin production has been examined by biochemical and genetic studies, and the bacteriocins produced by enterococci are often similar to those produced by other lactic acid bacteria. a classification scheme has been developed for bacteriocins produced by gram-positive bacteria, and most of this information is based on findings from lab. although classification is still a disputed issue, two major classes of heat-stable, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides are well defined. class i constitutes the lantibiotics, while class ii constitutes the unmodified non-lantibiotics. bacteriocins within different classes and subclasses also have been isolated and characterized in enterococci (cotter, hill, & ross, 2005; nes, diep, havarstein, brurberg, eijsink, & holo, 1996; nes, yoon, & diep, 2007). one of the most striking findings so far is the almost complete absence of lantibiotics among enteroccci, with the only exceptions being cytolysin and enterocin w (coburn & gilmore, 2003; cox, coburn, & gilmore, 2005; sawa, et al., 2012). most of the characterized enterocins belong to the class ii bacteriocins and a few are heat-labile lytic enzymes. the latter were previously classified as bacteriocins, but are now included in a distinct class of antimicrobials (cotter, hill, & ross, 2005). the hemolytic bacteriocin (cytolysin), the circular as-48, and bacteriocin 21 have been known as e. faecalis bacteriocins for a long time, and they have been genetically and biochemically well characterized (clewell d. b., 1981; gilmore, 1991; gilmore, coburn, nallapareddy, & murray, 2002; gilmore, segarra, booth, bogie, hall, & clewell, 1994; haas, shepard, & gilmore, 2002; ike, clewell, segarra, & gilmore, 1990). many bacteriocin producers have been identified and investigated from infection-derived e. faecalis or e. faecium isolates. from e. faecalis isolates, for example, bacteriocin 31 (tomita, fujimoto, tanimoto, & ike, 1996) and bacteriocin 41 (tomita, kamei, & ike, 2008) have been studied; and from e. faecium, there are bacteriocin 43 (todokoro, tomita, inoue, & ike, 2006), bacteriocin 32 (nes, diep, havarstein, brurberg, eijsink, & holo, 1996), and bacteriocin 51 (yamashita, tomita, inoue, & ike, 2011). besides enterococcal bacteriocins of clinical origin, bacteriocins from enterococci of food origins have been studied, and several bacteriocins from e.faecium isolates have been identified and characterized. these include enterocin l50a/l50b (cintas l. m., casaus, holo, hernandez, nes, & havarstein, 1998), enterocin q (cintas l. m., et al., 2000; criado, et al., 2006), enterocin a (aymerich, holo, havarstein, hugas, garriga, & nes, 1996; nilsen, nes, & holo, 1998), enterocin p (cintas l. m., casaus, havarstein, hernandez, & nes, 1997; kang & lee, 2005), enterocin b (casaus, nilsen, cintas, nes, hernandez, & holo, 1997) and others. many enterocins have also been characterized from various enterococcal species and from many environments, and the most thoroughly characterized enterocins are summarized in table 1. most of the characterized enterocins are from e. faecium and e. faecalis, but enterocins have also been isolated from e. muntii, e. avium, e. hirae, and e. durans (see table 1). the bacteriocin-producing enterococci are by and large isolated from food, waste, and the feces and gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but may also be isolated from other sources. fermented food, specimens from human infections, and feces from healthy babies seem to be particularly good niches for isolating bacteriocin-producing enterococci (see figure 1). it seems likely that most enterococci originate from the digestive tract of humans and animals, a notion which is in line with the finding that the same bacteriocins are identified in enterococci isolated from many environments, which most often include those of human origin.
daptomycin activity tested against 164457 bacterial isolates from hospitalised patients: summary of 8 years of a worldwide surveillance programme (2005-2012).
we report the results of 8 years (2005-2012) of the daptomycin surveillance programme worldwide. consecutive non-duplicate bacterial isolates (prevalence design) were collected from patients with documented infections in 410 medical centres and were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods. a total of 164457 gram-positive isolates were evaluated, including 97542 staphylococcus aureus, 21413 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 29619 enterococci and 15883 beta-haemolytic streptococci. the prevalence of daptomycin-non-susceptible isolates was extremely low for all species in all geographic regions. overall, the highest occurrence of non-susceptible isolates was observed among cons (0.19%), followed by enterococcus faecium (0.18%), s. aureus (0.05%), enterococcus faecalis (0.02%) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (0.00%). moreover, no trend towards increased daptomycin resistance (non-susceptibility) was observed for any species in any geographic region during the study interval. against s. aureus, the daptomycin mic(50/90) was 0.25/0.5 mg/l in all geographic regions (99.95% susceptible overall). only 53 daptomycin-non-susceptible s. aureus isolates were observed and the vast majority (49; 92.5%) had a daptomycin mic value only 1 log(2) dilution above the published susceptible breakpoint. daptomycin was also active against cons (mic(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.81% susceptible), e. faecalis (mic(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.98% susceptible), e. faecium (mic(50/90), 2/4 mg/l; 99.82% susceptible) including vancomycin-non-susceptible isolates (4521 isolates; mic(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 99.76% susceptible), and beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(50/90), </=0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible). in conclusion, daptomycin has remained very active against indicated species worldwide, and no significant year-to-year or regional variation in daptomycin activity has been detected.

the bacteriocin susceptibility of listeria monocytogenes mtcc 657, enterococcus faecium dsmz 20477, e. faecium vre, and e. faecalis atcc 29212 and their corresponding bacteriocin resistant variants was assessed. the single and combined effect of nisin and pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 bacteriocins produced by pediococcus pentosaceus 34, and e. faecium fh99, respectively, was determined. pediocin34 proved to be more effective in inhibiting l. monocytogenes mtcc 657. a greater antibacterial effect was observed against e. faecium dsmz 20477 and e. faecium (vre) when the a combination of nisin, pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 were used whereas in case of l. monocytogenes mtcc 657 a combination of pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 was more effective in reducing the survival of pathogen. bacteriocin cross-resistance and the antibiotic susceptibility of wild type and their corresponding resistant variants were assessed and results showed that resistance to a bacteriocin may extend to other bacteriocins within the same class and also the acquired resistance to bacteriocins can modify the antibiotic susceptibility/resistance profile of the bacterial species used in the study. according to the hydrophobicity nisin resistant variant of l. monocytogenes was more hydrophobic (p < 0.001), whereas the pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 resistant variants were less hydrophobic than the wild type strain. nisin, pediocin 34 and enterocin fh99 resistant variants of e. faecium dsmz 20477 and e. faecium vre were less hydrophobic than their wild type counterparts. nisin resistant e. faecalis atcc 29212 was less hydrophobic than its wild type counterpart.
antimicrobial susceptibility of indicator bacteria isolated from chickens in southeast asian countries (vietnam, indonesia and thailand).
to determine the prevalence of indicator bacteria resistant to antimicrobials among poultry in three southeast asian countries (vietnam, indonesia and thailand), we examined the antimicrobial susceptibilities of commensal bacteria isolated from chickens. in total, 125, 117 and 180 isolates of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively, were used to test for antimicrobial susceptibility. bacterial resistance to antimicrobial treatment was most frequently observed with oxytetracycline with a prevalence of 73.6% (e. coli), 69.2% (e. faecalis) and 92.2% (e. faecium). resistance to fluoroquinolones, which are critically important medicines, was also frequently observed in e. coli (48.8%), e. faecalis (17.9%) and e. faecium (82.8%). the prevalence of indicator bacteria resistant to most of the antimicrobials tested in these countries was higher than those for developed countries. the factors underlying antimicrobial resistance may include inappropriate and/or excessive use of antimicrobials. these results highlight the need for monitoring the emergence and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in developing countries.
food-borne zoonotic pathogens and antimicrobial resistance of indicator bacteria  in urban wild boars in barcelona, spain.
wildlife is increasingly abundant in urban environments, but little is known about the zoonotic pathogens carried by these populations. urban wild boars are of particular concern because this species is well-known as a pathogen reservoir, and thus, we studied selected zoonotic pathogens in urban wild boars in barcelona, spain (n=41). salmonella enterica was found in 5.00% (95% ci 0.61-16.91) and campylobacter coli in 4.88% (95% ci 0.6-16.53) of the animals. e. coli o157:h7 and c. jejuni were not found. other thermophilic campylobacter were moderately prevalent (19.51%, 95% ci 8.82-34.87). additionally, we screened for antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria: resistance was most frequent in enterococcus faecium (95% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent), followed by enterococcus faecalis (50%) and escherichia coli (10%). for the first time resistance to linezolid in bacteria carried by wildlife is reported. these findings pose a concern for public health, and thus, further research is needed on wildlife in urban environments.
antimicrobial activity of a uv-stable bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) produced by enterococcus faecium strain dsh20 against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains.
background/purpose: the narrow spectrum of action of most bacteriocins is an important limitation for their application as antimicrobial agents. the current study describes a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) that display extended spectrum antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains. methods: acquired resistance profiles of enterococcus isolates determined based on the european centre for disease prevention and control (ecdc) and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) definition as multidrug-resistant (mdr), extensively drug-resistant (xdr) and pandrug resistant (pdr). blis activity of enterococcus isolates was investigated against enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) atcc 29212 as the indicator strain and clinical isolates including vre, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and gram-negative bacteria containing pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), klebsiella, acinetobacter, and escherichia coli (e. coli). results: among 273 enterococcus isolates, 27 and 2 vre isolates, respectively, were xdr and pdr and eight isolates had blis activity against the indicator strain. one of these isolates, identified as e. faecium strain dsh20 based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties, as well as its 16s rrna gene sequence, had potent blis production against all 29 vre strains, but had no activity against mrsa, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella, acinetobacter, and e. coli strains. it was heat stable up to 121 degrees c for 15 minutes (autoclave condition), active within the ph range of 3-9 and had uv stability, but its activity disappeared by treatment with proteinase k, pepsin, and trypsin, demonstrating its proteinaceous nature. it was designated as an approximately 35kda peptide using the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) method. conclusion: this peptide is a potential agent for use as an alternative antibacterial agent for the treatment of drug-resistant strains of vre infection.
comparison of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis strains isolated from water and clinical samples: antimicrobial susceptibility and genetic relationships.
enterococci are part of the normal intestinal flora in a large number of mammals, and these microbes are currently used as indicators of fecal contamination in water and food for human consumption. these organisms are considered one of the primary causes of nosocomial and environmental infections due to their ability to survive in the environment and to their intrinsic resistance to antimicrobials. the aims of this study were to determine the biochemical patterns and antimicrobial susceptibilities of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolates from clinical samples and from water (groundwater, water from the xochimilco wetland, and treated water from the mexico city metropolitan area) and to determine the genetic relationships among these isolates. a total of 121 enterococcus strains were studied; 31 and 90 strains were isolated from clinical samples and water (groundwater, water from the xochimilco wetland, and water for agricultural irrigation), respectively. identification to the species level was performed using a multiplex pcr assay, and antimicrobial profiles were obtained using a commercial kit. twenty-eight strains were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). e. faecium strains isolated from water showed an atypical biochemical pattern. the clinical isolates showed higher resistance to antibiotics than those from water. both the enterococci isolated from humans, and those isolated from water showed high genetic diversity according to the pfge analysis, although some strains seemed to be closely related. in conclusion, enterococci isolated from humans and water are genetically different. however, water represents a potential route of transmission to the community and a source of antimicrobial resistance genes that may be readily transmitted to other, different bacterial species.
microbiological survey of imported produce available at retail across canada.
increasing consumption and year-round consumer demand for fresh, minimally processed green vegetables have been observed in canada and other developed countries. however, in the past two decades, produce has been increasingly implicated in outbreaks and correspondingly recognized as a vector for the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms. to this end, we examined the microbiological quality of imported produce available at retail across canada during a period of limited domestic availability. in total, 106 samples obtained from five canadian cities were purchased from retail outlets and subjected to microbiological analyses, including aerobic plate (apc) and coliform counts, and enrichments for enterococci, indicator escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. also, recovered enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were screened for antimicrobial resistance (amr). overall, samples included herbs (n=61), leafy greens (n=25), and spinach (n=20) deriving from five countries (columbia, dominican republic, guatemala, mexico, and the united states [us]). apcs were consistent across commodities regardless of country, ranging from mean log10 cfu/g of 6.1 to 7.4, with no significant differences observed. excluding a single leafy green sample from guatemala, the lowest prevalence of coliforms was for mexican herbs (22.2%), with a high of 66.7% on us leafy greens. with the exception of spinach, concentrations of coliforms varied widely, ranging from undetectable to too numerous to count (>8.5 log10 cfu/g). of the commodities assessed, mexican and us spinach had the lowest coliform concentrations (undetectable to 4.0 log10 cfu/g). organic herbs and conventional leafy greens possessed significantly lower (p<0.05) prevalence of coliforms compared to conventional herbs and organic leafy greens, respectively. the most frequent recovery of indicator e. coli was observed for herbs, with 11.1, 8.3, and 3.7% prevalence observed in samples from columbia, us, and mexico, respectively. for spinach, 0 and 6.7% of mexican and us samples tested positive, while no leafy green samples from either country were positive. no e. coli o157:h7 or salmonella spp. were detected. e. faecium and e. faecalis were recovered from 15.1 and 5.7% of samples, respectively. although no glycopeptide resistance was observed, resistance to other clinically relevant antibiotics was noteworthy in both species. overall, though microbiological quality indicators were frequently high, e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella were not detected. however, the presence of resistance and reduced susceptibility to clinically relevant antimicrobials in recovered enterococci demonstrate imported fresh produce may serve as a vehicle for the transmission of antimicrobial resistance across national borders.
using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
enterococcus faecium isolated from lombo, a portuguese traditional meat product:  characterisation of antibacterial compounds and factors affecting bacteriocin production.
strain st211ch, identified as a strain of enterococcus faecium, isolated from lombo produced a bacteriocin that inhibited the growth of enterococcus spp., listeria spp., klebsiella spp., lactobacillus spp., pseudomonas spp., staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. the mode of action of the bacteriocin named as bacteriocin st211ch was bactericidal against enterococcus faecalis atcc19443. as determined by tricine-sds-page, the approximate molecular mass of the bacteriocin was 8.0 kda. loss in antimicrobial activity was recorded after treatment with proteolytic enzymes. maximum activity of bacteriocin st211ch was measured in broth cultures of e. faecium strain st211ch after 24 h; thereafter, the activity was reduced. bacteriocin st211ch remained active after exposure to various temperatures and phs, as well as to triton x-100, tween-80, tween-20, sodium dodecyl sulfate, nacl, urea and edta. effect of media components on production of bacteriocin st211ch was also studied. on the basis of pcr reactions targeting different bacteriocin genes, i.e. enterocins, curvacins and sakacins, no evidences for the presence of these genes in the total dna of e. faecium strain st211ch was obtained. the bacterium most probably produced a bacteriocin different from those mentioned above. based on the antimicrobial spectrum, stability and mode of action of bacteriocin st211ch, e. faecium strain st211ch might be considered as a potential candidate with beneficial properties for use in biopreservation to control food spoilage bacteria.
screening for lactic acid bacteria capable of inhibiting campylobacter jejuni in  in vitro simulations of the broiler chicken caecal environment.
thermotolerant campylobacter spp., specifically campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, are the most common bacterial causes of human gastroenteritis in developed countries. consumption of improperly prepared poultry products and cross contamination are among the main causes of human campylobacteriosis. the aim of this study was to identify lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains capable of inhibiting c. jejuni growth in initial in vitro trials ('spot-on-lawn' method), as well as in batch fermentation studies mimicking the broiler caecal environment. these experiments served as an indication for using these strains to decrease the capability of campylobacter to colonise and grow in the chicken caeca during primary production, with the aim of reducing the number of human campylobacteriosis cases. a total of 1,150 lab strains were screened for anti-campylobacter activity. six strains were selected: members of the species lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus agilis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus salivarius, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. after treatment with catalase, proteinase k and a-chymotrypsin, anti-campylobacter activity of cell-free culture supernatant fluid (csf) for all six strains was retained, which indicated that activity was probably not exerted by bacteriocin production. based on the activity found in csf, the compounds produced by the selected strains are secreted and do not require presence of live bacterial producer cells for activity. during initial in vitro fermentation experiments, the e. faecalis strain exhibited the highest inhibitory activity for c. jejuni and was selected for further fermentation experiments. in these experiments we tested for therapeutic or protective effects of the e. faecalis strain against c. jejuni mb 4185 infection under simulated broiler caecal growth conditions. the best inhibition results were obtained when e. faecalis was inoculated before the c. jejuni strain, lowering c. jejuni counts at least one log compared to a positive control. this effect was already observed 6 h after c. jejuni inoculation.
enterococcus and streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in vietnam.
background: urinary tract infections (uti) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. e. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated uti, however, little is known about how recurrent utis and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials affect the aetiology of utis. this study aimed to establish the aetiology of uti in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in hanoi, vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. the aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with uti (defined as >/= 104 cfu/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by multi locus sequence typing (mlst), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. methods: urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on flexicult agar(r) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of uti, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to uti. all tentative e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were identified to species level by pcr, 16s rrna and partial sequencing of the groel gene. e. faecalis isolates were further characterized by multi locus sequence typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. results: mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women. on average, patients reported to have suffered from uti for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 utis during the previous year). cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of uti at the hospital. e. faecalis (55.1%), e. coli (12.2%) and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. mic testing of e. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). mlst revealed 12 sequence types (st) of which st 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related pfge types. conclusion: the different aetiology of uti compared with reports elsewhere, where e. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent utis together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. the similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated st 16 isolates in vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that e. faecalis st 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. treatment of uti with cephalosporins may select for e. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of e. faecalis st 16 in acute uti.
[vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). recent results and trends in development of antibiotic resistance].
enterococci (mainly e. faecalis, e. faecium) are important nosocomial pathogens predominantly affecting older and/or immunocompromised patients. the bacteria possess a broad spectrum of intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance properties. among these, the transferrable glycopeptide resistance of the vana and vanb genotypes in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre; reservoir: e. faecium) as well as resistance to last resort antibiotics (e.g. linezolid and tigecycline) are of special concern. enterococci (including vre) are easily transferred in hospitals; however, colonizations are far more frequent than infections. resistance frequencies for vancomycin in clinical e. faecium isolates have remained at a relatively constant level of 8-15% (but with local or regional variations) in recent years whereas frequencies for teicoplanin resistance have shown a slight decrease. glycopeptide resistance trends correlate with a spread of hospital-associated e. faecium strains carrying the vana and, with rising frequency in recent years, the vanb gene cluster, the latter being associated with teicoplanin susceptibility. this increased occurrence of vanb-positive e. faecium strains may be caused by an increased use of antibiotics selecting enterococci and vre as well as due to methodological reasons (e.g. reduced eucast mic-breakpoints for glycopeptides; increased use and sensitive performance of chromogenic vre agars, increased use of molecular diagnostic assays).
the changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in europe: trends from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system.
we investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in europe. aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (earss) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. trend analyses used generalized linear models. robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. from 2002 to 2008, the overall number of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (ci) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. in the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% ci 6.9-7.5%). the frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in e. coli and enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% ci 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year; 95% ci -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive s. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% ci 3.0-3.7). increasing rates of e. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. our data suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during earss surveillance. trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. it appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. as a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.
daptomycin resistance in enterococci is associated with distinct alterations of cell membrane phospholipid content.
background: the lipopeptide antibiotic, daptomycin (dap) interacts with the bacterial cell membrane (cm). development of dap resistance during therapy in a clinical strain of enterococcus faecalis was associated with mutations in genes encoding enzymes involved in cell envelope homeostasis and phospholipid metabolism. here we characterized changes in cm phospholipid profiles associated with development of dap resistance in clinical enterococcal strains. methodology: using two clinical strain-pairs of dap-susceptible and dap-resistant e. faecalis (s613 vs. r712) and e. faecium (s447 vs. r446) recovered before and after dap therapy, we compared four distinct cm profiles: phospholipid content, fatty acid composition, membrane fluidity and capacity to be permeabilized and/or depolarized by dap. additionally, we characterized the cell envelope of the e. faecium strain-pair by transmission electron microscopy and determined the relative cell surface charge of both strain-pairs. principal findings: both e. faecalis and e. faecium mainly contained four major cm pls: phosphatidylglycerol (pg), cardiolipin, lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (l-pg) and glycerolphospho-diglycodiacylglycerol (gp-dgdag). in addition, e. faecalis cms (but not e. faecium) also contained: i) phosphatidic acid; and ii) two other unknown species of amino-containing pls. development of dap resistance in both enterococcal species was associated with a significant decrease in cm fluidity and pg content, with a concomitant increase in gp-dgdag. the strain-pairs did not differ in their outer cm translocation (flipping) of amino-containing pls. fatty acid content did not change in the e. faecalis strain-pair, whereas a significant decrease in unsaturated fatty acids was observed in the dap-resistant e. faecium isolate r446 (vs s447). resistance to dap in e. faecium was associated with distinct structural alterations of the cell envelope and cell wall thickening, as well as a decreased ability of dap to depolarize and permeabilize the cm. conclusion: distinct alterations in pl content and fatty acid composition are associated with development of enterococcal dap resistance.
application of bacteriocinogenic enterococcus mundtii crl35 and enterococcus faecium st88ch in the control of listeria monocytogenes in fresh minas cheese.
several strains of enterococcus spp. are capable of producing bacteriocins with antimicrobial activity against important bacterial pathogens in dairy products. in this study, the bacteriocins produced by two enterococcus strains (enterococcus mundtii crl35 and enterococcus faecium st88ch), isolated from cheeses, were characterized and tested for their capability to control growth of listeria monocytogenes 426 in experimentally contaminated fresh minas cheese during refrigerated storage. both strains were active against a variety of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms and bacteriocin absorption to various l. monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 and lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 varied according to the strain and the testing conditions (ph, temperature, presence of salts and surfactants). growth of l. monocytogenes 426 was inhibited in cheeses containing e. mundtii crl35 up to 12 days at 8 degrees c, evidencing a bacteriostatic effect. e. faecium st88ch was less effective, as the bacteriostatic affect occurred only after 6 days at 8 degrees c. in cheeses containing nisin (12.5 mg/kg), less than one log reduction was observed. this research underlines the potential application of e. mundtii crl35 in the control of l. monocytogenes in minas cheese.
ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the us food and  drug administration (fda) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). after intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. because of its unique spectrum of activity, the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-mrsa activity. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. ceftaroline has low minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for all tested species of streptococci, and has potent activity against s. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. the activity of ceftaroline is limited against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis. the in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class b metallo-beta-lactamases or ampc cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in phase iii randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. two identical trials (canvas 1 and canvas 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with csssi. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (difference -1.1%, 95% ci -4.2, 2.0). an additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the fda guidance definition of absssi at treatment day 3. clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% ci 1.3, 14.0). clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with cap was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase iii trials (focus 1 and focus 2). of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against mrsa, patients with confirmed or suspected mrsa cap were excluded from the focus trials. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% ci 1.6, 11.8). an additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe cap and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. cabp). day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% ci -0.6, 20.6). in the phase iii trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant gram-positive pathogens, including mrsa, as well as many common gram-negative organisms. it is a welcome treatment option for absssi and cabp.
phenotypic and genotypic characterization of bacteriocins in enterococcal isolates of different sources.
a collection of 57 enterococcal isolates from different origin (including river,  treatment plant, spring and garbage water, soil, animal, and vegetables from aydin) was screened for the production of bacteriocins. enterococci were identified at species levels as enterococcus faecium (34), e. hirae (6), e. casseliflavus (4), e. durans (4), e. faecalis (4), e. mundtii (3) and e. avium (2). of the 57 isolates 40 of them inhibited the growth of at least one indicator bacterium. based on our pcr results 54 strains possesed enterocin genes. the genes of enta and entb were the most frequently detected structural genes among the pcr positive strains (54 and 53 strains, respectively) and the entb gene was always associated with enta gene. the highest combination of enterocin genes (24 of 54 strains) detected was enta, entb, entp and entl50a/b. the enterocins as-48 and cyll(ls) genes were not found. three enterococcal isolates, 2 e. faecium and 1 e. hirae were not harbour any of tested enterocin genes. no correlation between the presence of enterocin structural genes and the origin of the strain was detected, also no relationship seemed to exist between the tested enterocin genes and the activity spectra of isolates. genes encoding bacteriocins are widely disseminated among enterocci from different origin and more studies should be done for evaluate industrial potential of bacteriocins. electronic supplementary material: the online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s12088-011-0143-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.
enterococci of animal origin and their significance for public health.
enterococci are commensal bacteria in the intestines of humans and animals, but also cause infections in humans. most often, enterococcus faecium isolates from clinical outbreaks belong to different types than e. faecium from animals, food, and humans in the community. the same variants of the vana gene cluster (tn1546) encoding vancomycin resistance can be detected in enterococci of both human and animal origin. this could indicate horizontal transfer of tn1546 between enterococci of different origin. e. faecium isolates of animal origin might not constitute a human hazard in themselves, but they could act as donors of antimicrobial resistance genes for other pathogenic enterococci. enterococcus faecalis of animal origin seems to be a human hazard, as the same types can be detected in e. faecalis from animals, meat, faecal samples from humans in the community, and patients with bloodstream infections.

enterococci are major nosocomial pathogens due to their intrinsic resistance to many antimicrobials as well as to their ability to acquire new mechanisms of resistance. acquired resistance to beta-lactams is due to pbp5 overproduction or alterations in this protein. beta-lactamase production is anecdotal. high-level resistance (hlr) to aminoglycosides is due to the production of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes that delete synergistic killing in association with cell wall-active agents. the most frequent enzyme is aac(6')- aph(2"), which inactivates all the aminoglycosides most frequently used in clinical practice. acquired resistance to glycopeptides is due to the acquisition of gene clusters called vana, vanb, vand, vane, vang, vanl, vanm and vann. linezolid resistance is due to ribosomal mutations or to the acquisition of the cfr gene. some isolates present diminished susceptibility to daptomycin. in spain, both enterococcal resistance to beta-lactams and hlr to aminoglycosides are high. e. faecalis is almost uniformly susceptible to ampicillin. enterococcal resistance to glycopeptides is low, with the exception of occasional outbreaks. the new antimicrobials (linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline) are almost uniformly active against these microorganisms. because of the wide dissemination of the high-risk clonal complexes cc2 and cc9 (e. faecalis), and cc17 (e. faecium), surveillance studies are required to detect antimicrobial resistance genes as well as to identify high-risk clonal complexes in order to predict future trends in the acquisition of resistance genes.
characterization of an anti-listerial enterocin from wheat silage based enterococcus faecium.
two enterococcus faecium and one e. faecalis strains isolated and identified from wheat silage were characterized based on plasmid content, hemolytic activity, antibiotic resistance patterns, bacteriocin production potential, and presence of enterocin structural genes (enta, entb, entp, entl50b). among the isolates, only the e. faecium u7 strain exhibited bacteriocin activity against listeria monocytogenes atcc 7644, and vancomycin resistant enterococcus spp. (vre). a combination of three structural genes (enta, entb, and entp) was detected in e. faecium u7. a relationship between the presence of enterocin structural genes, and bacteriocin activity was detected in e. faecium u7; therefore partially purified enterocin (ppe) was further investigated from the isolate. several bands of different molecular weights were expressed from ppe extracts following tricine sds-page analysis. however, the only band showing bacteriocin activity was in an approximate 4-kda region. ppe treatment with proteinase k, lysozyme, and alpha -amylase caused complete loss of bacteriocin activity. ppe heat treatment at various temperatures resulted in a notable reduction in bacteriocin expression. enterocin u7 was relatively heat stable, and presumably exhibits a glucoprotein nature with distinct inhibitory properties. specific bacterial inhibitory activity of enterocin u7, and the producer strain absence of beta -hemolysis and vancomycin susceptibility features deserves further investigation to evaluate its potential application in silage inoculation and food preservation.
enterococcus faecium wb2000 inhibits biofilm formation by oral cariogenic streptococci.
this study investigated the inhibitory effect of probiotic enterococcus faecium wb2000 on biofilm formation by cariogenic streptococci. the ability of e. faecium wb2000 and jcm5804 and enterococcus faecalis jcm5803 to inhibit biofilm formation by seven laboratory oral streptococcal strains and 13 clinical mutans streptococcal strains was assayed. the enterococcal strains inhibited biofilm formation in dual cultures with the mutans streptococcal strains streptococcus mutans xc and streptococcus sobrinus jcm5176 (p < 0.05), but not with the noncariogenic streptococcal strains. enterococcus faecium wb2000 inhibited biofilm formation by 90.0% (9/10) of the clinical s. mutans strains and 100% (3/3) of the clinical s. sobrinus strains. after culturing, the ph did not differ between single and dual cultures. the viable counts of floating mutans streptococci were lower in dual cultures with e. faecium wb2000 than in single cultures. enterococcus faecium wb2000 acted as a probiotic bacterial inhibitor of cariogenic streptococcal biofilm formation.
single center experience of a vancomycin resistant enterococcal endocarditis cohort.
objectives: vancomycin resistant enterococcus (vre) infective endocarditis (ie) is an increasing nosocomial problem. we describe the clinical management and outcomes of a cohort of patients with vre ie at a tertiary endocarditis referral center. methods: retrospective review of all proven cases of vre ie, from july 2000 through january 2008 was performed. demographics, comorbidities and therapeutic details were collected and analyzed to assess for risk factors and clinical outcomes. results: fifty cases of vre ie were identified: 26 (52%) were enterococcus faecium and 24 were enterococcus faecalis. vancomycin resistant e. faecalis ie was associated with the presence of a central venous line, liver transplantation, and mitral valve infection while vr e. faecium ie was significantly associated with tricuspid valve infection (p=0.03). the median duration of bacteremia was 14 days for e. faecium and 4 days for e. faecalis, respectively (p=0.002). factors associated with mortality on bivariate analysis were hemodialysis via a catheter with vr e. faecium (or=11.7. ci 1.1-122, p=0.02) and liver transplantation with both species. combination antimicrobial therapy (or=0.5 ci=0.06-3.2, p=0.1) and valve surgery (or 1.3 ci 0.8-20, p=0.02) trended toward improved survival with e. faecalis on bivariate analysis. on multivariate analysis, none of the associations were significant. conclusions: hemodialysis and liver transplantation were factors associated with acquisition of vre ie. there was a higher mortality and prolonged bacteremia with vr e. faecium ie than vr e. faecalis ie. although not significant, combination antimicrobial therapy and surgical intervention trended toward improved survival.
protein expression vector and secretion signal peptide optimization to drive the  production, secretion, and functional expression of the bacteriocin enterocin a in lactic acid bacteria.
replacement of the leader sequence (ls) of the bacteriocin enterocin a (ls(enta)) by the signal peptides (sp) of the protein usp45 (sp(usp45)), and the bacteriocins enterocin p (sp(entp)), and hiracin jm79 (sp(hirjm79)) permits the production, secretion, and functional expression of enta by different lactic acid bacteria (lab). chimeric genes encoding the sp(usp45), the sp(entp), and the sp(hirjm79) fused to mature enta plus the enta immunity genes (enta+entia) were cloned into the expression vectors pnz8048 and pmsp3545, under control of the inducible p(nisa) promoter, and in pmg36c, under control of the constitutive p(32) promoter. the amount, antimicrobial activity, and specific antimicrobial activity of the enta produced by the recombinant lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, lactobacillus sakei and pediococcus acidilactici hosts varied depending on the signal peptide, the expression vector, and the host strain. however, the antimicrobial activity and the specific antimicrobial activity of the enta produced by most of the lab transformants was lower than expected from their production. the supernatants of the recombinant l. lactis nz9000 (pnzuai) and l. lactis nz9000 (pnzhai), overproducers of enta, showed a 1.2- to 5.1-fold higher antimicrobial activity than that of the natural producer e. faecium t136 against different listeria spp.
lower prevalence of antibiotic-resistant enterococci on u.s. conventional poultry farms that transitioned to organic practices.
background: in u.s. conventional poultry production, antimicrobials are used for  therapeutic, prophylactic, and nontherapeutic purposes. researchers have shown that this can select for antibiotic-resistant commensal and pathogenic bacteria on poultry farms and in poultry-derived products. however, no u.s. studies have investigated on-farm changes in resistance as conventional poultry farms transition to organic practices and cease using antibiotics. objective: we investigated the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant enterococcus on u.s. conventional poultry farms that transitioned to organic practices. methods: poultry litter, feed, and water samples were collected from 10 conventional and 10 newly organic poultry houses in 2008 and tested for enterococcus. enterococcus (n = 259) was identified using the vitek(r) 2 compact system and tested for susceptibility to 17 antimicrobials using the sensititre microbroth dilution system. data were analyzed using sas software (version 9.2), and statistical associations were derived based on generalized linear mixed models. results: litter, feed, and water samples were enterococcus positive. the percentages of resistant enterococcus faecalis and resistant enterococcus faecium were significantly lower (p < 0.05) among isolates from newly organic versus conventional poultry houses for two (erythromycin and tylosin) and five (ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, penicillin, and tetracycline) antimicrobials, respectively. forty-two percent of e. faecalis isolates from conventional poultry houses were multidrug resistant (mdr; resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes), compared with 10% of isolates from newly organic poultry houses (p = 0.02); 84% of e. faecium isolates from conventional poultry houses were mdr, compared with 17% of isolates from newly organic poultry houses (p < 0.001). conclusions: our findings suggest that the voluntary removal of antibiotics from large-scale u.s. poultry farms that transition to organic practices is associated with a lower prevalence of antibiotic-resistant and mdr enterococcus.
first detection of the staphylococcal trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk and the dfrk-carrying transposon tn559 in enterococci.
the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk has been recently described in staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. a total of 166 enterococci of different species (e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrk gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. the dfrk gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/l or </=1 mg/l, respectively). the tet(l)-dfrk linkage was detected in 21% of dfrk-positive enterococci. the chromosomal location of the dfrk gene was identified in one e. faecium isolate in which the dfrk was not linked to tet(l) gene but was part of a tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radc gene. this tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. all combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrk, dfrg, dfrf, dfrk+dfrg, dfrk+dfrf, dfrf+dfrg, and dfrf+dfrg+dfrk). the gene dfrk gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. this study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrg.
genetic organization and mode of action of a novel bacteriocin, bacteriocin 51: determinant of vana-type vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium.
bacteriocin 51 (bac 51) is encoded on the mobile plasmid phy (6,037 bp), which was isolated from vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium vre38. bacteriocin 51 is active against e. faecium, e. hirae, and e. durans. sequence analysis of phy showed that it encodes nine open reading frames (orfs) from orf1 to orf9 (in that order). genetic analysis suggested that orf1 and orf2, which were designated baca and bacb, respectively, are the bacteriocin and immunity genes. baca encodes a 144-amino-acid protein. the deduced baca protein has a typical signal sequence at its amino terminus, and a potential signal peptidase-processing site corresponding to the v-e-a sequence is located between the 37th and 39th amino acids. the predicted mature baca protein consists of 105 amino acids. a potential promoter sequence was identified upstream of the start codon. bacb encodes a 55-amino-acid protein. no obvious promoter or terminator sequence was identified between baca and bacb. northern blot analysis of baca and bacb with a baca rna probe produced a transcript of approximately 700 nucleotides, which corresponded to the combined nucleotide sizes of baca and bacb, indicating that transcription was initiated from the promoter upstream of baca, continued through bacb, and was terminated at the terminator downstream of bacb. the transcription start site was determined to be the t nucleotide located 6 nucleotides downstream from the -10 promoter sequence. these results indicate that baca and bacb constitute an operon and that baca is the bacteriocin structural gene while bacb is the immunity gene. the purified c-terminally his tagged baca protein of bac 51 showed bacteriostatic activity against the indicator strain. the purified c-terminally his tagged baca protein of bac 32 (whose mature baca protein has 54 amino acids) and the culture filtrates of the bac 31- and bac 43-producing e. faecalis strain fa2-2 showed bactericidal activity. bac 31 and bac 43 are pore-forming bacteriocins, unlike the newly characterized bacteriocin bac 51.
antibiotic resistance in faecal bacteria isolated from horses receiving virginiamycin for the prevention of pasture-associated laminitis.
enterococcus faecium, a major cause of potentially life-threatening hospital-acquired human infections, can be resistant to several antimicrobials, such that streptogramin quinupristin-dalfopristin (q/d) is one of the few antibiotics still effective. consequently use of the streptogramin virginiamycin as an animal growth promoter was banned in the eu in 1999 as some believed this contributed to the emergence of q/d resistant e. faecium. virginiamycin is advocated for preventing equine pasture-associated laminitis, but its effect on equine faecal bacterial q/d resistance has not been determined. faecal samples were obtained from horses receiving virginiamycin, horses co-grazing and horses not exposed to virginiamycin. streptogramin resistant e. faecium were cultured from 70% (21/30) of animals treated with virginiamycin, 75% (18/24) of co-grazing animals and 69% (11/16) of animals not exposed. ermb and vatd genes were detected using real time pcr in 63% and 66% of animals treated with virginiamycin, 75% and 71% of co-grazing animals and 63% and 69% of animals not exposed. antimicrobial resistance genes were present only in samples which had cultured q/d resistant e. faecium. there was no significant difference between groups with respect to antimicrobial resistance. the gene load of vatd was significantly (p=0.04) greater in unexposed animals compared to those treated with virginiamycin. the use of virginiamycin to prevent pasture-associated laminitis does not appear to be related to an increased q/d resistance frequency. however, in view of the high frequency of resistance within all groups, the horse is a reservoir of q/d resistant genes and clones that potentially could be transferred transiently to humans.
potential beneficial properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from smoked salmon.
aims: to evaluate the probiotic properties of strains isolated from smoked salmon and previously identified as bacteriocin producers. methods and results: strains lactobacillus curvatus et06, et30 and et31, lactobacillus fermentum et35, lactobacillus delbrueckii et32, pediococcus acidilactici et34 and enterococcus faecium et05, et12 and et88 survived conditions simulating the gastrointestinal tract (git) and produced bacteriocins active against several strains of listeria monocytogenes, but presented very low activity against other lactic acid bacteria (lab). cell-free supernatants containing bacteriocins, added to 3-h-old cultures of l. monocytogenes 603, suppressed growth over 12 h. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values ranged from 7.2% for et35 to 12.1% for et05. various degrees of co-aggregation with l. monocytogenes 603, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 were observed. adherence of the bacteriocinogenic strains to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. the highest levels of hydrophobicity were recorded for lact. curvatus (61.9-64.6%), lact. fermentum (78.9%), lact. delbrueckii (43.7%) and ped. acidilactici (51.3%), which are higher than the one recorded for lact. rhamnosus gg (53.3%). these strains were highly sensitive to several antibiotics and affected by several drugs from different generic groups in a strain-dependent manner. conclusions: smoked salmon is a rich source of probiotic lab. all strains survived conditions simulating the git and produced bacteriocins active against various pathogens. adherence to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lact. rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. in addition, the high hydrophobicity readings recorded define the strains as good probiotics.
telavancin activity against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with skin and skin-structure infections.
telavancin is approved in the united states and canada for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) in adults caused by susceptible gram-positive organisms. the antimicrobial activity of telavancin and comparators was evaluated against 5,027 (2007-2008) gram-positive bacteria responsible for sssi in medical centers in asia-pacific, european, latin american, and north american regions. telavancin was active against staphylococcus aureus (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l). telavancin inhibited all enterococcus faecalis, including four strains displaying a vanb phenotype, at </= 1 mg/l (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.25/0.5 mg/l), except for two isolates with a vana phenotype (mic, >2 mg/l). vancomycin-susceptible and vanb vancomycin-resistant e. faecium were inhibited by telavancin at </= 0.25 mg/l, while this drug exhibited elevated mic values (>/= 0.5 mg/l) against e. faecium of vana phenotype (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 2/>2 mg/l). telavancin was potent against beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and viridans group streptococci (mic(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible). these in vitro data document the activity of telavancin against contemporary gram-positive isolates and support its clinical use for the treatment of csssi caused by the indicated pathogens.
antimicrobial characterisation of solithromycin (cem-101), a novel fluoroketolide: activity against staphylococci and enterococci.
solithromycin (cem-101) is a novel fluoroketolide with high potency against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria commonly associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. in this study, solithromycin and comparator antimicrobials were tested against a contemporary collection of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and other enterococcus spp. collected in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. solithromycin was active against s. aureus [minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the organisms (mic(50))=0.12 mug/ml] and was two-fold more active than telithromycin (mic(50)=0.25 mug/ml). solithromycin was more potent against methicillin (oxacillin)-susceptible s. aureus [mic(50)=0.06 mug/ml and mic for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=0.12 mug/ml) compared with methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant s. aureus (mic(50)=0.12 mug/ml and mic(90)>16 mug/ml). solithromycin activity was reduced amongst heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (mic(50)>16 mug/ml). against strains with defined susceptibilities to erythromycin, clindamycin and telithromycin, solithromycin showed potent inhibition against all combinations (mic(50)=0.06 mug/ml) except those with non-susceptibility to telithromycin (>2 mug/ml) (mic(50)>16 mug/ml). the solithromycin mic(50) for e. faecium (1 mug/ml) was four-fold higher than the mic(50) for e. faecalis (0.25 mug/ml). in summary, solithromycin demonstrated high potency against many staphylococcus and enterococcus spp. isolated from contemporary infections worldwide.
antimicrobial resistance in swiss laying hens, prevalence and risk factors.
antimicrobial resistance is an emerging concern to public health, and food-producing animals are known to be a potential source for transmission of resistant bacteria to humans. as legislation of the european union requires to ban conventional cages for the housing of laying hens on the one hand, and a high food safety standard for eggs on the other hand, further investigations about the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in alternative housing types are required. in this study, we determined antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria from 396 cloacal swabs from 99 swiss laying hen farms among four alternative housing types during a cross-sectional study. on each farm, four hens were sampled and exposure to potential risk factors was identified with a questionnaire. the minimal inhibitory concentration was determined using broth microdilution in escherichia coli (n=371) for 18 antimicrobials and in enterococcus faecalis (n=138) and enterococcus faecium (n=153) for 16 antimicrobials. all antimicrobial classes recommended by the european food safety authority for e. coli and enterococci were included in the resistance profile. sixty per cent of the e. coli isolates were susceptible to all of the considered antimicrobials and 30% were resistant to at least two antimicrobials. in e. faecalis, 33% of the strains were susceptible to all tested antimicrobials and 40% were resistant to two or more antimicrobials, whereas in e. faecium these figures were 14% and 39% respectively. risk factor analyses were carried out for bacteria species and antimicrobials with a prevalence of resistance between 15% and 85%. in these analyses, none of the considered housing and management factors showed a consistent association with the prevalence of resistance for more than two combinations of bacteria and antimicrobial. therefore we conclude that the impact of the considered housing and management practices on the egg producing farms on resistance in laying hens is low.
effects of enterococcus faecium supplementation and floor type on performance, morphology of erythrocytes and intestinal microbiota in broiler chickens.
1. the experiment was to study the effects of floor type and probiotic supplementation (enterococcus faecium) on performance, morphology of erythrocytes and intestinal microbiota of male ross 308 broiler chickens. 2. the experimental design was a factorial 2 x 2 with 6 replicates. the factors were floor type (wire floor versus wood shaving litter) and the presence or absence of probiotic. 3. birds housed on wood shavings exhibited significantly improved weight gain and food intake. 4. addition of e. faecium led to significantly decreased food intake and gizzard weight. supplementation with e. faecium positively influenced the ileal and caecal microbiota, with a significant decrease in the population of escherichia coli. 5. erythrocyte length decreased and erythrocyte width increased in the birds housed on wood shavings.
proteomic characterization of vana-containing enterococcus recovered from seagulls at the berlengas natural reserve, w portugal.
background: enterococci have emerged as the third most common cause of nosocomial infections, requiring bactericidal antimicrobial therapy. although vancomycin resistance is a major problem in clinics and has emerged in an important extend in farm animals, few studies have examined it in wild animals. to determine the prevalence of vana-containing enterococcus strains among faecal samples of seagulls (larus cachinnans) of berlengas natural reserve of portugal, we developed a proteomic approach integrated with genomic data. the purpose was to detect the maximum number of proteins that vary in different enterococci species which are thought to be connected in some, as yet unknown, way to antibiotic resistance. results: from the 57 seagull samples, 54 faecal samples showed the presence of enterococcus isolates (94.7%). for the enterococci, e. faecium was the most prevalent species in seagulls (50%), followed by e. faecalis and e. durans (10.4%), and e. hirae (6.3%). vana-containing enterococcal strains were detected in 10.5% of the 57 seagull faecal samples studied. four of the vana-containing enterococci were identified as e. faecium and two as e. durans. the tet(m) gene was found in all five tetracycline-resistant vana strains. the erm(b) gene was demonstrated in all six erythromycin-resistant vana strains. the hyl virulence gene was detected in all four vana-containing e. faecium isolates in this study, and two of them harboured the purk1 allele. in addition these strains also showed ampicillin and ciprofoxacin resistance. the whole-cell proteomic profile of vana-containing enterococcus strains was applied to evaluate the discriminatory power of this technique for their identification. the major differences among species-specific profiles were found in the positions corresponding to 97-45 kda. sixty individualized protein spots for each vana isolate was identified and suitable for peptide mass fingerprinting measures by spectrometry measuring (maldi/tof ms) and their identification through bioinformatic databases query. the proteins were classified in different groups according to their biological function: protein biosynthesis, atp synthesis, glycolysis, conjugation and antibiotic resistance. taking into account the origin of these strains and its relation to infectious processes in humans and animals, it is important to explore the proteome of new strains which might serve as protein biomarkers for biological activity. conclusions: the comprehensive description of proteins isolated from vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and e. durans may provide new targets for development of antimicrobial agents. this knowledge may help to identify new biomarkers of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors.
antimicrobial-resistant enterococci in animals and meat: a human health hazard?
enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis belong to the gastrointestinal flora of humans and animals. although normally regarded harmless commensals, enterococci may cause a range of different infections in humans, including urinary tract infections, sepsis, and endocarditis. the use of avoparcin, gentamicin, and virginiamycin for growth promotion and therapy in food animals has lead to the emergence of vancomycin- and gentamicin-resistant enterococci and quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant e. faecium in animals and meat. this implies a potential risk for transfer of resistance genes or resistant bacteria from food animals to humans. the genes encoding resistance to vancomycin, gentamicin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin have been found in e. faecium of human and animal origin; meanwhile, certain clones of e. faecium are found more frequently in samples from human patients, while other clones predominate in certain animal species. this may suggest that antimicrobial-resistant e. faecium from animals could be regarded less hazardous to humans; however, due to their excellent ability to acquire and transfer resistance genes, e. faecium of animal origin may act as donors of antimicrobial resistance genes for other more virulent enterococci. for e. faecalis, the situation appears different, as similar clones of, for example, vancomycin- and gentamicin-resistant e. faecalis have been obtained from animals and from human patients. continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci from humans and animals is essential to follow trends and detect emerging resistance.
potent antimicrobial activity of 3-(4,5-diaryl-1h-imidazol-2-yl)-1h-indole derivatives against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
a new series of antimicrobial derivatives [3-(4,5-diaryl-1h-imidazol-2-yl)-1h-indole)] have been synthesized with potent activity against strains of staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains (mrsa). compound 17 [3-(4,5-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1h-imidazol-2-yl)-5-bromo-1h-indole], the most active derivative was shown to inhibit the growth of all gram-positive strains tested, including vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium with no activity against gram-negative bacteria.
antimicrobial resistance of enterococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples in korea.
the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance of various species of enterococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples. a total of 105 enterococci isolates were examined: enterococcus faecalis (n = 47), enterococcus faecium (n = 39), enterococcus gallinarum (n = 6), enterococcus avium (n = 6), enterococcus hirae (n = 5) and enterococcus durans (n = 2). all the isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin, and only a single e. hirae isolate was resistant to ampicillin. in general, the most frequently observed resistance among the enterococcal isolates was to tetracycline (69.5%), followed by penicillin (64.7%), erythromycin (57.1%) and cephalothin (44.7%). a similar antimicrobial resistance pattern was observed among individual species except e. durans, which exhibited only tetracycline resistance. resistance observed among isolates of e. hirae and e. gallinarum was almost as high as e. faecium and e. faecalis. of 105 isolates, only six (5.7%) strains of e. faecium were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested and about 52% (55/105) showed resistance to more than three antimicrobials. the most common multiple resistance pattern was penicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin, which was observed in 32 of 105 (30.4%) isolates. this study demonstrates that enterococcal isolates belonging to minor species showed antimicrobial resistance rates as high as those of e. faecium and e. faecalis, and that monitoring of antimicrobial resistance should not be restricted only to those two major species.
clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium bacteraemia--a five-year retrospective review.
the purpose of this study was to assess the epidemiology and outcomes of enterococcal bacteraemia. a retrospective review of demographic, microbiological and clinical data in patients 16 years of age and over with enterococcus faecalis or e. faecium bacteraemia at auckland city hospital, new zealand, from june 2002 to may 2007 was carried out. a total of 212 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with 205 being included in the analysis. e. faecalis accounted for 86% (176/205) and e. faecium 14% (29/205) of the patients. amoxycillin resistance occurred in 69% (20/29) of e. faecium isolates. high-level gentamicin resistance was present in 38% (65/171) of e. faecalis isolates and 25% (7/28) of e. faecium isolates (p = ns). no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated. healthcare association was present in 73% (149/205) of patients. co-morbidities were present in 86% (176/205) of patients. the 7-day mortality was 13% (27/205) and the 30-day mortality 25% (52/205). on multivariate analysis, the 7-day mortality was statistically significantly associated with cirrhosis and shorter intravenous amoxycillin therapy. the 30-day mortality was statistically significantly associated with cirrhosis, malignancy, e. faecium bacteraemia and not receiving active antimicrobial therapy. no statistically significant association between high-level gentamicin resistance and mortality was demonstrated on multivariate analysis. enterococcal bacteraemia occurs in a co-morbid, healthcare-exposed population. associated mortality is high, and is associated with severe underlying disease, e. faecium bacteraemia and treatment factors.
species distribution and resistance patterns to growth-promoting antimicrobials of enterococci isolated from pigs and chickens in korea.
a total of 147 enterococcus faecium and 165 enterococcus faecalis isolates from fecal samples of chickens and pigs at slaughterhouses in korea were tested for their resistance to 8 growth-promoting antimicrobials commonly used in animals and quinupristin and dalfopristin. resistance to most antimicrobials was very common among both e. faecalis and e. faecium. in particular, e. faecalis showed almost no susceptibility to all the antimicrobials tested except penicillin and flavomycin, to which 1.4% and less than 24% showed resistance, respectively. although the prevalence of resistance was lower than in e. faecalis, e. faecium showed relatively uniform resistance to all the agents tested. among the antimicrobials tested, virginiamycin and penicillin were the most effective against e. faecium isolates: less than 31% and 41% showed resistance to those 2 antimicrobials, respectively. penicillin was the only agent that showed relatively strong activity against both e. faecalis and e. faecium. resistance observed in e. faecalis and e. faecium against most antimicrobials used for growth promotion was more prevalent in korea than in european countries. the current study is the first report of resistance against feed additive antimicrobials in enterococcal isolates from livestock in korea.
spectrum of activity and mode of action of rep3123, a new antibiotic to treat clostridium difficile infections.
objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of rep3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-trna synthetase (metrs) in development for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection. methods: the spectrum of activity of rep3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of c. difficile and non-target organisms. the mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. results: rep3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of c. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant bi/nap1/027 strains (mic range=0.5-1 mg/l and mic(90) = 1 mg/l). the spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (mic(90)s < 1 mg/l), but rep3123 was not active against most gram-negative bacteria. rep3123 targeted c. difficile metrs with a calculated inhibition constant (k(i)) of 0.020 nm, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metrs. the specific mode of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by rep3123, and by mets overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in mic for rep3123. spontaneous rep3123-resistant mutants of c. difficile (mics, 4-128 mg/l) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the mets gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. most of the metrs substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target c. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.
relation of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates from foods and clinical specimens.
clinical enterococcus faecalis (n=65) and enterococcus faecium (n=12) blood isolates from three swiss hospitals were characterized with testing for resistance to antimicrobial agents, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), and the occurrence of virulence factors. phenotypic determination of resistance to antimicrobial agents resulted in 20% of e. faecalis isolates showing a triple resistance against chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, and seven isolates (two e. faecalis and five e. faecium) exhibiting a multiresistance against five or more antimicrobials. one isolate each of e. faecalis and e. faecium showed vancomycin resistance. all isolates contained at least two of the nine tested virulence genes (agg, gele, cyl, esp, efaafs, efaafm, cpd, cob, and ccf). phylogenetic analysis of the pfge profiles identified several small clusters within e. faecalis isolates, one of which included isolates of all three hospitals. fifty-six (73%) isolates occurred as unique, patient-specific clones. several pfge types were associated with shared features in their resistance patterns, indicating spread between and within wards. finally, enterococci from this study and previous isolates from cheeses were examined by pfge typing. the comparison of pfge profiles from human and food isolates resulted in clusters of genetically strong related strains, which suggests high similarities of the enterococcal community composition of these two environments. a possible spread of the enterococcal isolates through the food supply cannot be excluded.
identification and phenotypic characterization of a second collagen adhesin, scm, and genome-based identification and analysis of 13 other predicted mscramms, including four distinct pilus loci, in enterococcus faecium.
attention has recently been drawn to enterococcus faecium because of an increasing number of nosocomial infections caused by this species and its resistance to multiple antibacterial agents. however, relatively little is known about the pathogenic determinants of this organism. we have previously identified a cell-wall-anchored collagen adhesin, acm, produced by some isolates of e. faecium, and a secreted antigen, saga, exhibiting broad-spectrum binding to extracellular matrix proteins. here, we analysed the draft genome of strain tx0016 for potential microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (mscramms). genome-based bioinformatics identified 22 predicted cell-wall-anchored e. faecium surface proteins (fms), of which 15 (including acm) had characteristics typical of mscramms, including predicted folding into a modular architecture with multiple immunoglobulin-like domains. functional characterization of one [fms10; redesignated second collagen adhesin of e. faecium (scm)] revealed that recombinant scm(65) (a- and b-domains) and scm(36) (a-domain) bound to collagen type v efficiently in a concentration-dependent manner, bound considerably less to collagen type i and fibrinogen, and differed from acm in their binding specificities to collagen types iv and v. results from far-uv circular dichroism measurements of recombinant scm(36) and of acm(37) indicated that these proteins were rich in beta-sheets, supporting our folding predictions. whole-cell elisa and facs analyses unambiguously demonstrated surface expression of scm in most e. faecium isolates. strikingly, 11 of the 15 predicted mscramms clustered in four loci, each with a class c sortase gene; nine of these showed similarity to enterococcus faecalis ebp pilus subunits and also contained motifs essential for pilus assembly. antibodies against one of the predicted major pilus proteins, fms9 (redesignated ebpc(fm)), detected a 'ladder' pattern of high-molecular-mass protein bands in a western blot analysis of cell surface extracts from e. faecium, suggesting that ebpc(fm) is polymerized into a pilus structure. further analysis of the transcripts of the corresponding gene cluster indicated that fms1 (ebpa(fm)), fms5 (ebpb(fm)) and ebpc(fm) are co-transcribed, a result consistent with those for pilus-encoding gene clusters of other gram-positive bacteria. all 15 genes occurred frequently in 30 clinically derived diverse e. faecium isolates tested. the common occurrence of mscramm- and pilus-encoding genes and the presence of a second collagen-binding protein may have important implications for our understanding of this emerging pathogen.
virulence factors and bacteriocins in faecal enterococci of wild boars.
the production of antimicrobial, haemolytic and gelatinase activities was tested  in 67 enterococci (39 e. faecium, 24 e. hirae, 2 e. faecalis, and 2 enterococcus spp.), recovered from faecal samples of wild boars. in addition, the presence of genes encoding bacteriocin and virulence factors was also analysed by pcr and sequencing. production of antimicrobial activity was checked in all enterococci against 9 indicator bacteria and it was detected in 11 e. faecium isolates (16.5%); eight and two of them harboured the genes encoding enterocin a + enterocin b and enterocin l50a/b, respectively. sixty-seven per cent of our enterococci harboured different combinations of genes of the cyl operon, but none of them contained the complete cyl l(l)l(s)abm operon, necessary for cytolysin expression. the presence of gel e gene, associated with the fsr abc locus, was identified in 4 e. faecium and two e. faecalis isolates, exhibiting all of them gelatinase activity. beta -hemolytic activity was not found in our isolates. both cpd and ace genes, encoding respectively the accessory colonisation factor and pheromone, were detected in two e. faecalis isolates, and the hyl gene, encoding hyalorunidase, in two e. faecium isolates, one of them gelatinase-positive. genes encoding bacteriocins and virulence factors are widely disseminated among faecal enterococci of wild boars and more studies should be carried out to know the global distribution of these determinants in enterococci of different ecosystems.
assessment of environmental enterococci: bacterial antagonism, pathogenic capacity and antibiotic resistance.
the properties of 166 environmental strains belonging to the seven enterococcal species were studied. enterococci originated mainly from surface- and waste-waters. they were screened for the presence of enterocins, virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance. the presence of different enterocin genes (enta, entb, entp, ent31, entl50ab) was frequently observed in our enterococcal isolates, 109 strains contained at least one enterocin gene. the distribution of enterocin genes varied according to the species, the genes were present mainly in e. hirae and e. faecium. by enterocin spot assay, 10 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria strains. to evaluate the pathogenic ability of isolates, the distribution of selected virulence genes (cyla, gele and esp) was investigated, eleven strains were positive in some of these genes, five of them belonged to e. faecalis. regarding the antibiotic resistance of isolates, only two strains were multiresistant and two strains (e. hirae and e. casseliflavus) were resistant to vancomycin.
peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in situ hybridization for hospital-acquired enterococcal bacteremia: delivering earlier effective antimicrobial therapy.
hospital-acquired vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia has been associated with increased hospital costs, length of stay, and mortality. the peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in situ hybridization (pna fish) test for enterococcus faecalis and other enterococci (efoe) is a multicolor probe that differentiates e. faecalis from other enterococcal species within 3 h directly from blood cultures demonstrating gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains (gpcpc). a quasiexperimental study was performed over two consecutive years beginning in 2005 that identified gpcpc by conventional microbiological methods, and in 2006 pna fish was added with a treatment algorithm developed by the antimicrobial team (amt). the primary outcome assessed was the time from blood culture draw to the implementation of effective antimicrobial therapy before and after pna fish. the severity of illness, patient location, and empirical antimicrobial therapy were measured. a total of 224 patients with hospital-acquired enterococcal bacteremia were evaluated, with 129 in the preintervention period and 95 in the pna fish period. pna fish identified e. faecalis 3 days earlier than conventional cultures (1.1 versus 4.1 days; p < 0.001). pna fish identified enterococcus faecium a median 2.3 days earlier (1.1 versus 3.4 days; p < 0.001) and was associated with statistically significant reductions in the time to initiating effective therapy (1.3 versus 3.1 days; p < 0.001) and decreased 30-day mortality (26% versus 45%; p = 0.04). the efoe pna fish test in conjunction with an amt treatment algorithm resulted in earlier initiation of appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients with hospital-acquired e. faecium bacteremia.
molecular characterization of enterococci harboring genotype and phenotype incongruence related to glycopeptide resistance isolated in brazilian hospitals.
three enterococcus faecalis and one enterococcus faecium strains were characterized by plasmid profile, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and determination of antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations. vana elements were characterized by long pcr, overlapping pcr and dna sequencing. enterococcal strains showed resistance to vancomycin and harbored the vana gene, and three these were teicoplanin susceptible while one showed intermediate resistance to teicoplanin. two e. faecalis strains showed indistinguishable pfge profile while the third was unrelated. e. faecalis strains showed a deletion in the right terminal region of the tn1546-like element. the e. faecium strain showed an insertion element in the vanxy intergenic region. mutations in vana elements were not found. rearrangements in the vana element could be responsible for incongruities in genotype and phenotype in these strains.
prevalence and characterization of enterococcus spp. isolated from brazilian foods.
enterococci can be used in the food industry as starter or probiotic cultures. however, enterococci are also implicated in severe multi-resistant nosocomial infections. in this study, the prevalence of enterococci in selected brazilian foodstuffs (raw and pasteurized milk, meat products, cheeses and vegetables) was evaluated. phenotypic and pcr protocols were used for species identification. tests for production of gelatinase, haemolysin, bacteriocin and bile salt hydrolysis were done with all enterococci isolates, whereas molecular determination of virulence markers (genes esp, gel, ace, as, efaa, hyl and cyla) and antibiotic resistance was checked only for enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolates. the antibiotic-resistant isolates were assayed for biofilm formation and adhesion to mammalian cells. from the 120 food samples analyzed, 52.5% were positive for enterococci, meat and cheese being the most contaminated. e. faecium was the predominant species, followed by e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum. phenotypic tests indicated that 67.7% of isolates hydrolyzed bile salts, 15.2% produced bacteriocin, 12.0% were beta-hemolytic and 18.2% produced gelatinase. antibiotic resistance (gentamicin, tetracycline and erythromycin) and genes encoding for virulence traits were more frequent in e. faecalis than in e. faecium. three e. faecium isolates were resistant to vancomycin. among antibiotic-resistant isolates, 72.4% of e. faecalis were able to form biofilm and 13.8% to adhere to caco-2 cells. antibiotic-resistant e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates were grouped by rapd-pcr and a scattered distribution was noted, indicating that resistance was not related to a particular clone. the spread of virulence/resistance traits in isolates of the two species and different rapd-types suggest the pathogenic potential of both species. by contrast, the recovery of bacteriocinogenic e. faecium isolates with no virulence traits suggests their potential for biotechnological applications. in conclusion, our results showed that enterococci from brazilian foods present important dualist aspects for food safety.
antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at < or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa may be prevalent.
cloning and heterologous production of hiracin jm79, a sec-dependent bacteriocin  produced by enterococcus hirae dch5, in lactic acid bacteria and pichia pastoris.
hiracin jm79 (hirjm79), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus hirae dch5, was cloned and produced in lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and pichia pastoris. for heterologous production of hirjm79 in lactic acid bacteria (lab), the hirjm79 structural gene (hirjm79), with or without the hirjm79 immunity gene (hirijm79), was cloned into the plasmid pmg36c under the control of the constitutive promoter p(32) and into the plasmid pnz8048 under the control of the inducible p(nisa) promoter. for the production of hirjm79 in p. pastoris, the gene encoding the mature hirjm79 protein was cloned into the ppiczalphaa expression vector. the recombinant plasmids permitted the production of biologically active hirjm79 in the supernatants of l. lactis il1403, l. lactis nz9000, l. sakei lb790, e. faecalis jh2-2, and p. pastoris x-33, the coproduction of hirjm79 and nisin a in l. lactis dpc5598, and the coproduction of hirjm79 and enterocin p in e. faecium l50/14-2. all recombinant lab produced larger quantities of hirjm79 than e. hirae dch5, although the antimicrobial activities of most transformants were lower than that predicted from their production of hirjm79. the synthesis, processing, and secretion of hirjm79 proceed efficiently in recombinant lab strains and p. pastoris.
characterization and susceptibility patterns of clinically important enterococcus species in eastern nepal.
life threatening infections caused by enterococcus species with multidrug resistance has emerged as a threat to medical care in the present era. this study was conducted to characterize enterococcus species isolated from different clinical samples and to detect the pattern of susceptibility to some of the commonly used antibiotics in b.p koirala institute of health sciences (bpkihs), a tertiary care hospital in eastern nepal. clinical samples submitted to the microbiology unit of central laboratory service (cls) for culture and sensitivity during march 2002 - february 2003 was analyzed. enterococcus species were identified by colony characteristics, gram staining and relevant biochemical tests. antibiotic susceptibility test was done by the kirby bauer disc diffusion technique. of 50 enterococcus species isolated, e. faecalis was the predominant isolate (48.0%) followed by e. faecium (32.0%) and e. avium (20.0%). eighty-eight percent of e. faecalis showed sensitivity to cephotaxime and 87.0% to vancomycin. multiple drug resistance was observed most commonly in e. faecium. seventeen percent of e. faecium were resistant to vancomycin and 63.0% to ciprofloxacin and 44.0% to ampicillin. on the contrary e. avium rarely showed resistance to the antimicrobials tested including vancomycin. enterococcal infections are common nowadays specially in hospitalized patients. inappropriate use of antibiotics in clinical practice and poultry should be discouraged to prevent the emergence of multidrug resistant species.
a "retrocidal" plasmid in enterococcus faecalis: passage and protection.
enterococcus faecalis mc4 harbors a 130 kb conjugative, pheromone (ccf10)-responding plasmid, pams1, conferring chloramphenicol, streptomycin and tetracycline resistances. a plasmid-borne class iia bacteriocin (mc4-1) determinant and cognate immunity gene were present, but not expressed in mc4. however, pams1 transfer to e. faecalis jh2-2 (but not to the non-isogenic og1ss) generated the surprising ability to express bacteriocin activity against the plasmid donor, mc4. the bacteriocin target spectrum includes e. faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, and listeria monocytogenes. those donors unable to express bacteriocin or immunity could protect themselves from the "retrocidal" behavior of transconjugants by a switch to bacteriocin resistance at a frequency of approximately 10(-3). reversion to sensitivity occurred at a relatively high frequency, suggestive of involvement of a phase variation event. these observations concerning a conjugative plasmid with novel "retrocidal" properties, coupled with a defense mechanism independent of plasmid-borne immunity functions, may relate to phenomena exploiting regulatory features with broader ecological and evolutionary implications.
screening of the enterocin genes and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria in enterococcus strains obtained from different origins.
antimicrobial activities of 139 enterococcus isolates (48 e. faecium and 91 e. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, and escherichia coli. bacteriocin (bac) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least one of 6 indicator strains (bac+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 e. faecium and 22 e. faecalis). twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (enta, entb, entl50ab, and cyll) showed a bac+ phenotype. the existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied because the bac+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. the antimicrobial activity against gram-negative strains (salmonella enteritidis and e. coli) was detected in the 6 enterococcus isolates that had either the enta, entb, entl50ab or cyll genes. moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against l. monocytogenes among the cyll-positive e. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). the results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.
antimicrobial activity of mupirocin, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and tigecycline against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) from clinical isolates in korea (1998 and 2005).
it is a hot clinical issue whether newly approved antimicrobial agents such as daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid) and tigecycline are active enough to be used for infections caused by vancomycin resistant bacteria. we performed susceptibility tests for mupirocin, which is in widespread clinical use in korea, and four new antimicrobials, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and tigecycline, against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolated from korean patients in 1998 and 2005 to evaluate and compare the in vitro activity of these antimicrobials. among these agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin, which is rarely used in hospitals in korea, showed relatively high resistance to several vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) isolated in 2005. likewise, daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline have not yet been in clinical use in korea. however, our results showed that most of the 2005 vre isolates were already resistant to linezolid and daptomycin (highest minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value >100 microg/ml). compared with the other four antimicrobial agents tested in this study, tigecycline generally showed the greatest activity against vre. however, four strains of 2005 isolates exhibited resistance against tigecycline (mic >12.5 microg/ml). almost all vre were resistant to mupirocin, whereas all e. faecium isolated in 1998 were inhibited at concentrations between 0.8 to approximately 1.6 microg/ml. in conclusion, resistances to these new antimicrobial agents were exhibited in most of vre strains even though these new antibiotics have been rarely used in korean hospitals.
detection of bacteriocin production and virulence traits in vancomycin-resistant  enterococci of different sources.
aim: three hundred and two enterococci were isolated from food, animal and clinical samples in order to evaluate the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and bacteriocin, cytolysin, haemolysin, gelatinase production. methods and results: among the isolates, 27 (8.9%) were vre, and 17 (63%) of these showed, by the deferred antagonism method, bacteriocin production against gram-positive and some gram-negative indicators. eight bacteriocin producers displayed by polymerase chain reaction an enterocin structural gene: six enterococcus faecium the enterocin a, two enterococcus faecalis the enterocin p genes. the enterocins as-48, 31, l50 and 1071a/b genes were not found. regarding the virulence factors, two vre produced gelatinase and seven were haemolytic. gelatinase gele gene was found in 19 strains and cytolysin cyll(l) gene in eight. among the strains showing the cyll(l) gene, only two e. faecalis expressed a beta-haemolysis. conclusions: our results showed the persistence of vre in food, animal and clinical samples. many of these strains displayed antibacterial activity and sometimes different components of virulence, which could emphasize their pathogenicity. significance and impact of the study: this work indicates the need of a constant monitoring of enterococci in order to assess their possible pathogenic properties. the strains of interest in the food industry or used as probiotics should be tested for antibiotic resistance and virulence traits.
inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
outcomes for and risk factors associated with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium bacteremia in cancer patients.
objective: vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are a major cause of nosocomial infection. we sought to compare vancomycin-resistant (vr) enterococcus faecalis bacteremia and vr enterococcus faecium bacteremia in cancer patients with respect to risk factors, clinical presentation, microbiological characteristics, antimicrobial therapy, and outcomes. methods: we identified 210 cancer patients with vre bacteremia who had been treated between january 1996 and december 2004; 16 of these 210 had vr e. faecalis bacteremia and were matched with 32 patients with vr e. faecium bacteremia and 32 control patients. a retrospective review of medical records was conducted. results: logistic regression analysis showed that, compared with vr e. faecalis bacteremia, vr e. faecium bacteremia was associated with a worse clinical response to therapy (odds ratio [or], 0.3 [95% confidence interval (ci), 0.07-0.98]; p=.046) and a higher overall mortality rate (or, 8.3 [95% ci, 1.9-35.3]; p=.004), but the vre-related mortality rate did not show a statistically significant difference (or, 6.8 [95% ci, 0.7-61.8]; p=.09). compared with control patients, patients with vr e. faecalis bacteremia were more likely to have received an aminoglycoside in the 30 days before the onset of bacteremia (or, 5.8 [95% ci, 1.2-27.6]; p=.03), whereas patients with vr e. faecium bacteremia were more likely to have received a carbapenem in the 30 days before the onset of bacteremia (or, 11.7 [95% ci, 3.6-38.6]; p<.001). in a multivariate model that compared patients with vr e. faecium bacteremia and control patients, predictors of mortality included acute renal failure on presentation (or, 15.1 [95% ci, 2.3-99.2]; p=.004) and vr e. faecium bacteremia (or, 11 [95% ci, 2.7-45.1]; p<.001). no difference in outcomes was found between patients with vr e. faecalis bacteremia and control patients. conclusions: vr e. faecium bacteremia in cancer patients was associated with a poorer outcome than was vr e. faecalis bacteremia. recent receipt of carbapenem therapy was an independent risk factor for vr e. faecium bacteremia, and recent receipt of aminoglycoside therapy was independent risk factor for e. faecalis bacteremia.
a novel bacteriocin-like substance produced by enterococcus faecium 3587.
secretion of a novel bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance from enterococcus faecium 3587 is described herein for the first time. whereas some bacteriocins receive their denomination based on the species or genus name of the producer microorganism, the newly discovered bacteriocin-like substance was named "enterocin 3587." the growth characteristics of the producer strain, as well as the type of production and the primary characteristic of the peptide, were investigated. it was found by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that the molecule possesses a molecular weight <6.5 kda; its secretion is growth-phase dependent; and it shows activities only against other closely related enterococci but not against other gram-positive bacteria, such as l. innocua, s. aureus 209, and lactobacillus delbrueckii b2, nor against some gram-negative species, such as escherichia coli hb101.
antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus species isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
three hundred and ten enterococcal isolates (178 enterococcus faecium, 68 e. durans, 49 e. faecalis, 8 e. italicus, 3 e. gallinarum, 3 e. casseliflavus, and 1 e. hirae) from slovak bryndza cheese were evaluated for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents (vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, rifampicin, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin). all enterococcal isolates from bryndza cheese were susceptible to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin as determined by the disk diffusion method. vancomycin resistance genes vana and vanb were not detected. resistance rates of enterococcal isolates to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin were 24, 26, 2, and 1 %, respectively. thirty-six % of e. faecium isolates and 22 % of the e. faecalis isolates were resistant to erythromycin. resistance to rifampicin was similar in e. faecium (31 %) and e. faecalis (29 %). both e. faecium and e. faecalis strains showed the same resistance to ciprofloxacin (2 %). e. durans isolates showed low levels of resistance to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin (1-4 %). forty-eight (30 %) of the e. faecium isolates, two (3 %) of the e. durans isolates, and six (12 %) of the e. faecalis isolates exhibited multidrug resistance. the highest frequency of resistant enterococci was observed in bryndza produced in winter season.
antimicrobial and safety aspects, and biotechnological potential of bacteriocinogenic enterococci isolated from mallard ducks (anas platyrhynchos).
samples from the intestinal content and carcasses of mallard ducks (anas platyrhynchos) were evaluated for enterococci with antimicrobial activity, presence of genes coding bacteriocins and their expression, and potential virulence factors. enterococcus faecalis comprised the largest enterococcal species with antagonistic activity followed by e. faecium, e. hirae, enterococcus spp., and the non-enterococci. although all e. faecalis isolates manifested a potent direct antimicrobial activity, no activity was detected in supernatants of most producer cultures. however, all e. faecium isolates showed antimicrobial activity in their supernatants and encoded bacteriocins, although the occurrence in the isolates of several enterocin genes did not always correlate with a higher antagonistic activity in supernatants. the efaafm determinant was the only virulence gene detected in e. faecium, while e. faecalis showed a larger number of virulence determinants, and e. hirae did not carry any of the virulence genes examined. the rapid identification of genes coding described bacteriocins permits recognition of isolates that are potentially producers of novel bacteriocins. purification of the antimicrobial activity of e. hirae dch5 and lactococcus garvieae dcc43 revealed unique chromatographic fragments after maldi-tof mass spectrometry analysis, suggesting the antagonistic peptides were purified to homogeneity. bacteriocinogenic e. faecium and e. hirae isolates may be considered hygienic for production of bacteriocins, and potentially safe due to their low incidence of potential virulence genes and susceptibility to most clinically relevant antibiotics. however, the presence among the enterococci of e. faecalis strains with a potent antagonistic activity and multiple virulence factors, raises concerns regarding their potential pathogenicity to consumers.
effect of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb10415 on cell numbers of total  enterococcus spp., e. faecium and e. faecalis in the intestine of piglets.
sows and their piglets were fed a diet supplemented with or without the probiotic e. faecium ncimb10415 (also known as sf68). piglets were sacrificed 14, 28, 35 and 56 days after birth and dna from intestinal segments was extracted and purified. a real time pcr assay was used to distinguish enterococcus spp. (16s rdna based), e. faecium (efaafm gene), e. faecalis (efaafs gene) as well as the probiotic strain (unique plasmid sequence). extracts of autoclaved sow feces inoculated with e. faecium and e. faecalis cultures were used to calibrate real time pcr results. the probiotic strain was detected in 14 day old suckling piglets before the piglets had access to the starter diet. in piglets of the probiotic group, probiotic e. faecium cell counts were always a significant proportion of total e. faecium cells in stomach digesta (4-20%), however only a small fraction of the total enterococcus spp. cell number on day 14 and 28 in all intestinal segments (0.1-0.7%). compared to control samples, the probiotic e. faecium strain significantly (p < or = 0.05) decreased the amount of total enterococcus spp. and e. faecalis cells in the colon of 14 day old suckling piglets as well as in jejunum and colon samples one week after weaning. e. faecium cell counts were not modified on any sampling day or intestinal segment. this study showed that the presence of probiotic e. faecium ncimb10415 coincided with reduced total e. faecalis, but not total e. faecium cell numbers in the intestine of piglets. in view of unchanged cell numbers and ratios in sow feces, modifications must have taken place within the intestine of suckling piglets.
evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.
occurrence of the van genes in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium from clinical isolates in korea.
enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolated from korea patients in 1998 and 2005 were tested for susceptibility to nine different antimicrobial agents, including vancomycin and teicoplanin. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used for the detection of several vancomycin resistance genes such as vana ('high level'), vanb ('moderate high level'), vanc1 and vanc2 ('low level'). both e. faecalis and e. faecium exhibited a resistance of 80% and more than 60% to synercid and mupirocin, respectively. moreover, an average of 76% of all isolates was resistant to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, lincomycin, cefotaxime, and meropenem, confirming the multiple drug resistance of most of the isolates. no resistance to vancomycin or teicoplanin was observed in the 1998 e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates. however, the 2005 e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates exhibited resistance of 16% and 12% to vancomycin and teicoplanin, respectively. in addition, vana gene was detected in 4 strains of 2005 e. faecium isolates, thus showing a high resistance to vancomycin. no other vancomycin resistance genes, including vanb, vanc1, and vanc2, were found in our isolates. in this study, we compared the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and the presence of specific resistance genes in e. faecalis and e. faecium. the results showed that the 2005 isolates were usually more resistant than the 1998 isolates.
genetic analysis of bacteriocin 43 of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium.
a total of 636 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) isolates obtained  between 1994 and 1999 from the medical school hospital of the university of michigan were tested for bacteriocin production. of the 277 (44%) bacteriocinogenic strains, 21 were active against e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. hirae, e. durans, and listeria monocytogenes. of those 21 strains, a representative bacteriocin of strain vre82, designated bacteriocin 43, was found to be encoded on mobilizable plasmid pdt1 (6.2 kbp). nine open reading frames (orfs), orf1 to orf9, were presented on pdt1 and were oriented in the same direction. the bacteriocin 43 locus (bac43) consists of the bacteriocin gene baca (orf1) and the immunity gene bacb (orf2). the deduced baca product is 74 amino acids in length with a putative signal peptide of 30 amino acids at the n terminus. the bacb gene encodes a deduced 95-amino-acid protein without a signal sequence. the predicted mature baca protein (44 amino acids) showed sequence homology with the membrane-active class iia bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and showed 86% homology with bacteriocin 31 from e. faecalis yi717 and 98% homology with bacteriocin rc714. southern analysis with a bac43 probe of each plasmid dna from the 21 strains showed hybridization to a specific fragment corresponding to the 6.2-kbp ecori fragment, suggesting that the strains harbored the pdt1-like plasmid (6.2 kb) which encoded the bacteriocin 43-type bacteriocin. the bac43 determinant was not identified among non-vre clinical isolates.
resistance of enterococcus strains isolated from pigs to gastrointestinal tract and antagonistic effect against escherichia coli k88.
the intestinal flora plays an important role in health and wellbeing of different organisms. indigenous microflora can be innocuous or pathogenic. consumption of food supplemented with beneficial microorganisms as probiotics provides a good health state and this can be maintained and recovered. currently, probiotic strains of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus are widely used in humans as well as animals. swine industry would benefit with the application of probiotics, mainly to overcome diarrheal diseases produced by different causes, as a pathogenic e. coli k88. the aim of this work was to isolate strains of enterococcus from gastrointestinal tract of pigs to use them as probiotic. two strains of e. faecalis, 2 of e. mundii and 7 of e. faecium were isolated with characteristics of resistance to acid ph, tolerance to biliary salts and a high antagonistic activity (>80%) against e. coli k88. based on their characteristics and species affinity, we believe that these strains could be administered to pigs as a probiotic.
complete sequence of the enterocin q-encoding plasmid pciz2 from the multiple bacteriocin producer enterococcus faecium l50 and genetic characterization of enterocin q production and immunity.
the locations of the genetic determinants for enterocin l50 (entl50a and entl50b), enterocin q (entq), and enterocin p (entp) in the multiple bacteriocin producer enterococcus faecium strain l50 were determined. these bacteriocin genes occur at different locations; entl50ab (encoding entl50a and entl50b) are on the 50-kb plasmid pciz1, entqa (encoding entq) is on the 7.4-kb plasmid pciz2, and entp (encoding entp) is on the chromosome. the complete nucleotide sequence of pciz2 was determined to be 7,383 bp long and contains 10 putative open reading frames (orfs) organized in three distinct regions. the first region contains three orfs: entqa preceded by two divergently oriented genes, entqb and entqc. entqb shows high levels of similarity to bacterial atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters, while entqc displays no significant similarity to any known protein. the second region encompasses four orfs (orf4 to orf7), and orf4 and orf5 display high levels of similarity to mobilization proteins from e. faecium and enterococcus faecalis. in addition, features resembling a transfer origin region (orit) were found in the promoter area of orf4. the third region contains three orfs (orf8 to orf10), and orf8 and orf9 exhibit similarity to the replication initiator protein repe from e. faecalis and to repb proteins, respectively. to clarify the minimum requirement for entq synthesis, we subcloned and heterologously expressed a 2,371-bp fragment from pciz2 that encompasses only the entqa, entqb, and entqc genes in lactobacillus sakei, and we demonstrated that this fragment is sufficient for entq production. moreover, we also obtained experimental results indicating that entqb is involved in abc transporter-mediated entq secretion, while entqc confers immunity to this bacteriocin.
bacteriocin t8, a novel class iia sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium t8, isolated from vaginal secretions of children infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
enterococcus faecium t8, isolated from vaginal secretions of children with human  immunodeficiency virus, produces a class iia sec-dependent bacteriocin that is structurally different from three other class iia sec-dependent bacteriocins, i.e., enterocin p and an enterocin p-like bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus faecium, and bacteriocin 31, produced by enterococcus faecalis, and from a class iii bacteriocin produced by e. faecalis. the genes encoding the bacteriocin, immunity protein, mobilization protein, and relaxase nuclease are located on a 7-kb plasmid. bacteriocin t8 has a molecular mass of 5.1 kda based on its dna sequence, similar to the 5.0 kda recorded for bacteriocin 31 but larger than the 4.6 kda reported for enterocin p. at the amino acid level, bacteriocin t8 is 69% homologous to bacteriocin 31 and 47% homologous to enterocin p. bacteriocin t8 is active against e. faecalis isolated from patients diagnosed with vaginosis, against lactobacillus sakei, and against a propionibacterium sp. the peptide is heat stable (60 min at 100 degrees c) and remains active in phosphate buffer from ph 4.0 to 10.0. the mode of activity is bactericidal, as determined with e. faecalis.
detection of genes encoding virulence factors and bacteriocins in fecal enterococci of poultry in portugal.
seventy-six enterococcus isolates (43 e. faecalis, 30 e. faecium, two e. durans,  and one e. hirae) recovered from fecal samples of poultry in a slaughterhouse (one isolate per fecal sample and one fecal sample per lot of animals) were studied for bacteriocin production and for the presence of genes encoding bacteriocins and virulence factors. the presence of genes encoding virulence factors (cpd, gee, fsr, ace, agg, and esp) and bacteriocins (enta, entb, entp, entq, entas-48, entl50a/b, cyl, and bac31) were studied by polymerase chain reaction in all enterococci. at least two virulence genes were detected in all 43 e. faecalis isolates, cpd and gele being the most frequently detected genes (97.7%) followed by ace (62.8%), agg (39.5%), fsr (27.9%), and esp (2.3%). no virulence genes were detected in the other enterococcal species with the exception of one e. faecium and one e. durans isolates that harbored the gele gene. antimicrobial activity against eight indicator bacteria (including listeria monocytogenes) was assayed in the enterococci, and 23 (30.3%) showed inhibitory activity against l. monocytogenes, the other 22 enterococci showing activity against indicator bacteria other than l. monocytogenes. only the enta, entb, and cyl genes were detected in our study (enta + entb in nine e. faecium isolates and the cyl gene in seven e. faecalis isolates). a wide variety of virulence genes have been detected in fecal e. faecalis isolates from poultry, but not in the other enterococcal species. however, the presence of known bacteriocin structural genes is associated more with the e. faecium species.
bacteriocin production, plasmid content and plasmid location of enterocin p structural gene in enterococci isolated from food sources.
aims: to characterize bacteriocin production, antimicrobial spectrum and plasmid  content in bacteriocinogenic enterococci from foods. methods and results: bacteriocinogenic enterococcus faecium (14 isolates) and enterococcus faecalis (three isolates) showed two different patterns of bacteriocin production in liquid broth: exponential-phase and stationary-phase production. bacteriocin concentrates from all enterococci were inactivated by trypsin, but seldom by heat (100-117 degrees c), extremes of ph (2.0 to 9.0) or reducing agents (such as dithiothreitol). all bacteriocin concentrates were active against listeria innocua and listeria monocytogenes, and most were also active against many ent. faecalis and ent. faecium isolates. enterococci clustered in three main groups according to their plasmid content (which included plasmids from 2.0 to 53 kb). several isolates from different foods showed almost identical plasmid profiles. the enterocin p structural gene (entp) was detected by hybridization on plasmids of c. 19, 26 and/or 35-38 kb. conclusions: enterococci from food show different patterns of bacteriocin production and different plasmid content in spite of carrying similar bacteriocin-encoding genes. significance and impact of the study: this study provides information on the diversity of bacteriocinogenic enterococci from food sources carrying apparently similar enterocin genes.
antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, lbm415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
objectives: to evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of lbm415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (pdfi) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (ussti), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. methods: a total of 21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons); resistance to penicillin (mic > or = 2 mg/l) among 18.0% of streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of haemophilus influenzae. results: lbm415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus faecium and moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/l; 97.0% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of h. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. seventy-seven percent of burkholderia cepacia and 82.0% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/l. no differences in lbm415 activity against s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae, enterococcus spp. and h. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. while regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to lbm415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. one isolate of s. aureus displayed high-level resistance to lbm415 owing to multiple sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defb and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. this isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. conclusions: with few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first pdfi class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. these compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. given the detection of a pre-existing pdfi-resistant isolate of s. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the pdfi-targeted pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will be an important component of future studies.
genes encoding bacteriocins and their expression and potential virulence factors  of enterococci isolated from wood pigeons (columba palumbus).
samples of the intestinal content and carcasses of wood pigeons (columba palumbus) were evaluated for enterococci with antimicrobial activity. enterococcus faecium comprised the largest enterococcal species with antagonistic activity, followed by enterococcusfaecalis and enterococcus columbae. pcr amplification of genes coding bacteriocins and determination of their nucleotide sequence, and the use of specific antipeptide bacteriocin antibodies and a noncompetitive indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, permitted characterization of enterococci coding that described bacteriocins and their expression. the efaafm determinant was the only virulence gene detected in e. faecium, whereas e. faecalis showed a larger number of virulence determinants, and e. columbae did not carry any of the virulence genes examined. although all e. faecalis isolates manifested a potent direct antimicrobial activity, no activity was detected in supernatants of producer cells. purification of the antagonistic activity of e. columbae plch2 showed multiple chromatographic fragments after matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis, suggesting the active peptide(s) had not yet purified to homogeneity. bacteriocinogenic e. faecium and e. columbae isolates may be considered hygienic for production of enterocins and potentially safe due to their low incidence of potential virulence genes and susceptibility of most relevant clinical antibiotics. however, the presence among the enterococci of e. faecalis strains with a potent antagonistic activity and multiple virulence factors is an issue that must be considered further.
activity of a new oral streptogramin, xrp2868, against gram-positive cocci harboring various mechanisms of resistance to streptogramins.
the antibacterial activity of xrp2868, a new oral streptogramin composed of a combination of rpr132552 (streptogramin a) and rpr202868 (streptogramin b), was evaluated against a collection of clinical gram-positive isolates with characterized phenotypes and genotypes of streptogramin resistance. the effects of genes for resistance to streptogramin a or b on the activity of xrp2868 and its components were also tested by cloning these genes individually or in various combinations in gram-positive recipient strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. the species tested included staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and other species of streptococci. xrp2868 was generally fourfold more potent than quinupristin-dalfopristin against s. aureus, e. faecium, and streptococci and had activity against e. faecalis (mics = 0.25 to 1 microg/ml). xrp2868 appeared to be affected by the same mechanisms of resistance as those to quinupristin-dalfopristin. nevertheless, the strong activity of factor a of the oral streptogramin enabled the combination to be very potent against streptogramin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and e. faecium (mics = 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml) and to retain low mics against the strains harboring a mechanism of resistance to factor a or factor b of the streptogramin. however, the combination of mechanisms of resistance to factors a and b caused an increase in the mics of xrp2868, which reached 1 to 4 mug/ml. as with the other streptogramins, there was a reduction in the bactericidal effect of xrpr2868 when the staphylococcal strains acquired a constitutively expressed erm gene.
acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of diverse cat populations.
the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the resident intestinal microbiota of cats and to identify significant differences between various cat populations. escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and streptococcus canis were isolated as faecal indicator bacteria from rectal swabs of 47 individually owned cats, 47 cattery cats and 18 hospitalised cats, and submitted through antimicrobial sensitivity tests. the results revealed that bacteria isolated from hospitalised and/or cattery cats were more frequently resistant than those from individually owned cats. e. coli isolates from hospitalised cats were particularly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulfonamide. both enterococci and streptococci showed high resistance to tetracycline and in somewhat lesser extent to erythromycin and tylosin. most e. faecium isolates were resistant to lincomycin and penicillin. one e. faecalis as well as one e. faecium isolate from hospitalised cats showed 'high-level resistance' (mic > 500 microg/ml) against gentamicin, a commonly used antimicrobial agent in case of human enterococcal infections. the results of this research demonstrate that the extent of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of cats depends on the social environment of the investigated population. it is obvious that the flora of healthy cats may act as a reservoir of resistance genes.
effect of growth promotant usage on enterococci species on a poultry farm.
the species population of enterococci isolated from four poultry houses for six grow-outs on one farm was determined. two houses on the farm were control houses and did not use any antimicrobials, while two other houses on the farm used flavomycin, virginiamycin, and bacitracin during different poultry grow-outs. litter, chick boxliners, feed, and poultry carcass rinses were obtained from each house and cultured for the presence of enterococci. nine species of enterococci (enterococcusfaecalis, e. faecium, e. avium, e. casselifiavus, e. cecorum, e. durans, e. gallinarum, e. hirae, and e. malodoratus) were identified from the study. enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently from chick boxliners (n=176; 92%) and carcass rinses (n=491; 69%), whereas e. faecium was found more frequently in litter (n=361; 77%) and feed (n=67; 64%). enterococcus faecalis (n=763; 52%) and e. faecium (n=578; 39%) were isolated most often from the farm and houses, regardless of antimicrobial treatment. fifty-two percent of e. faecalis and 39% of e. faecium were isolated from both control (n=389 and 295, respectively) and treatment (n=374 and 283, respectively) samples. this study indicates that antimicrobial usage on this farm did not alter the resident population of enterococci.
cloning, production and functional expression of enterocin p, a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13, in escherichia coli.
the cloning and expression of enterocin p (entp), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium p13, was studied in escherichia coli. pcr-amplified products of the preenterocin p gene (entp) or entp plus the putative entp immunity gene (entip), were cloned in plasmid petblue-1 under the control of the inducible t7lac promoter. although target genes in derivative plasmids pjg01 (entp) and pjg02 (entp plus entip) did not generate products with antimicrobial activity after an in vitro combined transcription/translation reaction, they were expressed as biologically active products following transformation and induction in the e. coli tuner(de3)placi host. the use of specific antibodies and an elisa permitted the detection and quantification of entp in the supernatant (sn), cellular soluble protein fraction (csf), and inclusion bodies (ib) of e. coli tuner(de3)placi cells transformed with either pjg01 or pjg02. functional entp from the supernatants of e. coli tuner(de3)placi (pjg01) cultures grown in a complex medium was recovered, at a high efficiency, by immunoaffinity chromatography in a single step. a purification method based on hydrophobic adsorption and reverse-phase chromatographies also permitted the recovery of active entp from the supernatants of the same cultures grown in a minimally defined medium. the e. coli tuner(de3)placi (pjg01) cells would merit consideration as an alternative experimental model for the heterologous production and functional expression of entp, as well as for the fast and efficient recovery of this bacteriocin from the supernatant of this recombinant producer.
enterocin as-48rj: a variant of enterocin as-48 chromosomally encoded by enterococcus faecium rj16 isolated from food.
the bacteriocinogenic strain rj16 isolated from goat cheese has been identified as enterococcusfaecium by species-specific pcr, dna-rrna hybridization and rdna sequencing. purified bacteriocin from strain rj16 is a carboxypeptidase a-resistant peptide with a molecular mass (7125 da) very close to the cyclic peptide enterocin as-48. bacteriocin from strain rj16 and as-48 show identical antibacterial spectra, although the former is slightly less active on strains of listeria monocytogenes and bacillus cereus. producer strains show cross-immunity. pcr amplification of total dna from strain rj16 with primers for the as-48 structural gene and sequencing of the amplified fragment revealed an almost identical sequence (99.5%), except for a single mutation that predicts the change of glu residue at position 20 of as-48 to val. therefore, bacteriocin produced by e. faecium rj16 should be considered a variant of as-48, which we call as-48rj. pcr amplification revealed that strain rj16 contains the complete as-48. gene cluster. hybridization with probes for as-48 gene cluster revealed a chromosomal location of as-48 genes in strain rj16, being the first example of a chromosomal location of this bacteriocin trait. strain rj16 produced enzymes of interest in food processing (esterase, esterase lipase and phytase activities), and did not decarboxylate amino acids precursors for biogenic amines. strain rj16 did not exhibit haemolytic or gelatinase activities, and pcr amplification revealed the lack of genes encoding for known virulence determinants (aggregation substance, collagen adhesin, enterococcal surface protein, endocarditis antigens, as well as haemolysin and gelatinase production). strain rj16 was resistant to ciprofloxacin (mic > 2 mgl(-1)) and levofloxacin (mic > 4 mgl(-1)) and showed intermediate resistance to nitrofurantoin and erythromycin, but was sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin and teicoplanin. altogether, results from this study suggest that this broad-spectrum bacteriocin-producing strain may have a potential use in food preservation.
the susceptibility to growth-promoting antibiotics of enterococcus faecium isolates from pigs and chickens in europe.
objectives: to establish the susceptibility of enterococcus faecium isolates from pigs and chickens to antimicrobial growth promoters that either were or had been in use in the european union. methods: samples were taken at abattoirs in two successive years (mid-1998-mid-1999, year 1; mid-1999-mid-2000, year 2) from chickens (france, the netherlands, sweden, uk) and pigs (denmark, the netherlands, spain, sweden). e. faecium was isolated from faecal samples at national laboratories and sent to a central laboratory where mics of avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavophospholipol, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin were determined. microbiological breakpoints were allocated on the basis of mic distributions, and comparison was made between host species, country of origin and year of sample. results: in total, 2567 isolates were obtained from chickens and 1742 from pigs. in all countries, resistance to avoparcin (banned in 1997) was uncommon, but resistance to bacitracin and flavophospholipol was common (and was probably largely intrinsic). the prevalence of resistance was similar in chicken and pig isolates, with the exception of avilamycin, to which resistance was commoner among chicken isolates. the removal of four compounds as growth promoters (bacitracin, spiramycin, tylosin, virginiamycin) between years 1 and 2 appeared to result in a significant decrease in resistance to three of them-spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin, with no change in resistance to bacitracin, but an increase in resistance to avilamycin (not discontinued). associated resistance was shown between some of the compounds. conclusions: resistance prevalence declined rapidly following removal of growth promoters in pigs and chickens, suggesting that in the absence of selective pressure, a susceptible population began to replace phenotypically resistant strains. associated resistance between different compounds, where seen, could have resulted from either shared resistance mechanisms or from carriage of resistance genes on the same plasmid. multiresistance to streptogramins, macrolides and glycopeptides was rare.
control of listeria monocytogenes in model sausages by enterocin as-48.
in this work we describe the control of listeria monocytogenes cect 4032 in sausage by adding the enterocin as-48 producer strains enterococcus faecalis a-48-32 and enterococcus faecium s-32-81, and also by adding a semi-purified preparation of the bacteriocin. addition of preformed as-48 caused a significant decrease (p<0.01) in the number of viable listeria even at the lowest bacteriocin concentration tested (112 au/g). at a higher concentration (225 au/g) listeria were below the detection level (1.99 log units/g) in meat at 3 days of incubation but growth of listeria was observed again after 9 days. for an as-48 concentration of 450 au/g, no viable listeria were detected after 6 and 9 days of incubation. when e. faecalis a-48-32 was used as inoculum at approximately 10(7) cfu/g, listeria counts decreased progressively from start of experiment, being below detection level at day 9. the best results were obtained with e. faecium s-32-81, since listeria were undetectable at 6 days of incubation. bacteriocin concentrations in samples reached concentrations of 60 and 80 au/g for strains a-48-32 and s-32-81, respectively. these results clearly indicate that as-48 can be used in the control of l. monocytogenes in sausages.
nosocomial infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci at a university hospital in taiwan from 1991 to 2003: resistance trends, antibiotic usage and in vitro activities of newer antimicrobial agents.
a rapid increase of nosocomial methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infection (from 39% in 1991 to 75% in 2003) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) (from 1.2% in 1996 to 6.1% in 2003) at a university hospital in taiwan was found. the noticeable rise of mrsa and vre was significantly correlated with the increased consumption of glycopeptides, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones (pearson's correlation coefficient, p < 0.05). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 100 non-duplicate blood isolates of mrsa (in 2003) and of 25 non-duplicate isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and 172 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (in 1996-2003) causing nosocomial infection recovered from various clinical specimens of patients treated at the hospital to nine antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. all of these isolates were susceptible to linezolid and were inhibited by 0.5mg/l of tigecycline, and all mrsa isolates were inhibited by daptomycin 1mg/l, including two isolates of mrsa with heteroresistance to vancomycin. daptomycin had two-fold better activity against vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis (mic90, 2 mg/l) than against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (mic90, 4 mg/l). decreased susceptibilities of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and mrsa to quinupristin/dalfopristin (non-susceptibility 25% and 8%, respectively) were found. telithromycin had poor activity against the isolates tested (mic90, 8 mg/l). linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline may represent therapeutic options for infections caused by these resistant gram-positive organisms.
bacterial 2-component signal transduction systems: a fluorescence polarization screen for response regulator-protein binding.
two-component signal transduction systems are the primary means by which bacteria sense environmental change and integrate an adaptive response. in pathogenic bacteria, 2-component signal transduction (tcst) kinases are involved in the expression of virulence and antibiotic resistance. this makes bacterial tcst systems attractive targets for pharmacologic intervention. this paper describes a fluorescence polarization assay that quantifies the binding between bacterial dna promoter segments and their cognate response regulator proteins. using the van rstcst system from enterococcus faecium, which encodes vancomycin resistance, the authors demonstrate inhibition of response regulator protein/promoter segment binding with a known inhibitor. observed binding constants were comparable to those reported in surface plasmon resonance measurements and gel shift measurements.
in vitro activity of phenothiazine derivatives in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium.
the antimicrobial activity of the phenothiazine derivatives thioridazine and prochlorperazine have been evaluated with 11 enterococcus faecalis strains and 9 enterococcus faecium strains, originating from human infections and animal faecal flora. we found that all e. faecalis and e. faecium strains, regardless of their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics, were inhibited by thioridazine at a concentration of 16-32 microg/ml and by prochlorperazine at a concentration of 32-64 microg/ml. combinations of the antibiotics vancomycin or ampicillin and thioridazine and prochlorperazine at subinhibitory concentrations, could render vancomycin- or ampicillin-resistant bacteria sensitive to each of the antibiotics. verapamil and reserpine, inhibitors of p-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance, did not reduce resistance. our results outline modification of resistance in enterococci induced by phenothiazine derivatives unrelated to p-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance.
epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci of animal origin.
objective: we evaluated the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in enterococci from animal farms and the potential relation of resistance to antimicrobial use. methods: enterococci from faecal samples from 18 beef cattle, 18 dairy cattle, 18 swine, 13 chicken, and eight turkey farms were prospectively evaluated over a 6 year period from 1998 to 2003. results: we evaluated 1256 isolates of enterococcus faecium and 656 isolates of enterococcus faecalis. none was vancomycin resistant. quinupristin/dalfopristin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin resistance rates in e. faecium were 2%, 0% and 55% in beef cattle, 8%, 7% and 47% in dairy cattle, 21%, 1% and 47% in swine, 85%, 12% and 23% in chicken, and 52%, 13% and 24% in turkey isolates, respectively. for e. faecalis, gentamicin resistance rates were 0% in beef cattle, 24% in dairy cattle, 37% in swine, 32% in chicken, and 29% in turkey isolates, whereas 12%, 9%, 21%, 64% and none of isolates from beef, dairy, swine, chicken, and turkey farms, respectively, were resistant to ciprofloxacin. quinupristin/dalfopristin resistance in e. faecium was more common on chicken and turkey farms using virginiamycin (p<0.0001 for both) compared with farms not using a streptogramin, gentamicin resistance was more common on dairy farms using gentamicin (p<0.0001) compared with farms not using this antibiotic, and ciprofloxacin resistance was more common on turkey and dairy farms using enrofloxacin compared with those with no enrofloxacin use (p=0.02 and p=0.04, respectively). for e. faecalis, gentamicin resistance was more frequently detected on dairy and swine farms using gentamicin (p<0.0001 and p=0.0052, respectively) and ciprofloxacin resistance was more common on beef farms using enrofloxacin (p<0.0001) compared with farms not using these antimicrobials. pfge showed multiple strain types with some clones common between animals of the same animal species. conclusions: this study shows the presence of a significant reservoir of antibiotic-resistant enterococci among farm animals. resistance was more common on farms using antimicrobial agents.
potent antibacterial activity of halogenated compounds against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
common gram-positive clinical pathogens are showing an increasing trend for resistance to conventional antimicrobial agents. new drugs with potent antibacterial activities are urgently needed to remediate this problem. halogenated compounds isolated from several species of the red algae genus laurencia were examined for their antibacterial activity against 22 strains of human pathogenic bacteria, 7 strains of which were antibiotic-resistant bacteria. four phenolic sesquiterpenes and a polybrominated indole showed wide spectra of antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium (vre). in addition, laurinterol and allolaurinterol displayed potent bactericidal activity against three strains of mrsa at 3.13 microg ml(-1), and three strains of vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus, at 3.13 microg ml(-1) and 6.25 microg ml(-1), respectively.
molecular epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci recovered  from brazilian intensive care units.
we studied the antimicrobial resistance and the molecular epidemiology of 99 enterococcal surveillance isolates from two hospitals of brasilia, brazil. conventional biochemical tests were used to identify the enterococcal species and the disk diffusion method was used to determine their resistance profiles. enterococcus faecalis (76%) and e. faecium (9%) were the most prevalent species. no enterococci showed the vana or vanb vancomycin resistance phenotypes or genotypes. only the intrinsically resistant species e. gallinarum (n=2) and e. casseliflavus (n=3) harbored the vancomycin-resistance genes vanc1 and vanc2/3, respectively. we found e. faecalis isolates with high-level resistance to gentamicin (22%) and streptomycin (8%) and both e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates with resistance to more than two antimicrobials (84% and 67%, respectively). nine e. faecalis isolates (12%) were resistant to ampicillin; the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values were 16 microg/ml (n=6) and 32 microg/ml (n=3). among these ampicillin-resistant e. faecalis, seven were also resistant to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, rifampin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and erythromycin. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis classified those isolates in three different genotypes, suggesting dissemination of genetically related ampicillin-resistant e. faecalis strains among different patients.
multiple-antibiotic resistance of enterococcus spp. isolated from commercial poultry production environments.
the potential impact of food animals in the production environment on the bacterial population as a result of antimicrobial drug use for growth enhancement continues to be a cause for concern. enterococci from 82 farms within a poultry production region on the eastern seaboard were isolated to establish a baseline of susceptibility profiles for a number of antimicrobials used in production as well as clinical environments. of the 541 isolates recovered, enterococcus faecalis (53%) and e. faecium (31%) were the predominant species, while multiresistant antimicrobial phenotypes were observed among all species. the prevalence of resistance among isolates of e. faecalis was comparatively higher among lincosamide, macrolide, and tetracycline antimicrobials, while isolates of e. faecium were observed to be more frequently resistant to fluoroquinolones and penicillins. notably, 63% of the e. faecium isolates were resistant to the streptogramin quinupristin-dalfopristin, while high-level gentamicin resistance was observed only among the e. faecalis population, of which 7% of the isolates were resistant. the primary observations are that enterococci can be frequently isolated from the poultry production environment and can be multiresistant to antimicrobials used in human medicine. the high frequency with which resistant enterococci are isolated from this environment suggests that these organisms might be useful as sentinels to monitor the development of resistance resulting from the usage of antimicrobial agents in animal production.
sex pheromone response, clumping, and slime production in enterococcal strains isolated from occluded biliary stents.
bile-resistant bacteria, particularly gram-positive enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, play an important role in biliary stent occlusion, because their sessile mode of growth protects them against host defenses and antimicrobial agents. twelve e. faecalis and seven e. faecium strains isolated from occluded biliary stents have been investigated for slime production, presence of aggregation substance genes, and ability to adhere to caco-2 cells. ten isolates were strong producers of slime, and seven isolates produced clumps when exposed to pheromones of e. faecalis jh2-2 and/or og1rf. the small e. faecium clumps differed from the large clumps of e. faecalis and were similar to those of e. faecium ls10(pbrg1) carrying a pheromone response plasmid. after induction with pheromones, the adhesion to caco-2 cells of clumping-positive strains was found to increase from two- to fourfold. amplicons of the expected size were detected in three clumping-positive and three clumping-negative e. faecalis isolates by using primers (agg) internal to a highly conserved region of the e. faecalis pheromone response plasmids pad1, ppd1, and pcf10 and primers internal to prgb of the e. faecalis plasmid pcf10. the agg/prgb-positive e. faecalis strains were also positive in southern hybridization experiments with a prgb-specific probe. no pcr products were obtained with the same primers from four clumping-positive isolates (one e. faecalis and three e. faecium strains), which were also southern hybridization negative. our results demonstrate that slime production and pheromone response are both present in isolated enterococci, suggesting that clinical strains with these features might have a selective advantage in colonizing biliary stents.
susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in 839 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci from norway.
a total of 839 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci from norway including staphylococcus aureus (n = 214), coagulase negative staphylococcus spp. (n = 100), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 99), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 80), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 127), streptococcus spp. viridans group (n = 70), enterococcus faecalis (n = 75), and enterococcus faecium (n = 74), were tested by e-test for susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid. subgroups of oxacillin resistant s. aureus and coagulase negative staphylococcus spp., penicillin non-susceptible s. pneumoniae and vancomycin resistant enterococcus spp. were specifically included as they are the intended targets for these new drugs. all isolates were susceptible to linezolid (mic5o and mic9o 0.25-2.0 mg/l, mic range 0.12-2 mg/l). staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were also susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin except for some intermediately susceptible viridans group isolates (mic54, and mic90 0.25-2 mg/l, mic range 0.125-2 mg/l). enterococcus faecium (mic90 = 4.0 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (mic50 = 8.0 mg/l, mic90 > or = 32 mg/l) were less susceptible to this substance. there was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. the study demonstrated a high prevalence of in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, which is necessary for their use in the treatment of infections with resistant gram-positive pathogens. the results were used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in norway.
potential utility of a peptide deformylase inhibitor (nvp pdf-713) against oxazolidinone-resistant or streptogramin-resistant gram-positive organism isolates.
objectives: to evaluate the potency of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, nvp pdf-713, against gram-positive organisms having resistances to linezolid or quinupristin/dalfopristin. materials and methods: a total of 45 strains from three genera (six species groups) were tested by reference broth microdilution methods. the mechanism of resistance to the oxazolidinone was determined by sequencing of the gene encoding the ribosomal target. results: nvp pdf-713 retained activity against linezolid-resistant staphylococci (mic range 0.25-2 mg/l), streptococcus oralis (mic 0.5 mg/l), enterococcus faecalis (mic range 2-4 mg/l) and enterococcus faecium (mic range 0.5-4 mg/l). quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant e. faecium (mic range 1-2 mg/l) and staphylococci (mic range 0.12-2 mg/l) were also inhibited by nvp pdf-713. many (10 of 13 strains) of the linezolid-resistant enterococci were resistant to vancomycin and these clinical strains had a g2576u ribosomal target mutation. conclusions: nvp pdf-713 appears to be a promising clinical candidate among the peptide deformylase inhibitors for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive organisms that possess resistances to oxazolidinones or streptogramin combinations.
[the trend and susceptibility to antibacterial agents of enterococcus species from urinary tract infections].
objective: to determine the extent of drug-resistance among enterococcus species  we investigated in vitro experiments. methods: studies were carried out on pure cultured of enterococci isolated from 8,575 urine specimens between 1990 and 2002. we had determined test strains to three kinds of species, which posses the urinary pathogenesis. both an ef-agars and an adh decarboxylase test performed the identification and speciation of the strains of enterococci. in vitro drug-susceptibility tests of enterococci were performed against the following antibiotics: ampicillin (abpc), cefpirome (cpr), cefozopran (czop), imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs), minocycline (mino), levofloxacin (lvfx), vancomycin (vcm), sulfamethoxazone/trimethoprim (st), by employing the method for dilution antimicrobial susceptibility tests for bacteria that grow aerobically recommended by japan society of chemotherapy. these drug-susceptibilities were shown susceptible, intermittent and resistant in according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards (m100-s12). results: the most common species isolated was e. faecalis (84.4%), followed by e. faecium (9.9%) and e. avium (5.6%). in e. faecium and e. avium, the sensitivity to abpc has tended to improve from 1999. this tendency inverse correlated to decreasing dosage of pcs. there was much difference of resistant rate to ipm/cs between each species, and no correlation to used dosage of cbps. the rate of resistance to mino did not change during this period. 60% of e. faecalis had sensitivity to lvfx and the rate did not change during this period. in e. faecium, whose resistant rate to lvfx was 90%, the sensitivity has been improved to over 25% from 2001. the improved tendency of e. faecium to lvfx has inverse proportion to decreasing dosage of nqs. with the exception of a little bit vre (vcm resistant enterococci), almost of them had sensitivity to vcm. conclusion: the emergence of enterococci with alarming rates of resistance concomitantly to multi-drugs highlights the need for a more rational and restricted use of antimicrobials, in order to minimize the selection and spread of such strains. an early detection of these problem pathogens is also important for preventing any treatment failures.
worldwide assessment of dalbavancin activity and spectrum against over 6,000 clinical isolates.
continuing emergence of new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and the increased frequency of existing resistances, requires the development of alternative antimicrobial agents. dalbavancin is an amide glycopeptide derivative with a markedly extended serum elimination half-life. dalbavancin and selected comparators were tested against 6,339 recent clinical isolates (2002) from the americas and europe using reference susceptibility testing methods. the general characteristics of this gram-positive organism collection were: oxacillin (oxa)-resistant staphylococcus aureus (orsa) at 39% of strains; vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) at 10%; and penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci at 28%. the overall distribution of dalbavancin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranged from < or = 0.015 to > 32 microg/ml, but > 99% of mic results were at < or =1 microg/ml. s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were extremely susceptible to dalbavancin (mic90, 0.06 microg/ml) despite resistance patterns to other agents. dalbavancin was the most potent compound (by weight) against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium (mic90, 0.06 and 0.12 microg/ml, respectively); however, vre strains showed decreased dalbavancin susceptibility (mic50, 4 or 8 microg/ml). all streptococcal isolates were inhibited at < or =0.25 microg/ml of dalbavancin. this reported dalbavancin activity indicates that the new glycopeptide has significant activity, superior to available agents in the class, and a potency that was uniform across geographically sampled organisms. some vre were inhibited by very low dalbavancin concentrations (< or = 1 microg/ml; van b phenotypes). further clinical development seems warranted for this once-weekly administered agent.
[post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae, was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.
species distribution and antibiotic resistance patterns of enterococci isolated from food of animal origin in germany.
presently, enterococci take the third place of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections, after staphylococci and escherichia coli. especially, the resistances of enterococci to several available antibiotics are threatening. we attempted to determine which species of enterococci could be found in food of animal origin and their significance according to their antibiotic resistances for human beings. from november 2000 to may 2002 we investigated 155 samples of food of animal origin bought in retail outlets in germany: 27 samples of sausages, 19 of ham, 83 of minced meat, 26 of cheese. from these food samples we isolated 416 enterococcal strains. the most frequent species was enterococcus faecalis (299 strains); furthermore, we found enterococcus faecium (54 strains), enterococcus durans together with enterococcus hirae (24 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (22 strains), enterococcus avium (9 strains) and enterococcus gallinarum (8 strains). we focused on the resistance patterns of 118 selected e. faecium and e. faecalis strains to 13 antimicrobial active agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, avilamycin, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, flavomycin, gentamicin, penicillin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, tetracycline and vancomycin). from the clinical point of view, the situation of antibiotic resistance to the examined antimicrobial agents seemed to be favourable. the investigated strains were sensitive to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. these antibiotics are, in combination with an aminoglycoside, for example gentamicin, agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. only one e. faecium strain was resistant to penicillin, while all strains were sensitive to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin. resistances found against the antibiotics, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin and erythromycin, are causes for concern.
safety aspects of enterococci from the medical point of view.
enterococci occur in a remarkable array of environments. they can be found in soil, food, and water, and make up a significant portion of the normal gut flora of humans (10(5)-10(7)/g of stool) and animals. as other bacteria of the gut flora, enterococci can also cause infectious diseases. most clinical isolates are enterocococus faecalis, which account for 80-90% of clinical strains. enterocococus faecium accounts for 5-10% of such isolates. typical enterococcal infections occur in hospitalised patients with underlying conditions representing a wide spectrum of severity of illness and immune modulation. enterococci today rank second to third in frequency among bacteria isolated from hospitalised patients. they are isolated from urinary tract infections, intra-abdominal and pelvic infections, bacteremias, wound and tissue infections, and endocarditis--often as part of a polymicrobial flora. surprisingly, little is known about the factors that contribute to the ability of enterococci to cause infections. many strains of e. faecalis produce a cytolysin (haemolysin) exhibiting tissue-damaging capacity. further extracellular products often observed in clinical isolates are a proteinase (gelatinase), hyaluronidase, and extracellular superoxide. furthermore, many of the clinical isolates possess the aggregation substance on the surface and an extracellular surface protein, both contributing to the adherence to eucaryotic cells. some strains of e. faecalis, and many e. faecium strains are resistant to multiple antimicrobials. the ultimate role of all these factors in enterococcal pathogenicity remains to be determined. it was previously thought that enterococcal infections were endogenously acquired from the patient's own gut flora. a rather new concept that has emerged is that enterococcal disease is a two-stage process. there is an initial colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract by enterococcal strains possessing virulence traits and/or antibiotic resistance. subsequently, this population spreads, often facilitated by antibiotic elimination of competitors. for a selected number of patients, there is subsequent tissue invasion from the gastrointestinal tract reservoir. from this concept, it can be deduced that enterococcal strains without virulence traits and antibiotic resistances exogenously transferred into the human gut via food products or probiotics will not represent any risk for immunocompetent individuals. in very severely immunocompromised patients, however, a risk for enterococcal disease by such strains cannot completely be excluded.
heterogeneity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b resistance phenotypes in enterococci.
we determined the macrolide resistance phenotypes of 241 clinical isolates of erythromycin-resistant enterococci (mics, > or = 1 microg/ml), including 147 enterococcus faecalis strains and 94 enterococcus faecium strains, collected from a hospital in seoul, korea, between 1999 and 2000. by the erythromycin (40 micro g)-josamycin (100 microg) double-disk test, 93 strains were assigned to the constitutive macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b (mls(b)) resistance (cmls(b)) phenotype, and the remaining 148 strains were assigned to the inducible mls(b) resistance (imls(b)) phenotype. of the strains with the imls(b) phenotype, 36 exhibited a reversibly inducible mls(b) (rimls(b)) phenotype, i.e., blunting of the erythromycin zone of inhibition, which indicates that the 16-membered-ring macrolide josamycin is a more effective inducer than the 14-membered-ring macrolide erythromycin. sequence analysis of the regulatory regions of the erm(b) genes from all of the strains exhibiting the rimls(b) phenotype revealed not only erm(bv) [where v represents variant; previously erm(amr)] (n = 13), as reported previously, but also three kinds of erm(b) variants, which were designated erm(bv1) (n = 17), erm(bv2) (n = 3), and erm(bv3) (n = 3), respectively. in lacz reporter gene assays of these variants, the 16-membered-ring macrolide tylosin had stronger inducibility than erythromycin at > or = 0.1 microg/ml. these findings highlight the versatility of erm(b) in induction specificity.
[yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--i. gram-positive bacteria].
the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
a comparison of the antimicrobial resistance patterns of gram-positive cocci isolated from community-private and university-affiliated hospitals from puerto rico.
the antimicrobial resistance patterns of 2,462 selected gram-positive cocci obtained from three community-private hospitals (cph) and three university-affiliated hospitals (uah) were evaluated utilizing the institutions' antimicrobial susceptibility reports for the year 2000. the objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate the in vitro resistance to selected standard antibiotics of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates, and 2) to compare the antimicrobial resistance patterns between community-private (cph) and university-affiliated hospitals (uah). staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram-positive isolated organism in cph (63.3%) followed by e. faecalis (31.0%). in uah, the most prevalent cocci were e. faecalis (51.7%) followed by s. aureus (43.9%). enterococcus faecium represented 2.3% and 4.4% of cph and uah isolates, respectively. streptococcus pneumoniae represented 3.4% of the total gram-positive isolates from cph, no s. pneumoniae was reported in uah. the antimicrobial susceptibility results showed that for staphylococcus aureus there was a statistically significant higher resistance to methicillin and thrimethoprim sulfamethoxazole in uah, while resistance to erythromycin was significantly higher in cph. there was no difference in the resistance of s. aureus to other antimicrobial agents between hospitals groups. a statistically significant resistant to vancomycin was found between enterococcal isolates from uah (43%) and cph (12.7%). high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) was observed among uah enterococcal isolates with e. faecium showing a higher resistance than e. faecalis, no data for hlar in cph could be obtained. for pneumococci 46% of cph isolates were resistant to penicillin. in summary, there are important differences in the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance between the gram-positive bacteria isolated from community and teaching hospitals.
in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive, clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp., but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.
geographic variations and trends in antimicrobial resistance among enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (1997-2000).
in the 1990s, the enterococcus emerged as an important pathogen because of increasing prevalence and acquired resistances to glycopeptides and other agents. the seriousness of this problem can vary markedly worldwide and within nations; the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program documents these differences. over 8,000 enterococci were processed in the program (1997-2000) and the enterococcus faecalis (ef; 4,034 strains) and enterococcus faecium (efm; 1,123 strains) isolates are tabulated. all strains were processed by three regional monitors using reference dilution methods. identification to species was performed by participants and confirmed by the central laboratories. ef occurrence was greater than efm by ratios of 3:1 to 5:1 in the asia-pacific (apac), european (eu), and north american (na) regions; the ratio was 17:1 in latin america (la). ef and efm represented approximately 80-90% of all isolated enterococci. glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) rates varied from nil for ef in apac and la to 43 to 54% in efm in na. a slight increase in gre was noted in na (efm only). van a phenotypes predominated all regions. the most recent (2000) rank order of % gre by region was: for na (13%) > la (4%) > eu (3%) > apac (1%). in na potential therapeutic agents were (% s): ampicillin (81%), chloramphenicol (87%), quinupristin/dalfopristin (20%), ciprofloxacin (39%), gatifloxacin (51%), nitrofurantoin (83%) and linezolid (>99%). resistances in enterococci continue to be documented worldwide, but rates within endemic areas like na appears to be stabilizing. van a resistance patterns predominate and therapeutic options continue to present dilemmas, although some of the older agents remain usable as primary therapy or as alternatives to the newer agents such as the oxazolidinones.
species composition and antimicrobial resistance genes of enterococcus spp, isolated from integrated and traditional fish farms in thailand.
integrated fish farming uses the manure from animal husbandry as fertilisers in the fish ponds. a total of 410 enterococcal isolates, from integrated and traditional fish farms in thailand, were collected to assess whether the input of manure from chickens receiving feed containing growth promoters and antimicrobial treatments influenced the species composition and the bacterial antimicrobial resistance in the fish pond environment. enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis were the predominate species isolated from the integrated farms, whereas e. casseliflavus and e. mundtii isolates were most prevalent in traditional farms. enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium demonstrated the highest prevalence of resistance, whereas e. mundtii isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested. all the enterococci species isolated from the integrated farms, generally demonstrated higher resistance phenotypes to the tested antimicrobials compared with the same species from traditional farms. the erm(b) and tet(m) genes, associated with resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline, respectively, were found in 87% of the erythromycin-resistant and 95% of the oxytetracycline-resistant enterococci isolates respectively. these results suggest that the species composition and antimicrobial resistance of enterococci in tropical aquatic environments are influenced by faecal and antimicrobial pollution.
purification of bacteriocin as-48 from an enterococcus faecium strain and analysis of the gene cluster involved in its production.
the cyclic bacteriocin as-48 has previously been shown to be produced by enterococcus faecalis strains. a bacteriocin has been purified from an e. faecium strain (e. faecium 7c5), and it has been found to possess molecular mass, cyclization and amino acid sequence typical of bacteriocin as-48. in addition to the structural gene as-48a, the sequence analysis of the as-48 gene cluster present in e. faecium 7c5 has revealed the presence of several putative coding regions presumably involved in bacteriocin production and immunity. the results of dna hybridization assays have indicated that the as-48 gene cluster and the gene pd78 are present on the same plasmid, possibly the ppd1 plasmid, in e. faecium 7c5.
clinical isolates of enterococcus faecium exhibit strain-specific collagen binding mediated by acm, a new member of the mscramm family.
a collagen-binding adhesin of enterococcus faecium, acm, was identified. acm shows 62% similarity to the staphylococcus aureus collagen adhesin cna over the entire protein and is more similar to cna (60% and 75% similarity with cna a and b domains respectively) than to the enterococcus faecalis collagen-binding adhesin, ace, which shares homology with acm only in the a domain. despite the detection of acm in 32 out of 32 e. faecium isolates, only 11 of these (all clinical isolates, including four vancomycin-resistant endocarditis isolates and seven other isolates) exhibited binding to collagen type i (ci). although acm from three ci-binding vancomycin-resistant e. faecium clinical isolates showed 100% identity, analysis of acm genes and their promoter regions from six non-ci-binding strains identified deletions or mutations that introduced stop codons and/or is elements within the gene or the promoter region in five out of six strains, suggesting that the presence of an intact functional acm gene is necessary for binding of e. faecium strains to ci. recombinant acm a domain showed specific and concentration-dependent binding to collagen, and this protein competed with e. faecium binding to immobilized ci. consistent with the adherence phenotype and sequence data, probing with acm-specific iggs purified from anti-recombinant acm a polyclonal rabbit serum confirmed the surface expression of acm in three out of three collagen-binding clinical isolates of e. faecium tested, but in none of the strains with a non-functional pseudo acm gene. introduction of a functional acm gene into two non-ci-binding natural acm mutant strains conferred a ci-binding phenotype, further confirming that native acm is sufficient for the binding of e. faecium to ci. these results demonstrate that acm, which encodes a potential virulence factor, is functional only in certain infection-derived clinical isolates of e. faecium, and suggest that acm is the primary adhesin responsible for the ability of e. faecium to bind collagen.
prevalence of resistance to ampicillin, gentamicin and vancomycin in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates from clinical specimens and use of antimicrobials in five nordic hospitals.
we determined the species distribution and prevalence of ampicillin resistance, high-level gentamicin resistance (hlgr) and vancomycin resistance among clinical enterococcal isolates from five nordic laboratories (bergen, tromso, uppsala, aarhus and reykjavik). isolates represented three different groups: (i) all blood culture isolates from 1999; (ii) consecutive in-patient isolates (maximum 40); and (iii) consecutive outpatient isolates (maximum 40) collected during march to may 2000. antimicrobial use data were collected at the national and hospital level. a high proportion (31.4%) of enterococcus faecium was detected among blood culture isolates, in contrast to only 4.2% among isolates from outpatients. ampicillin resistance was not found in enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 48.8% in e. faecium isolates. hlgr rates varied considerably between laboratories (1.1-27.6%). acquired vancomycin resistance was not detected. there were no significant differences in the prevalences of hlgr between in-patient and outpatient isolates at individual hospitals. a cluster of clonally related ampicillin-resistant and hlgr e. faecium isolates was demonstrated in one of the hospitals. the lowest level of hospital antimicrobial use, the lowest proportion of e. faecium and the lowest prevalence of resistance were observed in reykjavik. the study showed a relatively low level of resistance in enterococci, as compared with most european countries and the usa. however, there were large differences between hospitals with regard to the relative proportion of e. faecium isolates, their susceptibility to ampicillin and gentamicin, as well as the prevalence of hlgr in e. faecalis isolates. this indicates a potential for further improvement of antibiotic policies, and possibly hospital infection control, to maintain the low resistance levels observed in these countries.
activity of tigecycline (gar-936), a novel glycylcycline, against enterococci in  the mouse peritonitis model.
a novel glycylcycline agent, tigecycline (gar-936), was evaluated in vivo in the  mouse model of peritonitis against three enterococcus faecalis and four enterococcus faecium isolates with different susceptibilities to vancomycin and tetracyclines, all of which were inhibited by </=0.125 micro g of tigecycline/ml. using a single subcutaneous dose, tigecycline displayed a protective effect (50% protective dose, </=5.7 mg/kg of body weight) against all strains tested, including two with tn925 (from the tn916 family), which contains the tet(m) tetracycline resistance determinant, as well as vana and vanb strains. as expected, tetracycline and minocycline were ineffective against the isolates carrying tn925.
mc21-a, a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
we previously reported a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in the present study, we purified an anti-mrsa substance (mc21-a) from the methanol extract of the cells of p. phenolica o-bc30(t) and analyzed its chemical structure. mc21-a was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. its anti-mrsa activity against 10 clinical isolates of mrsa was comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a mics, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin mics, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). this substance was also high active against enterococcus serolicida, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis but was less active against streptococcus spp. a time-kill study also demonstrated that mc21-a was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. the postantibiotic effect (pae) of mc21-a against a clinical mrsa isolate, strain e 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a paes, 1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin paes, 0.84 to 1.43 h). however, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse mrsa cells. this substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. a sytox green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of mrsa as its mode of action. when its activities against a hypersensitive escherichia coli mutant (ko 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, mc21-a exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. furthermore, mc21-a was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. these results suggest that mc21-a might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-mrsa substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.
activity and diffusion of tigecycline (gar-936) in experimental enterococcal endocarditis.
the activity of tigecycline (gar-936), a novel glycylcycline, was investigated in vitro and in experimental endocarditis due to the susceptible enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 strain, its vana type transconjugant bm4316, and a clinical vana type strain, e. faecium hb217 resistant to tetracycline. mics of gar-936 were 0.06 micro g/ml for the three strains. in vitro pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of gar-936 that was not enhanced by increasing concentrations to more than 1 micro g/ml and a postantibiotic effect ranging from 1 to 4.5 h for concentrations of 1- to 20-fold the mic. intravenous injection of [(14)c]gar-936 to five rabbits with enterococcal endocarditis sacrificed 30 min, 4 h, or 12 h after the end of the infusion evidenced a lower clearance of gar-936 from aortic vegetations than from serum and a homogeneous diffusion of gar-936 into the vegetations. in rabbits with endocarditis, gar-936 (14 mg/kg of body weight twice a day [b.i.d.]) given intravenously for 5 days was bacteriostatic against both strains of e. faecalis. against e. faecium hb217, bacterial counts in vegetations significantly decreased during therapy (p < 0.01), and the effect was similar with gar-936 at 14 mg/kg b.i.d., 14 mg/kg once a day (o.d.), and 7 mg/kg o.d., which provided concentrations in serum constantly above the mic. mean serum elimination half-life ranged from 3.3 to 3.6 h. no gar-936-resistant mutants were selected in vivo with any regimen. we concluded that the combination of prolonged half-life, significant postantibiotic effect, and good and homogeneous diffusion into the vegetations may account for the in vivo activity of gar-936 against enterococci susceptible or resistant to glycopeptides and tetracyclines, even when using a o.d. regimen in rabbits.
comparative antimicrobial spectrum and activity of bms284756 (t-3811; a desfluoroquinolone) tested against an international collection of staphylococci and enterococci, including in vitro test development and intermethod comparisons.
the study was initiated to determine the in vitro activity and mic/disk test comparisons of bms284756, a new des-fluoro(6)-quinolone, against isolates of staphylococci and enterococci from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program, 2000. isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution and standardized disk diffusion methods. against 3,789 strains of gram-positive cocci from the sentry program (2000), the bms284756 mic90 and percentage susceptible at < or = 2 and < or = 4 microg/ml were: staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/ml; 89.3 and 97.1%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 4 microg/ml; 86.1 and 96.0%) and enterococci (> 4 microg/ml; 62.0 and 76.2%). also tested were selected staphylococci (300 strains) and enterococci (102 strains) by two standardized methods. the activity of bms284756 was highly correlated with oxacillin resistance among staphylococci. oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci were all inhibited by bms284756 at < or = 0.5 microg/ml, whereas oxacillin-resistant strains required inhibitory concentrations of > or = 1 microg/ml. excellent correlation was observed between the mic and 5-microg disk zone diameter for staphylococci and enterococci (r=0.91 to 0.93). among vancomycin-susceptible enterococci, 67% of enterococcus faecalis, 25% of e. faecium, and 76% of other enterococcus spp. isolates were inhibited by bms284756 at < or = 2 microg/ml. all vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre; 11 e. faecalis and 15 e. faecium) were inhibited by > or = 2 microg/ml of bms284756. among the non-vre, non-faecium enterococcal isolates (n=64), 62% were inhibited by < or = 0.5 microg/ml. bms284756 showed excellent activity against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci and moderate activity against enterococci other than vre and e. faecium. acceptable correlations were observed between mic and disk test results for both tested genus groups.
in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in italy.
objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
treatment options for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections.
serious infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) usually occurs in patients with significantly compromised host defences and serious co-morbidities, and this magnifies the importance of effective antimicrobial treatment. assessments of antibacterial efficacy against vre have been hampered by the lack of a comparator treatment arm(s), complex treatment requirements including surgery, and advanced illness-severity associated with a high crude mortality. treatment options include available agents which don't have a specific vre approval (chloramphenicol, doxycycline, high-dose ampicillin or ampicillin/sulbactam), and nitrofurantoin (for lower urinary tract infection). the role of antimicrobial combinations that have shown in vitro or animal-model in vivo efficacy has yet to be established. two novel antimicrobial agents (quinupristin/ dalfopristin and linezolid) have emerged as approved therapeutic options for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium on the basis of in vitro susceptibility and clinical efficacy from multicentre, pharmaceutical company-sponsored clinical trials. quinupristin/dalfopristin is a streptogramin, which impairs bacterial protein synthesis at both early peptide chain elongation and late peptide chain extrusion steps. it has bacteriostatic activity against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium [minimum concentration to inhibit growth of 90% of isolates (mic(90)) = 2 microg/ml] but is not active against enterococcus faecalis (mic(90 )= 16 microg/ml). in a noncomparative, nonblind, emergency-use programme in patients who were infected with gram-positive isolates resistant or refractory to conventional therapy or who were intolerant of conventional therapy, quinupristin/dalfopristin was administered at 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours. the clinical response rate in the bacteriologically evaluable subset was 70.5%, and a 65.8% overall response (favourable clinical and bacteriological outcome) was observed. resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin on therapy was observed in 6/338 (1.8%) of vre strains. myalgia/arthralgia was the most frequent treatment-limiting adverse effect. in vitro studies which combine quinupristin/dalfopristin with ampicillin or doxycyline have shown enhanced killing effects against vre; however, the clinical use of combined therapy remains unestablished. linezolid, an oxazolidinone compound that acts by inhibiting the bacterial pre-translational initiation complex formation, has bacteriostatic activity against both vancomycin resistant e. faecium (mic(90) = 2 to 4 microg/ml) and e. faecalis (mic(90) = 2 to 4 microg/ml). this agent was studied in a similar emergency use protocol for multi-resistant gram-positive infections. 55 of 133 evaluable patients were infected with vre. cure rates for the most common sites were complicated skin and soft tissue 87.5% (7/8), primary bacteraemia 90.9% (10/11), peritonitis 91.7% (11/12), other abdominal/pelvic infections 91.7% (11/12), and catheter-related bacteraemia 100% (9/9). there was an all-site response rate of 92.6% (50/54). in a separate blinded, randomised, multicentre trial for vre infection at a variety of sites, intravenous low dose linezolid (200mg every 12 hours) was compared to high dose therapy (600 mg every 12 hours) with optional conversion to oral administration. a positive dose response (although statistically nonsignificant) was seen with a 67% (39/58) and 52% (24/46) cure rate in the high- and low-dose groups, respectively. adverse effects of linezolid therapy have been predominantly gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), headache and taste alteration. reports of thrombocytopenia appear to be limited to patients receiving somewhat longer courses of treatment (>14 to 21 days). linezolid resistance (mic > or = 8 microg/ml) has been reported in a small number of e. faecium strains which appears to be secondary to a base-pair mutation in the genome encoding for the bacterial 23s ribosome binding site. at present a comparative study between the two approved agents for vre (quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid) has not been performed. several investigational agents are currently in phase ii or iii trials for vre infection. this category includes daptomycin (an acidic lipopeptide), oritavancin (ly-333328; a glycopeptide), and tigilcycline (gar-936; a novel analogue of minocycline). finally, strategies to suppress or eradicate the vre intestinal reservoir have been reported for the combination of oral doxycyline plus bacitracin and oral ramoplanin (a novel glycolipodepsipeptide). if successful, a likely application of such an approach is the reduction of vre infection during high risk periods in high risk patient groups such as the post-chemotherapy neutropenic nadir or early post-solid abdominal organ transplantation.
characterization of anti-listeria monocytogenes bacteriocins from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and lactococcus lactis strains isolated from raib, a moroccan traditional fermented milk.
seventy-four samples of raib, a moroccan traditional fermented milk, were screened for their anti-listeria monocytogenes activity. nine lactic acid bacteria with antilisterial activity were isolated and identified as lactococcus lactis [4], enterococcus faecium [4], and e. faecalis [1]. antibacterial spectra, determined against 45 target strains, led to the selection of four antibacterial-producing strains, which were further characterized. their anti-microbial agents, inactivated by one or more proteases, were designed as bacteriocins. lactococcin r9/2 and r10/1 showed the broadest range of inhibitory action. anti-bacterial spectra and physico-chemical properties suggest that these bacteriocins were similar to nisin. enterocin r69 had a specificity of action against listeria spp., whereas enterocin r18 had a broad spectrum of activity. lc. lactis r9/2 and e. faecalis r18 were able to coagulate sterilised uht milk at 30 degrees c in 24 h and induced a 2 log reduction in l. monocytogenes atcc 15313 population.
in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
effect of abolishment of the use of antimicrobial agents for growth promotion on  occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in fecal enterococci from food animals in denmark.
from 1995 to 2000, a total of 673 enterococcus faecium and 1,088 enterococcus faecalis isolates from pigs together with 856 e. faecium isolates from broilers were isolated and tested for susceptibility to four classes of antimicrobial agents used for growth promotion as part of the danish program of monitoring for antimicrobial resistance. the four antimicrobials were avilamycin, erythromycin, vancomycin, and virginiamycin. major changes in the use of antimicrobial agents for growth promotion have occurred during the last 6 years in denmark. the government banned the use of avoparcin in 1995 and of virginiamycin in 1998. furthermore, the producers have voluntarily stopped all use beginning in 1999. the avoparcin ban in 1995 was followed by a decrease in the occurrence of glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium (gre) in broilers, from 72.7% in 1995 to 5.8% in 2000. the occurrence of glycopeptide resistance among isolates from pigs remained constant at around 20% from 1995 to 1997. it was shown that, in gre from pigs, the genes encoding macrolide and glycopeptide resistance were genetically linked and that, following the decrease in the use of tylosin during 1998 and 1999, the occurrence of gre in pigs decreased to 6.0% in 2000. from 1995 to 1997 the occurrence of erythromycin resistance among e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates from pigs was almost 90%. use of tylosin decreased considerably during 1998 and 1999, and this decrease was followed by decreases in the occurrence of resistance to 46.7 and 28.1% among e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates from pigs, respectively. erythromycin resistance among e. faecium isolates from broilers reached a maximum of 76.3% in 1997 but decreased to 12.7% in 2000 concomitantly with more limited use of virginiamycin. use of virginiamycin increased from 1995 to 1997 and was followed by an increased occurrence of virginiamycin resistance among e. faecium isolates in broilers, from 27.3% in 1995 to 66.2% in 1997. in january 1998 the use of virginiamycin was banned in denmark, and the occurrence of virginiamycin resistance decreased to 33.9% in 2000. use of avilamycin increased from 1995 to 1996 and was followed by an increase in avilamycin resistance among e. faecium isolates from broilers, from 63.6% in 1995 to 77.4% in 1996. since 1996 avilamycin usage has decreased, followed by a decrease in resistance to 4.8% in 2000. our observations show that it is possible to reduce the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in a national population of food animals when the selective pressure is removed. cases in which resistance to vancomycin was linked to resistance to erythromycin were exceptions. in such cases resistance did not decrease until the use of both avoparcin and tylosin was limited.
linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments, including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
bacteriocin production in vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus isolates of different origins.
bacteriocin production was determined for 218 enterococcus isolates (enterococcus faecalis [93] and e. faecium [125]) obtained from different origins (human clinical samples [87], human fecal samples [78], sewage [28], and chicken samples [25]) and showing different vancomycin susceptibility patterns (vancomycin resistant, all of them vana positive [56], and vancomycin susceptible [162]). all enterococcal isolates were randomly selected except for the vancomycin-resistant ones. a total of 33 isolates of eight different bacterial genera were used as indicators for bacteriocin production. forty-seven percent of the analyzed enterococcal isolates were bacteriocin producers (80.6% of e. faecalis and 21.6% of e. faecium isolates). the percentage of bacteriocin producers was higher among human clinical isolates (63.2%, 81.8% of vancomycin-resistant isolates and 60.5% of vancomycin-susceptible ones) than among isolates from the other origins (28 to 39.3%). only one out of the 15 vancomycin-resistant isolates from human fecal samples was a bacteriocin producer, while 44.4% of fecal vancomycin-susceptible isolates were. the bacteriocin produced by the vana-containing e. faecium strain rc714, named bacteriocin rc714, was further characterized. this bacteriocin activity was cotransferred together with the vana genetic determinant to e. faecalis strain jh2-2. bacteriocin rc714 was purified to homogeneity and its primary structure was determined by amino acid sequencing, showing an identity of 88% and a similarity of 92% with the previously described bacteriocin 31 from e. faecalis yi717. the presence of five different amino acids in bacteriocin rc714 suggest that this could be a new bacteriocin. the results obtained suggest that the epidemiology of vancomycin resistance may be influenced by different factors, including bacteriocin production.
identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococci isolated from the  root canal.
enterococci are occurring in opportunistic infections involving the oral cavity.  this study has identified enterococcal species in 29 endodontic infections undergoing treatment with ca (oh)2 dressings. the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of 29 isolated enterococcal strains was determined. enterococcus faecalis was speciated for 26 isolates and enterococcus faecium for three isolates. in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed enterococcal isolates resistant to benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole and tetracycline but sensitive to erythromycin and vancomycin. due to low sensitivity to antimicrobial agents, enterococci may be selected in root canals undergoing standard endodontic treatment and significantly contribute to endodontic treatment failures.
in vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin and eight other antimicrobial agents against 360 clinical isolates from korea.
the emergence of multi-drug resistant gram-positive cocci such as methicillin-resistant (mr) staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant (vr) enterococci, and vancomycin-intermediate resistant s. aureus (visa) has given new urgency to the development of new antimicrobial agents. one of these is quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d). we decided to determine the susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated at two university hospitals in seoul to q/d and compare the results with eight other antimicrobial agents. we investigated 120 isolates of s. aureus including 49 mrsas and one visa, 120 isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci (cns), 64 e. faecalis and 56 e. faecium, including seven strains of vr e. faecium. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) for several antimicrobials, including vancomycin and q/d, were determined by broth microdilution. all s. aureus including visa were susceptible to q/d. q/d mic90 for both methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) and mrsa was 0.25 g/ml. 49 (87.5%) of 56 e. faecium including six of seven vr e. faecium were susceptible to q/d. e. faecalis were not susceptible to q/d (only 1.5% susceptible), but were inhibited by ampicillin (94% susceptible) or vancomycin (95%). cns was susceptible to q/d (96% susceptible) and vancomycin (100% susceptible). one of 38 staphylococci and two of 17 e. faecium were tolerant to q/d. in conclusion, q/d showed excellent activity against all species of gram-positive cocci including mrsa, visa, and vr e. faecium except e. faecalis, and may provide a valuable option for the treatment of infections caused by these emerging nosocomial pathogens of gram-positive cocci.
antibacterial activities of temporin a analogs.
temporin a (ta) is a small, basic, highly hydrophobic, antimicrobial peptide amide (flpligrvlsgil-nh2) found in the skin of the european red frog, rana temporaria. it has variable antibiotic activities against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including clinically important methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus as well as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium strains. in this investigation the antimicrobial activity and structural characteristics of ta synthetic analogs were studied. for antibacterial activity against s. aureus and enterococcal strains, the hydrophobicity of the n-terminal amino acid of ta was found to be important as well as a positive charge at amino acid position 7, and bulky hydrophobic side chains at positions 5 and 12. replacing isoleucine with leucine at amino acid positions 5 and 12 resulted in the greatest enhancement of antibacterial activity. in addition, there was little difference between the activities of ta and its all-d enantiomer, indicating that the peptide probably exerts its effect on bacteria via non-chiral interactions with membrane lipids.
comparison of antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and resistance genes in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium from humans in the community, broilers, and pigs in denmark.
enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolated from humans in the community (98 and 65 isolates), broilers (126 and 122), and pigs (102 and 88) during 1998 were tested for susceptibility to 12 different antimicrobial agents and for the presence of selected genes encoding resistance using pcr. furthermore, the presence of vancomycin resistant enterococci was examined in 38 human stool samples using selective enrichment. widespread resistance to chloramphenicol, macrolides, kanamycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline was found among isolates from all three sources. all e. faecium isolates from humans and pigs were susceptible to avilamycin, whereas 35% of isolates from broilers were resistant. all e. faecium isolates from humans were susceptible to vancomycin, whereas 10% and 17% of isolates from broilers and pigs, respectively, were resistant. a vancomycin resistant e. faecium isolate was found in one of the 38 human fecal samples examined using selective enrichment. all vancomycin resistant isolates contained the vana gene, all chloramphenicol resistant isolates the cat(pip501) gene, and all five gentamicin resistant isolates the aac6-aph2 gene. sixty-one (85%) of 72 erythromycin resistant e. faecalis examined and 57 (90%) of 63 erythromycin resistant e. faecium isolates examined contained ermb. forty (91%) of the kanamycin resistant e. faecalis and 18 (72%) of the kanamycin resistant e. faecium isolates contained apha3. the tet(m) gene was found in 95% of the tetracycline resistant e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates of human and animal origin, examined. tet(k) was not observed, whereas tet(l) was detected in 17% of tetracycline resistant e. faecalis isolates and in 16% of the e. faecium isolates. tet(o) was not detected in any of the isolates from pigs, but was observed in 38% of e. faecalis isolates from broilers, in two e. faecalis isolates from humans and in three e. faecium isolates from broilers. tet(s) was not detected among isolates from animals, but was observed in 31% of e. faecalis and one e. faecium isolate from humans. this study showed a frequent occurrence of antimicrobial resistance and the presence of selected resistance genes in e. faecalis and e. faecium isolated from humans, broilers and pigs. differences in the occurrence of resistance and tetracycline resistance genes were observed among isolates from the different sources. however, similar resistance patterns and resistance genes were detected frequently indicating that transmission of resistant enterococci or resistance genes takes place between humans, broilers, and pigs.
preliminary characterization of bacteriocins produced by enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis isolated from pig faeces.
a total of 92 enterococci, isolated from the faeces of minipigs subjected to an in vivo feeding trial, were screened for the production of antimicrobial substances. bacteriocin production was confirmed for seven strains, of which four were identified as enterococcus faecalis and three as enterococcus faecium, on the basis of physiological and biochemical characteristics. the bacteriocins produced by the ent. faecalis strains showed a narrow spectrum of activity, mainly against other enterococcus spp., compared with those from the ent. faecium strains showing a broader spectrum of activity, against indicator strains of enterococcus spp., listeria spp., clostridium spp. and propionibacterium spp. the bacteriocins of all seven enterococcus strains were inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, trypsin, pronase, pepsin and papain, but not by lipase, lysozyme and catalase. the bacteriocins were heat stable and displayed highest activity at neutral ph. the molecular weight of the bacteriocins, as determined by tricine sds-page, was approximately 3.4 kda. only the strains of ent. faecalis were found to contain plasmids. pcr detection revealed that the bacteriocins produced by ent. faecium bfe 1170 and bfe 1228 were similar to enterocin a, whereas those produced by ent. faecium bfe 1072 displayed homology with enterocin l50a and b.
quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. the combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref), drug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, clostridium perfringens and peptostreptococcus spp. the combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including moraxella catarrhalis, legioniella pneumophila and mycoplasma pneumoniae. quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against e. faecalis. the combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. as for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against e. faecium. in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) or vref infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with vref infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome p450 3a4 and therefore has the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. conclusions: quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. in serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. however, in vref or unresponsive mrsa infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.
in vitro activity of moxifloxacin, a new 8-methoxyquinolone, against gram-positive bacteria.
the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin, formerly bay 12-8039, against gram-positive bacteria was tested by the agar dilution method. a total of 189 isolates that included staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococci, rhodococci, leuconostocs, pediococci, lactobacilli, and diphtheroids were tested. moxifloxacin showed greater potency than ciprofloxacin against s. aureus, streptococci, and enterococci, having minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) lower than those of ciprofloxacin by 2- to 64-fold. this improved activity was most prominent for s. aureus. moxifloxacin was active against leuconostoc and rhodococcus species. time-kill studies using moxifloxacin at a concentration of 3 micrograms/ml against one isolate each of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mssa) (mic, 0.031 microgram/ml), mrsa (mic, 1 microgram/ml), two isolates of e. faecalis (mics, 0.25 and 2 micrograms/ml), and two isolates of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (mics, 0.25 and 2 micrograms/ml) revealed an average decrease in colony forming unit (cfu) by 3.8, 0.4, 4.0, 2.0, 4.2, and 1.8 log10 cfu/ml at 24 h, respectively. moxifloxacin is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with improved in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria. further studies of the in vivo activity of this compound appear warranted.
[vancomycin-resistant enterococci: in vitro activity of quinupristin / dalfoprostin (rp 59500)].
background: the recent emergence of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci limits the treatment of enterococcal infections. the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of a new streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, against 30 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and compared with those of other 15 antimicrobials. material and methods: enterococci were identified by using rapid id 32 strep system. genotyping of the isolates was performed by pcr. the mics of quinupristin/dalfopristin were determined by the agar dilution technique recommended by the nccls. susceptibilities to the rest of antibiotics tested (teicoplanin, ampicillin, penicillin, imipenem, doxycicline, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, streptomycin, rifampin, levofloxacin, fleroxacin, trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, pefloxacin and clinafloxacin) were determined by using the e test. beta-lactamase production was examined with nitrocefin disks. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin has demonstrated excellent activity against enterococcus faecium (mic90' 2 micrograms/ml). enterococcus faecalis was considerably less susceptible than e. faecium, at concentration of 4 micrograms/ml inhibited only 31% of tested strains. for doxycicline 77% of strains were susceptible. only five isolates were susceptible to clinafloxacin; the other quinolones tested displayed poor activity. resistance to chloramphenicol was detected in 47% of isolates. none of the isolates produced beta-lactamase. conclusions: this study indicates that vancomycin-resistant enterococci are often concomitantly resistant to multiple antibiotics. quinupristin/dalfopristin was the most active agent tested against e. faecium strains. on the basis of these results quinupristin/dalfopristin could be a therapeutic option for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium infections.
atypical genetic locus associated with constitutive production of enterocin b by  enterococcus faecium bfe 900.
a purified bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium bfe 900 isolated from black olives was shown by edman degradation and mass spectrometric analyses to be identical to enterocin b produced by e. faecium t136 from meat (p. casaus, t. nilsen, l. m. cintas, i. f. nes, p. e. hernandez, and h. holo, microbiology 143:2287-2294, 1997). the structural gene was located on a 2.2-kb hindiii fragment and a 12.0-kb ecori chromosomal fragment. the genetic characteristics and production of entb by e. faecium bfe 900 differed from that described so far by the presence of a conserved sequence like a regulatory box upstream of the entb gene, and its production was constitutive and not regulated. the 2.2-kb chromosomal fragment contained the hitherto undetected immunity gene for entb in an atypical orientation that is the reverse of that of the structural gene. typical transport and other genes associated with bacteriocin production were not detected on the 12.0-kb chromosomal fragment containing the entb structural gene. this makes the entb genetic system different from most other bacteriocin systems, where transport and possible regulatory genes are clustered. entb was subcloned and expressed by the dedicated secretion machinery of carnobacterium piscicola lv17a. the structural gene was amplified by pcr, fused to the divergicin a signal peptide, and expressed by the general secretory pathway in enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433.
from vana enterococcus hirae to vana enterococcus faecium: a study of feed supplementation with avoparcin and tylosin in young chickens.
fifteen newborn chickens were isolated in separate cages after 1 month of living  together, divided into three groups, and challenged for 5 weeks with seed food which either was supplemented with avoparcin (10 mg/kg of animal food) or tylosin (40 mg/kg) or was nonsupplemented. at 9 weeks of age and after the 5-week challenge, all chickens received nonsupplemented feed for 4 additional weeks. at 4, 9, and 13 weeks of life, feces were collected and inoculated on m-enterococcus agar plates with and without vancomycin (4 micrograms/ml). vana-containing enterococcus hirae was isolated from 11 of 15 chickens before antibiotic challenge, without detection of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. at 9 weeks of age and after the 5-week avoparcin challenge, vana e. hirae strains were no longer detected, but five of five chickens now had vana e. faecium. at a lower frequency, vana e. faecium had also displaced vana e. hirae in both the tylosin group (one of four chickens) and the control group (two of five chickens). one month after avoparcin discontinuation, the number of chickens colonized with vana e. faecium decreased from five to one. all vana-containing e. hirae strains detected in the first month of life and most of the vana-containing e. faecium strains detected in the second month of life showed identical apai and smai restriction patterns, respectively, when analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. all vana e. hirae isolates transferred glycopeptide and macrolide resistance to enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 in vitro; the level of glycopeptide resistance was higher in the transconjugants than in the donor e. hirae strains. these data suggest that e. hirae may be a significant source of vana determinants with the potential of transfer to other enterococcal species from humans or animals.
characterization and heterologous expression of the genes encoding enterocin a production, immunity, and regulation in enterococcus faecium dpc1146.
enterocin a is a small, heat-stable, antilisterial bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecium dpc1146. the sequence of a 10, 879-bp chromosomal region containing at least 12 open reading frames (orfs), 7 of which are predicted to play a role in enterocin biosynthesis, is presented. the genes enta, enti, and entf encode the enterocin a prepeptide, the putative immunity protein, and the induction factor prepeptide, respectively. the deduced proteins entk and entr resemble the histidine kinase and response regulator proteins of two-component signal transducing systems of the agrc-agra type. the predicted proteins entt and entd are homologous to abc (atp-binding cassette) transporters and accessory factors, respectively, of several other bacteriocin systems and to proteins implicated in the signal-sequence-independent export of escherichia coli hemolysin a. immediately downstream of the entt and entd genes are two orfs, the product of one of which, orf4, is very similar to the product of the ytei gene of bacillus subtilis and to e. coli protease iv, a signal peptide peptidase known to be involved in outer membrane lipoprotein export. another potential bacteriocin is encoded in the opposite direction to the other genes in the enterocin cluster. this putative bacteriocin-like peptide is similar to lafx, one of the components of the lactacin f complex. a deletion which included one of two direct repeats upstream of the enta gene abolished enterocin a activity, immunity, and ability to induce bacteriocin production. transposon insertion upstream of the entf gene also had the same effect, but this mutant could be complemented by exogenously supplied induction factor. the putative enti peptide was shown to be involved in the immunity to enterocin a. cloning of a 10.5-kb amplicon comprising all predicted orfs and regulatory regions resulted in heterologous production of enterocin a and induction factor in enterococcus faecalis, while a four-gene construct (entaitd) under the control of a constitutive promoter resulted in heterologous enterocin a production in both e. faecalis and lactococcus lactis.
antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin tested against 1676 strains of ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-positive cocci isolated from patient infections in north and south america.
gatifloxacin (formerly am-115) is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum against gram-positive cocci and some anaerobes. to assess this new agent's activity, a collection of 1,676 gram-positive cocci were selected for resistance to ciprofloxacin (> or = 4 micrograms/ml) and tested against gatifloxacin and 18 other compounds by reference broth microdilution methods. the strains (approximately 23,000 total isolates from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program) were from significant blood stream, respiratory tract, wound, and urinary tract infections in patients in north (38 hospitals) and south (10 hospitals) america. against enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, gatifloxacin inhibited only 16% and 10% of strains compared with 12% and 5% for recently released trovafloxacin, respectively. among staphylococcus aureus (90% oxacillin-resistant) strains, gatifloxacin was more active (67% susceptible at < or = 4 micrograms/ml) than trovafloxacin (59%) or sparfloxacin (4%). gatifloxacin had a wider spectrum than trovafloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci especially s. epidermidis, 2% versus 58% resistance. the glycopeptides, chloramphenicol and rifampin were most active. against all genus/species groups with more than 100 sample strains (1,566), high-level resistance to gatifloxacin and trovafloxacin (> 4 micrograms/ml) was not significantly different (41.7% versus 39.1%; p > 0.05). emerging resistance to the fluoroquinolones remains a clinical problem among gram-positive species, and gatifloxacin seems to be active in vitro against many of these contemporary strains isolated in the americas.
the effect of ph on the inhibition of bacterial growth by physiological concentrations of butyric acid: implications for neonates fed on suckled milk.
butyric acid is released from milk by pre-intestinal lipases during suckling. it  is also known to inhibit bacterial growth. to investigate whether butyric acid may be a significant factor in controlling bacterial growth in the stomach of pre-weaned animals, the ability of butyric acid to inhibit growth of selected bacteria was tested over physiological ranges of ph and butyric acid concentrations. six enteric and environmental strains of bacteria were used: two strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus casseliflavus. at ph 4.5 and 5.0, the growth of all organisms was significantly inhibited in the presence of butyrate, and in some cases growth was completely arrested. at ph 6.0, butyric acid did not affect bacterial growth until the concentration reached 40 mm. the maximum concentration of butyric acid available in cow's milk after incubation with pre-gastric lipase is approximately 16 mm, which would be sufficient to prevent growth of the organisms tested at ph values occurring in the stomach. therefore, butyric acid inhibition of bacterial growth may explain in part, the role of pre-intestinal lipases in young animals' natural defenses against bacteria in ingested food prior to weaning.
antibiotic susceptibility testing (agar disk diffusion and agar dilution) of clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium: comparison of mueller-hinton, iso-sensitest, and wilkins-chalgren agar media.
forty-two isolates of enterococcus faecalis and 56 isolates of enterococcus faecium, including 8 vancomycin-resistant strains, were examined for comparative susceptibility to 27 antimicrobial drugs with the agar dilution method, employing mueller-hinton (mha), iso-sensitest (ista), and wilkins-chalgren (wca) agar. the bauer-kirby agar disk diffusion method was used to comparatively test 24 of the agents in parallel. the enterococci yielded better growth on ista and wca. however, wca completely antagonized co-trimoxazole and, though less, fosfomycin. importantly, wca slightly reduced the activities of teicoplanin (minimal inhibitory concentrations, mics, raised up to twofold) and vancomycin (mics raised two- to fourfold) against enterococci and staphylococcal quality control strains. therefore, wca was judged unsuitable for susceptibility testing of enterococci. for e. faecalis no discrepancies between agar dilution mics and inhibition zone diameters were encountered with augmentin, ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, chloramphenicol, mupirocin, oxacillin, teicoplanin, and co-trimoxazole. overall, mha yielded fewer very major (category i) and major (category ii) discrepancies than ista. however, numerous minor (category iii), slight (category iv), minimal (category v), and/or negligible (category vi) discrepancies were encountered with ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, erythromycin, fosfomycin, fusidic acid, meropenem, ofloxacin and rifampin. with respect to e. faecium, only cefotaxime, mupirocin, oxacillin, and teicoplanin yielded nondiscrepant results. several very major (i) and major (ii) discrepancies were observed with augmentin, ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, doxycycline, fusidic acid, imipenem, and penicillin g. minor discrepancies (categories iii-vi) were particularly numerous with augmentin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and piperacillin. the largest numbers of negligible (vi) discrepancies were noted with fosfomycin, fusidic acid, and ofloxacin. it is recommended to test one cephalosporin (cefuroxime or the like) in parallel for educational purposes and to exclude fosfomycin, fusidic acid, and rifampin from test batteries because of the wide scatter of test results. the large number of minimal (v) discrepancies of ciprofloxacin against e. faecalis, the numerous minor (iii) and slight (iv) discrepancies of chloramphenicol against e. faecium, and the not insignificant number of very major (i) and minor (iii) discrepancies observed with meropenem against isolates of e. faecalis necessitated proposals for new disk intermediate susceptibility criteria.
association between decreased susceptibility to a new antibiotic for treatment of human diseases, everninomicin (sch 27899), and resistance to an antibiotic used for growth promotion in animals, avilamycin.
the emergence of multiresistant bacteria has increased the need for new antibiotics or modifications of older antibiotics. one promising agent might be the everninomicin sch 27899, an oligosaccharide antibiotic recently developed by schering plough. however, another oligosaccharide, avilamycin, that is structurally very similar has been used as a growth promoter for food animals in the eu for several years, and a very frequent occurrence of resistance to avilamycin has been found among enterococcus faecium isolates from broilers in denmark. this study was conducted to investigate whether the resistance to avilamycin was associated with decreased susceptibility to everninomicin. from broilers, a total of 31 avilamycin susceptible and 55 avilamycin resistant (mic >16 microg/ml) e. faecium isolates were selected. from pigs, 21 avilamycin-susceptible and eight avilamycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and 50 avilamycin-susceptible and two avilamycin-resistant e. faecium isolates were selected. all isolates were tested for susceptibility to everninomicin by e-test. the avilamycin-susceptible enterococci isolates had mics to everninomicin from 0.064 to 0.75 microg/ml (mic50 = 0.38 microg/ml) and the avilamycin-resistant isolates had mics from 1.5 to 16 microg/ml (mic50 = 3 microg/ml). complete agreement between decreased susceptibility to avilamycin and everninomicin was found. this study showed that the use of avilamycin as a growth promoter for broilers and pigs has created a reservoir of e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates with decreased susceptibility to everninomicin among food animals already before this antibiotic have been finally developed for human use.
effects of different test conditions on mics of food animal growth-promoting antibacterial agents for enterococci.
the influence of the addition of sheep blood to mueller-hinton ii agar and the effects of aerobic incubation with or without co2 and of anaerobic incubation were tested with bacitracin, tylosin, avoparcin, virginiamycin, avilamycin, narasin, and flavomycin on enterococci. the antibacterial activity of bambermycin (flavomycin) was strongly inhibited by the addition of blood, except with the species enterococcus faecium, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus casseliflavus, and enterococcus gallinarum, which were not susceptible to this antibiotic on blood-free medium. with all other antimicrobials except avoparcin and tylosin, the presence of blood resulted in mic increases of 1 to 3 log2 differences. incubation in aerobic or anaerobic atmospheres enriched with co2 lowered the susceptibility of enterococci to tylosin and increased their susceptibility to avilamycin, narasin, and avoparcin. this effect was most pronounced in tests on blood-free media. results of susceptibility tests incubated under anaerobiosis and in a co2-enriched atmosphere did not differ. for all enterococcal species, the preferred conditions for testing the susceptibility are mueller-hinton ii medium supplemented with blood and incubation in a co2-enriched atmosphere. however, when only e. faecium and enterococcus faecalis are being tested, mueller-hinton ii medium without blood incubated aerobically gives satisfactory results.
[comparative antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.
effect of vancomycin on intestinal flora of patients who previously received antimicrobial therapy.
to evaluate the ecological disturbances of peroral vancomycin administration following cephalosporin administration, 20 healthy volunteers received cefuroxime axetil tablets (250 mg) perorally twice a day for 1 week, and 10 of these volunteers subsequently received vancomycin capsules (125 mg) perorally four times daily for 7 days. the concentration of vancomycin in feces after 1 week of vancomycin administration was high (mean +/- sd, 520 +/- 197 mg/kg), which correlated with the ecological disturbances noted in the vancomycin recipients. vancomycin administration resulted in a rapid decrease in the numbers of intestinal enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus durans (p < or = .05), while there was a significant emergence of motile enterococci with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (enterococcus gallinarum and enterococcus casseliflavus; minimum inhibitory concentration, 4-16 mg/l) (p < or = .01). because of vancomycin administration, there was also a significant overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant pediococcus species and lactobacilli as well as of klebsiella species, citrobacter species, and enterobacter species (p < or = .01). the numbers of bifidobacteria and bacteroides species were significantly reduced during vancomycin administration. none of the enterococcal strains carried vana or vanb. twenty-two of the 27 motile enterococci carried the vanc-1 gene specific for e. gallinarum, whereas five strains carried the vanc-2(c-3) gene, thus implicating that they were e. casseliflavus or enterococcus flavescens.
the in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against gram-positive bacteria.
the in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new quinolone, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, various beta-lactam antibiotics and, where appropriate, clindamycin and vancomycin against a range of gram-positive bacteria including staphylococci (n = 201), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 83), beta-haemolytic streptococci (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 100), streptococcus milleri (n = 18) and enterococci (n = 161) by an agar dilution technique. in addition, time-kill studies were performed to estimate the bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin against s. milleri and viridans group streptococci. trovafloxacin was the most active agent tested against staphylococci. it also showed good activity, at least four-fold and usually eight- to 16-fold that of ciprofloxacin, against all the streptococci. trovafloxacin showed good activity against vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, but was less active against the 11 isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. trovafloxacin showed comparable or superior bactericidal activity to amoxycillin against the s. milleri and viridans group streptococci tested.
comparative in-vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against enterococcus spp.
the in-vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against enterococcus spp. was  compared with that of amoxycillin, vancomycin, telcoplanin and erythromycin. the susceptibility of 106 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis, 92 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium and 14 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) was tested. only one strain of vancomycin-susceptible e. faecium was not susceptible to < or = 0.5 mg/l quinupristin/dalfopristin; this strain required 4 mg/l. all strains of e. faecalis were inhibited by < or = 8 mg/l quinupristin/dalfopristin and all vre strains were inhibited by < or = 2 mg/l. in contrast, teicoplanin and vancomycin showed inhibitory activity against e. faecalis and e. faecium but not against vre. amoxycillin was active against e. faecalis but not usually against e. faecium and showed variable activity against vre; 38% of e. faecalis, 84% of e. faecium and 80% of vre strains were resistant to erythromycin. the bactericidal activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against e. faecium exceeded that of the comparator drugs as judged by mic:mbc ratios and killing curves. the mbc99 of quinupristin/dalfopristin determined by a microdilution broth technique was < or = 1 mg/l for e. faecium. four of the five strains of vancomycin-susceptible e. faecium and three of the five vre strains tested with time-kill curves showed a > or = 2 log reduction in viable count after exposure to quinupristin/dalfopristin for 6 h.
in-vitro bactericidal activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin alone and in combination against resistant strains of enterococcus species and staphylococcus aureus.
in-vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a semisynthetic injectable streptogramin, and vancomycin were compared against multidrug-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and a methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). combinations of quinupristin/dalfopristin and/or vancomycin with ofloxacin or gentamicin were evaluated using the chequerboard technique. the only synergy observed was that between quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin plus gentamicin against e. faecium (fic index < 0.5). time-kill curves were performed over 24 h with an inoculum of 1 x 10(7) cfu/ml and clinically achievable concentrations of quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin, ofloxacin and gentamicin (6, 30, 5 and 5 mg/l, respectively). in time-kill studies, combinations of quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin plus gentamicin were additive, not synergic, against e. faecium and achieved 99.9% killing in 21.2 h and 19.6 h, respectively. none of the combination regimens suppressed the regrowth of e. faecalis. quinupristin/dalfopristin combined with vancomycin demonstrated consistent synergy against atcc 25923 and the mrsa, achieving 99.9% killing in 12.1 h and 11.9 h, respectively. overall, quinupristin/dalfopristin alone demonstrated inhibitory activity against e. faecium, but not against e. faecalis, and bactericidal activity was achieved only with quinupristin/dalfopristin in combination with vancomycin or gentamicin against e. faecium. quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin was the most potent and reliable combination against both strains of s. aureus in time-kill studies.
in-vitro study of the synergy between beta-lactam antibiotics and glycopeptides against enterococci.
the synergy between glycopeptides and beta-lactams was studied using different techniques such as broth macrodilution, killing curves and agar dilution combined with agar diffusion. two glycopeptide-resistant enterococci isolated from different clinical samples were used. results showed different effects with significant changes in mics. antibacterial activity was related to the concentration of glycopeptide and beta-lactam for enterococcus faecalis 8253, while for enterococcus faecium 8072 a paradoxical effect was observed. with this strain, the best synergic effect was detected at teicoplanin concentrations of 1-4 mg/l, but antibacterial activity was reduced at concentrations of 8, 16 and 32 mg/l. no synergic effect was observed with vancomycin. the combination of agar dilution with agar diffusion techniques may constitute a simple method for routine detection of synergic effects between glycopeptides and beta-lactams.
antibacterial activity of enterococci strains against vibrio cholerae.
thirty-seven strains of enterococci isolated from milk and milk products from santa fe (argentina) region were tested for antagonistic activity against vibrio cholerae 01 and non-01. seven of 17 strains of enterococcus faecalis, five of 10 strains of enterococcus faecium and four of 10 strains of enterococcus durans produced inhibition zones against the indicator species. the activity of the antibacterial compounds was completely destroyed by treatment with trypsin and pronase e in most cases (only the supernatant fluids of a few strains remained weakly active after the treatment), but was resistant to heat treatment at 100 degrees c during 10 and 30 min. when the 10-fold concentrated supernatant fluids were added to a fresh culture of sensitive cells it produced a rapid inactivation. according to these preliminary tests, different strains of enterococci produced compounds with slightly different antivibrio properties, and these compounds were heat-resistant and had a predominantly proteinaceous nature.
cloning and genetic organization of the bacteriocin 31 determinant encoded on the enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmid pyi17.
the conjugative plasmid pyi17 (57.5 kb) isolated from enterococcus faecalis yi717 confers a pheromone response on the host and encodes the bacteriocin 31 gene. bacteriocin 31 is active against e. hirae 9790, e. faecium, and listeria monocytogenes. pyi17 was mapped physically by restriction enzyme analysis and the relational clone method. deletion mutant and sequence analyses of the ecori fragment b cloned from pyl17 revealed that a 1.0-kb fragment contained the bacteriocin gene (baca) and an immunity gene (bacb). this fragment induced bacteriocin activity in e. faecalis og1x and e. hirae 9790. the baca gene is located on the pyi17 physical map between 3.37 and 3.57 kb, and bacb is located between 3.59 kb and 3.87 kb, baca encodes 67 amino acids, and bacb encodes 94 amino acids. the deduced amino acid sequence of the baca protein contained a series of hydrophobic residues typical of a signal sequence at its amino terminus. the predicted mature baca protein (43 amino acids) showed sequence homology with the membrane-active class ii bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria. analysis of tn5 insertion mutants and the resulting transcripts indicated that these genes are transcribed as an operon composed of baca, bacb, and an open reading frame located downstream of bacb designated orf3.
vancomycin-resistant enterococci. the 'superbug' scourge that's coming your way.
strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have emerged and spread widely  throughout the united states during the last few years. multiply-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium are especially troublesome because they are often resistant to all commercially available antimicrobial agents. at present, vre infections occur most often in hospitalized patients with severe underlying disease who have undergone invasive procedures and received prolonged courses of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. because therapeutic options are limited, prevention of spread from patients with known cases to other vulnerable patients is essential.
in vitro activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. u-100592 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and u-100766 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. mics were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective mics of u-100592 and u-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. most strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (vana, vanb, and vanc resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and m. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. the presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. the spontaneous mutation frequencies of s. aureus atcc 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for u-100592 and u-100766, respectively. serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.
unorthodox antibiotic combinations including ciprofloxacin against high-level gentamicin resistant enterococci.
development of high-level gentamicin resistance among enterococci represents a serious therapeutic problem as it precludes synergy between aminoglycosides and cell-wall active agents. as part of a search for active antibiotic combinations against enterococci with high-level gentamicin resistance, we tested by the time kill curve method the efficacy of ciprofloxacin combined with ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, vancomycin or teicoplanin against ten isolates of enterococcus faecium, three of enterococcus casseliflavus and 13 of enterococcus faecalis that exhibited a mic of gentamicin > or = 2000 mg/l. most of the e. faecium were also resistant to ampicillin and to ciprofloxacin. the combination of ciprofloxacin with ampicillin was bactericidal against five of seven e. faecium strains that exhibited a ciprofloxacin mic < or = 4 mg/l, but was inactive against the three e. faecium that were highly resistant to ciprofloxacin. this combination was also bactericidal against the e. casseliflavus and all the e. faecalis strains. the combination of ciprofloxacin with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was bactericidal against five of the seven e. faecium and seven of the nine e. faecalis strains with a ciprofloxacin mic < or = 4 mg/l. no bactericidal activity of this combination was seen against the enterococci that were highly resistant to either ciprofloxacin or to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. the combination of ciprofloxacin with glycopeptides was inactive against e. faecium and e. casseliflavus and against e. faecalis, it was either ineffective or antagonistic; in only one case it was bactericidal. five strains of e. faecium were resistant to all antibiotic combinations tested.
antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in the 1990s.
streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and klebsiella pneumoniae have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. this chapter reviews the epidemiology of this resistance, its detection in the laboratory, the mechanisms of resistance, and the options for therapy and infection control.
the challenge of vancomycin-resistant enterococci: a clinical and epidemiologic study.
background: vancomycin-resistant enterococci have been recovered with increasing  frequency from hospitalized patients. risk factors, mode of nosocomial transmission, extent of colonization in hospitalized patients, and treatment options for these organisms have not been completely delineated. methods: we studied 53 patients (group a) with vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from various clinical specimens and also surveyed for vancomycin-resistant enterococci in stool specimens submitted for clostridium difficile toxin assays (group b). stool specimens submitted for identification of bacterial pathogens and stool specimens from hospital employees were also analyzed for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. results: seventy-six isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were recovered in group a. five of these patients harbored vancomycin-resistant enterococci on admission. fifty-three of 289 group b stool specimens submitted for c. difficile toxin assays yielded vancomycin-resistant enterococci. cephalosporins and vancomycin were the most common antimicrobial agents received by both groups of patients. enterococcus faecium isolates were more resistant than enterococcus faecalis isolates to antimicrobial agents. all isolates exhibited high-level aminoglycoside resistance and were not beta-lactamase producers. there were at least 15 different molecular clones of e. faecium and three of e. faecalis. vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia was associated with a 100% in-hospital mortality rate. conclusions: multidrug-resistant and vancomycin-resistant enterococci have become important nosocomial pathogens that are difficult to treat. vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia was associated with a poor prognosis. we found a high rate of colonization in patients with suspected c. difficile toxin colitis. judicious use of vancomycin and broad-spectrum antibiotics is recommended, and strict infection control measures must be implemented to prevent nosocomial transmission of these organisms.
[nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for s. aureus and cns.
in vitro activity of rp 59500 (quinupristin/dalfopristin) against antibiotic-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci.
the activity of rp 59500 (quinupristin/dalfopristin) was evaluated in vitro against antibiotic-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 15) and enterococcus spp. (n = 43). by broth dilution mic tests rp 59500 was highly active against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, but showed poor activity against e. faecalis. in time-kill studies the drug was rapidly bactericidal against s. pneumoniae but failed to kill most enterococci, even in the presence of gentamicin or human serum.
epidemiologic analysis and genotypic characterization of a nosocomial outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
we are reporting on a nosocomial outbreak of 213 cases of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus infection involving 2,812 enterococcal isolates from patients over a period of 36 months. in 1990, the enterococcus faecium vancomycin susceptibility rate was found to be 85.7% (36 of 42 cases), and an incidence of 10.9% (42 of 383) was noted. the 1991 data showed e. faecium with a vancomycin susceptibility rate of 61.8% (110 of 178) and an incidence of 26.0% (178 of 684). subsequently, in 1992, the incidence of e. faecium increased to 34.0% (599 of 1,745), with a decreased vancomycin susceptibility rate of 25.8% (155 of 599). the e. faecalis vancomycin susceptibility rate remained near 97% (1,768 of 1,823) over the 36-month period. of 115 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) clinical isolates identified by the microscan mic combo-6 panels (baxter healthcare, sacramento, calif.), the agar dilution method indicated the resistance rate to be 92.3% (106 of 115) (high level), 3.5% (4 of 115) midlevel, and 3.5% (4 of 115) (low level). genotypic characterization of 32 different vre isolates by field-inversion gel electrophoresis demonstrated 19 dissimilar restriction endonuclease patterns, with 9 patterns associated with vre quinolone resistance. statistical analysis of case-control data for 32 patients with vre infections indicated a positive association with intrabdominal surgical procedures (odds ratio, 24.12), multidrug therapy (odds ratio, 37.80), preexposure to vancomycin (odds ratio, 20.21), and death (odds ratio, 17.50).
simple combined agar-strip test for detection of enterococcal susceptibility to ampicillin, moderate- or high-level gentamicin resistance and potential additive activity of ampicillin plus gentamicin.
a simple combined agar-strip test (cast), involving filter paper strips charged with 20 micrograms of ampicillin or 40 micrograms of gentamicin, accurately detected high-level gentamicin resistance among 43 of 146 isolates of enterococcus faecalis and additive activity of ampicillin plus gentamicin against 101 of 103 (98%) isolates of e. faecalis with moderate-level gentamicin resistance (mlgr). all 15 mlgr enterococcus faecium isolates were moderately to highly resistant to ampicillin; 5 isolates with moderate resistance to ampicillin (minimal inhibitory concentrations = 16 micrograms/ml) were additively inhibited by ampicillin plus gentamicin, whereas the highly ampicillin-resistant e. faecium isolates yielded an indifferent effect with the cast procedure.
use of the e test to predict high-level resistance to aminoglycosides among enterococci.
the e test and the reference agar dilution methods were compared for detecting high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) among 71 selected clinical isolates, including 62 enterococcus faecalis and 9 enterococcus faecium isolates. high-level gentamicin resistance alone was found in 11% (5 e. faecalis and 3 e. faecium strains) and high-level streptomycin resistance was found in 42% (28 e. faecalis, 2 e. faecium strains) of the strains tested, and 31% of the strains demonstrated high-level resistance to both antimicrobial agents (21 e. faecalis and 1 e. faecium strains). the e test detected all hlar populations, but the streptomycin strip may require recalibration to achieve absolute mic comparisons with the reference value (twofold less) or the use of an alternative interpretive resistance breakpoint, e.g., > 1,000 micrograms/ml. by the e test, mic results indicate that ampicillin, imipenem, penicillin, piperacillin, and vancomycin remain active against the hlar e. faecalis isolates; however, these tested drugs were less effective on the hlar e. faecium isolates (< 50%).
absence of synergistic activity between ampicillin and vancomycin against highly  vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
the emergence of clinical enterococcal isolates resistant to both ampicillin and  vancomycin is a cause of great concern, as there are few therapeutic alternatives for treatment of infections caused by such organisms. we evaluated the effects of the combination of ampicillin with vancomycin against vancomycin-resistant clinical enterococcal isolates. using both the checkerboard technique and time-kill curves, we examined 28 strains of enterococci (17 enterococcus faecalis and 11 enterococcus faecium strains) with different levels of resistance to vancomycin. of these, 15 strains were also highly gentamicin resistant, and 9 demonstrated resistance to ampicillin. only seven strains of e. faecalis were inhibited synergistically by the combination of vancomycin with ampicillin, and even then, the concentrations of vancomycin at which synergism was demonstrated were above levels achievable in serum. none of the ampicillin-resistant isolates (all e. faecium) were inhibited synergistically at any concentration of the drugs. in no instance was bactericidal synergism observed, and in most cases the combination resulted in less killing than with ampicillin alone. antagonism was not observed at clinically relevant concentrations. the results of this study suggest that the combination of vancomycin with ampicillin has little to offer against these emerging pathogens.
comparative in vitro activity of clarithromycin. spanish collaborative group.
the activity in vitro of clarithromycin, a new macrolide, was compared to that of various antibiotics in tests using 3,880 clinical isolates. clarithromycin was two times more active than erythromycin against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococci of groups c, g and f, brucella melitensis, legionella pneumophila and mycoplasma spp., 16 times more active against ureaplasma urealyticum and 2 to 4 times less active against campylobacter spp. in general, clarithromycin showed intrinsic activity 2 to 4 times higher than that of roxithromycin and 4 to 8 times higher than that of miocamycin. cross-resistance was found between the macrolides. clarithromycin was bactericidal against streptococcus spp. and haemophilus influenzae.
the activity of metal compounds against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of two metal compounds, jm-1397 (oso2[xylyl]2) and jm-2469 (aucl[s2cpet3]). both inhibited methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus at concentrations of 0.5-2 micrograms/ml, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) of 1 microgram/ml for jm-1397 and 0.5 microgram/ml for jm-2469. similar concentrations inhibited methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus). jm-2469 inhibited group a, b, c, f, and g beta-hemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci at 1-8 micrograms/ml (mic90 4 micrograms/ml) but enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium had mics of 8-16 micrograms/ml. jm-1397 had mics for these organisms of greater than 64 micrograms/ml. bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides, and clostridium species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.12-4 micrograms/ml (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). mics of both compounds for enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas spp. were greater than 64 micrograms/ml. these studies show that osmium and gold compounds have potential as topical agents against gram-positive and anaerobic species.
characterization and partial purification of a bacteriocin produced by leuconostoc carnosum la44a.
twenty leuconostoc strains isolated from vacuum packaged vienna-type sausages were screened for antagonistic activity against various gram-positive organisms (including listeria spp.). one of the three strains exhibiting inhibitory activity was chosen for further investigation. this strain was identified as leuc. carnosum and the inhibitory substance produced was named carnosin. carnosin was inactivated by trypsin but not by catalase or other non-proteolytic enzymes tested. carnosin retained activity after heating at 100 degrees c for 20 min, whereas heating at 121 degrees c for 15 min resulted in complete loss of activity. carnosin was active at ph values ranging from 2 to 9. carnosin activity was not detectable until cells were in the late log-phase of growth. at low temperatures (4 degrees c), higher cell densities were required before carnosin activity could be detected. carnosin was active against various lactic acid bacteria, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and against listeria spp. difficulties in purification were reduced by growing leuc. carnosum in a modified mrs medium, having 50% of the normal peptone concentration and no tween or meat extract. sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of partially purified carnosin indicated that it has a molecular mass between 2510 and 6000 da. yet, retention of activity after exhaustive dialysis suggested a molecular mass > 14kda. it is hypothesized that carnosin forms large active complexes which can be dissociated to small (active) components.
in vitro activity of decaplanin (m86-1410), a new glycopeptide antibiotic.
the in vitro activity of decaplanin (formerly m86-1410), a novel glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, was tested against 169 gram-positive bloodstream isolates from patients at the university of iowa hospitals and clinics and 12 selected vancomycin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, bacilli, corynebacteria, and listeria were inhibited by decaplanin (mics for 90% of the strains tested [mic90s], 0.12 to 4 micrograms/ml). however, some rarely isolated and selected enterococcus sp. populations had a mic90 of 16 micrograms/ml, and s. haemolyticus strains had a mic90 of 8 micrograms/ml. these in vitro results suggest that decaplanin may be useful against most gram-positive strains, even though some enterococcus species and coagulase-negative staphylococci were potentially resistant (mics, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml).
comparative in vitro activity of the new glycopeptide sk&f 104662 against problematic gram-positive bacteria.
the in vitro activity of the new glycopeptide antibiotic sk&f 104662 against problematic gram-positive microorganisms was determined using the agar dilution technique. for comparison, ampicillin, oxacillin, vancomycin, erythromycin and gentamicin were tested. sk&f 104662 was found to have high activity against staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (both methicillin sensitive and resistant strains), enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, corynebacterium jeikeium and corynebacterium group d2. all of 254 isolates, except one vancomycin-resistant strain of enterococcus faecium, were inhibited by 2 mg/l of sk&f 104662; this compound may thus be potentially useful in the treatment of infections with the above-mentioned gram-positive pathogens.
[clinical features of enterococcal septicemia and antimicrobial susceptibilities  for clinical isolates of enterococci in nagoya university hospital].
enterococci are important causative organisms of nosocomial infections as well as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. enterococcal bacteremia has been increased in nagoya university hospital from april 1983 to march 1990. we analyzed the clinical backgrounds, portal of entry and mortality for the patients with enterococcal septicemia. thirty-four cases with enterococcal septicemia (24 enterococcus faecalis, 10 enterococcus faecium) were subjected in this study. twenty-seven cases were monomicrobial septicemia and 7 cases were polymicrobial septicemia. as to the portal of entry, intra-abdominal infections in 21 cases, urinary tract infections in 4 cases, respiratory tract infections or chest tubes in 2 cases, decbitus infection in 1 case, intravascular catheter in 1 case, and unknown sources in 5 cases. total mortality of the septicemia was 44.1%. e. faecium and enterococcus avium were much more resistant to antimicrobial agents than e. faecalis. enterococci with high-level resistance to gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration, greater than 2000 micrograms/ml) accounted for 35% of the 26 clinical isolates of enterococci.
[antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp. against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.
[the influence of cefpirome on intestinal bacterial flora].
cefpirome (cpr, hr810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its effect on the intestinal bacterial flora in pediatric patients. the subjects were children admitted for infections (6 males and 3 females, 1 month to 5 years 1 month old, weighted 3.94 to 21.0 kg). cpr was intravenously administered at a dose between 19.0 to 40.0 mg/kg, 3 to 4 doses daily over 6 to 12 days. the feces from these children were collected before, during, and after administration, and bacteria were identified and counted. cpr concentration, beta-lactamase activity, and clostridium difficile d-1 antigen were also assayed. bacterial flora changes in feces during cpr administration showed some variance, but generally 5 cases out of the 9 showed a significant decrease in enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecalis among aerobic bacteria. the other 4 cases showed some transient decrease, but no significant change was observed. no significant changes were recognized for enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecium, and the total aerobic bacterial count decreased in a transient manner in only one patient. regarding anaerobic bacteria, bifidobacterium and eubactrium revealed a significant decrease, a transient decrease or no change from case to case. bacteroides showed little change in count. consequently, the total anaerobic bacteria count did not reveal a large change aside from 1 case in which bacteroides was not detected before administration and a significant decrease of other bacteria was noted. in no case, glucose nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli or fungi were found dominant. although c. difficile and c. difficile d-1 antigen were detected in 3 and 4 cases, respectively, there was no exact relationship between the number of c. difficile and the characteristics of the feces. cpr was detected in fecal samples from 6 cases during administration with concentrations ranging between 1.20 to 22.4 micrograms/g. high values of cpr tended to be found in specimens with low beta-lactamase activity in the feces. when drug sensitivities of the bacteria isolated from feces before and after administration were compared, higher levels of resistance were found in some bacteria such as enterococci and bacteroides during or after administration than before administration. the above results suggest that cpr is a drug with a relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora in children, but a particular attention is required for diarrhea and microbial replacement during a continuous, long-term administration of the drug.
effects of combinations of beta-lactams, daptomycin, gentamicin, and glycopeptides against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci.
activities of combinations of beta-lactams, daptomycin, gentamicin, teicoplanin,  and vancomycin against 11 clinical isolates of enterococcus faecium highly resistant to glycopeptides, three plasmid-cured derivatives, eight e. faecalis and e. faecium transconjugants, and two susceptible recipient strains were tested. a marked synergy between penicillins or imipenem and glycopeptides against the glycopeptide-resistant strains but not against the glycopeptide-susceptible strains was observed by the double-disk agar diffusion assay. the synergy of combinations of amoxicillin, imipenem, penicillin g, or piperacillin with vancomycin or teicoplanin against resistant strains was confirmed by the checkerboard technique. the fractional inhibitory concentration indexes were generally below 0.25, except for one strain of e. faecium resistant to high levels of penicillin g. however, the combinations were not bactericidal as tested by time-killing experiments, and high concentrations (64 micrograms/ml) of amoxicillin, penicillin g, or piperacillin combined with 8 micrograms of vancomycin or teicoplanin per ml tended to be antagonistic. addition of 4 micrograms of gentamicin per ml to these combinations enhanced their bactericidal effect, but they occasionally remained slightly less effective than beta-lactams associated with gentamicin. the combination of 10 micrograms of daptomycin per ml with gentamicin was bactericidal after 6 h against 11 glycopeptide-resistant strains.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
the enterococci: evidence of species-specific clinical and microbiologic heterogeneity.
investigations of the clinical role of enterococci have been limited largely to enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis and have not distinguished between the various species of enterococci. to characterize the full spectrum of enterococcal disease and to determine whether clinically important differences exist among infections and/or instances of colonization (infections/colonizations) by the various enterococcal species, cases of enterococcal infection/colonization diagnosed at the dallas veterans administration medical center (dvamc) in 1986 were reviewed. during this period, 220 enterococcus faecalis, 21 enterococcus faecium, 12 enterococcus avium, and no enterococcus durans isolates were identified in clinical specimens (other than stool) submitted to the dvamc microbiology laboratory. clinical characteristics of cases of infection/colonization by the three species of enterococci were similar and did not vary significantly when blood stream invasion occurred. nevertheless, mortality data and therapeutic response rates suggested differences in virulence of the three enterococcal species. enterococcal infections/colonizations (including bacteremia) frequently were polymicrobial. although enterobacteriaceae were the most common copathogens identified overall, staphylococcus aureus was the most common copathogen in bloodstream infections. e. avium was more resistant than e. faecalis or e. faecium to penicillin g and ampicillin and less resistant to most other antimicrobial agents. the results of this investigation suggest that enterococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that should not be treated as a single entity in clinical investigations.
comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
we have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. in-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. although pristinamycin's mean mic for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (mic greater than or equal to 3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin showed poor activity against haemophilus influenzae (mode mic 1.56 and mic90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. pristinamycin inhibited all nine clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. it was less effective against the bacteroides fragilis group: (mic90 3.12 mg/l). pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.
