TI  == preparative scale purification of fucosyl-n-acetylglucosamine disaccharides and their evaluation as potential prebiotics and antiadhesins.
AB  == fucosyl-n-acetylglucosamine disaccharides are important core structures that form part of human mucosal and milk glyco-complexes. we have previously shown that alfb and alfc alpha-l-fucosidases from lactobacillus casei are able to synthesize fucosyl-alpha-1,3--n-acetylglucosamine (fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac) and fucosyl-alpha-1,6-n-acetylglucosamine (fuc-alpha1,6-glcnac), respectively, in transglycosylation reactions. here, these reactions were performed in a semipreparative scale, and the produced disaccharides were purified. the maximum  yields obtained of fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac and fuc-alpha1,6-glcnac were 4.2 and 9.3 g/l, respectively. the purified fucosyl-disaccharides were then analyzed for their prebiotic effect in vitro using strains from the lactobacillus casei/paracasei/rhamnosus group and from bifidobacterium species. the results revealed that 6 out of 11 l. casei strains and 2 out of 6 l. rhamnosus strains tested were able to ferment fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac, and l. casei bl87 and l. rhamnosus bl327 strains were also able to ferment fuc-alpha1,6-glcnac. dna hybridization experiments suggested that the metabolism of fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac in those strains relies in an alpha-l-fucosidase homologous to alfb. bifidobacterium breve and bibidobacterium pseudocatenolatum species also metabolized fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac. notably, l-fucose was excreted from all the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains fermenting fucosyl-disaccharides, except from strains l. rhamnosus bl358 and bl377, indicating that in these latest strains, l-fucose was catabolized. the fucosyl-disaccharides were also tested for their inhibitory  potential of pathogen adhesion to human colon adenocarcinoma epithelial (ht29) cell line. enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) strains isolated from infantile gastroenteritis were used, and the results showed that both fucosyl-disaccharides inhibited adhesion to different extents of certain epec strains to ht29 cells in tissue culture.

TI  == a novel lactobacillus casei lp1 producing 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, a bifidogenic growth stimulator.
AB  == 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (dhna) is a bifidogenic growth stimulator (bgs) and could be a functional food ingredient since bifidobacteria are beneficial for human health. for that reason, lactic acid bacteria producing dhna have been screened. a lactic acid bacterium lp1 strain isolated from a natural cheese was confirmed to produce dhna, analyzed by a hplc method. the strain was identified as lactobacillus casei by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the cell-free supernatant of fermented whey produced by l. casei lp1 presented the bgs activity for three bifidobacterial strains such as bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis  kctc 3127, bifidobacterium bifidum kctc 3202, and bifidobacterium breve kctc 3220 which were human-originated. to the best of our knowledge, a l. casei strain which can produce dhna was firstly identified in this study.

TI  == evaluation of culture media for selective enumeration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to test the suitability of transgalactosylated oligosaccharides-mupirocin lithium salt (tos-mup) and mrs-clindamycin-ciprofloxacin (mrs-cc) agars, along with several other culture media, for selectively enumerating bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria (lab)  species commonly used to make fermented milks. pure culture suspensions of a total of 13 dairy bacteria strains, belonging to eight species and five genera, were tested for growth capability under various incubation conditions. tos-mup agar was successfully used for the selective enumeration of both bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and b. breve m-16 v. mrs-cc agar showed relatively good selectivity for lactobacillus acidophilus, however, it also promoted the growth of lb. casei strains. for this reason, mrs-cc agar can only be used as a selective medium for the enumeration of lb. acidophilus if lb. casei is not present in a product at levels similar to or exceeding those of lb. acidophilus.  unlike bifidobacteria and coccus-shaped lab, all the lactobacilli strains involved in this work were found to grow well in mrs ph 5.4 agar incubated under  anaerobiosis at 37 degrees c for 72 h. therefore, this method proved to be particularly suitable for the selective enumeration of lactobacillus spp.

TI  == synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == aim: infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. in a randomised clinical  trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. methods: fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion cfu of: lactobacillus casei, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, l. acidophilus, b. infantis, l. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (protexin healthcare, somerset, uk), or placebo daily for 30 days. parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. the primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). results: the treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic  group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (p < 0.005). at day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (p < 0.01). symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (p < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, p = 0.24). we encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. conclusion: this synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus fos) significantly improved  colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.

TI  == thermostability of probiotics and their alpha -galactosidases and the potential for bean products.
AB  == soybeans and other pulses contain oligosaccharides which may cause intestinal disturbances such as flatulence. this study was undertaken to investigate alpha -galactosidase-producing probiotics added to frozen foods which can survive warming treatments used in thawing and consumption of the pulses. the maximum alpha -galactosidase activity (1.26 u/mg protein) was found in bifidobacterium breve s46. lactobacillus casei had the highest alpha -galactosidase thermostability among the various strains, with d values of 35, 29, and 9.3 minutes at 50 degrees c, 55 degrees c, and 60 degrees c, respectively. the enzyme activity was less affected than viable cells by heating. however, the d values of two bacterial enzymes were lower than those of three commercial alpha -galactosidase-containing products. freshly grown cells and their enzymes were more stable than the rehydrated cultures and their enzymes. practical application. enzymes and cultures can be added to foods in order to enhance the digestibility of carbohydrates in the gastrointestinal tract. however since many  foods are warmed, it is important that the thermostability of the enzymes be assessed. this paper provides data on the stability of alpha -galactosidase, which could potentially be added to food matrices containing stachyose or raffinose, such as beans.

TI  == antipathogenic activity of probiotics against salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies  in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  == probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: lactobacillus casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), lactobacillus acidophilus ncimb 30184 (pxn 35), bifidobacterium breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera on the survival of salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile using ph-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on  probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). there was also a significant reduction in s. typhimurium and c. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely l. casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), and b. breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of s. typhimurium and c. difficile. in addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally  detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.

TI  == effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: we are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. objective: this study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. methods: this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. the multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) cfu), l. casei (7 x 10(9) cfu), l. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), l. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) cfu), bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) cfu), b. longum (7 x 10(9) cfu), streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (gsh). results: between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (fpg) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in fpg (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group  and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. we observed a significant increase in homa-ir (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). mean changes in serum hs-crp were significantly different between the two  groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group,  p = 0.02). probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma gsh  levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). conclusion:  in conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in fpg and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-crp and an increase in plasma total gsh.

TI  == a stand-alone synbiotic treatment for the prevention of d-lactic acidosis in short bowel syndrome.
AB  == synbiotics are combinations of probiotics and prebiotics that have recently been  used in the context of various gastrointestinal diseases, including infectious enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and bowel obstruction. we encountered a patient with recurrent d-lactic acidosis who was treated successfully for long periods using synbiotics. the patient was diagnosed as having short bowel syndrome and had recurrent episodes of neurologic dysfunction due to d-lactic acidosis. in addition to fasting, the patient had been treated with antibiotics to eliminate d-lactate-producing bacteria. after the failure of antibiotic treatment, a stand-alone synbiotic treatment was started, specifically bifidobacterium breve yakult and lactobacillus casei shirota as probiotics, and galacto-oligosaccharide as a prebiotic. serum d-lactate levels declined, and the  patient has been recurrence-free for 3 years without dietary restriction. synbiotics allowed the reduction in colonic absorption of d-lactate by both prevention of d-lactate-producing bacterial overgrowth and stimulation of intestinal motility, leading to remission of d-lactate acidosis.

TI  == epithelial cell proliferation arrest induced by lactate and acetate from lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium breve.
AB  == in an attempt to identify and characterize how symbiotic bacteria of the gut microbiota affect the molecular and cellular mechanisms of epithelial homeostasis, intestinal epithelial cells were co-cultured with either lactobacillus or bifidobacterium as bona fide symbionts to examine potential gene modulations. in addition to genes involved in the innate immune response, genes encoding check-point molecules controlling the cell cycle were among the most modulated in the course of these interactions. in the m-iccl2 murine cell line, genes encoding cyclin e1 and cyclin d1 were strongly down regulated by l. casei and b. breve respectively. cell proliferation arrest was accordingly confirmed. short chain fatty acids (scfa) were the effectors of this modulation, alone or in conjunction with the acidic ph they generated. these results demonstrate that the production of scfas, a characteristic of these symbiotic microorganisms, is potentially an essential regulatory effector of epithelial proliferation in the gut.

TI  == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in  cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61;  -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a  clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions:  some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  == effects of probiotic bacteria on candida presence and iga anti-candida in the oral cavity of elderly.
AB  == imbalance in the resident microbiota may promote the growth of opportunistic microorganisms, such as yeasts of candida genus and the development of diseases,  especially in aged people. this study evaluated whether the consumption of the probiotic yakult lbz((r)) (lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium breve) was able to influence on the specific immunological response against candida and on the presence of these yeasts in the oral cavity of 42 healthy aged individuals. saliva samples were collected before and after the probiotic use for 30 days, 3 times a week. the samples were plated in dextrose saboraud agar with chloramphenicol, the colony-forming units (cfu/ml) were counted and the candida species were identified. anti-candida iga analysis was conducted using the elisa  technique. anova and student's t-test were used for normally distributed data and the wilcoxon test was used for data with non-normal distribution (alpha=0.05). the results showed a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) in candida prevalence (from 92.9% to 85.7%), in cfu/ml counts of candida and in the number of non-albicans species after consumption of the probiotic. immunological analysis demonstrated a significant increase (p<0.05) in anti-candida iga levels. in conclusion, probiotic bacteria reduced candida numbers in the oral cavity of the elderly and increased specific secretory immune response against these yeasts, suggesting its possible use in controlling oral candidosis.

TI  == early-life gut bacteria associate with il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma production at  two years of age.
AB  == microbial exposure early in life influences immune maturation and potentially also the development of immune-mediated disease. here we studied early-life gut colonization in relation to cytokine responses at two years of age. fecal samples were collected from infants during the first two months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, a group of lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as  well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus were detected with real time pcr. peripheral mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and numbers of il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma secreting cells were evaluated using elispot. we further stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants in vitro and assessed the il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma inducing capacity by flow cytometry and elisa. early s. aureus colonization associated with higher numbers  of il-4- (p = 0.022) and il-10 (p = 0.016) producing cells at two years of age. in contrast to colonization with s. aureus alone, co-colonization with lactobacilli associated with suppression of il-4- (p = 0.004), il-10- (p = 0.004) and ifn-gamma (p = 0.034) secreting cells. in vitro stimulations of mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants supported a suppressive role of l. rhamnosus gg on s. aureus-induced cytokine responses. we demonstrate that the early gut colonization pattern associates with the pha-induced cytokine profile at two years of age and our in vitro findings support that specific bacterial species influence the t helper cell subsets. this suggests that dysbiosis in the early microbiota may modulate the risk of developing inflammatory conditions like allergy.

TI  == probiotic bifidobacterium breve induces il-10-producing tr1 cells in the colon.
AB  == specific intestinal microbiota has been shown to induce foxp3(+) regulatory t cell development. however, it remains unclear how development of another regulatory t cell subset, tr1 cells, is regulated in the intestine. here, we analyzed the role of two probiotic strains of intestinal bacteria, lactobacillus  casei and bifidobacterium breve in t cell development in the intestine. b. breve, but not l. casei, induced development of il-10-producing tr1 cells that express cmaf, il-21, and ahr in the large intestine. intestinal cd103(+) dendritic cells  (dcs) mediated b. breve-induced development of il-10-producing t cells. cd103(+)  dcs from il10(-/-), tlr2(-/-), and myd88(-/-) mice showed defective b. breve-induced tr1 cell development. b. breve-treated cd103(+) dcs failed to induce il-10 production from co-cultured il27ra(-/-) t cells. b. breve treatment  of tlr2(-/-) mice did not increase il-10-producing t cells in the colonic lamina  propria. thus, b. breve activates intestinal cd103(+) dcs to produce il-10 and il-27 via the tlr2/myd88 pathway thereby inducing il-10-producing tr1 cells in the large intestine. oral b. breve administration ameliorated colitis in immunocompromised mice given naive cd4(+) t cells from wild-type mice, but not il10(-/-) mice. these findings demonstrate that b. breve prevents intestinal inflammation through the induction of intestinal il-10-producing tr1 cells.

TI  == modulation of toll-like receptor ligands and candida albicans-induced cytokine responses by specific probiotics.
AB  == probiotics have been proposed as modulators of gut inflammation, especially in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). in order to be able to use them in these clinical conditions, their capacity to modulate immune responses towards other stimuli or microorganisms has to be thoroughly understood. in the present study,  three different potentially probiotic strains, bifidobacterium breve (numres 204), lactobacillus rhamnosus (numres1) and lactobacillus casei (dn-114 001), have been studied for their potential to modulate responses to stimulation with pure pattern-recognition receptor (prr) ligands or to the gut commensal fungus candida albicans. cytokine production induced by prr ligands or c. albicans was assessed in conditions of simultaneous stimulation or preincubation of primary immune cells with bifidobacterium or lactobacillus spp. results indicate that simultaneous stimulation leads to potentiation of il-1beta and il-6 production, while the tnfalpha and ifn-gamma production was inhibited. in settings of pre-incubation with these potentially probiotic strains, lower production of tnfalpha was observed in the presence of b. breve. moreover, c. albicans-induced  il-17 production was decreased after pre-incubation with both bifidobacterium or  lactobacillus probiotic strains. whereas c. albicans induced cytokines are dampened by the tested probiotic strains, tnfalpha and il-6 production by pure pattern-recognition receptor ligands are potentiated. interestingly, an important role of toll-like receptor 9 signalling that involves jnk kinase in the modulatory effects of these probiotic strains has been identified. in conclusion, specific probiotic strains exhibit cross-tolerance effects towards other inflammatory stimuli, especially c. albicans, which might have beneficial effects on gut inflammation.

TI  == beneficial effects of long-term consumption of a probiotic combination of lactobacillus casei shirota and bifidobacterium breve yakult may persist after suspension of therapy in lactose-intolerant patients.
AB  == background: the efficacy of some probiotic strains for the management of lactose  intolerance remains to be established. aim: to evaluate the effects of a 4-week consumption of a probiotic product containing lactobacillus casei shirota and bifidobacterium breve yakult (10(7)-10(9) cfu of each strain) on symptoms and breath hydrogen exhalation after a lactose load in lactose-intolerant patients and whether the beneficial results persisted after probiotic discontinuation. methods: twenty-seven patients with lactose maldigestion and intolerance participated in this study, which comprised 4 hydrogen breath tests: baseline condition (20 g lactose), after lactase ingestion (9000 fcc units), at the end of 4-week probiotic supplementation, and a follow-up test performed 3 months after probiotic discontinuation. for each test, the area under the breath hydrogen concentration vs time curve (auc(180 min)) was calculated, and symptom scores were recorded. results: the probiotic combination significantly reduced symptom scores (p < .01) and breath hydrogen auc (p = .04) compared with the baseline condition. the comparison with the lactase test showed that symptom scores were similar (p > .05), despite the significantly higher (p = .01) auc values after probiotic use. in the follow-up test, symptom scores and breath hydrogen auc values remained similar to those found at the end of probiotic intervention. conclusion: four-week consumption of a probiotic combination of l casei shirota and b breve yakult seems to improve symptoms and decrease hydrogen production intake in lactose-intolerant patients. these effects may persist for at least 3 months after suspension of probiotic consumption.

TI  == the effect of lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium breve on antibiotic-associated diarrhea treatment: randomized double-blind clinical trial.
AB  == introduction: antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) is an important side effect of this specific class of drugs. the objective of this study was to investigate the  effect of the use of probiotics in the treatment of aad. methods: a group of hospitalized patients, who contracted diarrhea during or after 7 days of suspension of antimicrobial medication, was blindly randomized to receive a standardized diet associated with the use of the probiotics (lactobacillus casei  and bifidobacterium breve) or its corresponding placebo, three times a day. results: seventy patients were studied. for the experimental (n=35) and control (n=35) groups, respectively, the average time of treatment was 5.06+/-2.18 and 5.49+/-3.17 days (p=0.95), and the average duration of diarrhea, among those who  were healed, was 4.87+/-2.13 and 4.52+/-2.55 days (p=0.36). four (11.4%) patients who received probiotics and ten (28.6%) who received the placebo were not cured (p=0.13), and relapse rates were similar between both groups. seven patients from each group, in addition to diarrhea, presented cases of bloating and/or abdominal cramps and/or vomiting (p=1.00). conclusions: in this light, it is concluded that l. casei associated with b. breve, in the administered dosage and frequency, has  no effect on the antibiotic-associated diarrhea. similar studies need to be conducted with higher doses of these or other probiotics.

TI  == effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  == food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. this study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape  seed extract (gse) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a gse fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (gse-m). on the other hand, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the gse fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (gse-o) fraction. within bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium lactis bb12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas bifidobacterium breve 26m2  and bifidobacterium bifidum hdd541 reached maximum growth in presence of gse-o and gse-m fractions. metabolism of flavan-3-ols by lab and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. the results revealed that only l. plantarum ifpl935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that  led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. an unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also  detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in l. plantarum ifpl935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

AB  == the use of probiotics as a food supplement has gained tremendous interest in the  last few years as beneficial effects were reported in gut homeostasis and nutrient absorption but also in immunocompromised patients, supporting protection from colonization or infection with pathogenic bacteria or fungi. as a treatment  approach for inflammatory bowel diseases, a suitable probiotic strain would ideally be one with a low immunogenic potential. insight into the immunogenicities and types of t-cell responses induced by potentially probiotic strains allows a more rational selection of a particular strain. in the present study, the bacterial strains bifidobacterium breve (numres 204), lactobacillus rhamnosus (numres1), and lactobacillus casei (dn-114 001) were compared concerning their capacity to induce inflammatory responses in terms of cytokine production by human and mouse primary immune cells. it was demonstrated that the  b. breve strain induced lower levels of the proinflammatory cytokine gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) than the tested l. rhamnosus and l. casei strains. both b. breve and lactobacilli induced cytokines in a toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9)-dependent manner, while the lower inflammatory profile of b. breve was due to inhibitory effects of tlr2. no role for tlr4, nod2, and c-type lectin receptors was apparent. in conclusion, tlr signaling is involved in the differentiation of inflammatory responses between probiotic strains used as food  supplements.

TI  == efficacy of bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus casei oral supplementation on necrotizing enterocolitis in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants: a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.
AB  == background: probiotics are used for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) because of their positive effects on intestinal motor function, modulation  of inflammatory response, and mucosal barrier function. objective: the objective  was to assess whether the combined use of lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium breve may prevent the occurrence of nec stage >/= 2 by the criteria of bell in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants. design: a double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted in 231 preterm infants weighing from 750  to 1499 g at birth. the intervention group was composed of 119 infants who received human milk with probiotic supplementation (b. breve and l. casei) and a  control group of 112 infants who received human milk containing no probiotics. the primary outcome was the occurrence of nec stage >/= 2 as defined by bell's modified criteria. results: four confirmed cases of nec stage >/= 2 by bell's criteria occurred only in the control group. conclusions: oral supplementation of b. breve and l. casei reduced the occurrence of nec (bell's stage >/= 2). it was  considered that an improvement in intestinal motility might have contributed to this result. this trial was registered at www.isrctin.org as number 67165178 (international standard randomized controlled trial).

TI  == effects of synbiotic treatment on serum level of p-cresol in haemodialysis patients: a preliminary study.
AB  == background: para-cresol, which is present in the blood mainly as p-cresyl sulphate, is a protein-bound uraemic toxin that is produced in the intestine by certain intestinal bacteria, and its production is affected by various intestinal environmental factors. patients with end-stage renal disease who are undergoing haemodialysis (hd) often have defective bowel function leading to abnormal defecation. since treatment with synbiotics (syn), which are a combination of probiotics and prebiotics, is reported to improve bowel habit, we examined the effects of syn on the serum p-cresol level in hd patients. methods: nine hd patients received syn (lactobacillus casei strain shirota and bifidobacterium breve strain yakult as probiotics and galacto-oligosaccharides as prebiotics) three times a day for 2 weeks. the duration of the study was 4 weeks (2 weeks of  pretreatment observation and 2 weeks of treatment). the subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire about their bowel habits (defecation frequency, stool quantity, stool form and ease of defecation) during the study period. serum p-cresol levels before and after syn treatment were determined. results: according to the questionnaire conducted during the pretreatment observation period, hd patients with a high serum p-cresol level tended to have hard stools with difficulty in defecation. with syn treatment, stool quantity increased significantly and hard, muddy or soft stools tended to be replaced by normal ones. the serum p-cresol level also decreased significantly. conclusions: it was  found that uraemic toxin, p-cresol, was associated with constipation and that syn treatment resulted in normalization of bowel habits and a decrease of serum p-cresol levels in hd patients. therefore, syn treatment may be anticipated to reduce the toxic effect of p-cresol in hd patients.

TI  == the influence of some probiotic supernatants on the growth and virulence features expression of several selected enteroaggregative e. coli clinical strains.
AB  == the purpose of this study was the assessment of the influence of three probiotic  supernatants (bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700, enterococcus faecium atcc 19434,  lactobacillus casei subsp. casei atcc 393) on the growth (quantified by viable cell counts) and virulence features expression (adherence ability to hep-2 cells  and inert substratum- slime test) of several selected eaggec diarrhoeagenic strains as well as the cytotoxicity of the respective supernatants on hep-2 cells. results: our in vitro studies are demonstrating that the selected supernatants, when added simultaneously with the bacterial culture are generally  opposing to the adherence to the cellular substratum by the eaggec strains. when  added after the pre-adherence period, the supernatants did not change the adherence indexes of the eaggec strains, but induced slight changes in the adherence pattern, reducing the frequency and size of bacterial aggregates. only  in few cases, the bacterial growth rate was slightly increased or sustained by the probiotic supernatants, a possible explanation being that we used supernatants obtained from 24 hrs fresh cultures, which are probably still containing some nutrients and probably also other growth factors. conclusion: our results are demonstrating that soluble probiotic metabolites accumulated in culture supernatants may interfere with the first step of adherence and colonization of the cellular and inert substrata by eaggec strains, probablyby the cross-talk between probiotic soluble molecules and quorum-sensing mediators of opportunistic strains; so, direct contact between the probiotic and pathogenic bacteria are not always necessary for the occurrence of a protective effect, that could be partly mediated by the soluble molecules secreted by specific probiotic  strains.

TI  == oral administration of probiotic bacteria, lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium breve, does not exacerbate neurological symptoms in experimental  autoimmune encephalomyelitis.
AB  == to evaluate the safety of two probiotic bacterial strains, lactobacillus casei strain shirota (lcs) and bifidobacterium breve strain yakult (bby), these probiotics were orally administered to lewis rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae), the experimental model of human multiple sclerosis. we examined three experimental designs by combining different antigen types and probiotic administration periods: (1) eae was induced with a homogenate of guinea pig spinal cord as the sensitizing antigen, and lcs was orally administered from  one week before this sensitization until the end of the experiment; (2) eae was induced using guinea pig originated myelin basic protein (mbp) as the sensitizing antigen, and lcs was orally administered from one week before this sensitization  to the end of the experiment; (3) eae was induced using guinea pig mbp as the sensitizing antigen, and the probiotic strains (lcs and bby) were administered starting in infancy (two weeks old) and continued until the end of the experiment. in experiment 1, oral administration of lcs tended to suppress the development of neurological symptoms. differences in neurological symptoms between the control group and the administration groups did not reach statistical significance in experiments 2 and 3. these results support the notion that neither lcs nor bby exacerbates autoimmune disease.

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == early use of probiotics is important therapy in infants with severe congenital anomaly.
AB  == background: infants with severe congenital anomaly often need to undergo operation followed by antibiotic therapy. as a result they inevitably acquire abnormal intestinal microbiota, which cause severe infections such as necrotizing enterocolitis. also, intestinal function deteriorates and their nutritional state is very poor. in order to prevent these situations probiotic therapy is proposed  as an effective supporting treatment. probiotic therapy were therefore applied to infants with severe congenital anomaly as early as possible to ascertain its efficacy. methods: as probiotics, two bacteria were used: bifidobacterium breve yakult and lactobacillus casei shirota. probiotic therapy was used in four infants with severe congenital anomaly as early as possible after surgery. their  intestinal microbiota and physical growth were followed through the treatment course. results: two patients suffered from meconium peritonitis with ileal atresia. one patient was born with complex anomalies (omphalocele, bladder exstrophy, myelomeningocele). the fourth patient suffered from complete urorectal septum malformation. the intestinal microbiota of these four patients was first induced to be probiotic dominant and finally changed to commensal anaerobe dominant that was similar to normal intestinal microbiota. pathogenic bacteria were seldom detected. the patients' physical growth was excellent despite short bowel and pulmonary hypoplasia. conclusion: probiotic therapy was effective in inducing probiotic dominant intestinal microbiota and normal intestinal microbiota in infants with severe congenital anomalies. as a result their intestinal absorptive functions were activated and severe infections were completely prevented. all of the infants grew well despite their physical disadvantages.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus casei and bifidobacterium breve on urinary oxalate excretion in nephrolithiasis patients.
AB  == it had been suggested that lactic acid bacteria (lab) may degrade oxalate in the  intestinal lumen, reducing urinary oxalate excretion. we aimed to evaluate the effect of a lab mixture containing lactobacillus casei (lc) and bifidobacterium breve (bb) (lc + bb) upon urinary oxalate reduction in stone-forming (sf) patients without hyperoxaluria under conditions of an oxalate-rich diet. after an oxalate restriction period (7 days washout), 14 sf patients consumed an oxalate-rich diet during 4 weeks (200 mg/day) and a lyophilized lc + bb preparation was given t.i.d. after meals during the last 2 weeks. twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected for determination of oxalate, calcium, magnesium, citrate, sodium, potassium and creatinine at baseline, after  2 weeks (diet) and 4 weeks (diet + lc + bb). the mean urinary oxalate excretion was significantly higher after diet versus baseline (27 +/- 8 vs. 35 +/- 11 mg/24 h), but the mean decrease was not significant between diet + lc + bb and diet periods (35 +/- 11 vs. 33 +/- 10 mg/24 h). seven out of 14 patients presented a reduction in oxaluria after lc + bb versus diet, being the reduction higher than  25% in 4, and up to 50% in 2 of them. the latter two patients were those who had  presented the greatest increase in oxaluria in response to dietary oxalate. in conclusion, this mixture of l. casei and b. breve was shown to possess a variable lowering effect upon urinary oxalate excretion that may be dependent on dietary oxalate intake.

TI  == synbiotics decrease the incidence of septic complications in patients with severe sirs: a preliminary report.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate if synbiotic therapy can correct the deteriorated gut flora and environment in patients with severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs). twenty-nine sirs patients, who fulfilled a serum c-reactive protein (crp) level >10 mg/dl, received synbiotics (bifidobacterium breve, lactobacillus casei, and galactooligosaccharides) (s group) and were compared with previous observations in 26 patients without synbiotics (ns group). analysis of fecal flora confirmed that patients in the s group had significantly greater levels of beneficial bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, and total organic acids (particularly short-chain fatty acids) than those in the ns group. the incidence of infectious complications such as enteritis, pneumonia, and bacteremia was significantly lower in the s group than  in the ns group. synbiotics maintain the gut flora and environment and decrease the incidence of septic complications in patients with severe sirs. further randomized controlled study is necessary to determine the effects of synbiotics.

TI  == effect of probiotics, bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus casei, on bisphenol a exposure in rats.
AB  == bisphenol a (bpa), a putative endocrine disruptor, may be taken up by humans via  the diet and have adverse effects on human health. in this study, we evaluated whether the probiotics, bifidobacterium breve strain yakult (bby) and lactobacillus casei strain shirota (lcs), could exert a protective effect against dietary exposure to bpa. a group of rats fed on a diet containing 5% bby or 5% lcs showed three advantageous effects compared to the control group; (i) the area under the blood concentration-time curve of bpa after its oral administration was significantly decreased, (ii) the amount of bpa excreted in the feces was significantly greater (2.4 times), and (iii) the percentage of bpa bound to the sediment fraction of the feces was significantly higher. these results suggest that bby and lcs reduced the intestinal absorption by facilitating the excretion  of bpa, and that these probiotics may suppress the adverse effects of bpa on human health.

TI  == differential effects of two probiotic strains with different bacteriological properties on intestinal gene expression, with special reference to indigenous bacteria.
AB  == probiotics are used for the improvement of gut disorders. to explore the potential of probiotics, a gnotobiotic study using balb/c mice to analyze epithelial gene expression was performed. microarray analysis of probiotic strain-monoassociated mice showed that lactobacillus casei shirota and bifidobacterium breve yakult noticeably affected gene expression in the ileal and colonic epithelial cells, respectively, although to a smaller extent than segmented filamentous bacteria (sfb). lactobacillus casei shirota enhanced the gene expression involving defense/immune functions and lipid metabolism more strongly than b. breve yakult. in the colon, expression of a chloride transporter was slightly enhanced, although downregulation of many genes, such as guanine nucleotide-binding protein, was evident in mice with b. breve yakult compared with the ones with l. casei shirota. sfb affected gene expression more strongly than the probiotic strains. in particular, alpha(1-2) fucosyltransferase and pancreatitis-associated protein were significantly enhanced only in sfb-monoassociated mice but not probiotic strain-monoassociated mice. gene expression of sfb-monoassociated mice was either stimulated or repressed in a manner similar to or opposite that of conventional colonized mice. taken together, probiotic strains of l. casei shirota and b. breve yakult differentially affect epithelial gene expression in the small intestine and colon, respectively.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus casei shirota, bifidobacterium breve, and oligofructose-enriched inulin on colonic nitrogen-protein metabolism in healthy humans.
AB  == pre- and/or probiotics can cause changes in the ecological balance of intestinal  microbiota and hence influence microbial metabolic activities. in the present study, the influence of oligofructose-enriched inulin (of-in), lactobacillus casei shirota, and bifidobacterium breve yakult on the colonic fate of nh3 and p-cresol was investigated. a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study was  performed in 20 healthy volunteers to evaluate the influence of short- and long-term administration of of-in, l. casei shirota, b. breve yakult, and the synbiotic l. casei shirota + of-in. the lactose[15n,15n]ureide biomarker was used to study the colonic fate of nh3. urine and fecal samples were analyzed for 15n content by combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometery and for p-cresol content by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. rt-pcr was applied to determine the levels of total bifidobacteria. both short- and long-term administration of of-in resulted in significantly decreased urinary p-cresol and 15n content. the reduction of urinary 15n excretion after short-term of-in intake was accompanied  by a significant increase in the 15n content of the fecal bacterial fraction. however, this effect was not observed after long-term of-in intake. in addition,  rt-pcr results indicated a significant increase in total fecal bifidobacteria after long-term of-in intake. long-term l. casei shirota and b. breve yakult intake showed a tendency to decrease urinary 15n excretion, whereas a significant decrease was noted in p-cresol excretion. in conclusion, dietary addition of of-in, l. casei shirota, and b. breve yakult results in a favorable effect on colonic nh3 and p-cresol metabolism, which, in the case of of-in, was accompanied by an increase in total fecal bifidobacteria.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

AB  == background/purpose: probiotic and prebiotic therapies are potent new strategies to treat various intestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and viral and bacterial infections. synbiotics is defined as the combined use of probiotics and prebiotics and is expected to have a stronger effect on intestinal diseases than probiotics or prebiotics alone, but there has been no report of its clinical application. the authors designed a protocol for synbiotic therapy composed of bifidobacterium breve, lactobacillus casei, and galactooligosaccharides and preliminarily ascertained its clinical effects in humans. methods: this protocol of synbiotic therapy was applied for more than 1 year to 7 malnourished patients with short bowels who suffered from refractory enterocolitis. results: the therapeutic protocol improved the intestinal bacterial flora (inducing the domination by anaerobic bacteria and suppressing the residence of pathogenic bacteria) and increased short chain fatty acids in the feces (from 27.8 to 65.09 micromol/g wet feces). all patients but 1 accelerated their body weight gain, and 5 patients showed increased serum rapid turnover proteins. conclusions: this protocol for synbiotic therapy might be a potent modulator of intestinal flora and a promising strategy to treat short bowel patients with refractory enterocolitis.

TI  == glucose but not polypeptone reduces the effect of probiotic preparations to stimulate carbohydrate breakdown and reduce net ammonia production by pig cecal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == probiotic preparations are used to prevent or treat diarrhea. probiotic preparations increase the in vitro breakdown of carbohydrates and decrease that of protein by mixed cecal bacteria in the absence of readily fermentable materials. diarrhea can increase the influx of readily digestible materials into  the large intestine. therefore, we compared production of organic acids and ammonia in batch cultures using pig cecal contents with or without probiotic preparations (clostridium butyricum, lactobacillus casei plus bifidobacterium breve, or l. casei plus enterococcus faecalis) and with or without readily fermentable substrates (glucose or polypeptone). effects of additional substrates appeared earlier than those of probiotic preparations. both probiotic preparations and glucose increased the production of most short-chain fatty acids and lactic acid but decreased those of ammonia and isovaleric acid. effects of probiotic preparations and glucose were not additive. effects of different preparations were alike. polypeptone increased the production of ammonia and isovaleric acid independent of probiotic preparations. effects of probiotics and  glucose may be to provide either energy or carbon to the microbial ecosystem. effects of glucose were probably mediated through their direct utilization by indigenous bacteria.

AB  == in this study, the effects of orally administered viable lactobacillus casei shirota strain yit9029 on the immunity parameters of wistar and brown norway rats were examined. for this purpose, we used the trichinella spiralis host resistance model. two weeks before and during t. spiralis infection, rats were fed 10(9) viable l. casei bacteria 5 days per week. the t. spiralis-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (dth) response was significantly enhanced in both wistar and brown norway rats given l. casei. in both rat strains fed l. casei, serum t. spiralis-specific immunoglobulin g2b (igg2b) concentrations were also significantly increased. in the model, no significant effects of l. casei on larval counts or inflammatory reactions in the tongue musculature, body weights,  or lymphoid organ weights were observed. serum specific antibody responses, other than igg2b, were not changed by feeding of l. casei. in contrast to l. casei, it  was shown that orally administered bifidobacterium breve or bifidobacterium bifidum had no influence on the measured infection and immunity indices in the rat infection model. since the rat dth response is considered to be a manifestation of th1 cell-mediated immunity and the igg2b isotype has been associated with th1 activity, it was concluded that th1 cells could play an active role in the immunomodulatory effects of orally administered l. casei. furthermore, our data do not indicate that the effect of oral supplementation with l. casei is dependent on the genetic background of the host.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
AB  == the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.

TI  == immunomodulatory function of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == using mice, we found that oral administration of bifidobacterium breve yit4064 (b. breve) activated the humoral immune system, augmented anti-rotavirus iga production or anti-influenza virus (ifv) igg production and protected against rotavirus infection or influenza infection, respectively. furthermore, when the b. breve was given to infants from an infant home, there was a significant reduction of the frequency of rotavirus shedding in stool samples during the administration of the bacteria. it was also found, again using mice, that oral administration of lactobacillus casei strain shirota (lcs) stimulated type 1 helper t (th1) cells, activated the cellular immune system and inhibited incidence of tumors and ige production. these results demonstrated that these two strains of lactic acid bacteria modulated the different immune systems each in its own way and prevented against various diseases.

TI  == increased growth of bifidobacterium and eubacterium by germinated barley foodstuff, accompanied by enhanced butyrate production in healthy volunteers.
AB  == germinated barley foodstuff (gbf) derived from the aleurone and scutellum fractions of germinated barley mainly consists of low-lignified hemicellulose and glutamine-rich protein. gbf improves the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and defecation, through the bacterial production of short chain fatty acids (scfa), especially butyrate. in this study we investigated the mechanism of production of butyrate by microflora in humans and in vitro. daily administration of 9 g gbf for 14 successive days significantly increased fecal butyrate content. fecal bifidobacterium and eubacterium were also significantly increased by gbf administration in healthy volunteers. ten anaerobic micro-organisms selected from intestinal microflora were cultured in vitro in the medium containing gbf as a sole carbon source (gbf medium). after a 3-day incubation, 7 strains (bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, bacteroides ovatus, clostridium butyricum, and  eubacterium limosum) lowered the medium ph producing scfa. eubacterium grown together with bifidobacterium in gbf medium efficiently produced butyrate. on the other hand, gbf changed the intestinal microflora and increased probiotics such as bifidobacterium in the intestinal tract. as a result, butyrate was produced by the mutual action of eubacterium and bifidobacterium. this butyrate is considered to enhance the proliferation of colonic epithelial cells.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.
