TI  - Bisphosphonates enhance bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on bone hydroxyapatite.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of the suspicion that bisphosphonates enhance bacterial colonization, this study evaluated adhesion and biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans 25175, Staphylococcus aureus 6538, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 14454 reference strains on hydroxyapatite coated with clodronate, pamidronate, or zoledronate. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial strains were cultured on bisphosphonate-coated and noncoated hydroxyapatite discs. After incubation, nonadhered bacteria were removed by centrifugation. Biofilm formation was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Bacterial colonization was estimated using quantitative cultures compared by means with Kruskal-Wallis and post-hoc Student-Newman-Keuls tests. Modeling of the interactions between bisphosphonates and hydroxyapatite was performed using the Density Functional Theory method. RESULTS: Bacterial colonization of the hydroxyapatite discs was significantly higher for all tested strains in the presence of bisphosphonates vs. CONTROLS: Adherence in the presence of pamidronate was higher than with other bisphosphonates. Density Functional Theory analysis showed that the protonated amine group of pamidronate, which are not present in clodronate or zoledronate, forms two additional hydrogen bonds with hydroxyapatite. Moreover, the reactive cationic amino group of pamidronate may attract bacteria by direct electrostatic interaction. CONCLUSION: Increased bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation can promote osteomyelitis, cause failure of dental implants or bisphosphonate-coated joint prostheses, and complicate bone surgery in patients on bisphosphonates.
TI  - Antibacterial assay-guided isolation of active compounds from Artocarpus heterophyllus heartwoods.
AB  - CONTEXT: Preparations from Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae) heartwoods are used in the traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, malarial fever, and to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to isolate pure antibacterial compounds from A. heterophyllus heartwoods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dried and powdered A. heterophyllus heartwoods were successively extracted with the following solvents: hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Each of the extracts was screened for their antibacterial activities using a disc diffusion method (10 mg/disc). Their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined using a broth microdilution method. The extract that showed the strongest antibacterial activities was fractionated to isolate the active compounds by an antibacterial assay-guided isolation process. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The ethyl acetate extract exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities against Streptococcus mutans, S. pyogenes, and Bacillus subtilis with MIC values of 78, 39, and 9.8 microg/mL, respectively. Based on an antibacterial assay-guided isolation, four antibacterial compounds: cycloartocarpin (1), artocarpin (2), artocarpanone (3), and cyanomaclurin (4) were purified. Among these isolated compounds, artocarpin exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including S. mutans, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis with MICs of 4.4, 4.4, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microM, respectively, and MBCs of 8.9, 8.9, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microM, respectively, while artocarpanone showed the strongest activity against Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 12.9 and 25.8 microM, respectively. Only artocarpin showed inhibitory activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with an MIC of 286.4 microM.
TI  - The Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal Inhibits Biofilm Development of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - Bacteria often thrive in natural environments through a sessile mode of growth, known as the biofilm. Biofilms are well-structured communities and their formation is tightly regulated. However, the mechanisms by which interspecies interactions alter the formation of biofilms have not yet been elucidated in detail. We herein demonstrated that a quorum-sensing signal in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (the Pseudomonas quinolone signal; PQS) inhibited biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans. Although the PQS did not affect cell growth, biofilm formation was markedly inhibited. Our results revealed a unique role for this multifunctional PQS and also indicated its application in the development of prophylactic agents against caries-causing S. mutans.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  - Abstract Objective. The aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. Materials and methods. The growth of selected bacteria (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. The content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with HPLC-ESI-MS. Results. The spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. Sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. Total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with pH varying between 4.1-5.4. Conclusions. The present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice pH explains bacterial in vitro growth. This may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.
TI  - Scratching the surface - tobacco-induced bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Individual environmental factors, such as iron, temperature and oxygen, are known to have a profound effect on bacterial phenotype. Therefore, it is surprising so little known is about the influence of chemically complex cigarette smoke on bacterial physiology. Recent evidence has demonstrated that tobacco smoke and components alter the bacterial surface and promote biofilm formation in several important human pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Klebsiella pneumonia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the relevance to increased susceptibility to infectious disease in smokers and to treatment are reviewed.
TI  - Bactericidal Activity and Mechanism of Photoirradiated Polyphenols against Gram-Positive and -Negative Bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans) and Gram-negative bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/mL polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to LED light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mW/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. Caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. It was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial DNA, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. The present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and mechanism of action of a novel cationic alpha-helical  octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase of rice.
AB  - AmyI-1-18, an octadecapeptide derived from alpha-amylase (AmyI-1) of rice (Oryza  sativa L. japonica), is a novel cationic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that contains two lysine and two arginine residues. The antimicrobial activity of AmyI-1-18 against human pathogens was quantitatively evaluated using a chemiluminescence method that measures ATP derived from viable cells. Of the ten kinds of human pathogens, AmyI-1-18 exhibited antimicrobial activity against nine. Its 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (ICs50 ) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Streptococcus mutans were 13, 19, 50, 64, and 77 muM, respectively. AmyI-1-18 had little or no hemolytic activity even at 500 muM, and showed negligible cytotoxicity up to 1200 muM. The degree of 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide release from P. gingivalis cells induced by the addition of AmyI-1-18 was significantly lower than that induced by the addition of melittin. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the percentages of P. aeruginosa, S. mutans, and C. albicans cells stained with propidium iodide (PI), a DNA-intercalating dye, were 89%, 43%, and 3%, respectively, when AmyI-1-18 was added at a concentration equal to its 4xIC50 . Therefore, the antimicrobial activity of AmyI-1-18 against P. aeruginosa and S. mutans appears to be mainly attributable to its membrane-disrupting activity. In contrast, its antimicrobial activity against P. gingivalis and C. albicans most likely depends upon interactions with intracellular targets other than their cell membranes. Collectively, these results indicate that AmyI-1-18 is useful as a safe and potent AMP against the pathogens described above in many fields of healthcare. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers (Pept Sci) 104: 73-83, 2015.
TI  - Recent advances in natural product-based anti-biofilm approaches to control infections.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are highly organized surface-associated communities of bacteria encased within an extracellular matrix produced by themselves, capable of growing in connection with different biological or inert surfaces such as artificial joints or catheters. Biofilms are commonly associated with many health problems, such as endocarditis, otitis media, periodontitis, prostatitis, and urinary tract infections. Several bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or fungal pathogen as Candida albicans, can form biofilms in the body tissues, leading to different infections. The inherently defensive character of the biofilm is demonstrated by enhanced persistence of bacteria grown in the sessile mode respect to bacteria grown planktonically. This makes most biofilm- associated infections difficult to eradicate, thus contributing to disease chronicity. Since natural products provide a diverse array of chemical structures and possess a wide variety of biological properties, natural resources are worldwide exploited in the search of new pharmaceuticals. In this context bioactive secondary metabolites from natural sources, useful for the new antimicrobial and anti-biofilm drugs, are of interest. In this review, the role of small molecules from plants and marine organisms in inhibiting and/or dispersing bacterial biofilms is discussed, as well as the approaches that have been applied to the discovery of lead small molecules that mediate biofilm development. Molecules inhibiting the formation of biofilm may have therapeutic potential. Several candidates, as halogenated furanones, 2-amminoimidazole alkaloids and flavonoids have been already isolated and characterized from many plants and from marine organisms.
TI  - Microbial biofilms are able to destroy hydroxyapatite in the absence of host immunity in vitro.
AB  - PURPOSE: It is widely thought that inflammation and osteoclastogenesis result in  hydroxyapatite (HA) resorption and sequestrum formation during osseous infections, and microbial biofilm pathogens induce the inflammatory destruction of HA. We hypothesized that biofilms associated with infectious bone disease can directly resorb HA in the absence of host inflammation or osteoclastogenesis. Therefore we developed an in vitro model to test this hypothesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Customized HA discs were manufactured as a substrate for growing clinically relevant biofilm pathogens. Single-species biofilms of Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans and mixed-species biofilms of C albicans plus S mutans were incubated on HA discs for 72 hours to grow mature biofilms. Three different non-biofilm control groups also were established for testing. HA discs were then evaluated by means of scanning electron microscopy, micro-computed tomography metrotomography, x-ray spectroscopy, and confocal microscopy with planimetric analysis. In addition, quantitative cultures and pH assessment were performed. Analysis of variance was used to test for significance between treatment and control groups. RESULTS: All investigated biofilms were able to cause significant (P < .05) and morphologically characteristic alterations in HA structure as compared with controls. The highest number of alterations observed was caused by mixed biofilms of C albicans plus S mutans. S mutans biofilm incubated in medium with additional sucrose content was the most detrimental to HA surfaces among single-species biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that direct microbial resorption of bone is possible in addition to immune-mediated destruction, which has important translational implications for the pathogenesis of chronic bone infections and for targeted antimicrobial therapeutics.
TI  - Development of a novel resin with antimicrobial properties for dental application.
AB  - The adhesion of biofilm on dental prostheses is a prerequisite for the occurrence of oral diseases. OBJECTIVE: To assess the antimicrobial activity and the mechanical properties of an acrylic resin embedded with nanostructured silver vanadate (beta-AgVO3). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of beta-AgVO3 was studied in relation to the species Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. The halo zone of inhibition method was performed in triplicate to determine the inhibitory effect of the modified self-curing acrylic resin Dencor Lay-Classico. The surface hardness and compressive strength were examined. The specimens were prepared according to the percentage of beta-AgVO3 (0%-control, 0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, 5%, and 10%), with a sample size of 9x2 mm for surface hardness and antimicrobial activity tests, and 8x4 mm for the compression test. The values of the microbiologic analysis were compared and evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test (alpha=0.05); the mechanical analysis used the Shapiro-Wilk's tests, Levene's test, ANOVA (one-way), and Tukey's test (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: The addition of 10% beta-AgVO3 promoted antimicrobial activity against all strains. The antimicrobial effect was observed at a minimum concentration of 1% for P. aeruginosa, 2.5% for S. aureus, 5% for C. albicans, and 10% for S. mutans. Surface hardness and compressive strength increased significantly with the addition of 0.5% beta-AgVO3 (p<0.05). Higher rates of the nanomaterial did not alter the mechanical properties of the resin in comparison with the control group (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of beta-AgVO3 has the potential to promote antimicrobial activity in the acrylic resin. At reduced rates, it improves the mechanical properties, and, at higher rates, it does not promote changes in the control.
TI  - Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of PGLa-AM1, CPF-AM1, and magainin-AM1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  - Cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (HDPs). Three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa-AM1), caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF-AM1) and magainin-AM1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the African volcano frog Xenopus amieti (Pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. Minimal effective concentrations (MECs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) determined by microbroth dilution. PGLa-AM1 and CPF-AM1 were particularly active against Streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against Fusobacterium nucleatum, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. A type strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. PGLa-AM1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. All three peptides showed less binding to P. gingivalis LPS than to LPS from the other species studied. Oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 muM peptide treatments. Production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 muM magainin-AM1 but not following treatment with PGLa-AM1 or CPF-AM1. In conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the X. amieti peptides bound to LPS from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. CPF-AM1 and PGLa-AM1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.
TI  - [Complementation and function of methyl-metabolic pathway in Streptococcus mutans luxS null strain].
AB  - PURPOSE: To complement the activated methyl cycle (AMC) pathway at an AI-2 defect background in Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) luxS null strain. METHODS: A sahH gene was amplified from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and introduced into the S. mutans luxS null strain to complement the methyl-metabolic disruption at an AI-2 defect background. Western blot, reverse-transcription PCR and AI-2 bioassay were performed to confirm the heterogenous expression of SahH in S. mutans luxS null strain. The data was statistically analyzed by SAS8.0 software package. RESULTS: LuxS and SahH were detected to express in Escherichia coli BL21 as well as their mRNA were confirmed to be successfully transcribed in S. mutans luxS null strain. AI-2 production was found in wide type S. mutans and its luxS-introduced luxS null strain but not found in the luxS null strain and its sahH and empty plasmid-introduced strains. CONCLUSIONS: A new S. mutans derivative with the AMC pathway complements while the AI-2 defect is constructed.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of the triterpene 3beta,6beta,16beta-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene on planktonic cells and biofilms from Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.
AB  - This study evaluated the antimicrobial effect of 3beta,6beta,16beta-trihydroxylup-20(29)-ene (CLF1), a triterpene isolated from Combretum leprosum Mart., in inhibiting the planktonic growth and biofilms of Gram positive bacteria Streptococcus mutans and S. mitis. The antimicrobial activity was assessed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The antibiofilm potential was determined by quantifying total biomass and enumerating biofilm-entrapped viable bacteria. In addition, the acute toxicity of CLF1 on Artemia sp. nauplii was also determined. The results showed that CLF1 was able in inhibiting the growth of S. mutans and S. mitis with MIC and MBC of 7.8 mug/mL and 15.6 mug/mL, respectively. CLF1 was highly effective on biofilms of both bacteria. Only 7.8 mug/mL CLF1 was enough to inhibit by 97% and 90% biomass production of S. mutans and S. mitis, respectively. On the other hand, such effects were not evident on Gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. The toxicity tests showed that the LC50 of CLF1 was 98.19 mug/mL. Therefore, CLF1 isolated from C. leprosum may constitute an important natural agent for the development of new therapies for caries and other infectious diseases caused by S. mutans and S. mitis.
TI  - A microbiological assessment of the oral hygiene of 24-72-month-old kindergarten  children and disinfection of their toothbrushes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to assess the index of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMF-T), habit of brushing teeth, and the microbiological agents accumulating on the children's toothbrushes for 4 weeks and response of these agents to disinfection via a chlorhexidine solution, then compare those results with the education and income levels of the children's parents. METHOD: Included in the study were 187 children (96 in the control group and 91 in the experiment group - chlorhexidine) chosen randomly from 600 kindergarten children whose ages ranged from 24 months to 72 months. The children selected had not taken any antibiotics, antimicotics for three months and dental treatments during this trial. The distribution of these children to the groups was also done randomly. After performing a survey for the education, occupation, and income status of the parents, the children were examined and the number of decayed teeth was recorded. The children were given toothbrushes, toothpaste (with fluroide), and the solutions (including distilled water and chlorhexidine) for four weeks under the condition that toothbrushes were returned at the end of each week. The 14 different microbiological agents observed as a result of the assessment of the samples taken in the first week were also included in the assessments of the samples taken over the four-week period. RESULTS: The decrease in the DMF-T index was found to be meaningful according to the differences in education, income, and occupation status of the parents. Of all the samples taken from the toothbrushes, the bacteria with the greatest rate of reproduction included Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia Coli, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa, Enterococcus spp, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans. Except for Candida albicans, the other microorganisms taken as samples from the toothbrushes reproduced less overall. In the group using the solution with chlorhexidine, a meaningful decrease in bacterial reproduction was discovered compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show that the education, occupation, and socioeconomic situations of the parents should be considered when discussing children's oral and dental health. Moreover, the study shows that disinfection of toothbrushes in order to prevent reinfection and contamination oral flora with the bacteria again is important in terms of preventive medicine and family-children health.
TI  - Susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/RealSeal (RS). To determine if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. RESULTS: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain RS emulsion. CONCLUSION: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of Iranian green-tea-containing mouthrinse vs chlorhexidine  0.2%: an in vitro study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of green tea, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of mouthrinses containing green tea extract vs 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected microorganisms in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antibacterial activity of both mouthrinses and the pure green tea extract was assessed by using disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods against five microorganisms: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aerogenosa and Escherichia coli. Growth inhibition zones were measured in mm after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. The two mouthrinses were assessed at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mg/ml to determine the MIC, which was interpreted as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. RESULTS: 0.2% chlorhexidine produced a larger zone of growth inhibition than did the mouthrinse made of green tea extract (P < 0.01). Paradoxically, the growth inhibition zones of the tested bacteria were significantly larger in pure extract of green tea than in 0.2% chlorhexidine (P < 0.01). The chlorhexidine mouthrinse inhibited the growth of all tested species and exhibited significantly lower MICs than did the green tea mouthrinse (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Even though the mouthrinse made with green tea extract presented an in vitro antimicrobial activity inferior to 0.2% chlorhexidine, the pure extract had considerable bactericidal effect.
TI  - Photosensitization of in vitro biofilms formed on denture base resin.
AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Proper sterilization or disinfection of removable prostheses and surgical guides has been problematic in dental practice because of the absence of simple and low-cost techniques that do not cause damage to acrylic resins. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to study the effect of photodynamic therapy against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans biofilms formed on acrylic resin specimens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The specimens were sterilized in ethylene oxide gas and submitted to in vitro biofilm growth. The photodynamic therapy consisted of the application of 0.05% methylene blue (P+) conjugated to irradiation with a light-emitting-diode of 630 nm and 150 mW (L+). The specimens were randomly divided into groups (n=5): negative control (P-L-); stained and irradiated at 10 J/cm(2) (P+L+ 10); stained and irradiated at 30 J/cm(2) (P+L+ 30); stained and not irradiated (P+L-); not stained and irradiated at 10 J/cm(2) (P-L+ 10); not stained and irradiated at 30 J/cm(2) (P-L+ 30); and gold standard (GS), sterilized. Afterward, the specimens were submitted to contact with culture medium agar for 10 minutes in petri plates, which were incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees C. The number of colony-forming units was obtained, and the data were expressed according to scores (1=0; 2=1-10; 3=11-100; 4=101-1000) and analyzed by the Friedman and Dunn tests (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Streptococcus mutans was sensitized by (P+L-); P aeruginosa and C albicans were also sensitized by the dye but showed a slight microbial reduction with (P+L+ 30), as did S aureus (P>.05); E coli presented an initial score of 3 and achieved a bacterial reduction to score 2 with (P+L+ 30) (P=.039). CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy was effective in reducing E coli counts on biofilms formed on acrylic resin specimens. The inhibition of microorganism growth tended to be directly proportional to the amount of energy provided by the light-emitting diode.
TI  - Evaluation of the stability and antimicrobial activity of an ethanolic extract of Libidibia ferrea.
AB  - Biofilm is a dense, whitish, noncalcified aggregate of bacteria, with desquamated epithelial cells and food debris creating conditions for an imbalance of resident oral microflora and favoring the destruction of hard and soft tissues by development of caries and gingivitis. The aim of this study was to obtain and characterize an extract of Libidibia ferrea, ex Caesalpinia ferrea L. and to evaluate its feasibility for formulation as a mouthwash, according to current legislation. For this purpose, pH, sedimentation, density, and stability were evaluated, along with microbiological testing of the extract. The microbiological test was used to verify the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fungi, yeasts, coliforms, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus oralis strains. Characterization, microbiological evaluation, and minimum inhibitory concentration results were tabulated and described using descriptive statistics. The L. ferrea extract showed stable characteristics, product quality, and antibacterial activity against the microorganisms tested irrespective of experimental time intervals. According to these results, it can be concluded that formulation of a mouthwash containing L. ferrea extract to control biofilm is feasible, but further studies are needed.
TI  - gamma-Alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5H)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae Delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. We have recently reported that some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of Enterococcus faecalis. In the present Letter we describe results of the biological evaluation of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus mutans. Our results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms of S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. In some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/mL (1.3 muM, compound 3d) and 0.7 mug/mL (1.3 muM, 3f). Results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.
TI  - [Evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (SNP's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. It is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal SNP's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of SNP's against cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. Tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. Nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. METHODS: Colloidal silver solution (CSS) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. Nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at Department of Conservative Dentistry, Medical University of Warsaw. MIC and MBC values for CSS's were evaluated. RESULTS: CSS used in this research is of good stability. No agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. Silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. MIC values were: 12-25 ppm for S. salivarius, 25 ppm for S. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for S. mitis and 50 ppm for S. mutans, while MBC values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. After 24 hours of contact MBC values were: 25-50 ppm for S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for S. mitis and 200 ppmfor S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial properties of CSS depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. The susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. Sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. We tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. For all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. In contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, S. salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection treatment up to 40 times. This finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. The active ingredient of this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of H2O2. Therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. In conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.
TI  - A distinguishable role of eDNA in the viscoelastic relaxation of biofilms.
AB  - Bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth are protected against chemical and mechanical stresses. Biofilms are composed, for the most part, of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). The extracellular matrix is composed of different chemical constituents, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and extracellular DNA (eDNA). Here we aimed to identify the roles of different matrix constituents in the viscoelastic response of biofilms. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were grown under different conditions yielding distinct matrix chemistries. Next, biofilms were subjected to mechanical deformation and stress relaxation was monitored over time. A Maxwell model possessing an average of four elements for an individual biofilm was used to fit the data. Maxwell elements were defined by a relaxation time constant and their relative importance. Relaxation time constants varied widely over the 104 biofilms included and were divided into seven ranges (<1, 1 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 50, 50 to 100, 100 to 500, and >500 s). Principal-component analysis was carried out to eliminate related time constant ranges, yielding three principal components that could be related to the known matrix chemistries. The fastest relaxation component (<3 s) was due to the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, combined with the absence of bacteria, i.e., the heaviest masses in a biofilm. An intermediate component (3 to 70 s) was related to other EPSs, while a distinguishable role was assigned to intact eDNA, which possesses a unique principal component with a time constant range (10 to 25 s) between those of EPS constituents. This implies that eDNA modulates its interaction with other matrix constituents to control its contribution to viscoelastic relaxation under mechanical stress. IMPORTANCE: The protection offered by biofilms to organisms that inhabit it against chemical and mechanical stresses is due in part to its matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) in which biofilm organisms embed themselves. Mechanical stresses lead to deformation and possible detachment of biofilm organisms, and hence, rearrangement processes occur in a biofilm to relieve it from these stresses. Maxwell analysis of stress relaxation allows the determination of characteristic relaxation time constants, but the biofilm components and matrix constituents associated with different stress relaxation processes have never been identified. Here we grew biofilms with different matrix constituents and used principal-component analysis to reveal that the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, together with the absence of bacteria, is associated with the fastest relaxation, while other EPSs control a second, slower relaxation. Extracellular DNA, as a matrix constituent, had a distinguishable role with its own unique principal component in stress relaxation with a time constant range between those of other EPSs.
TI  - Microwave assisted synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones;  synthesis, in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer activities of novel coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones.
AB  - The present article describes the synthesis of dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (2a-h) under microwave irradiation. The product was obtained in excellent yield (74-94%) in a shorter reaction time (2 min). These molecules (2a, b) further reacted with various substituted 4-bromomethylcoumarins (3a-f) to yield a new series of coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones (4a-h). The structure of all the synthesized compounds were confirmed by spectral studies and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against three Gram-positive bacteria viz., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus mutans and three Gram-negative bacteria viz., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium chrysogenum and anticancer activity against Dalton's Ascitic Lymphoma (DAL) cell line. In general, all the compounds possessed better antifungal properties than antibacterial properties. The coumarin substituted dihydrobenzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (4g) (R = i-Pr, R(1) = 6-Cl) was found to be the most potent cytotoxic compound (88%) against Dalton's Ascitic Lymphoma cell line at the concentration of 100 mug/mL.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activities of bioaggregate and mineral trioxide aggregate].
AB  - Treatment outcome of endodontic perforations depends on successful elimination of the associated microorganisms and infected tissues as well as the effective seal of the root-end or perforation site to prevent future contamination. Ideally, perforation repair material has to be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in order to prevent bacterial contamination as well as good sealing properties and biocompatibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of BioAggregate (BA) and Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA) on the standard strains of Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar disc diffusion test. Colonies of each strains were harvested from the medium and microorganisms were diluted to obtain a suspension of approximately 108 cfu/ml. Petri plates with blood agar base with 5% sheep blood or Sabouraud dextrose agar (for C.albicans) were inoculated with experimental suspensions and BA and MTA discs prepared as 2 mm length and 6 mm diameter were placed. After 24 and 48 hours incubation, the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured. The results of the disc diffusion tests showed that BA and MTA were effective on the tested microorganisms at 24 and 48 hours incubation periods. BA and MTA showed similar antimicrobial effects on C.albicans and E.coli. BA was more effective than MTA on S.mutans, E.faecalis and P.aeruginosa, however MTA was more effective than BA on S.sanguinis at 48 hours. When the time efficiency of the materials were compared, there was no statistically difference between 24 to 48 hours on E.coli, E.faecalis, S.mutans, S.sanguinis in both two groups (p> 0.05). There was statistically significant decrease 24 to 48 hours on C.albicans in BA and MTA groups and P.aeruginosa in BA group (p< 0.05). It can be concluded that although BA and MTA displayed similar antimicrobial efficacy on the tested microorganisms newly improved material BA demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity than other.
TI  - Silver nanoparticles as active ingredient used for alcohol-free mouthwash.
AB  - We developed an effective and non-irritant mouthwash that is alcohol-free and has a low concentration of silver nanoparticles (SNP) in order to be used for preventing oral cavity infections in immunocompromised oncologic patients. We studied antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles (SNP) in the range of (50-0.024 microg/ml) and 3% of ethanol (30,000 microg/ml) in mouthwash. Antimicrobial effects of two treatments were studied by doing challenge test on microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and measuring MIC and MBC (MFC) values of SNP toward mentioned microorganisms. These values of SNP respectively were in the range of (0.78-3.12) and (1.56-12.5 microg/ml). Results showed that SNP in the MIC and the lower concentrations killed all of the used microorganisms. No difference was observed between the antimicrobial effect of ethanol-free mouthwash containing SNP and mouthwash containing SNP and ethanol (30,000 microg/ml). SNP has high antimicrobial effects at low concentrations and it can be a good alternative for ethanol (30,000 microg/ml) because ethanol is also irritating, especially to sensitive or inflamed mucosa.
TI  - Comparison of chlorine dioxide and dichloroisocyanurate disinfectants for use in  the dental setting.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial properties of a slow  release noncorrosive chlorine dioxide with those of sodium dichloroisocyanurate to establish their possible use in the dental settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Disinfectant solutions were prepared according to manufacturers' instructions and tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Streptococcus mutans NCTC 1044, Candida albicans ATCC 90028, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 15244 spores, Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATCC 25177, Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium ATCC 25291 and Hepatitis B virus using the Standard quantitative suspension test. The shelf-lives of the disinfectants were also determined. RESULTS: Both disinfectants killed all the test organisms within 30 seconds. B. subtilis spores were killed in 2 and 2.5 minutes by chlorine dioxide and sodium dichloroisocya nurate respectively. When diluted solutions of these disinfectants were stored in screw cap bottles, they retained their activity for at least 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: Chlorine dioxide and sodium dichloroisocyanurate containing disinfectants can be used in the denta settings for surfaces and heat sensitive instruments. However, chlorine dioxide is advantageous because it is non-corrosive and the effective concentration is lower than that recommended for sodium dichloroisocyanurate.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic (Allium sativum) extract on dental plaque bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allium sativum, commonly known as garlic, exhibits antibacterial effects against a wide range of bacteria. AIM: The objective of this in vitro study was to assess the antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic extract against human dental plaque microbiota. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial activities of four different concentrations of garlic extract (5%, 10%, 20%, and 100%) were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lactobacillus spp. using the disk diffusion method. Papers soaked in 0.2% concentration chlorhexidine gluconate and saline were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The data were subjected to one-way ANOVA and the Tukey multiple comparisons test at a 5% significance level. RESULTS: All bacterial strains were inhibited by all test materials. The inhibition zones of the different concentrations of garlic extract were not significantly different for S. mutans, S. sanguis, and S. salivarius. For P. aeruginosa and lactobacillus spp. the inhibition zones of 5%, 10% and 20% concentrations were not significantly different from one another, but they were significantly more than that of the 100% extract. CONCLUSION: The 5%, 10%, 20%, and 100% concentrations of garlic extract had similar effects, so further studies seem to be indicated on the usefulness of the 5% extract.
TI  - Rapid, electrical impedance detection of bacterial pathogens using immobilized antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - The detection of bacterial pathogens plays an important role in many biomedical applications, including clinical diagnostics, food and water safety, and biosecurity. Most current bacterial detection technologies, however, are unsuitable for use in resource-limited settings where the highest disease burdens often exist. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop portable, user-friendly biosensors capable of rapid detection of multiple pathogens in situ. We report a microfluidic chip for multiplexed detection of bacterial cells that uses antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with species-specific targeting and binding capabilities. The AMPs are immobilized onto an electrical impedance microsensor array and serve as biorecognition elements for bacterial cell detection. Characterization of peptide immobilization on the sensors revealed robust surface binding via cysteine-gold interactions and vertical alignment relative to the sensor surface. Samples containing Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were loaded in the chip, and both microorganisms were detected at minimum concentrations of 10(5) cfu/mL within 25 min. Measurements performed in a variety of solutions revealed that high-conductivity solutions produced the largest impedance values. By integrating a highly specific bacterial cell capture scheme with rapid electrical detection, this device demonstrates great potential as a next-generation, point-of-care diagnostic platform for the detection of disease-causing pathogenic agents.
TI  - Phenolic Content, Antioxidant Activity, Antibacterial Activity and Phytochemical  Composition of Garcinia lancifolia.
AB  - Garcinia lancifolia (Clusiaceae) is an unexplored medicinal plant used as stomachic, diuretic and its fruit is used to cure dysentery and diarrhoea. The acidic fruits are used to prepare juice, pickle and curries. The phytochemical analysis of different extracts of G. lancifolia leaf, stem and fruit revealed the presence of tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids and cardiac glycosides. The high phenolic content was observed in the methanol extract of leaf followed by methanol extract of stem and dichloromethane extract of leaf. The G. lancifolia fruit juice exhibited high antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus subtilis. The methanol extract of fruit pulp was also very effective against Gram-positive bacteria when compared with Gram-negative bacteria. The radical scavenging activity of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl was highest in fruit juice followed by methanol extract of leaf and stem. All extracts showed concentration-dependent increase in the antioxidant activity.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy of primary root canal filling materials.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate and compare six different materials commonly used for filling the root canals of primary teeth for antimicrobial efficacy against some of the microorganisms commonly found in infected root canals. STUDY DESIGN: In this experimental in vitro study six root canal filling materials were tested for antimicrobial efficacy against eight microbial strains using the agar diffusion method. RESULTS: Zinc oxide eugenol paste exhibited the strongest antimicrobial potential followed by Endoflas, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide-sodium fluoride mixture, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture and calcium hydroxide paste (Apexcal). The addition of sodium fluoride to the zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture enhanced the antimicrobial efficacy. Metapex demonstrated minimal inhibition and Vaseline was non-inhibitory. CONCLUSIONS: All the test filling materials demonstrated varying antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested. Zinc oxide eugenol paste and materials containing zinc oxide were found to be more effective against the microorganisms compared to materials without zinc oxide.
TI  - Zn(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) complexes of tridentate asymmetrical Schiff base ligands: synthesis, characterization, properties and biological activity.
AB  - New asymmetrical tridentate Schiff base ligands were synthesized using 1,2-phenylenediamine, 4-methyl-1,2-phenylenediamine, 2-hydroxy-1-napthaldehyde, 9-anthracenecarboxaldehyde. Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes were synthesised and characterized by using FT-IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, UV-Vis, XRD, ESR, elemental analysis and fluorescence studies. The antimicrobial activity of the ligands and their metal complexes were studied against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, S. aureus ATCC 25923, Streptococcus mutans RSHM 676, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. The determination of the antibacterial activity was done using the broth microdilution methods. In general, it has been determined that the studied compounds have MIC values similar to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It has been found that Ni, Pb, Zn derivatives of HL1A and ZnL(2)A has lower MIC values than ampicillin for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 strain.
TI  - pH and Antimicrobial Activity of Portland Cement Associated with Different Radiopacifying Agents.
AB  - Objective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and pH changes induced by Portland cement (PC) alone and in association with radiopacifiers. Methods. The materials tested were pure PC, PC + bismuth oxide, PC + zirconium oxide, PC + calcium tungstate, and zinc oxide and eugenol cement (ZOE). Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by agar diffusion test using the following strains: Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. After 24 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C, inhibition of bacterial growth was observed and measured. For pH analysis, material samples (n = 10) were placed in polyethylene tubes and immersed in 10 mL of distilled water. After 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours, the pH of the solutions was determined using a pH meter. Results. All microbial species were inhibited by the cements evaluated. All materials composed of PC with radiopacifying agents promoted pH increase similar to pure Portland cement. ZOE had the lowest pH values throughout all experimental periods. Conclusions. All Portland cement-based materials with the addition of different radiopacifiers (bismuth oxide, calcium tungstate, and zirconium oxide) presented antimicrobial activity and pH similar to pure Portland cement.
TI  - Synergistic effects between silver nanoparticles and antibiotics and the mechanisms involved.
AB  - Silver nanoparticles (nano-Ags), which have well-known antimicrobial properties,  are used extensively in various medical and general applications. In this study, the combination effects between nano-Ags and the conventional antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin against various pathogenic bacteria were investigated. The MIC and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) were determined to confirm antibacterial susceptibility and synergistic effects. The results showed that nano-Ags possessed antibacterial effects and synergistic activities. The antibiofilm activities of nano-Ags alone or in combination with antibiotics were also investigated. Formation of biofilm is associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents and chronic bacterial infections. The results indicated that nano-Ags also had antibiofilm activities. To understand these effects of nano-Ags, an ATPase inhibitor assay, permeability assay and hydroxyl radical assay were conducted. The antibacterial activity of nano-Ags was influenced by ATP-associated metabolism rather than by the permeability of the outer membrane. Additionally, nano-Ags generated hydroxyl radicals, a highly reactive oxygen species induced by bactericidal agents. It was concluded that nano-Ags have potential as a combination therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious diseases by bacteria.
TI  - Assessing the oral microbiota of healthy and alcohol-treated rats using whole-genome DNA probes from human bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the capacity of whole-genome DNA probes prepared from human oral bacteria to cross-react with bacteria from the oral cavity of rats, and to assess the influence of alcohol ingestion on the animals' oral biofilm. DESIGN: Twenty four mature Wistar rats were equally divided in two groups. One group (control) was fed balanced diet of rat pellets and water. The alcohol-treated group (AT) received the same diet and 20% ethanol solution. Upon euthanasia after 30 days, bacterial samples from the oral biofilm covering the animals' teeth were collected using microbrushes. Bacteria identification and quantification were performed using the DNA checkerboard hybridization method with 33 probes prepared from human oral bacteria. Signals corresponding to bacterial genome counts and percentages were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test with a significance level <0.05. RESULTS: Cross-reaction for all targeted species, except Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus mitis-like species, occurred in the control group. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Veillonella parvula-like species only produced detectable signals in the AT group. Significantly more signals were detected in the control group compared to the AT group (p=0.001). The percentage of E. coli-like species was highest in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-genome DNA probes prepared from human oral bacteria can cross-react with rats' oral bacterial species. Alcohol consumption is associated with lower levels and diversity of bacterial species in the oral cavity of rats.
TI  - An agar diffusion study comparing the antimicrobial activity of Nanoseal with some other endodontic sealers.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a new experimental nano-hydroxyapatite epoxy resin-based sealer (Nanoseal) with several other commercially available sealers; AH26, Tubliseal, Sealapex and Roekoseal against Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and Escherichia coli for up to 7 days. Agar diffusion was used in this study. Fifty Muller-Hinton agar plates were prepared and divided into five experimental groups (n = 10), for each micro-organism. Another 10 agar plates were used as positive and negative controls. Endodontic sealers were tested against each micro-organism. Inhibition zones produced were recorded. The results of this study showed that all test materials exhibited inhibition zones towards the tested micro-organisms for 7 days except for Roekoseal, which showed no inhibition zones. Nanoseal and AH26 exhibited similar zones of inhibition. Significant difference was found between Nanoseal and the other tested sealers (P < 0.001).
TI  - Disinfection effect of dental impression tray adhesives.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Iatrogenic infections are serious problems in dental offices. Impression tray adhesives are delivered in glass containers with a fixed brush attached inside the cap. Using the brush for application of the impression tray adhesive on a contaminated impression tray or prostheses, pathogen transmission by replacing the cap with the brush is possible. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial strains (patient strains and in vitro strains) were supervaccinated on Columbia agar. The bacterial solution was diluted with TSB and aerobically grown, and starting concentration was 1 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The stock solution was placed on Columbia agar. Alginate, polyether, and silicon impression tray adhesives were applied to the center of the particular blood agar plates and incubated for 48 h. The expansion of the inhibition zone assays were measured using a microscope. RESULTS: Twenty-one different bacterial strains were selected in the saliva samples of 20 patients. The growth inhibition for alginate impression tray adhesive was 1.1 % (+/-0.3) of the patient strains. The overgrowth of polyether impression tray adhesive was 30.6 % (+/-9.3) and for silicon impression tray adhesive 11.8 % (+/-5.0). In in vitro strains, alginate impression tray adhesive performed an inhibition of 0.7 % (+/-0.3). The overgrowth of polyether impression tray adhesive was 7.0 % (+/-1.6) and for silicon impression tray adhesive was 6.5 % (+/-1.3). CONCLUSIONS: Using the fixed brush for application of the impression tray adhesive on multiple patients, a cross-contamination cannot be ruled out. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: An application of the impression tray adhesive with a pipette and a single-use brush would eliminate the contamination.
TI  - Inhibition of Candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by Solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  - Xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of Candida albicans. The aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for Candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. Water extract from the herbaceous plant Solidago virgaurea (Goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). Saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in S. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and S. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. C. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. Solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of C. albicans (four strains), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius or Enterococcus faecalis. When inocula were incubated with Solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in Candida yeast-hyphal transition. Candida biofilms were then prepared in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. Biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. In conclusion, the S. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of C. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Chitosan nanoparticles for antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation: characterization and in vitro investigation.
AB  - The growing resistance to antibiotics has rendered antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) an attractive alternative treatment modality for infectious diseases. Chitosan (CS) was shown to further potentiate the PDI effect of photosensitizers and was therefore used in this study to investigate its ability to potentiate the activity of erythrosine (ER) against bacteria and yeast. CS nanoparticles loaded with ER were prepared by ionic gelation method and tested for their PDI efficacy on planktonic cells and biofilms of Streptococcus mutans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The nanoparticles were characterized for their size, polydispersity index and zeta potential. No toxicity was observed when planktonic cells and biofilms were treated with the nanoparticles in the dark. However, when the cells were exposed to light irradiation after treatment with free ER or ER/CS nanoparticles, a significant phototoxicity was observed. The antimicrobial activity of ER/CS nanoparticles was significantly higher than ER in free form. The particle size and incubation time of the nanoparticles also appeared to be important factors affecting their PDI activity against S. mutans and C. albicans.
TI  - The short-term effects of various oral care methods in dependent elderly: comparison between toothbrushing, tongue cleaning with sponge brush and wiping on oral mucous membrane by chlorhexidine.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the short-term effects from toothbrushing, tongue cleaning with sponge brush and wiping on oral mucous membrane by chlorhexidine. BACKGROUND: Numerous reports have been seen in recent years proving the effectiveness of mouth cleaning with a toothbrush for the prevention of respiratory infections among the dependent elderly. However, the short-term effects from each oral care method have not yet been clarified. Hence, an investigation was conducted by having each subject independently perform various oral care methods for five consecutive days. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects consisted of 12 assistance-dependent elderly who have difficulties with tooth brushing by themselves, have 10 or more residual teeth and are not yet using plate dentures. After the pre-intervention examination, each of the following oral care methods were performed on the same subject on an approximately three week basis: 1) Tooth brushing 2) Tongue cleaning with sponge brush 3) Wiping on oral mucous with sponge brush by chlorhexidine. Each method was performed independently, once a day for 5 consecutive days and the subjects were reexamined on the sixth day for comparative verification. RESULTS: Consequently, toothbrushing decreased the plaque index and gingival index significantly and an improvement of oral malodour was also acknowledged (p < 0.01). Tongue cleaning with a sponge brush decreased the tongue coat score significantly (p < 0.05) and oral malodour was also improved (p < 0.01). Wiping on oral mucous with a sponge brush soaked in chlorhexidine significantly decreased opportunistic infections in the pharynx region (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It was suggested that the use of not only a toothbrush but also chlorhexidine gluconate may be indicated for dependent elderly people in whom pathogens of opportunistic infection are detected.
TI  - Extracellular DNA in biofilms.
AB  - Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. Its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, then Enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. Autolysis is the common mechanism by which eDNA is released. In P. aeruginosa eDNA is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. In E. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. In Staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells. In S. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in S. epidermidis by the autolysin protein AtlE. In P. aeruginosa eDNA is located primarily in the stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. In S. aureus the crucial role of eDNA in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of DNase I. eDNA represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. eDNA and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the TLR family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).
TI  - AFM study of the differential inhibitory effects of the green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a main constituent of tea catechins, affects Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria differently; however, the underlying mechanisms are not clearly understood. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to compare morphological alterations in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria induced by EGCG and by H(2)O(2) at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). EGCG initially induced aggregates in the cell envelopes of Staphylococcus aureus and eventually caused cell lysis, which was not observed in cells treated with H(2)O(2). It initially induced nanoscale perforations or microscale grooves in the cell envelopes of Escherichia coli O157:H7 which eventually disappeared, similar to E. coli cells treated with H(2)O(2). An E. coli O157:H7 tpx mutant, with a defect in thioredoxin-dependent thiol peroxidase (Tpx), was more severely damaged by EGCG when compared with its wild type. Similar differing effects were observed in other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria when exposed to EGCG; it caused aggregated in Streptococcus mutans, while it caused grooves in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AFM results suggest that the major morphological changes of Gram-negative bacterial cell walls induced by EGCG depend on H(2)O(2) release. This is not the case for Gram-positive bacteria. Oxidative stress in Gram-negative bacteria induced by EGCG was confirmed by flow cytometry.
TI  - Quantitative evaluation of bacteria adherent and in biofilm on single-wall carbon nanotube-coated surfaces.
AB  - Biofilm is a common bacterial lifestyle, and it plays a crucial role in human health, causing biofilm-mediated infections. Recently, to counteract biofilm development, new nano-structured biomaterials have been proposed. However, data about the antibacterial properties of nano-structured surfaces are fragmentary and controversial, and, in particular, the susceptibility of nano-structured materials to colonization and biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens has not been yet thoroughly considered. Here, the ability of the pathogenic Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to adhere and form biofilm on surfaces coated with single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was analyzed. Our results showed that the surfaces of SWCNTs-coated glass beads (SWCNTs-GBs) were colonized at the same extent of uncoated GBs both by S. mutans and P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that single wall SWCNTs-coated surfaces are not suitable to counteract bacterial adhesion and biofilm development.
TI  - A new biphenyl and antimicrobial activity of extracts and compounds from Clusia burlemarxii.
AB  - Phytochemical investigation on Clusia burlemarxii (Clusiaceae) led to isolation and identification of nine compounds. Were isolated from leaves 3-O-alpha-L- rhamnopyranosylquercetin, 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosylkaempferol, 4-hydroxy-5,5-dimethyldihydrofuran-2-one, 2Z-delta-tocotrienoloic acid and friedelin and were isolated from trunk betulinic acid, protocatechuic acid, lyoniresinol, and a new biphenyl 2,2-dimethyl-3,5-dihydroxy-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)chromane. The structures were determined by (1)H, (1)(3)C-NMR, DEPT, HMBC, HMQC, HRESIMS. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentration against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella choleraesuis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus niger and Cladosporium cladosporioides was also determined. Extracts and compounds showed significant activity against tested Gram-positive bacteria, none activity against tested Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Influence of hyaluronic acid on bacterial and fungal species, including clinically relevant opportunistic pathogens.
AB  - Hyaluronic acid (HA) has several clinical applications (aesthetic surgery, dermatology, orthopaedics and ophtalmology). Following recent evidence, suggesting antimicrobial and antiviral properties for HA, we investigated its effects on 15 ATCC strains, representative of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal species. The in vitro system employed allowed to assess optical density of broth cultures as a measure of microbial load in a time-dependent manner. The results showed that different microbial species and, sometimes, different strains belonging to the same species, are differently affected by HA. In particular, staphylococci, enterococci, Streptococcus mutans, two Escherichia coli strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida glabrata and C. parapsilosis displayed a HA dose-dependent growth inhibition; no HA effects were detected in E. coli ATCC 13768 and C. albicans; S. sanguinis was favoured by the highest HA dose. Therefore, the influence of HA on bacteria and fungi warrants further studies aimed at better establishing its relevance in clinical applications.
TI  - Assessment of the antibacterial activity of calcium hydroxide combined with chlorhexidine paste and other intracanal medications against bacterial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro antibacterial activity of four formulations of calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)(2)] pastes against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus mutans. METHODS: A broth dilution test was performed, and the lengths of time for different pastes to kill the microbial cells were recorded and statistically analyzed. The following medications were assessed: Group I - Ca(OH)(2) + 2.0% chlorhexidine (CHX) gel; Group II - Ca(OH)(2) + camphorated paramonochlorophenol (CMCP) and propylene glycol; Group III - Ca(OH)(2) + propylene glycol; Group IV - Ca(OH)(2) + saline. RESULTS: The results showed that E. faecalis was the most resistant microorganism. Groups II and III eliminated all the microbial cells in 15 seconds. Group I took 45 seconds to eliminate E. faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, it was concluded that all the intracanal medications tested showed antibacterial activity. However, the association of Ca(OH)(2) and PMCC or Ca(OH)(2) and propylene glycol showed a better performance, since Groups II and III took a shorter length of time than the other groups to eliminate S. aureus and E. faecalis.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci in viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. However, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways has not yet been examined. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (VGS), in terms of MICs and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs). METHODS: The MICs of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the QRDRs for 190 isolates of VGS, originating from the sputa of adult CF patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. VGS organisms included Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus australis and Streptococcus mutans. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and QRDRs within the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs >/=8 mg/L) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (MICs 4 mg/L). As a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive VGS organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-CF patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. Five novel QRDR PCR assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the CF VGS population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential QRDR resistance mutations. Double mutations in gyrA and parC/parE led to MICs of 16 to >64 mg/L, while single mutations in parC or parE resulted in MICs of 8-32 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively. The mean homologies of each species to Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 were: gyrA, 70.3%-95%; gyrB, 69.6%-96.2%; parC, 76.1%-94.8%; and parE, 70.7%-94.7%. The close relatives of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis and S. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of P. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with CF may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal VGS flora, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the Streptococcus milleri group.
TI  - Proposal of protocols using D-glutamine to optimize the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenly)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) assay for indirect estimation of microbial loads in biofilms of medical importance.
AB  - Due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. One reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. XTT presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. However, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. This study evaluated the effectiveness of D-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (TAC), as inducer of XTT reduction. The metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC(R)27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC(R)13883, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC(R)12228, Streptococcus mutans ATCC(R)25175, and Candida albicans SC5314 were evaluated. Results showed that D-glutamine 50 mM (for P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. epidermidis) and 25 mM (for S. mutans and C. albicans) may enhance the detection of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the XTT reduction assay more robust.
TI  - Additive effects of orexin B and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide on LL-37-mediated antimicrobial activities.
AB  - The present study examined the bactericidal effects of orexin B (ORXB) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) alone or combined with cationic antimicrobial peptides, such as LL-37, on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans and Staphylococcus aureus. The bactericidal effect of ORXB or VIP alone was detected in low NaCl concentration, but attenuated in physiological NaCl concentration (150 mM). However, such attenuated bactericidal activities of ORXB and VIP in 150 mM NaCl were regained by adding LL-37. Therefore, our results indicate that VIP and ORXB appear to mediate bactericidal effects in concert with LL-37 in the physiological context of mucosal tissue.
TI  - Effects of deuterium oxide on Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - A complex aggregation of microorganisms growing on a solid substrate is termed a  biofilm and is considered to be an etiological agents. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus mutans are representative bacteria in such biofilms. It is well known that deuterium oxide (D(2)O) causes toxic effects on a number of biological systems. We investigated the effects of D(2)O on growth and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa and S. mutans. These bacteria were incubated in medium containing D(2)O (100%, 75% or 0%) at 37 degrees C for 24hr, 48 hr or 72 hr. Growth of P. aeruginosa was inhibited by D(2)O within the first 48 hr. However, after 72 hr, growth rate was seen to increase in the D(2)O-containing medium compared with in medium without D(2)O. In contrast, the growth of S. mutans in the D(2)O medium was inhibited within 72 hr. The biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa was increased in the D(2)O medium. Biofilm formation of S. mutans in the D(2)O medium increased compared with in the medium without D(2)O, but this increase was only temporary in the case of P. aeruginosa. Compared to biofilm formation in 0% D(2)O medium marked as 100%, the biofilm formation rate of S. mutans in 75% D(2)O medium was 143% at 24 hr, 146% at 48 hr and 130% at 72 hr. In other D(2)O concentration media biofilm formation was lower. In 100% D(2)O medium, biofilm formation rate decreased from 114% at 24 hr to 56% at 72 hr. The biofilm formation rate of P. aeruginosa in 100% D(2)O medium was 172% at 24 hr, but decreased to 88% at 72 hr. Biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa in 75% and 0% D(2)O media showed no significant difference. We consider that these results were due to stress or alteration in bacterial metabolisms.
TI  - Light insensitive silver(I) cyanoximates as antimicrobial agents for indwelling medical devices.
AB  - Ten silver(I) cyanoximates of AgL composition (L = NC-C(NO)-R, where R is electron withdrawing groups: -CN, -C(O)NR(2), -C(O)R' (alkyl), -C(O)OEt, 2-heteroaryl fragments such as 2-pyridyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 2-benzoxazolyl, 2-benzthiazolyl) were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods and X-ray analysis. Crystal structures of four complexes were determined and revealed the formation of two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymers of different complexity in which anions exhibit bridging or combined chelate and bridging binding modes. In these compounds, anions are in the nitroso form. All studied AgL complexes are sparingly soluble in water and are thermally stable to 150 degrees C. Synthesized compounds demonstrated remarkable insensitivity toward visible light and UV-radiation, which was explained based on their polymeric structures with multiple covalent bonds between bridging cyanoxime ligands and Ag(I) centers. All 10 silver(I) cyanoximates were tested in vitro on the subject of their antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus hirae, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium fortuitum as well as against Candida albicans in solutions, and in the solid state as pressed pellets and dried filter paper disks presoaked with solutions of AgL in DMF. Results showed pronounced antimicrobial activity for all investigated complexes. A combination of five factors: (1) light insensitivity, (2) poor water solubility, (3) high thermal stability, (4) lack of toxicity of organic ligands, and (5) in vitro antimicrobial activity allows development of silver(I) cyanoximates for medical applications. These include antimicrobial additives to acrylate glue, cured by UV-radiation, used in introduction of prosthetic joints and dental implants, and prevention of biofilm formation on several types of indwelling medical devices.
TI  - Comparative effect of chlorhexidine and some mouthrinses on bacterial biofilm formation on titanium surface.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and commonly used mouthrinses to single- and poly-species biofilms by S. mutans, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, on titanium discs of grade IV. The formation of single- and poly-species biofilms at 16.5, 40.5 and 64.5-h incubation on titanium surface was evaluated by plate count (CFU ml(-)(1)) before and after exposure to CHX and four mouthrinses (Curasept, Listerine, Meridol and Buccagel) and expressed as percentage of Inhibitory Activity (IA%). The application of the different anti-plaque formulations on biofilm can reduce the adhesion of bacteria to titanium surface with different degrees. The higher efficacy was observed for Listerine that shows IA% = 100 on the biofilm formed by S. mutans at 16.5 h. Log count of CFU was dependent to culture time and four mouthrinses for S. mutans and S. aureus, whilst was not dependent to culture time but to mouthrinses for P. aeruginosa. In general, the efficacy was particularly lesser to poly-species biofilms; no statistical differences were evidenced between all the mouthrinses and CHX as control group. The tested mouthrinses, compared to reference CHX 0.2%, have demonstrated a significant lower antibacterial activity than Listerine towards the experimental biofilms. This "in vitro" biofilm model should prove extremely useful for pre-clinical testing of anti-plaque agents, which inhibit biofilm formation, can prevent subsequent implant failure.
TI  - 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose and its derivatives: biosynthesis, preparation and potential medical applications.
AB  - 1,5-Anhydro-D-fructose (AF) was first found in fungi and red algae. It is produced by the degradation of glycogen, starch and maltosaccharides with alpha-1,4-glucan lyase (EC 4.2.2.13). In vivo, AF is metabolized to 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol (AG), ascopyrone P (APP), microthecin and other derivatives via the anhydrofructose pathway. The genes coding for the enzymes in this pathway have been cloned, enabling the large-scale production of AF and related products in a cell-free reactor. The possible applications of these products in medicine have been evaluated using both in vitro and in vivo systems. Thus AF is a useful anticariogenic agent as it inhibits the growth of the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans, impairing the production of plaque-forming polysaccharides and lactic acid. AF also shows anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects. AG is used as a diabetic marker for glycemic control. AG also stimulates insulin secretion in insulinoma cell lines. in vivo, APP has been shown to lengthen the life span of cancer-afflicted mice. It interferes with tumor growth and metastasis by its cidal effects on fast multiplying cells. Microthecin inhibits the growth of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, particularly under anaerobic conditions. The pharmaceutical usefulness of the other AF metabolites 1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol,1-deoxymannojirimycin, haliclonol, 5-epipentenomycin I, bissetone, palythazine, isopalythazine, and clavulazine remains to be investigated. In this review AF and its metabolites as the bioactive natural products for their pharmaceutical potentials are discussed.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Sugar fatty acid esters inhibit biofilm formation by food-borne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Effects of food additives on biofilm formation by food-borne pathogenic bacteria  were investigated. Thirty-three potential food additives and 3 related compounds were added to the culture medium at concentrations from 0.001 to 0.1% (w/w), followed by inoculation and cultivation of five biofilm-forming bacterial strains for the evaluation of biofilm formation. Among the tested food additives, 21 showed inhibitory effects of biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and in particular, sugar fatty acid esters showed significant anti-biofilm activity. Sugar fatty acid esters with long chain fatty acid residues (C14-16) exerted their inhibitory effect at the concentration of 0.001% (w/w), but bacterial growth was not affected at this low concentration. Activities of the sugar fatty acid esters positively correlated with the increase of the chain length of the fatty acid residues. Sugar fatty acid esters inhibited the initial attachment of the S. aureus cells to the abiotic surface. Sugar fatty acid esters with long chain fatty acid residues (C14-16) also inhibited biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans and Listeria monocytogenes at 0.01% (w/w), while the inhibition of biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa required the addition of a far higher concentration (0.1% (w/w)) of the sugar fatty acid esters.
TI  - Disinfection of irreversible hydrocolloid impression material with chlorinated compounds.
AB  - PROBLEM: Irreversible hydrocolloid (alginate) impressions are dimensionally unstable and difficult to disinfect. PURPOSE: To evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of a chlorite disinfectant (Presept) and a new formulation chlorine dioxide based disinfectant (Aseptrol) on irreversible hydrocolloid (alginate) impression material. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Alginate blocks were contaminated with Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans and Bacillus subtilis spores. The blocks were placed either in sterile distilled water as control, or in 48-ppm Aseptrol or Presept solution containing organic matter. Immersion times were 30 seconds, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 and 5 minutes. The blocks were then placed in sterile 0.5% sodium thiosulphate neutralizer and surviving organisms were harvested and counted using the serial dilution technique followed by culturing on appropriate media. The anti-microbial efficacy of the solution was tested for 37 days. RESULTS: There was a consistent significant reduction (99.99%) in all tests of vegetative organisms after immersion in the Aseptrol for 30 seconds, and for spores after 1.5 minutes. It was effective against vegetative organisms for up to 27 days for a 30-second exposure. Presept significantly reduced (99.99%) C. albicans, S. aureus and S. mutans in 30 seconds, P. aeruginosa in 60 seconds, but for B. subtilis spores took at least 5 minutes. It was effective against vegetative organisms for >37 days for a 30-second exposure. CONCLUSION: Within the limits of this study it was found that both compounds effectively disinfected the alginate in the presence of organic material, but that Aseptrol did so after an immersion time of only 1.5 minutes. This immersion time is less likely to affect the dimensional properties of the impression material. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The short action time of Aseptrol may make it ideal for the disinfection of alginate impressions, and it may also find many uses for disinfection and possible sterilisation.
TI  - Isolation and identification of antimicrobial compound from Mentha longifolia L.  leaves grown wild in Iraq.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mentha longifolia L. (Lamiaceae) leaves have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation by the indigenous people of Iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. In the present study, an antimicrobial compound was isolated and characterized, and its biological activity was assessed. METHODS: The compound was isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oil using different spectral techniques: TLC, FTIR spectra and HPLC. Antimicrobial activity of the compound was assessed using both disc diffusion and microdilution method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. RESULTS: A known compound was isolated from the essential oil of the plant and was identified as (-) menthol. The isolated compound was investigated for its antimicrobial activity against seven selected pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the yeast Candida albicans. Menthol at different concentrations (1:1, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20) was active against all tested bacteria except for P. aeruginosa, and the highest inhibitory effect was observed against S. mutans (zone of inhibition: 25.3 mm) using the disc diffusion method. Minimal inhibitory concentration MIC values ranged from 15.6-125.0 microg/ml, and the most promising results were observed against S. aureus and S. mutans (MIC 15.6 microg/ml) while, S. faecalis, S. pyogenis and L. acidophilus ranked next (MIC 31.2 microg/ml). Furthermore, menthol achieved considerable antifungal activity against the yeast C. albicans (zone of inhibition range: 7.1-18.5 mm; MIC: 125.0). CONCLUSION: The isolation of an antimicrobial compound from M. longifolia leaves validates the use of this plant in the treatment of minor sore throat and minor mouth or throat irritation.
TI  - Effect of three methods for cleaning dentures on biofilms formed in vitro on acrylic resin.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of three denture hygiene methods against different microbial biofilms formed on acrylic resin specimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The set (sterile stainless steel basket and specimens) was contaminated (37 degrees C for 48 hours) by a microbial inoculum with 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml (standard strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis; field strains: S. mutans, C. albicans, C. glabrata, and C. tropicalis). After inoculation, specimens were cleansed by the following methods: (1) chemical: immersion in an alkaline peroxide solution (Bonyplus tablets) for 5 minutes; (2) mechanical: brushing with a dentifrice for removable prostheses (Dentu Creme) for 20 seconds; and (3) a combination of chemical and mechanical methods. Specimens were applied onto a Petri plate with appropriate culture medium for 10 minutes. Afterward, the specimens were removed and the plates incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. RESULTS: Chemical, mechanical, and combination methods showed no significant difference in the reduction of CFU for S. aureus, S. mutans (ATCC and field strain), and P. aeruginosa. Mechanical and combination methods were similar and more effective than the chemical method for E. faecalis, C. albicans (ATCC and field strain), and C. glabrata. The combination method was better than the chemical method for E. coli and C. tropicalis, and the mechanical method showed intermediate results. CONCLUSION: The three denture hygiene methods showed different effects depending on the type of microbial biofilms formed on acrylic base resin specimens.
TI  - Increase in detectable opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity of orthodontic patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to detect the opportunistic bacteria and fungi from the oral cavities of orthodontic patients and examine the ability of the organisms to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. METHODS: Opportunistic bacteria and fungi were isolated from 58 patients (orthodontic group: 42; non-orthodontic group: 16) using culture methods and were identified based on their biochemical and enzymatic profiles. Seven opportunistic and four streptococcal strains were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. RESULTS: More opportunistic bacteria and fungi were detected in the orthodontic group than in the non-orthodontic group (P < 0.05). Opportunistic bacteria adhered to saliva-coated metallic brackets to the same degree as oral streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation frequencies of opportunistic bacteria and fungi increase during orthodontic treatment, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to oral hygiene in orthodontic patients to prevent periodontal disease and the aggravation of systemic disease in immunocompromised conditions.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - The influence of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. A potassium salt of CLA (CLA-K) was tested against three Gram-positive strains ( Bacillus cereus , Staphylococcus aureus , and Streptococcus mutans ) and five Gram-negative strains ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Salmonella typhimurium , Vibrio parahemolyticus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Proteus mirabilis ). CLA-K-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the Gram-positive strains. The IC(50) value of CLA-K was 0.3 mM for B. cereus, 1.2 mM for S. aureus, and 0.3 mM for S. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mM for K. pneumoniae, 1.2 mM for P. aeruginosa, 1.8 mM for S. typhimurium, 1.8 mM for V. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mM for P. mirabilis. The CLA-K delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower CLA-K concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. All cells grown in the medium containing CLA-K contained CLA in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in Gram-positive than Gram-negative strains. Higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (LDH), protein content, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evident in Gram-positive strains than in Gram-negative strains. These results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by CLA mediated through the lipid peroxidation of CLA in the membranes and in the medium.
TI  - Tuning the surface-enhanced Raman scattering effect to different molecular groups by switching the silver colloid solution pH.
AB  - Silver colloids were produced for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) experiments using hydroxylamine hydrochloride as the reduction agent. The roles of hydroxylamine hydrochloride and bulk solution pH values in the formation of functional groups on the surface of silver colloids and in determining the dimensions of silver colloids were examined using Raman, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and zeta-size measurements. The spectrum of hydroxylamine hydrochloride reduced silver colloids was compared with the spectrum of sodium borohydride reduced colloids. The effect of colloid solution pH on SERS results was demonstrated using analyte molecules with biological significance, such as ribonucleic acid, egg albumin, L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine, and glucose. In general, it was shown that at high pH values the SERS effect was more pronounced due to the surface functional groups and colloid dimensions, and sharp, high spectral intensity values were obtained. At low pH values, protonation and rapid aggregation of colloids occurred and the surface chemistry was different. Depending on the analyte, bands were shifted, broadened, and/or the enhancement effect was reduced. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Streptococcus mutans it was also shown that by changing the solution bulk pH value, it was possible to enhance the response from different molecular groups in the bacteria and obtain different spectra from the same bacteria strain and the process was reversible. It was concluded that it is possible to produce site- or molecule-specific metal colloids and to tune the SERS effect to certain functional groups of analytes by means of the pH of colloidal suspension.
TI  - Evaluation of Antibacterial Effectiveness of Desensitizers against Oral Bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Desensitizers contribute to better clinical results by reducing the rate of cervical dentin sensitivity. However, information on their antibacterial effect is limited. This study examined the antibacterial activities of a triclosan containing (Seal & Protect), a benzalconium containing desensitizer (Micro Prime), a fluoride containing prophilaxy paste (Sultan Desensitizer), two fluoride containing varnishes (Cavity Shealth and Ultra EZ), and a dentin bonding primer (All Bond). METHODS: The test materials were inserted in the wells of Muller Hinton agar plates inoculated with Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarious, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The diameters of the inhibition zones produced around the materials were measured after 24 h of incubation. The results were analyzed by the Kruskal Wallis one way ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney tests at a significance level of P<.05. RESULTS: Micro Prime Desensitizer containing benzalkonium chloride had the highest antibacterial effectiveness compared to other desensitizers used in this study. In addition, triclosan containing Seal & Protect and acidic components containing All Bond showed very high antibacterial efficacy. On the other hand, fluoride within both varnishes had little antibacterial effectiveness. However a fluoride component in a paste (Sultan Desensitizer) showed very high bactericidal effect. CONCLUSIONS: All desensitizers except fluoride varnishes showed various degrees of antibacterial effect against the bacteria tested in this study. If antibacterial effect is also required from the desensitizers' clinicians should avoid use of varnishes.
TI  - Design and activity of a 'dual-targeted' antimicrobial peptide.
AB  - Numerous reports have indicated the important role of human normal flora in the prevention of microbial pathogenesis and disease. Evidence suggests that infections at mucosal surfaces result from the outgrowth of subpopulations or clusters within a microbial community and are not linked to one pathogenic organism alone. To preserve the protective normal flora whilst treating the majority of infective bacteria in the community, a tuneable therapeutic is necessary that can discriminate between benign bystanders and multiple pathogenic organisms. Here we describe the proof-of-principle for such a multitargeted antimicrobial: a multiple-headed specifically targeted antimicrobial peptide (MH-STAMP). The completed MH-STAMP, M8(KH)-20, displays specific activity against targeted organisms in vitro (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus mutans) and can remove both species from a mixed planktonic culture with little impact against untargeted bacteria. These results demonstrate that a functional, dual-targeted molecule can be constructed from a wide-spectrum antimicrobial peptide precursor.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neuropeptides against a range of micro-organisms from skin, oral, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract sites.
AB  - Many neuropeptides are similar in size, amino acid composition and charge to antimicrobial peptides. This study aimed to determine whether the neuropeptides substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), displayed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. SP, NPY, VIP and CGRP displayed variable degrees of antimicrobial activity against all the pathogens tested with the exception of S. aureus. These antimicrobial activities add a further dimension to the immunomodulatory roles for neuropeptides in the inflammatory and immune responses.
TI  - Distribution of bacteria and fungi in the earthworm Libyodrillus violaceous (Annelida: Oligochaeta), a native earthworm from Nigeria.
AB  - Earthworms are soil invertebrates that play a key role in recycling organic matter in soils. In Nigeria, earthworms include Libyodrillus violaceous. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts, as well as fungal counts of viable microorganisms in soils and gut sections, were made on twenty L. violaceous collected from different sites on the campus of the University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria. The samples were collected between April and November, 2002. Numbers of microorganisms were higher in castings and gut sections than in un-ingested soil samples. The guts and their contents also had higher moisture and total nitrogen contents than the un-ingested soils. Bacteria and fungi isolated from the samples were identified by standard microbiological procedures on the bases of their morphological and biochemical characteristics. Isolated bacteria were identified as Staphylococcus, Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, Clostridium, Spirocheata spp., Azotobacter spp., Micrococcus lylae, Acinetobacter spp., Halobacterium for bacteria. Yeast isolates were identified as Candida spp., Zygosaccharomyces spp., Pichia spp., and Saccharomyces spp while molds were identified as, Aspergillus spp., Pytium spp., Penicillium spp., Fusarium spp and Rhizopus spp. Of the five locations examined, the refuse dump area had the highest numbers of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms, followed by the arboretum while the cultivated land area recorded the lowest counts. The higher numbers of microorganisms observed in the gut sections and casts of the earthworms examined in this work reinforce the general concept that the gut and casts of earthworms show higher microbial diversity and activity than the surrounding soil.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of Vicryl Plus suture (coated Polyglactin 910 with triclosan) using zone of inibition assays.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy, of an absorbable suture coated with triclosan (Vicryl Plus((R))) against two bacteria, potential responsible for the development of oral diseases: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus mutans. METHODS: Vicryl Plus 3-0 and Vicryl 3-0 were tested for their efficiency against P. aeruginosa and S. Mutans. 27 segments 10 cm long each, of every suture, have been tested against P. Aeruginosa and S. Mutans respectively. Every sample has been dipped in a broth culture containing pure dried stocks of P. aeruginosa and S. mutans and placed in a Petri dish right after. Four hours later the sutures have been aseptically removed and placed in a selective culture. The incubation time was 18 hours for P. aeruginosa and 43 hours for S. mutans at 37 degrees C. The antimicrobial efficacy of both sutures was performed by measuring the length of the bacteria-free suture segment. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference between Vicryl Plus 3-0 and Vicryl 3-0 has been observed, with an higher bacterial growth on Vicryl 3-0 for both bacteria (P. aeruginosa and S. mutans). CONCLUSIONS: Vicryl Plus presented an antibacterial effectiveness in vitro against both P. aeruginosa and S. mutans.
TI  - An analysis of the persistent presence of opportunistic pathogens on patient-derived dental impressions and gypsum casts.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the persistent presence of microorganisms on  patient-derived dental impressions and gypsum casts, while highlighting important human pathogens such as Candida, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The practices and opinions regarding cross-infection control from 59 general dentists in Japan were obtained via a questionnaire. Alginate impressions were made from 56 patients. Using a brain heart infusion agar medium, impression and imprint cultures were carried out to visualize the microbial contamination on the surfaces of the impressions and gypsum casts, respectively. The colonies on the surfaces of the 30 impression cultures and 26 imprint cultures were collected by swabbing and then inoculated onto selective agar plates to detect streptococci, staphylococci, Candida, MRSA, and P aeruginosa. RESULTS: The questionnaire showed that only 54% of general dentists had a cross-infection policy in their dental clinics, and only 30% to 40% were aware of the possible persistence of MRSA or P aeruginosa on impressions and gypsum casts. The impression/imprint cultures grew a large number of visible bacterial colonies on all of impression/gypsum cast samples investigated. Selective agar cultures demonstrated the presence of streptococci (100, 100%), staphylococci (56.7, 65.4%), Candida (30, 46.2%), MRSA (26.7, 15.4%), and P aeruginosa (6.7, 7.7%) on the impressions and the gypsum casts, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation showed that patient-derived dental impressions and gypsum casts are contaminated with numerous microbes, including Candida, MRSA, and P aeruginosa, which are known pathogens responsible for nosocomial and/or life-threatening infection in the immunocompromised host.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial efficiency of a mouthwash containing triclosan/gantrez and sodium bicarbonate.
AB  - Several antiseptic substances have been used as adjuncts to routine mechanical procedures of oral hygiene, based on their antimicrobial effects. The objective of this study was to assess in vitro the antimicrobial efficiency of a mouthwash containing Triclosan/Gantrez and sodium bicarbonate in comparison to both positive and negative controls. Standard strain samples of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Actinomyces viscosus and Bacillus subtilis were used. Samples of Streptococcus mutans and Gram-negative bacilli were collected from 20 volunteers (10 with a clinically healthy periodontium and 10 presenting biofilm-associated gingivitis). Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity was performed by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). The results indicated that the test solution inhibited the growth of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms from the volunteers saliva as well as that of the standard strains at the MIC dilution of 1:20, whereas the MIC dilution of 0.12% chlorhexidine against the same bacteria was 1:80. Thus, even though the tested mouthrinse solution presented an in-vitro antimicrobial activity superior to that of a placebo, it was inferior to that of chlorhexidine.
TI  - Reduced medical infection related bacterial strains adhesion on bioactive RGD modified titanium surfaces: a first step toward cell selective surfaces.
AB  - Ideally, implants should inhibit nonspecific protein adsorption, bacterial adhesion, and at the same time, depending on the final application be selective toward cellular adhesion and spreading for all or only selected cell types. Poly(L-lysine)-grafted-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLL-g-PEG) polymers have been shown to adsorb from aqueous solution onto negatively charged metal oxide surfaces, reducing protein adsorption as well as fibroblast, osteoblast and epithelial cell adhesion significantly. PLL-g-PEG can be functionalized with bioligands such as RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp), which then restores host cell adhesion, but the surface remains resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption. Previously, it was also shown that both nonfunctionalized PLL-g-PEG and RGD-peptide functionalized PLL-g-PEG reduced the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus to titanium (Ti) surfaces. The present study looked at the effect of other implant associated infection relevant bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa towards the same surface chemistries. The different surfaces were exposed to the bacteria for 1-24 h, and bacteria surface density was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence light microscopy (FM). The adhesion of all bacteria strains tested was reduced on Ti surfaces coated with PLL-g-PEG compared to uncoated Ti surfaces even in the presence of RGD. The percentage reduction in bacterial adhesion over the 24-h culture time investigated was 88%-98%, depending on the bacteria type. Therefore, coating surfaces with PLL-g-PEG/PEG-RGD allows cells such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts to attach but not bacteria, resulting in a selective biointeractive pattern that may be useful on medical implants.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Uncaria tomentosa against oral human pathogens.
AB  - Uncaria tomentosa is considered a medicinal plant used over centuries by the peruvian population as an alternative treatment for several diseases. Many microorganisms usually inhabit the human oral cavity and under certain conditions can become etiologic agents of diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of Uncaria tomentosa on different strains of microorganisms isolated from the human oral cavity. Micropulverized Uncaria tomentosa was tested in vitro to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) on selected microbial strains. The tested strains were oral clinical isolates of Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus spp., Candida albicans, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The tested concentrations of Uncaria tomentosa ranged from 0.25-5% in Mueller-Hinton agar. Three percent Uncaria tomentosa inhibited 8% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 52% of S. mutans and 96% of Staphylococcus spp. The tested concentrations did not present inhibitory effect on P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. It could be concluded that micropulverized Uncaria tomentosa presented antimicrobial activity on Enterobacteriaceae, S. mutans and Staphylococcus spp. isolates.
TI  - Resin-based dentin restorative materials under accelerated ageing: bio-functional behavior.
AB  - OBJECT: The aim of the present study was the evaluation of the effect of different polishing and finishing procedures on Filtek Z250 FZ ESPE restorative material. Particularly, the consequence of artificial aging (UV-irradiation) on this resin-based dental material was investigated determining also its outcome on cell behavior. METHODS: 96 specimens of restorative material were prepared using a light emitting diode curing unit and randomly divided into four finishing and polishing groups: (I) No treatment (FZ); (II) Identoflex rubbers (ID); (III) Enhance System (EN) and (IV) Sof-Lex Pop-on XT discs (SF). The surface morphology of native and artificially aged materials was assessed with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). FTIR and biological (biocompatibility and bacterial adhesion) analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Among all, the ID procedure represented an acceptable compromise for efficiency of polymerization and biocompatibility both before and after artificial ageing. SF and EN techniques showed better interactions with the biological environment. CONCLUSION: UV artificial ageing of the tested specimens has shown an acceleration of the surface degrading processes, favoring a possible decrease in the mechanical properties and the release of toxic free radicals. Finishing and polishing procedure seemed to affect the photodegrading pathways, even though no differences among the techniques were observed. As the cytotoxicity of materials undergoing accelerated aging is relevant, further improvement of dental restorative materials are required to limit the long-term biological damage.
TI  - An alternative infrared spectroscopy assay for the quantification of polysaccharides in bacterial samples.
AB  - The ability of bacteria to produce extracellular polysaccharides has been regarded as an indication of biofilm-forming capacity. Therefore, the determination of the sugar content in bacterial samples becomes a significant parameter. The colorimetric methods currently used are rather sensitive to the nature of the sugars and therefore require knowledge of the sugar types present in the samples. Unfortunately, the types of sugars present in bacteria are generally unknown and often composed of a complex mixture. In this article, we propose an alternative method based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for the estimation of the total sugar content in bacterial samples. The method is based on a systematic treatment of FTIR spectra obtained from dried bacteria samples. It is assumed that the total sugar amount can be estimated from the area of characteristic bands between 970 and 1182 cm(-1). In parallel, the amide II band (1560-1530 cm(-1)) associated with proteins, or the C-H stretching region (2820-3020 cm(-1)) associated with the biomass, can be used for normalization purposes. Therefore, the ratio of the band area in the sugar window over that of the amide II or C-H stretching can be used to report the sugar content in bacterial samples. This method has been validated on model bacterial mixtures containing sugars, proteins, and DNA. Results with real bacterial samples are also provided and show conclusively that increased sugar contents in biofilms can be identified. The proposed FTIR approach requires minimal sample preparation and a single acquisition, is rapid, and may be applied to any kind of bacterial growth.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Substance P and Neuropeptide Y against laboratory strains of bacteria and oral microorganisms.
AB  - Infection and inflammation of mucosal tissue may induce the production of neuropeptides, specifically Substance P and Neuropeptide Y. Since these neuropeptides are similar to antimicrobial peptides in their amino acid composition, amphipathic design, cationic charge, and size, we wanted to determine if they had antimicrobial activity against a panel of common bacteria and oral microorganisms using the radial diffusion assay. Neuropeptide Y and Substance P had antimicrobial activity against E. coli (MIC 20.6+/-5.5 microg/ml SEM and 71.5+/-15 SEM microg/ml, respectively), but did not have activity against laboratory strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (MIC>500 microg/ml) nor oral strains of Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (MIC>500 microg/ml). While Substance P and Neuropeptide Y did not have direct antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested, they still may stimulate local epithelial cells to produce other innate immune factors like defensins and cathelicidins. However, this remains to be determined.
TI  - Glycoprotein 340 in normal human ocular surface tissues and tear film.
AB  - The tear film is a complex mixture of secreted fluid, ions, proteins, glycoproteins, and lipids that lubricates and protects the ocular surface. Recently, several antimicrobial peptides have been described in the tear fluid. In this study, we describe the presence of the large secreted glycoprotein gp340 in the tear film. Western blot analysis showed that gp340 is abundant in secreted tears and in the lacrimal glands. Lesser amounts of gp340 were detected in the cornea and conjunctiva. Consistent with Western blot data, reverse transcription-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR showed that gp340 transcripts were abundant in lacrimal gland tissue and were also present in the cornea and conjunctiva. Immunohistochemistry localized gp340 to the acinar cells of the lacrimal gland and the deeper layers of the conjunctival epithelium. gp340 was not detected in conjunctival goblet cells. In the cornea, gp340 was present only in a peripheral band of basal epithelial cells, suggesting that gp340 may play a role in the cycle of corneal epithelial renewal. To determine if tear film gp340 may function as a bacterial agglutinin as it does in saliva, tears were incubated with streptococcal cells and the formation of bacterial aggregates was monitored. Addition of tears to late-exponential-phase Streptococcus mutans cells resulted in time- and dose-dependent aggregation of the bacteria. Furthermore, Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of cell-associated gp340 in isolated bacterial aggregates. The ocular pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa, also aggregated when incubated with tears. These results suggest that gp340 is a normal component of the tear film and that the glycoprotein may function as a bacterial agglutinin.
TI  - Effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of Candida albicans biofilms.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro Candida albicans biofilm development. A single isolate of C. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species of oral bacteria comprising, Actinomyces israelii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Prevotella nigrescens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. Biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of Candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. A viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. Co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on Candida biofilm formation. Co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (P<0.05), except for L. acidophilus, S. mutans, and, S. intermedius co-cultures. Further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration of either P. gingivalis or E. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (P<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. Taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate C. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.
TI  - Effect of MUC7 peptides on the growth of bacteria and on Streptococcus mutans biofilm.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the susceptibility of selected bacteria as well as Streptococcus mutans biofilm to MUC7 peptides and compare the activities with those of other known antimicrobial peptides. METHODS: MIC and MBC of peptides for S. mutans, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus gordonii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using the microdilution method. For S. mutans, the effects of the peptides on the kinetics of growth inhibition, time-killing, and on biofilm formation and reduction were also examined. For biofilm studies, polystyrene microtitre plates, Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) and hydroxylapatite (HA) discs, along with Crystal Violet and Alamar Blue dyes, and/or EM observations, were employed. RESULTS: S. mutans was the most susceptible to all peptides tested (MICs of 9.4-25.0 microM), compared with the other species (MICs of 3.1->100 microM). MUC7 peptides (except MUC7-12-mer-L4) exerted 2-fold higher activity against S. mutans than Hsn5-12-mer and magainin-II, and faster killing of S. mutans than Hsn5-12-mer. The MUC7 peptides also had an effect on S. mutans biofilm. On the polystyrene plates, they suppressed the biofilm formation, with MBIC(50) of 6.25-12.5 microM, and reduced the 1 day developed biofilm in a batch culture, with MBRC(50) of 25-50 microM. On the CBD pegs, the viabilities of the biofilm were suppressed by >95% in the presence of MUC7 peptides at 4x MIC (50 microM). One day developed biofilm viabilities were inhibited by 49-75%. On HA, the formation of biofilm (as observed by EM) was also considerably reduced. CONCLUSIONS: MUC7 peptides present somewhat preferential antimicrobial activity against S. mutans. They also have an effect on in vitro formation and reduction of the preformed S. mutans biofilm.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antibacterial activity of Arctium lappa as a phytotherapeutic agent used in intracanal dressings.
AB  - The discovery of natural biocomponents from plants with antibacterial activity on endodontic microbiota may lead to new therapies. This study evaluated the antibacterial activity of a phytotherapeutic agent prepared from an ethyl acetate fraction (AcOEt) extracted from Arctium lappa. This agent was compared with calcium hydroxide as an intracanal dressing. Twenty-seven maxillary canines were instrumented, sterilized and inoculated with a mixed bacterial suspension of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. The teeth were divided into three groups and their canals filled with: group 1, calcium hydroxide and propylene glycol; group 2, a paste containing AcOEt fraction of A. lappa and propylene glycol; group 3, propylene glycol (control). At 7, 14 and 30 days, three teeth from each group were opened and a paper point was placed in the root canal for 5 min. The paper points were transferred to Petri dishes with Brain Heart Infusion (BHI). The bacterial growth was classified. Mild bacterial growth was found in group 1 at all time intervals; in group 2 there was severe growth at 7 days, but no growth at 14 and 30 days. The phytotherapeutic agent extracted from an AcOEt fraction of A. lappa inhibited the growth of all the microorganisms in this study.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of monocaprin: a monoglyceride with potential use as a denture disinfectant.
AB  - Monocaprin is a 1-monoglyceride of capric acid that has antimicrobial activity against enveloped viruses, certain bacteria, and the yeast Candida albicans. Solutions containing monocaprin were formulated and tested in vitro against a number of micro-organisms, including species found in the oral cavity and common pathogenic species. The antimicrobial activity of monocaprin was tested with strains growing on a surface as well as in the planktonic phase. Micro-organisms tested were: Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Two sets of dilutions were prepared for each test strain; one to be inoculated with the micro-organism growing in the planktonic phase and the other with the same strain growing on a filter paper disk. Control solutions were also prepared to find out if any of the excipients were affecting the microbicidal effect of monocaprin. Test strains growing on the filter paper surface were less sensitive to monocaprin than the same strain growing in its planktonic phase. C. albicans was the micro-organism that was most sensitive to monocaprin, but S. mutans also showed appreciable sensitivity. The indication that monocaprin may have potential as a topical agent against Candida was tested in an open study of denture disinfection in 32 patients attending a geriatric daycare centre. A significant, but short-term, reduction in counts of Candida on the fitting surface of full dentures was observed.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - Coating of a surface with 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) co-polymer significantly reduces retention of human pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - The present study compares the retention of four species that are often isolated  in association with biomedical device-related infections - Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans - to three different surfaces. All four bacterial species were found to bind significantly less well to MPC-coated surfaces than to non-coated surfaces. We attribute this effect to the "superhydrophilicity" of MPC-coated surfaces, whereas hydrophobic surfaces are well known to reduce bacterial retention and thus to inhibit a crucial step in the formation of bacterial biofilms that lead to biomedical device-related infections and complications.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions from cranberry juice.
AB  - The effect of anthocyanin- and proanthocyanidin-rich fractions isolated from cranberry juice was studied for their antibacterial activity against nine bacterial strains. Activity was assessed by the agar diffusion assay. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 was the only strain to exhibit some susceptibility to four out of 10 anthocyanin-rich fractions tested. A variable susceptibility of S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541, and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341 to proanthocyanidin- rich fractions was also observed. Streptococcus mutans strains as well as Escherichia coli ATCC 10538 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were not susceptible to any of the cranberry juice samples or fractions at the tested concentrations. There was no clear correlation between Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacterial susceptibility to cranberry juice. In this work, the role of cranberry juice anthocyanic and proanthocyanic fractions upon bacterial viability is discussed.
TI  - Lactoferrin functions: current status and perspectives.
AB  - Lactoferrin, an iron-binding glycoprotein synthesized by neutrophils and exocrine glands, plays an important role in human innate defense mechanisms against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. First, a bacteriostatic activity of lactoferrin, depending on iron withholding to bacteria, and successively a bactericidal iron-independent effect, related to its binding on bacterial surfaces, was recognized. Many other functions have been ascribed to this cationic protein, including the inhibiting action toward bacterial adhesion and invasion of target host cells. Recent research also reported the lactoferrin influence on bacterial aggregation and biofilm development of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus mutans. The different lactoferrin functions can be justified by different physicochemical properties of the molecule, which include the iron-binding capability, the binding to anionic cell surfaces and molecules, and serine protease activity.
TI  - An in vitro study on antimicrobial activity of propolis from Mugla province of Turkey.
AB  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)  extracts of 45 different propolis samples from the Mugla province of Turkey were investigated. Antimicrobial activity of propolis varied depending on propolis sample, dosage of propolis, and the extraction solvents for all test microorganisms. Antimicrobial activity of all propolis samples increased with increasing dosage without reaching a plateau at the highest dosage tested. Except for Brucella melitensis, the DMSO extracts of all propolis samples were more active than the acetone extracts of the same samples. For B. melitensis, the acetone extracts of all propolis samples showed greater activity. The most sensitive microorganism to propolis was Shigella sonnei in the gram-negative group and Streptococcus mutans in the gram-positive group. The least sensitive microorganism was Candida albicans. A control test run with standard antibiotics revealed that propolis samples from the Mugla province of Turkey has a similar or greater inhibitory effect on S. mutans, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. sonnei, and C. albicans growth.
TI  - Preliminary evaluation of bioactive glass S53P4 as an endodontic medication in vitro.
AB  - Calcium hydroxide is the "gold standard" endodontic medication, but it may fail to eliminate certain facultative bacteria and yeasts found in root canal systems. In this study, standardized bovine dentin blocks infected with Enterococcus faecalis were treated with an aqueous calcium hydroxide or bioactive glass S53P4 (BAG) powder suspension. While calcium hydroxide was ineffective, the BAG suspension eliminated the infection in the sampled dentin layers after 5 days. In a direct exposure test, preincubation with human dentin boosted the BAG-killing efficacy against E. faecalis ATCC29212, Candida albicans CCUG19915, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027, Streptococcus sanguis ATCC10556, and S. mutans ATCC25175. BAG placed in the root canals of extracted teeth did not alter root-dentin pH. Consequently, the conditions under which the microbiota were killed were not pH-mediated. Further studies are ongoing to help clarify the antimicrobial BAG effect in the presence of dentin.
TI  - Lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the N1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the N1-domain. Based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the N1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. This novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. Furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis. Notably, lactoferrampin is located in the N1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.
TI  - Antibacterial characteristics of newly developed amphiphilic lipids and DNA-lipid complexes against bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of newly  developed amphiphilic lipids and DNA/lipid complexes against two types of oral bacteria and two types of hospital infection bacteria. Nine amphiphilic lipids were quantitatively prepared from the reaction of n-alkyl alcohol, alpha-amino acids, and p-toluenesulfonic acid. Nine DNA-lipid complexes were prepared by the simple mixing of DNA and amphiphilic lipids. The DNA-lipid complexes were insoluble in water. The antibacterial activity of lipids and DNA-lipid complexes against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were evaluated by the disk-diffusion method. Seven artificial lipids showed antibacterial behavior; in particular, the lipids prepared from n-decyl alcohol and glycine and from n-decyl alcohol and L-alanine showed antibacterial activity against the four bacterial strains used in this study. On the other hand, the lipids of glutamic acid derivatives did not show any antibacterial activity against the four bacteria strains except for the lipid with an n-octyl group. Five DNA-lipid complexes also had an antibacterial effect. The complex prepared from DNA and glycine decyl ester p-toluenesulfonic acid salt exhibited antibacterial activity against the four types of bacteria strains. In this study it was found that lipids and DNA-lipid complexes with a mono-decyl group or a mono-dodecyl group have more favorable antibacterial activity.
TI  - [Isolation, purification and antibacterial activities of salivary histidine-rich  polypeptides].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate and purify salivary histidine-rich-polypeptides (HRPs) and  observe their antibacterial activities. METHODS: By using of preparative acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AU-PAGE), three major HRPs(HRP-1, HRP-3 and HRP-5) were purified from parotid saliva collected from healthy adults. Their antibacterial activities were tested in the ultrasensitive antibacterial assay, named radial diffusion assay. RESULTS: Each fraction of the three purified HRPs appeared as a single protein zone both in AU-PAGE and Tricine-SDS-PAGE. Their molecular weights are 3-5 kD as determined by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. All the three major HRPs showed potent bactericidal effects on Streptococcus mutans MT6R and Staphylococcus aureas ATCC25923. As to Escherichia coli ML-35P and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853, HRP-3 and HRP-5 also demonstrated significant antibacterial activities, whereas HRP-1 did not show any inhibitory effects on the viability of them. CONCLUSION: The above results suggested that the method of preparative AU-PAGE we used in this study has the benefits of high resolution, simple manipulation and perfect results of purification. HRPs are important components to prevent oral tissue from bacterial infections, therefore play a potent role in the maintenance of the oral health.
TI  - CCL28 has dual roles in mucosal immunity as a chemokine with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.
AB  - CCL28 is a CC chemokine signaling via CCR10 and CCR3 that is selectively expressed in certain mucosal tissues such as exocrine glands, trachea, and colon. Notably, these tissues commonly secrete low-salt fluids. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that salivary glands expressed CCL28 mRNA at the highest levels among various mouse tissues. Single cells prepared from mouse parotid glands indeed contained a major fraction of CD3(-)B220(low) cells that expressed CCR10 at high levels and CCR3 at low levels and responded to CCL28 in chemotaxis assays. Morphologically, these cells are typical plasma cells. By immunohistochemistry, acinar epithelial cells in human and mouse salivary glands were strongly positive for CCL28. Furthermore, human saliva and milk were found to contain CCL28 at high concentrations. Moreover, the C terminus of human CCL28 has a significant sequence similarity to histatin-5, a histidine-rich candidacidal peptide in human saliva. Subsequently, we demonstrated that human and mouse CCL28 had a potent antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, Gram-negative bacteria, and Gram-positive bacteria. The C-terminal 28-aa peptide of human CCL28 also displayed a selective candidacidal activity. In contrast, CCL27, which is most similar to CCL28 and shares CCR10, showed no such potent antimicrobial activity. Like most other antimicrobial peptides, CCL28 exerted its antimicrobial activity in low-salt conditions and rapidly induced membrane permeability in target microbes. Collectively, CCL28 may play dual roles in mucosal immunity as a chemoattractant for cells expressing CCR10 and/or CCR3 such as plasma cells and also as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial protein secreted into low-salt body fluids.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to titanium-oxy-nitride (TiNOX) coatings with different resistivities: a novel approach for the development of biomaterials.
AB  - In this study the quantitative adhesion of a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to and the ease of removal from different TiNOX coatings was investigated by means of a parallel plate flow chamber and in situ image analysis. Quality of adhesion was determined by counting bacteria which remained attached to the surface after exposure to an air-liquid interface. S. epidermidis and S. mutans showed a bipolar adhesion pattern with highest numbers of adhesion at low and high resistivity with lowest adhesions at a resistivity of 10(4) microohms cm. P. aeruginosa was the least adherent organism. These results indicate that the affinity of these three strains under the current experimental conditions is minimal for TiNOX coatings with a specific resistivity. TiNOX coatings with pre-adsorbed fibrinogen showed different numbers of S. epidermidis adhered to the different coatings. However, the affinity of this strain for fibrinogen-coated TiNOX remains low when the resistivity is around 10(4) microohms cm. This indicates that the specific influence of the resistivities of the TiNOX coatings is transferred through the adsorbed fibrinogen film to the interface with adhering bacteria.
TI  - Mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  - This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in Spain. Six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. Results suggested that the determination of MIC values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. On the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. All tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and Triclosan.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--Endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% NaOCl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast Candida albicans. Activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. The base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of Muller Hinton Medium or 10.0 ml of Brain Heart Infusion agar in a Petri dish. After solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of Muller Hinton Medium or Brain Heart Infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. Absorbent paper disks (6.0 mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. Plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The candle jar system was used for the Brain Heart Infusion agar plates. All tests were performed in duplicate. After incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. Endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% NaOCl was effective only against S. aureus.
TI  - Ultraviolet disinfection with a novel microwave-powered device.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of a novel u.v. beaker, powered in a domestic microwave oven. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three beakers were compared, with most rapid killing obtained in the Neutra Plasma 50. Ultraviolet light generated within the beakers efficiently killed planktonic and surface-associated Streptococcus mutans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vegetative Bacillus stearothermophilus, herpes simplex and polio viruses. Candida albicans and Mycobacterium phleii were less rapidly killed, and only 70% inactivation of B. stearothermophilus endospores was achieved. Irradiation for 45 s reduced viable bacterial counts in saliva by > 99%. CONCLUSIONS: The u.v.-generating beakers efficiently reduced viable counts of bacteria, yeast and viruses. Kinetics of killing varied, reflecting the fact that lethal mechanisms are complex, and probably depend on interplay between u.v. and heat. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This novel method of generating u.v., using a cheap and widely available power source, provides a rapid, inexpensive and non-toxic method of disinfection with a wide range of applications in hospitals, clinics and the home.
TI  - Conserved DegP protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The DegP protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Brucella abortus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The function of DegP in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. Additionally, the DegP protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining the Escherichia coli periplasm and influences E. coli pilus biogenesis. We report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. Moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degP allele in S. pyogenes is similar to that reported for E. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. Virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional DegP protease is required for full virulence. These results suggest DegP as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.
TI  - Control of microorganisms in vitro by calcium hydroxide pastes.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the influence of vehicles on the antimicrobial efficiency of calcium hydroxide. METHODOLOGY: A total of 588 size 50 sterile absorbent paper points, were immersed in various microbial suspensions for 3 min. The points were then placed on Petri dishes and covered with intracanal dressings containing calcium hydroxide: Ca(OH)2 + saline; Ca(OH)2 + camphorated paramonochlorophenol; Ca(OH)2 + 1% chlorhexidine solution: Ca(OH)2 + 3% sodium lauryl sulphate; Ca(OH)2 + Otosporin. After 1 min, 48 and 72 h and 7 days, 147 absorbent paper cones were removed from contact with the intracanal dressings and individually transported and immersed in 5 mL of Letheen Broth, followed by incubation at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Microbial growth was evaluated by turbidity of the culture medium. A 0.1-mL inoculum obtained from the Letheen Broth was transferred to 5 mL of BHI, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Bacterial growth was again evaluated by turbidity of the culture medium. Positive BHI tubes were selected and inocula were spread on the surface of BHI agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Gram staining of the BHI growth and from colonies growing on BHI agar was carried out. RESULTS: An antimicrobial effect occurred after 48 h on the cultures of S. mutans, E. faecalis, S. aureus, P aeruginosa, B. subtilis, C. albicans and a mixed culture, irrespective of the intracanal dressing. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, the various vehicles associated with calcium hydroxide pastes did not influence the time required for microbial inactivation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Streblus asper leaf extract.
AB  - Bactericidal activity was found in the 50% ethanol (v/v) extract of Streblus asper leaves. The extract possessed a selective bactericidal activity towards Streptococcus, especially to Streptococcus mutans which has been shown to be strongly associated with dental caries. The extract had no effect on cultures of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus coagulase positive, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia pseudomeallei and Candida albicans. The minimum growth inhibitory concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration of S. asper extract against 10(8) CFU/mL of S. mutans was 2 mg/mL. The active compound is partially polar, partially heat labile, precipitated by 80% ammonium sulphate, and possesses a molecular weight larger than 10 000 Da. The potential for using S. asper extract as a natural product for controlling dental caries is discussed.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (AH Plus, Sealapex, Ketac Endo, and Fill Canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. Seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541. There was a wild strain of Streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. Activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with Brain Heart Infusion agar and Muller Hinton medium seeded by pour plate. Calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% TTC gel and inhibition haloes were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. However, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, Enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by AH Plus, Fill Canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. We conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% TTC gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides in human parotid saliva].
AB  - Two ultrasensitive antibacterial assays were applied to determine the antibacterial activity of histidine-rich polypeptides (HRPs) in human parotid saliva. The results not only confirmed the potent antibacterial activity of HRPs against Streptococcus mutans MT6R, but also showed for the first time that HRPs were effectively antibacterial to Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ML-35p and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Among HRPs, HRP3, HRP5 and HRP6 were the major antibacterial components which were active against S. mutans, S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, whereas HRP1 was only effective against E. coli. S. sanguis was resistant to the action of HRPs. These results suggest that HRPs are actually a family of endogenous antibiotic peptides with broad antimicrobial spectrum including fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and may play an important role in the prevention of various infection diseases in the oral cavity as well as in the resistance to caries.
TI  - An evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: Facultative aerobes-anaerobes: Candida albicans ATCC 10231; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212; Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27,853; Streptococcus mitis ATCC 9811; Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668; Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419; and Streptococcus sanguis ATCC 10556. Microaerophiles: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522. Obligate anaerobes: Actinomyces odontolyticus ATCC 17929; Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25,586; Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277; and Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845. Each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. Results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.
TI  - Enzymatic removal and disinfection of bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Model biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas  fluorescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were made on steel and polypropylene substrata. Plaque-resembling biofilms of Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were made on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. The activity of enzymes against bacterial cells in biofilm was measured by fluorescence microscopy and an indirect conductance test in which evolution of carbon dioxide was measured. Glucose oxidase combined with lactoperoxidase was bactericidal against biofilm bacteria but did not remove the biofilm from the substrata. A complex mixture of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes was able to remove bacterial biofilm from steel and polypropylene substrata but did not have a significant bactericidal activity. Combining oxidoreductases with polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes resulted in bactericidal activity as well as removal of the biofilm.
TI  - Studies on the antimicrobial activity of juglans regia.
AB  - Juglans regia L. bark is used in some countries as a toothbrush and as a dye for  coloring the lips for cosmetic purposes. Its extract showed a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity in a dose dependent manner. It inhibited the growth of several species of pathogenic micro-organisms representing Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans), Gram-negative bacteria (Esherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a pathogenic yeast (Candida albicans). The extract has either synergistic or additive action when tested with a wide range of antibacterial drugs. It also increased the pH of saliva. Thus, brushing the teeth with this bark may improve oral hygiene, prevent plaque and caries formation, and reduce the incidence of gingival and periodontal infections.
TI  - Characterization of IS199 from Streptococcus mutans V403.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the insertion sequence IS199 has been determined. This novel element was found in Streptococcus mutans V403 where DNA hybridization studies suggested that it was present in multiple copies on the genome. IS199 is 1220 bp and appears unique to the mutans streptococci. A limited epidemiological survey revealed this element to occur infrequently in this group (4/50 strains examined). IS199 belongs to the IS3 family of procaryotic insertion sequence elements. It contained tandem open reading frames (ORFs) reminiscent of the structure of the IS3 class. Additionally, the larger of the two ORF products (ORFB) exhibited amino acid sequence similarities to comparable proteins from IS3 and other elements of this family. Transposition of IS199 gave rise to a 3-bp target site duplication. We were able to insert an antibiotic resistance gene into IS199 enabling us to follow the transposition of this element in S. mutans V403.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - Determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium. The size determinations of OG1X, a strain of E. faecalis widely used in many laboratories for genetic studies, using Sma I, Not I, and Sfi I alone or in combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. Using the same enzymes as with OG1X, the size of HH-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of E. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of JH2-2, an E. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. The size range generated for GE-1, a plasmid-free E. faecium strain, with the use of Sma I, Not I, and Apa I was 2,045-2,155 kb. Although OG1X differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. However, for both E. faecalis OG1X and E. faecium GE-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other two enzymes. The discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two enzymes are used to size a genome. The size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. The molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for Campylobacter, smaller than that of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (OG1X) or smaller (JH2-2, HH67, and GE-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system.
AB  - Chlorhexidine is widely used as a mouth rinse in the prevention and treatment of  periodontal diseases and dental caries. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine in a controlled release delivery system. The controlled release dispenser comprised a polymeric inner core matrix containing the medicament with an outer vinyl membrane controlling the drug release. The effect on the following bacteria was studied: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mutans, Wolinella recta, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Eikenella corrodens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. Chlorhexidine-containing vinyl patches with a diameter of 5.5 mm were placed on blood agar plates containing the various bacteria. The plates were incubated aerobically or anaerobically at 37 degrees C for 24 h or longer, when appropriate, and examined for inhibition of bacterial growth. Distinct zones of inhibition were seen surrounding all vinyl patches on all plates with all bacteria. Thus, the vinyl dispenser appeared to be an effective vehicle for releasing chlorhexidine to a localized area such as the surface of a tooth, a periodontal pocket, or a root canal.
TI  - An in vitro study of the antibacterial and antifungal properties of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with disinfectant.
AB  - The difficulties associated with the disinfection of alginate (irreversible hydrocolloid) materials have resulted in the development of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with an antimicrobial compound, didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride. This investigation assessed the antibacterial and antifungal properties in vitro of this innovative irreversible hydrocolloid material by using the agar well technique. The microorganisms used were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus odontolyticus rodriguez, Actinomyces odontolyticus, mixed salivary organisms, and Candida albicans. The results showed an absence of activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Varying degrees of antibacterial activity were exhibited against the other microorganisms. It is concluded that it is not know whether the limited antibacterial and antifungal effect demonstrated in this study is sufficient to prevent bacterial and fungal colonization of the impression surface in the mouth during clinical practice.
TI  - T-cell modulation of the antibody response to bacterial polysaccharide antigens.
AB  - Pretreatment of mice with subimmunogenic doses of meningococcal polysaccharide (MP), Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (PA), or Streptococcus mutans polysaccharide (SM) resulted in suppression of antibody response. The transfer of putative suppressor T cells (Ts cells) from donor mice primed with a subimmunogenic dose of MP to naive recipients at the time of immunization with MP substantially reduced the magnitude of the antibody response. Also, the infusion of B cells taken from animals immunized with either MP or PA suppressed the antibody response of naive recipients to MP or PA, respectively, relative to controls, suggesting that Ts cells respond to determinants on immune B cells. We observed that the injection of concanavalin A or phytohemagglutinin (two lectins known to augment the activity of amplifier T cells [Ta cells]) 2 days postimmunization enhanced the antibody response to MP and SM. In addition, Ta-cell activity was transferred to naive animals by using spleen cells. Although the administration of phytohemagglutinin at the time of immunization with MP also resulted in increased antibody response, the injection of concanavalin A simultaneous with immunization resulted in a suppression of the antibody response to MP. Although Ts cells generated in response to pneumococcal polysaccharide type III were found to respond to monoclonal antibody Ly-m22, Ta cells responded to monoclonal antibodies L3T4 and Ia but not to Ly-m22. These studies suggest that Ta and Ts cells can modulate the antibody response to MP, SM, and PA in a positive and negative manner, respectively.
TI  - Bactericidal action of carbon dioxide laser radiation in experimental dental root canals.
AB  - The ability of a carbon dioxide laser to sterilize the root canal of human teeth  has been investigated. Three oral bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, and Actinomyces viscosus, and three other bacteria, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as experimental organisms. Exposure of cells on glass slides to laser radiation showed there was little difference in the exposure required to kill these six organisms. Complete recovery of bacteria from the root canal was initially a problem and was only achieved when bacterial manipulations and removal were carried out in rapid succession, within 5 min of inoculation. However, the geometry of the instrumented canal and the laser alignment were major factors in achieving consistent cell death of oral bacteria in the root canals. Using sets of 10 teeth, four repeated exposures of 10 W for 1 s was found to sterilize 4 or more of the teeth.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. This investigation assessed the effect of light-activated Hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans. Photoactivation of Hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. Combinations of light-activated Hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular S. aureus. The ability of Hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of abscesses.

TI  - Bactericidal activity of human lactoferrin: sensitivity of a variety of microorganisms.
AB  - Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein that has been detected in secretions that  bathe human mucosal tissues. Previous studies have shown that, when this protein is in the iron-free state, it is capable of a direct bactericidal effect on Streptococcus mutans and Vibrio cholerae. The present study demonstrates variable susceptibilities for a variety of different microorganisms. The list of susceptible organisms includes gram-positive and gram-negative microbes, rods and cocci, facultative anaerobes, and aerotolerant anaerobes. Similar morphological and physiological types are represented among the lalctoferrin-resistant bacteria. S. mutans was more resistant to lactoferrin when grown on a sucrose-contaning medium than when it was grown on brain heart infusion broth without added scurose. When a lactoferrin-sensitive, avirulent strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae was passed through mice, the resultant virulent culture became lactoferrin resistant. Since organisms of the same species and even of the same strain (S. pneumoniae) can differ in susceptibility to lactoferrin, it appears that accessibility to the lactoferrin target site may account for differences in susceptibility. It appears that there may be a relation between virulence and resistance to lactoferrin.

TI  - Production and properties of an extracellular bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans bacteriocidal for group A and other streptococci.
AB  - An extracellular bacteriocidal substance is produced by a serotype c strain of Streptococcus mutans in liquid meduim during the stationary phase of growth. The lethal effect of the substance was demonstrated by the decrease in viable counts of a standardized suspension of group A streptococci in broth. No lysis of affected cells was observed and no changes in appearance of these cells was seen in electron micrographs. The material was effective against certain strains of immmunological groups A, C, D, G, H, L, and O streptococci. It was inactive against strains of S. mutans belonging to the a, b, c, and d serotypes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. The factor was purified 273-fold from the culture fluid by column chromatography. It was sensitive to trysin and Pronase and resistant to catalase. It possessed a molecular weight of more than 20,000 and was not dialyzable. The properties of this substance indicate that it is a bacteriocin. Group A streptococci, which had been treated with antiserum specific for the cell wall group and type antigens, were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcal strains resistant to the lethal action of the bacteriocin adsorbed the bacteriocin from the solutions, as did the sensitive cells. The bacteriocin was not adsorbed at 0 C.
