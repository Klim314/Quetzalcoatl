TI  == impact of gram-negative bacteria in interaction with a complex microbial consortium on biogenic amine content and sensory characteristics of an uncooked pressed cheese.
AB  == the impact of gram-negative bacteria on sensory characteristics and production of volatile compounds as well as biogenic amines (ba) in the core of an uncooked pressed type model cheese was investigated in the presence of a defined complex microbial consortium. eleven strains of gram-negative bacteria, selected on the basis of their biodiversity and in vitro ba-production ability, were individually tested in a model cheese. four out of 6 strains of enterobacteriaceae (citrobacter freundii ucma 4217, klebsiella oxytoca 927, hafnia alvei b16 and proteus vulgaris ucma 3780) reached counts close to 6 log cfu g(-)(1) in the model cheese. in core of cheeses inoculated with gram-negative bacteria, only slight differences were observed for microbial counts (enterococcus faecalis or lactobacillus plantarum count differences below 1 log cfu g(-)(1)), acetate concentration (differences below 200 mg kg(-)(1)) and texture (greater firmness)  in comparison to control cheeses. cheese core colour, odour and volatile compound composition were not modified. although ornithine, the precursor of putrescine, was present in all cheeses, putrescine was only detected in cheeses inoculated with h. alvei b16 and never exceeded 2.18 mmol kg(-)(1) cheese dry matter. cadaverine was only detected in cheeses inoculated with h. alvei b16, k. oxytoca  927, halomonas venusta 4c1a or morganella morganii 3a2a but at lower concentrations (<1.05 mmol kg(-)(1) cheese dry matter), although lysine was available. only insignificant amounts of the detrimental ba histamine and tyramine, as well as isopentylamine, tryptamine or phenylethylamine, were produced in the cheese model by any of the gram-negative strains, including those which produced these ba at high levels in vitro.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes from a greek vineyard.
AB  == grape bacterial microbiota plays central roles in the quality of grapes and wine, yet its diversity remains poorly described. in the present study, bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes of two cultivars originating from the same vineyard were assessed. isolates were identified by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and sequence analysis of partial 16s rrna gene. comparable counts were recorded between botrytis-infected  and sound grape samples. in all cases, the majority of isolates belonged to different species of enterobacteriaceae. the dominant species in the vineyard was klebsiella oxytoca that was found in different combinations with citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., erwinia sp., pantoea dispersa, tatumella ptyseos or  other species. in fermenting musts, those populations declined while other species evolved, like lactobacillus plantarum and enterobacter ludwigii. populations in botrytised samples persisted longer during spontaneous fermentations. present study suggests that bacterial diversity on grapes may be wider than previously described.

TI  == identification of a non-haem catalase in salmonella and its regulation by rpos (sigmas).
AB  == we report the identification and functional analysis of katn, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. katn, which is not present in escherichia coli, is located between the ycigfe and ycid e. coli homologues in the salmonella genome. its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 da and is similar to the mn-catalases of lactobacillus plantarum and thermus spp. its product, katn, was visualized as a 37 kda protein  in e. coli maxicells. a katn recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its c-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed  on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. katn was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. its expression was shown to be  regulated by growth phase and rpos. northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream ycigfe genes. a putative rpos-regulated promoter was identified upstream of ycig. southern blotting revealed that katn is conserved within salmonella serovars. katn homologues were found in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. a katn mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) response of salmonella. however, the expression of katn increased the h2o2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpos mutants in stationary phase. thus, katn may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in salmonella in certain environmental conditions.
