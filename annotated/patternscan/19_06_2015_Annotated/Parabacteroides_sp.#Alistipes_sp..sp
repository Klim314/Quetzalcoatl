TI  == genome sequence determination and metagenomic characterization of a dehalococcoides mixed culture grown on cis-1,2-dichloroethene.
AB  == a dehalococcoides-containing bacterial consortium that performed dechlorination of 0.20 mm cis-1,2-dichloroethene to ethene in 14 days was obtained from the sediment mud of the lotus field. to obtain detailed information of the consortium, the metagenome was analyzed using the short-read next-generation sequencer solid 3. matching the obtained sequence tags with the reference genome  sequences indicated that the dehalococcoides sp. in the consortium was highly homologous to dehalococcoides mccartyi cbdb1 and bav1. sequence comparison with the reference sequence constructed from 16s rrna gene sequences in a public database showed the presence of sedimentibacter, sulfurospirillum, clostridium, desulfovibrio, parabacteroides, alistipes, eubacterium, peptostreptococcus and proteocatella in addition to dehalococcoides sp. after further enrichment, the members of the consortium were narrowed down to almost three species. finally, the full-length circular genome sequence of the dehalococcoides sp. in the consortium, d. mccartyi ibaraki, was determined by analyzing the metagenome with  the single-molecule dna sequencer pacbio rs. the accuracy of the sequence was confirmed by matching it to the tag sequences obtained by solid 3. the genome is  1,451,062 nt and the number of cds is 1566, which includes 3 rrna genes and 47 trna genes. there exist twenty-eight rdase genes that are accompanied by the genes for anchor proteins. the genome exhibits significant sequence identity with other dehalococcoides spp. throughout the genome, but there exists significant difference in the distribution rdase genes. the combination of a short-read next-generation dna sequencer and a long-read single-molecule dna sequencer gives detailed information of a bacterial consortium.

TI  == performance evaluation and bacteria analysis of afb-mfc enriched with high-strength synthetic wastewater.
AB  == in order to study the performance and bacterial communities of an anaerobic fluidized bed microbial fuel cell (afb-mfc) system, the 16s rdna gene sequencing  was applied, and high-strength synthetic wastewater was treated by the afb-mfc system. the high-strength synthetic wastewater, in which the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (cod), nitrite nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen were above 19,000, 2,516-3,871 and 927-1,427 mg/l, was treated by the afb-mfc system. the removal efficiency of cod, nitrite nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen reached 70-89,  98 and 98%, while the maximum voltage was 394 mv. the bacteria analysis revealed  the presence of alistipes putredinis, carnobacterium sp., victivallis vadensis, klebsiella pneumoniae, thauera sp., parabacteroides merdae, parvimonas micra, parabacteroides sp., and desulfomicrobium baculatum in the anode chamber. in addition, the klebsiella pneumoniae was observed to have the capability of organic degradation and electricity generation, while the thauera sp. has the capability of denitrification.
