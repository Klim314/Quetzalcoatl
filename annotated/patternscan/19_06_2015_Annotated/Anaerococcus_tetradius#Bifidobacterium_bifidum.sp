TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

TI  == urease-producing species of intestinal anaerobes and their activities.
AB  == urease activities of anaerobic bacteria that constituted predominant gut flora were examined. it was demonstrated that some strains of eubacterium aerofaciens,  e. lentum, and peptostreptococcus products produced urease. they were the most numerous species in human feces. all strains of bifidobacterium infantis and some strains of bacteroides multiacidus, b. bifidum, clostridium symbiosum, fusobacterium necrophorum, f. varium, lactobacillus fermentum, peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and p. prevotii produced urease. the optimum ph of the lactobacillus urease was found to be 4.0, whereas the ph value of b. multiacidus  urease was 8.0.

TI  == fermentation of mucins and plant polysaccharides by anaerobic bacteria from the human colon.
AB  == a total of 154 strains from 22 species of bifidobacterium, peptostreptococcus, lactobacillus, ruminococcus, coprococcus, eubacterium, and fusobacterium, which are present in high concentrations in the human colon, were surveyed for their ability to ferment 21 different complex carbohydrates. plant polysaccharides, including amylose, amylopectin, pectin, polygalacturonate, xylan, laminarin, guar gum, locust bean gum, gum ghatti, gum arabic, and gum tragacanth, were fermented  by some strains from bifidobacterium, peptostreptococcus, ruminococcus, and eubacterium species. porcine gastric mucin, which was fermented by some strains of ruminococcus torques and bifidobacterium bifidum, was the only mucin utilized  by any of the strains tested.
