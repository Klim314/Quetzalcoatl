TI  == utility of reflexive semen cultures for detecting bacterial infections in patients with infertility and leukocytospermia.
AB  == this study evaluated the benefit of reflexive semen cultures in peroxidase-positive samples drawn from 17,142 consecutive samples analyzed, in which 4.7% (807/17,142) had leukocytospermia and 12.7% of those (103/807) grew significant bacterial colonies on culture. considering the potential ramifications of the use of samples with bacteriospermia, we conclude that reflexive culture results are cost-effective and prudent.

TI  == bacterial flora of the low male genital tract in patients consulting for infertility.
AB  == the physiological aerobic bacterial flora of the low male genital tract was determined. this prospective study was performed on 600 semen specimens collected from 543 asymptomatic males consulting for infertility. semen cultures were sterile in 28.8%, with a polymicrobial flora and/or absence or low titres of ureaplasma urealyticum in 49.3%, and with one or two aerobic and facultative bacteria > or =1 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1) and/or u. urealyticum with titres > or =10(4) ccu ml(-1) (colour changing units) in 21.8%. in standard aerobic cultures, gardnerella vaginalis was the most commonly isolated species (26.1%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%) and streptococcus anginosus (14.2%). ureaplasma urealyticum was absent in 84.5% of semen samples, but when recovered,  high (> or =10(4) ccu ml(-1)) and low titres (< or =10(3) ccu ml(-1)) were counted in 7.2% and 8.3% respectively. of 48 patients, the follow-up of semen cultures showed marked variations in time. this study shows that (i) there was no relationship between the bacterial flora and the leucocytospermia; (ii) low titres of u. urealyticum in semen were not associated with a disturbance of the ecosystem; (iii) the critical threshold for u. urealyticum should be raised to >  or =10(4) cfu ml(-1) and (iv) a positive semen culture should be repeated before  any treatment.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dequalinium chloride against leading germs of vaginal infections.
AB  == dequalinium chloride (cas 522-51-0) and povidone iodine (cas 25655-41-8) are known as antiseptic agents and used in the local treatment of vaginal infections. clotrimazole (cas 23593-75-1) is an anti-fungal drug and applied primarily in the therapy of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis and to a lesser extent in bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis. however, antimicrobial activities of those three agents in comparison to each other have not been reported so far. to address this issue the antimicrobial activities of these agents against 18 germs relevant to vaginal infections were determined. the tested species are representatives of the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus, enterococcus, listeria, escherichia, proteus, gardnerella, bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, candida, and trichomonas. all micro-organisms were susceptible to dequalinium chloride with the exception of proteus mirabilis. at a given dose, the activity of dequalinium  chloride was higher as compared to the other substances. in view of its wide antimicrobial spectrum dequalinium chloride is an efficient alternative in the local therapy of vaginal infections such as fluor vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis, vulvo-vaginal candidiasis and trichomoniasis.

TI  == susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  == fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. two hundred thirty-one  patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90%  of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of enterococcus faecalis were  4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates  of escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of proteus mirabilis 0.25  and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. in summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety  of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.

TI  == interstitial cystitis and the urethral syndrome: a possible answer.
AB  == a study was made of 20 patients fulfilling the criteria customarily used for the  diagnosis of interstitial cystitis. a possible infective aetiology was sought by  culture of bladder tissue, catheter and midstream specimens of urine, and urethral swabs by methods capable of detecting fastidious bacteria as well as aerobic pathogens. all bladder biopsies showed the histological appearances usually associated with interstitial cystitis, and bacteria were isolated from the catheter specimens and/or bladder biopsies of 12 patients. eight of these isolates were fastidious bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis (6) and lactobacillus sp. (2). fastidious bacteria were isolated from the midstream specimen of urine (msu) and/or urethral swab of 6 other patients. the correlation of the histological and bacteriological findings supports the hypothesis of an infective aetiology and suggests that the so-called urethral syndrome and interstitial cystitis may be the earlier and later stages of the same disease process. the importance of early diagnosis of infection in these patients is emphasised.
