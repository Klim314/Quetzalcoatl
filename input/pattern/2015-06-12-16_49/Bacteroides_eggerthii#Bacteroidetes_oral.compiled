TI  - High prevalence of cfxA beta-lactamase in aminopenicillin-resistant Prevotella strains isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  - This prospective study was designed to investigate amoxicillin-resistant oral anaerobes, and to identify their beta-lactamase-encoding genes. Three subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 12 patients suffering from periodontitis. One to seven beta-lactamase-producing strains were obtained from each patient, mostly belonging to the Prevotella genus (Bacteroides eggerthii, 2/35 strains; Prevotella sp., 33/35 strains). PCR assays were used to detect cfxA and cepA/cblA, the genes encoding class A/group2e beta-lactamases previously described in the Bacteroides fragilis group. The present investigation confirmed the role of Prevotella species as beta-lactamase producers in periodontal pockets. Additionally, this PCR screening showed (1): the high prevalence of CfxA beta-lactamase production by aminopenicillin-resistant Prevotella (32/33: 97.0% positive strains) vs. cepA/cblA (1/33: 3.0% positive strains), and (2) the presence of cfxA in the periodontal reservoir in the absence of antimicrobial therapy during the previous 6 months.
TI  - Genetic transformation of Porphyromonas gingivalis by electroporation.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis was transformed by electroporation using the DNA of plasmid pE5-2, or its derivative, pYT7. Prior to transformation, pE5-2 was transferred from Escherichia coli to P. gingivalis strains by conjugation (mobilization with R751), and the plasmid DNA was purified from the P. gingivalis transconjugants. Transformation occurred when the recipient strain and the donor strain from which the plasmid DNA was purified were homologous. If they were heterologous, transformation did not take place or did so at a very low frequency. This suggested that a restriction-modification system is present in P. gingivalis strains. Plasmid pYT7 was derived by removing an 8.0 kb AvaI fragment from pE5-2 that was purified from P. gingivalis cells. It has several single-cutting restriction sites such as EcoRI, AvaI and ClaI usable for gene cloning, though it was not stable enough in P. gingivalis cells, probably because the rep gene was derived from a relatively distant species, Bacteroides eggerthii.
TI  - Prevotella, a new genus to include Bacteroides melaninogenicus and related species formerly classified in the genus Bacteroides.
AB  - It was recently proposed that the genus Bacteroides should be restricted to Bacteroides fragilis (the type species) and closely related organisms (viz., B. caccae, B. distasonis, B. eggerthii, B. merdae, B. ovatus, B. stercoris, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, and B. vulgatus). By contrast, the moderately saccharolytic, predominantly oral Bacteroides species, which include B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, and related species, form a phenotypically and phylogenetically coherent group of species which differ so significantly from the emended description of the genus Bacteroides that they should not be classified in the same genus. Therefore, we formally propose that these species be reclassified in a new genus, Prevotella. The type species is Prevotella melaninogenica.
TI  - Chromosomal DNA probes for the identification of Bacteroides species.
AB  - We compared 22 Bacteroides species by DNA-DNA homology studies using the S1 endonuclease method. None of the currently defined species shared more than 30% DNA homology with any other species examined with the exception of B. buccae and B. capillus (which along with B. pentosaceus are now considered a single species), which shared 86% of their DNA sequences. Two clusters showed weak genetic relationships, with DNA homology greater than 10%. The first cluster included B. coporis, B. disiens, B. bivius, B. intermedius and B. melaninogenicus. The second cluster included B. fragilis, B. eggerthii, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron and B. uniformis. Five of the oral species, B. asaccharolyticus, B. gingivalis, B. loescheii, B. intermedius and B. melanogenicus, were chosen for study as whole chromosomal probes in dot blot assays. These were tested against 243 clinical strains biochemically identified as Bacteroides species. The DNA probes correctly identified 94% of the clinical strains. DNA probe and biochemical identification was 100% for two of the five species. In contrast, only 86% of the strains biochemically identified as B. intermedius were identified by the DNA probe. The DNA probes gave a species identification to seven strains which could not be biochemically identified.
